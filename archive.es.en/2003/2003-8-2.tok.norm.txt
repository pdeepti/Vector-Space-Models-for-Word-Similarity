" we could actually see the stage , the lighting and at the end a few pyrotechnics and fireworks , so not only did we hear a muffled version of angels we could also see the lights we should have seen up close . "

for the first time in my life , i 'm speechless " robbie williams police are reviewing their handling of the traffic for the weekend concerts .
" certainly there is a plan that is being reviewed and revised in co-operation with the traffic management consultants , " a hertfordshire police spokesman said .
the spokesman said the " sheer volume of traffic " descending on the venue caused the chaos .
at the start of the concert , the singer descended on to the stage from the ceiling , suspended by wires .
" good evening everybody , my name is robbie williams , " he said before launching into a pounding rendition of let me entertain you .
looking at the huge sea of faces , an emotional williams told them : " for the first time in my life , i 'm speechless .
" i really hope i can do a show that will make you proud .
" i 've never seen anything like this in my life , ever . "
tickets were snapped up in seven hours for the initial two dates , beating the record set by oasis in 1996 who sold out two shows in nine hours .
the knebworth gigs feature support acts including mercury-nominated the darkness , moby , ash and kelly osborne .
the concerts are part of the star 's summer european tour which culminates in dublin 's phoenix park on 9 august .
williams will go back on the road again in october and november for more european dates including portugal , iceland , italy and the czech republic .

according to the daily telegraph , officials were preparing to incinerate a " media plan " about the government weapons expert when they were stopped by security guards .
it is alleged that three days after dr kelly was found dead , the document was placed in a sack of material due to be burnt .
the guards became aware of this and alerted the police .
on saturday , mod sources conceded to the bbc there had been a " security breach " on 20 july when a bag of confidential material due for incineration was left out overnight .
however the sources said they were not aware that any of the material in the bag , which was taken away by thames valley police , related to dr kelly .
blair evidence the bbc 's political correspondent norman smith said it seemed unavoidable that lord hutton , who is carrying out an inquiry into dr kelly 's death , would want to know if the police still have the bag and if so whether it does contain any relevant material .
blair to face hutton inquiry analysis : hutton 's forensic clarity he said the allegation raises the spectre of a potential cover-up by government officials whose evidence is likely to form a key part of the inquiry .
lord hutton opened the inquiry on friday , setting out its parameters and indicating that he would call the prime minister , defence secretary geoff hoon and bbc journalist andrew gilligan to give evidence .
other witnesses would include dr kelly 's widow , janice , mod officials , the bbc chairman gavyn davies and the chair of the foreign affairs select committee , donald anderson .

on friday at the church 's general convention in minneapolis , those for and against the election of gene robinson engaged in an intense and passionate debate over whether the episcopal church should have an openly gay and non-celibate bishop .
we 're heading for civil war convention delegate the anglican church has always been so broad and tolerant that it even allows room for clergy who do not believe in god .
but the issue of homosexuality is causing a serious rift .
the debate is so fervent that one despairing convention delegate said : " we 're heading for civil war " .
in the spotlight is gay priest mr robinson , the divorced father of two who was elected bishop of new hampshire in june .
according to the reverend hays junkin who headed the election committee , " it was open , it was fair , it was transparent and it was - we believe , spirit-led " .
strong opposition but it caused a storm of protest worldwide , with conservatives here and abroad calling for a walkout if it is approved .
a statement signed by archbishops from australia to nigeria and the west indies has predicted a " dramatic re-alignment " of the church .
so why is mr robinson at the centre of such a storm ?
he is the face of a debate that cuts deep into the theological cultural and political heart of the church .
clergy and lay people will vote on robinson 's appointment for progressives , it is an issue of justice , for conservatives it is one of morality and of upholding " scripture , tradition and reason " .
speakers at the opening debate in minneapolis were equally passionate on both sides , and often , given that it was about sex , it was personal .
in front of a packed ballroom , mr robinson answered a question about why god made human beings sexual , by describing his sexual relationship with mark andrews his partner of 14 years as " sacramental " and a reflection of god 's love .
those who support mr robinson argue that he is being penalised for being honest about his sexuality .
homosexuality ' sinful ' others called on the church to trust the people of new hampshire , and the bishop of arkansas , larry maze , said anglicans have " a calling to be a different voice in the bible belt , that voice is tolerant " .
but conservatives stressed the importance of chastity outside marriage , and repeatedly appealed to the bible to uphold their view that homosexuality is sinful .
the former bishop of pittsburgh , alden hathaway , said that supporters of mr robinson are " trying to promote an idea that homosexuality has the same bonds as marriage , but it 's apples and oranges , it 's not the same thing , it 's a deviation from god " .
so if the governing body votes on sunday and monday to confirm mr robinson as a bishop , will it split the church ?
conservatives say it will , and that it will separate anglicans further from their brothers and sisters in other churches .
progressives , many of whom also want to create a rite for same-sex blessings , say that we have heard such threats before , notably over the ordination of women into the episcopal church - a split did not happen , and there are now women bishops .

organisers trident ploughshares said a large number of people had decided to come because it was their first chance to protest since the war in iraq .
many of the protesters have come from europe to demonstrate against what they describe as " britain 's weapons of mass destruction " .
the organisers said they were planning actions designed to disrupt the work of the naval bases at coulport and faslane , home of the uk 's nuclear submarine fleet .
two-week camp this is the fifth year there has been a two-week long camp in the area .
last year 55 people were arrested when activists managed to daub paint on a trident submarine and blockaded the gates of both bases .

the venture in caia park , wrexham , was set up by county councillor malcolm king in the late 1970s , offering a haven for five to 16-year-olds .
the scheme 's primary purpose has always been providing the youngsters with somewhere to play .
however , the venture has other benefits for the local community .
initially , an adventure playground , in recent years homework clubs have been introduced to give pupils somewhere peaceful to study .
" we have a birthday party every year and about 300 kids come down who use the venture , " said mr king .
organisers of the party are expecting an extra 1,000 people at saturday 's event and they have sent invites to all ex-users .
youngsters activities have been organised and competitions will continue throughout the day .
caia park used to have one of the highest crime rates in north wales .
however , a recent report suggested that juvenile crime fell by 56 % in the first five years that the centre opened .
caia park hit the headlines in june following two nights of violence which police said were partly racially motivated .
a number of iraqi kurd refugees had been living on the estate and a fight broke out between them and other residents .
mr king said the youngsters who use the venture are a credit to local people , establishing links with people from all ethnic backgrounds .
