german chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday took part in a parliamentary mediation committee meeting in an attempt to keep his economic and welfare reforms on track with a bold new proposal on financing tax cuts . schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens passed labor market reforms and tax cuts in october in the lower house , but the upper house – which represents germany ’ s 16 federal states and is controlled by the conservatives and free-market liberals – rejected them last month .
that ’ s set the stage for a high-stakes legislative poker match that will determine the fate of the biggest reform process in germany in recent history . the mediation committee is charged with hammering out a deal between the lower house , the bundestag , and the upper house , the bundesrat .
schröder , joined by greens leader foreign minister joschka fischer , is hoping to garner the support of the conservatives by offering to finance the € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- tax cuts with less borrowing and a larger share from privatization funds . " the new proposal calls for three-fourths of the costs of the to the federal government being financed without new borrowing , " a government source told the reuters news agency .
" it is conceivable that this could be done with higher privatization revenues . " schröder ’ s decision to personally attend the meeting highlights how important he considers pushing through the reforms before the christmas break .
he has tied his political fate to the so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package of sweeping reforms designed to spark growth and trim the country ’ s bloated welfare state . schröder eager for deal “ i ’ m – as you know – willing to compromise and i expect that from the other side too , ” schröder told journalists on sunday . the two leaders of the conservative opposition , angela merkel from the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and edmund stoiber from the cdu ’ s bavaria sister party the csu , both also attended the meeting sunday .
however , ahead of the meeting it wasn ’ t clear if what schröder was bringing to the negotiating table wouldn ’ t be enough to get the conservatives on board .

u.s. officials confirmed on sunday they had captured former iraqi dictator saddam hussein near his hometown of tikrit .
sporadic celebratory gunfire was heard across the country as the news filtered out . on the run from u.s.-led coalition forces since the fall of baghdad in april , hussein has been washington ’ s most-wanted member of the iraqi regime .
his arrest will likely be a huge boost to the american occupation , which has had difficulty stabilizing postwar iraq . “ ladies and gentlemen , we got him , ” paul bremer , the u.s. civilian administrator in iraq , told a televised press conference in baghdad . u.s. lt.-gen.
ricardo sanchez said u.s. special forces raided a farm house near tikrit late on saturday .
he said hussein was captured without resistance after being found in a small underground hideout .
sanchez then also showed a video of a bearded and haggard-looking hussein being given a medical exam . " there were no injuries .
not a single shot was fired , " sanchez , the top u.s. general in iraq , told the press conference .
he said he had no idea how long he had been hiding there or whether he had been coordinating opposition to the u.s. occupation from that location . that the 66-year-old former leader had been able to elude u.s. forces for so long has been a major distraction for washington .
hussein is suspected of encouraging resistance to the coalition occupation and supporting attacks against american and allied troops . along with a few small arms , sanchez said hussein had around $ 750,000 -lrb- € 611,347 -rrb- in cash with him in the six by eight foot hole .
he did not say whether anyone had tipped off u.s. forces as to hussein 's location or if anyone would qualify for the $ 25 million bounty washington had placed on his head . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul bremer " this is a great day in iraq 's history .
the tyrant is a prisoner , " said bremer .
" now is the time for all iraqis - arabs and kurds , sunnis , shia , christian and turkmen - to build a prosperous , democratic iraq , at peace with itself and with its neighbors . " european leaders welcome capture british prime minster tony blair was the first western leader to confirm hussein had been taken alive .
" this has lifted a shadow from the people of iraq .
saddam will not be returning , " blair said . blair has been the staunchest ally of u.s. president george bush throughout the conflict with iraq , but the leaders of france and germany , both high-profile opponents of the war , also congratulated washington on sunday . “ i was extremely pleased to hear of the capture of saddam hussein and i offer my congratulations on this successful operation , ” german chancellor gerhard schröder said in an official letter to bush .
“ i hope his arrest will aid the efforts of the international community in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq . ” schröder , french president jacques chirac and the leaders of other countries opposed to the war were angered last week when u.s. deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz announced only companies from nations backing washington in iraq would be able to take part in iraqi reconstruction efforts being funded by the u.s. government worth some $ 18.6 billion . wolfowitz said he hoped the action would put pressure on other nations to join the military efforts in iraq , but it has also been criticized as unnecessarily provoking u.s. allies just as washington is looking for greater nato involvement in iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. bars germany , france from iraqi reconstruction contracts the united states said tuesday only companies from countries that supported the war in iraq would be allowed to bid for large reconstruction contracts , effectively excluding firms from war opponents germany and france .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday took part in a parliamentary mediation committee meeting in an attempt to keep his economic and welfare reforms on track with a bold new proposal on financing tax cuts . schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens passed labor market reforms and tax cuts in october in the lower house , but the upper house – which represents germany ’ s 16 federal states and is controlled by the conservatives and free-market liberals – rejected them last month .
that ’ s set the stage for a high-stakes legislative poker match that will determine the fate of the biggest reform process in germany in recent history . the mediation committee is charged with hammering out a deal between the lower house , the bundestag , and the upper house , the bundesrat .
schröder , joined by greens leader foreign minister joschka fischer , is hoping to garner the support of the conservatives by offering to finance the € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- tax cuts with less borrowing and a larger share from privatization funds . " the new proposal calls for three-fourths of the costs of the to the federal government being financed without new borrowing , " a government source told the reuters news agency .
" it is conceivable that this could be done with higher privatization revenues . " schröder ’ s decision to personally attend the meeting highlights how important he considers pushing through the reforms before the christmas break .
he has tied his political fate to the so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package of sweeping reforms designed to spark growth and trim the country ’ s bloated welfare state . schröder eager for deal “ i ’ m – as you know – willing to compromise and i expect that from the other side too , ” schröder told journalists on sunday . the two leaders of the conservative opposition , angela merkel from the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and edmund stoiber from the cdu ’ s bavaria sister party the csu , both also attended the meeting sunday .
however , ahead of the meeting it wasn ’ t clear if what schröder was bringing to the negotiating table wouldn ’ t be enough to get the conservatives on board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " we wo n't accept a bad deal , " she said , according to reuters .
" there wo n't be any lousy compromises that only lead to a few days of peace . " while it could appear that the opposition has the upper hand in the talks because of schröder ’ s strong desire for a deal , the conservatives are also aware most germans would be upset if the cdu appeared to block the economic reforms for their own political gain at a time when the country is suffering from low growth and high unemployment . “ a total failure won ’ t happen , ” merkel told the bild am sonntag newspaper . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crucial talks will decide fate of german reforms the german government wednesday began a last ditch effort to pass chancellor schröder ’ s key economic and welfare reforms before christmas .
whether the conservative opposition will back the proposals is far from certain .

u.s. officials confirmed on sunday they had captured former iraqi dictator saddam hussein near his hometown of tikrit .
sporadic celebratory gunfire was heard across the country as the news filtered out . on the run from u.s.-led coalition forces since the fall of baghdad in april , hussein has been washington ’ s most-wanted member of the iraqi regime .
his arrest will likely be a huge boost to the american occupation , which has had difficulty stabilizing postwar iraq . “ ladies and gentlemen , we got him , ” paul bremer , the u.s. civilian administrator in iraq , told a televised press conference in baghdad . u.s. lt.-gen.
ricardo sanchez said u.s. special forces raided a farm house near tikrit late on saturday .
he said hussein was captured without resistance after being found in a small underground hideout .
sanchez then also showed a video of a bearded and haggard-looking hussein being given a medical exam . " there were no injuries .
not a single shot was fired , " sanchez , the top u.s. general in iraq , told the press conference .
he said he had no idea how long he had been hiding there or whether he had been coordinating opposition to the u.s. occupation from that location . that the 66-year-old former leader had been able to elude u.s. forces for so long has been a major distraction for washington .
hussein is suspected of encouraging resistance to the coalition occupation and supporting attacks against american and allied troops . along with a few small arms , sanchez said hussein had around $ 750,000 -lrb- € 611,347 -rrb- in cash with him in the six by eight foot hole .
he did not say whether anyone had tipped off u.s. forces as to hussein 's location or if anyone would qualify for the $ 25 million bounty washington had placed on his head . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul bremer " this is a great day in iraq 's history .
the tyrant is a prisoner , " said bremer .
" now is the time for all iraqis - arabs and kurds , sunnis , shia , christian and turkmen - to build a prosperous , democratic iraq , at peace with itself and with its neighbors . " european leaders welcome capture british prime minster tony blair was the first western leader to confirm hussein had been taken alive .
" this has lifted a shadow from the people of iraq .
saddam will not be returning , " blair said . blair has been the staunchest ally of u.s. president george bush throughout the conflict with iraq , but the leaders of france and germany , both high-profile opponents of the war , also congratulated washington on sunday . “ i was extremely pleased to hear of the capture of saddam hussein and i offer my congratulations on this successful operation , ” german chancellor gerhard schröder said in an official letter to bush .
“ i hope his arrest will aid the efforts of the international community in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq . ” schröder , french president jacques chirac and the leaders of other countries opposed to the war were angered last week when u.s. deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz announced only companies from nations backing washington in iraq would be able to take part in iraqi reconstruction efforts being funded by the u.s. government worth some $ 18.6 billion . wolfowitz said he hoped the action would put pressure on other nations to join the military efforts in iraq , but it has also been criticized as unnecessarily provoking u.s. allies just as washington is looking for greater nato involvement in iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. bars germany , france from iraqi reconstruction contracts the united states said tuesday only companies from countries that supported the war in iraq would be allowed to bid for large reconstruction contracts , effectively excluding firms from war opponents germany and france .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday took part in a parliamentary mediation committee meeting in an attempt to keep his economic and welfare reforms on track with a bold new proposal on financing tax cuts . schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens passed labor market reforms and tax cuts in october in the lower house , but the upper house – which represents germany ’ s 16 federal states and is controlled by the conservatives and free-market liberals – rejected them last month .
that ’ s set the stage for a high-stakes legislative poker match that will determine the fate of the biggest reform process in germany in recent history . the mediation committee is charged with hammering out a deal between the lower house , the bundestag , and the upper house , the bundesrat .
schröder , joined by greens leader foreign minister joschka fischer , is hoping to garner the support of the conservatives by offering to finance the € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- tax cuts with less borrowing and a larger share from privatization funds . " the new proposal calls for three-fourths of the costs of the to the federal government being financed without new borrowing , " a government source told the reuters news agency .
" it is conceivable that this could be done with higher privatization revenues . " schröder ’ s decision to personally attend the meeting highlights how important he considers pushing through the reforms before the christmas break .
he has tied his political fate to the so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package of sweeping reforms designed to spark growth and trim the country ’ s bloated welfare state . schröder eager for deal “ i ’ m – as you know – willing to compromise and i expect that from the other side too , ” schröder told journalists on sunday . the two leaders of the conservative opposition , angela merkel from the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and edmund stoiber from the cdu ’ s bavaria sister party the csu , both also attended the meeting sunday .
however , ahead of the meeting it wasn ’ t clear if what schröder was bringing to the negotiating table wouldn ’ t be enough to get the conservatives on board .

" there wo n't be any lousy compromises that only lead to a few days of peace .

u.s. officials confirmed on sunday they had captured former iraqi dictator saddam hussein near his hometown of tikrit .
sporadic celebratory gunfire was heard across the country as the news filtered out . on the run from u.s.-led coalition forces since the fall of baghdad in april , hussein has been washington ’ s most-wanted member of the iraqi regime .
his arrest will likely be a huge boost to the american occupation , which has had difficulty stabilizing postwar iraq . “ ladies and gentlemen , we got him , ” paul bremer , the u.s. civilian administrator in iraq , told a televised press conference in baghdad . u.s. lt.-gen.
ricardo sanchez said u.s. special forces raided a farm house near tikrit late on saturday .
he said hussein was captured without resistance after being found in a small underground hideout .
sanchez then also showed a video of a bearded and haggard-looking hussein being given a medical exam . " there were no injuries .
not a single shot was fired , " sanchez , the top u.s. general in iraq , told the press conference .
he said he had no idea how long he had been hiding there or whether he had been coordinating opposition to the u.s. occupation from that location . that the 66-year-old former leader had been able to elude u.s. forces for so long has been a major distraction for washington .
hussein is suspected of encouraging resistance to the coalition occupation and supporting attacks against american and allied troops . along with a few small arms , sanchez said hussein had around $ 750,000 -lrb- € 611,347 -rrb- in cash with him in the six by eight foot hole .
he did not say whether anyone had tipped off u.s. forces as to hussein 's location or if anyone would qualify for the $ 25 million bounty washington had placed on his head . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul bremer " this is a great day in iraq 's history .

" european leaders welcome capture british prime minster tony blair was the first western leader to confirm hussein had been taken alive .
" this has lifted a shadow from the people of iraq .
saddam will not be returning , " blair said . blair has been the staunchest ally of u.s. president george bush throughout the conflict with iraq , but the leaders of france and germany , both high-profile opponents of the war , also congratulated washington on sunday . “ i was extremely pleased to hear of the capture of saddam hussein and i offer my congratulations on this successful operation , ” german chancellor gerhard schröder said in an official letter to bush .
“ i hope his arrest will aid the efforts of the international community in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq . ” schröder , french president jacques chirac and the leaders of other countries opposed to the war were angered last week when u.s. deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz announced only companies from nations backing washington in iraq would be able to take part in iraqi reconstruction efforts being funded by the u.s. government worth some $ 18.6 billion . wolfowitz said he hoped the action would put pressure on other nations to join the military efforts in iraq , but it has also been criticized as unnecessarily provoking u.s. allies just as washington is looking for greater nato involvement in iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. bars germany , france from iraqi reconstruction contracts the united states said tuesday only companies from countries that supported the war in iraq would be allowed to bid for large reconstruction contracts , effectively excluding firms from war opponents germany and france .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday took part in a parliamentary mediation committee meeting in an attempt to keep his economic and welfare reforms on track with a bold new proposal on financing tax cuts . schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens passed labor market reforms and tax cuts in october in the lower house , but the upper house – which represents germany ’ s 16 federal states and is controlled by the conservatives and free-market liberals – rejected them last month .
that ’ s set the stage for a high-stakes legislative poker match that will determine the fate of the biggest reform process in germany in recent history . the mediation committee is charged with hammering out a deal between the lower house , the bundestag , and the upper house , the bundesrat .
schröder , joined by greens leader foreign minister joschka fischer , is hoping to garner the support of the conservatives by offering to finance the € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- tax cuts with less borrowing and a larger share from privatization funds . " the new proposal calls for three-fourths of the costs of the to the federal government being financed without new borrowing , " a government source told the reuters news agency .
" it is conceivable that this could be done with higher privatization revenues . " schröder ’ s decision to personally attend the meeting highlights how important he considers pushing through the reforms before the christmas break .
he has tied his political fate to the so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package of sweeping reforms designed to spark growth and trim the country ’ s bloated welfare state . schröder eager for deal “ i ’ m – as you know – willing to compromise and i expect that from the other side too , ” schröder told journalists on sunday . the two leaders of the conservative opposition , angela merkel from the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and edmund stoiber from the cdu ’ s bavaria sister party the csu , both also attended the meeting sunday .
however , ahead of the meeting it wasn ’ t clear if what schröder was bringing to the negotiating table wouldn ’ t be enough to get the conservatives on board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " we wo n't accept a bad deal , " she said , according to reuters .
" there wo n't be any lousy compromises that only lead to a few days of peace . " while it could appear that the opposition has the upper hand in the talks because of schröder ’ s strong desire for a deal , the conservatives are also aware most germans would be upset if the cdu appeared to block the economic reforms for their own political gain at a time when the country is suffering from low growth and high unemployment . “ a total failure won ’ t happen , ” merkel told the bild am sonntag newspaper . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crucial talks will decide fate of german reforms the german government wednesday began a last ditch effort to pass chancellor schröder ’ s key economic and welfare reforms before christmas .
whether the conservative opposition will back the proposals is far from certain .

u.s. officials confirmed on sunday they had captured former iraqi dictator saddam hussein near his hometown of tikrit .
sporadic celebratory gunfire was heard across the country as the news filtered out . on the run from u.s.-led coalition forces since the fall of baghdad in april , hussein has been washington ’ s most-wanted member of the iraqi regime .
his arrest will likely be a huge boost to the american occupation , which has had difficulty stabilizing postwar iraq . “ ladies and gentlemen , we got him , ” paul bremer , the u.s. civilian administrator in iraq , told a televised press conference in baghdad . u.s. lt.-gen.
ricardo sanchez said u.s. special forces raided a farm house near tikrit late on saturday .
he said hussein was captured without resistance after being found in a small underground hideout .
sanchez then also showed a video of a bearded and haggard-looking hussein being given a medical exam . " there were no injuries .
not a single shot was fired , " sanchez , the top u.s. general in iraq , told the press conference .
he said he had no idea how long he had been hiding there or whether he had been coordinating opposition to the u.s. occupation from that location . that the 66-year-old former leader had been able to elude u.s. forces for so long has been a major distraction for washington .
hussein is suspected of encouraging resistance to the coalition occupation and supporting attacks against american and allied troops . along with a few small arms , sanchez said hussein had around $ 750,000 -lrb- € 611,347 -rrb- in cash with him in the six by eight foot hole .
he did not say whether anyone had tipped off u.s. forces as to hussein 's location or if anyone would qualify for the $ 25 million bounty washington had placed on his head . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul bremer " this is a great day in iraq 's history .
the tyrant is a prisoner , " said bremer .
" now is the time for all iraqis - arabs and kurds , sunnis , shia , christian and turkmen - to build a prosperous , democratic iraq , at peace with itself and with its neighbors . " european leaders welcome capture british prime minster tony blair was the first western leader to confirm hussein had been taken alive .
" this has lifted a shadow from the people of iraq .
saddam will not be returning , " blair said . blair has been the staunchest ally of u.s. president george bush throughout the conflict with iraq , but the leaders of france and germany , both high-profile opponents of the war , also congratulated washington on sunday . “ i was extremely pleased to hear of the capture of saddam hussein and i offer my congratulations on this successful operation , ” german chancellor gerhard schröder said in an official letter to bush .
“ i hope his arrest will aid the efforts of the international community in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq . ” schröder , french president jacques chirac and the leaders of other countries opposed to the war were angered last week when u.s. deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz announced only companies from nations backing washington in iraq would be able to take part in iraqi reconstruction efforts being funded by the u.s. government worth some $ 18.6 billion . wolfowitz said he hoped the action would put pressure on other nations to join the military efforts in iraq , but it has also been criticized as unnecessarily provoking u.s. allies just as washington is looking for greater nato involvement in iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. bars germany , france from iraqi reconstruction contracts the united states said tuesday only companies from countries that supported the war in iraq would be allowed to bid for large reconstruction contracts , effectively excluding firms from war opponents germany and france .

u.s. officials confirmed on sunday they had captured former iraqi dictator saddam hussein near his hometown of tikrit .
sporadic celebratory gunfire was heard across the country as the news filtered out . on the run from u.s.-led coalition forces since the fall of baghdad in april , hussein has been washington ’ s most-wanted member of the iraqi regime .
his arrest will likely be a huge boost to the american occupation , which has had difficulty stabilizing postwar iraq . “ ladies and gentlemen , we got him , ” paul bremer , the u.s. civilian administrator in iraq , told a televised press conference in baghdad . u.s. lt.-gen.
ricardo sanchez said u.s. special forces raided a farm house near tikrit late on saturday .
he said hussein was captured without resistance after being found in a small underground hideout .
sanchez then also showed a video of a bearded and haggard-looking hussein being given a medical exam . " there were no injuries .
not a single shot was fired , " sanchez , the top u.s. general in iraq , told the press conference .
he said he had no idea how long he had been hiding there or whether he had been coordinating opposition to the u.s. occupation from that location . that the 66-year-old former leader had been able to elude u.s. forces for so long has been a major distraction for washington .
hussein is suspected of encouraging resistance to the coalition occupation and supporting attacks against american and allied troops . along with a few small arms , sanchez said hussein had around $ 750,000 -lrb- € 611,347 -rrb- in cash with him in the six by eight foot hole .
he did not say whether anyone had tipped off u.s. forces as to hussein 's location or if anyone would qualify for the $ 25 million bounty washington had placed on his head . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul bremer " this is a great day in iraq 's history .
the tyrant is a prisoner , " said bremer .
" now is the time for all iraqis - arabs and kurds , sunnis , shia , christian and turkmen - to build a prosperous , democratic iraq , at peace with itself and with its neighbors . " european leaders welcome capture british prime minster tony blair was the first western leader to confirm hussein had been taken alive .
" this has lifted a shadow from the people of iraq .
saddam will not be returning , " blair said . blair has been the staunchest ally of u.s. president george bush throughout the conflict with iraq , but the leaders of france and germany , both high-profile opponents of the war , also congratulated washington on sunday . “ i was extremely pleased to hear of the capture of saddam hussein and i offer my congratulations on this successful operation , ” german chancellor gerhard schröder said in an official letter to bush .
“ i hope his arrest will aid the efforts of the international community in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq . ” schröder , french president jacques chirac and the leaders of other countries opposed to the war were angered last week when u.s. deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz announced only companies from nations backing washington in iraq would be able to take part in iraqi reconstruction efforts being funded by the u.s. government worth some $ 18.6 billion . wolfowitz said he hoped the action would put pressure on other nations to join the military efforts in iraq , but it has also been criticized as unnecessarily provoking u.s. allies just as washington is looking for greater nato involvement in iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. bars germany , france from iraqi reconstruction contracts the united states said tuesday only companies from countries that supported the war in iraq would be allowed to bid for large reconstruction contracts , effectively excluding firms from war opponents germany and france .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday took part in a parliamentary mediation committee meeting in an attempt to keep his economic and welfare reforms on track with a bold new proposal on financing tax cuts . schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens passed labor market reforms and tax cuts in october in the lower house , but the upper house – which represents germany ’ s 16 federal states and is controlled by the conservatives and free-market liberals – rejected them last month .
that ’ s set the stage for a high-stakes legislative poker match that will determine the fate of the biggest reform process in germany in recent history . the mediation committee is charged with hammering out a deal between the lower house , the bundestag , and the upper house , the bundesrat .
schröder , joined by greens leader foreign minister joschka fischer , is hoping to garner the support of the conservatives by offering to finance the € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- tax cuts with less borrowing and a larger share from privatization funds . " the new proposal calls for three-fourths of the costs of the to the federal government being financed without new borrowing , " a government source told the reuters news agency .
" it is conceivable that this could be done with higher privatization revenues . " schröder ’ s decision to personally attend the meeting highlights how important he considers pushing through the reforms before the christmas break .
he has tied his political fate to the so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package of sweeping reforms designed to spark growth and trim the country ’ s bloated welfare state . schröder eager for deal “ i ’ m – as you know – willing to compromise and i expect that from the other side too , ” schröder told journalists on sunday . the two leaders of the conservative opposition , angela merkel from the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and edmund stoiber from the cdu ’ s bavaria sister party the csu , both also attended the meeting sunday .
however , ahead of the meeting it wasn ’ t clear if what schröder was bringing to the negotiating table wouldn ’ t be enough to get the conservatives on board .

" there wo n't be any lousy compromises that only lead to a few days of peace .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday took part in a parliamentary mediation committee meeting in an attempt to keep his economic and welfare reforms on track with a bold new proposal on financing tax cuts . schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens passed labor market reforms and tax cuts in october in the lower house , but the upper house – which represents germany ’ s 16 federal states and is controlled by the conservatives and free-market liberals – rejected them last month .
that ’ s set the stage for a high-stakes legislative poker match that will determine the fate of the biggest reform process in germany in recent history . the mediation committee is charged with hammering out a deal between the lower house , the bundestag , and the upper house , the bundesrat .
schröder , joined by greens leader foreign minister joschka fischer , is hoping to garner the support of the conservatives by offering to finance the € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- tax cuts with less borrowing and a larger share from privatization funds . " the new proposal calls for three-fourths of the costs of the to the federal government being financed without new borrowing , " a government source told the reuters news agency .
" it is conceivable that this could be done with higher privatization revenues . " schröder ’ s decision to personally attend the meeting highlights how important he considers pushing through the reforms before the christmas break .
he has tied his political fate to the so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package of sweeping reforms designed to spark growth and trim the country ’ s bloated welfare state . schröder eager for deal “ i ’ m – as you know – willing to compromise and i expect that from the other side too , ” schröder told journalists on sunday . the two leaders of the conservative opposition , angela merkel from the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and edmund stoiber from the cdu ’ s bavaria sister party the csu , both also attended the meeting sunday .
however , ahead of the meeting it wasn ’ t clear if what schröder was bringing to the negotiating table wouldn ’ t be enough to get the conservatives on board .

u.s. officials confirmed on sunday they had captured former iraqi dictator saddam hussein near his hometown of tikrit .
sporadic celebratory gunfire was heard across the country as the news filtered out . on the run from u.s.-led coalition forces since the fall of baghdad in april , hussein has been washington ’ s most-wanted member of the iraqi regime .
his arrest will likely be a huge boost to the american occupation , which has had difficulty stabilizing postwar iraq . “ ladies and gentlemen , we got him , ” paul bremer , the u.s. civilian administrator in iraq , told a televised press conference in baghdad . u.s. lt.-gen.
ricardo sanchez said u.s. special forces raided a farm house near tikrit late on saturday .
he said hussein was captured without resistance after being found in a small underground hideout .
sanchez then also showed a video of a bearded and haggard-looking hussein being given a medical exam . " there were no injuries .
not a single shot was fired , " sanchez , the top u.s. general in iraq , told the press conference .
he said he had no idea how long he had been hiding there or whether he had been coordinating opposition to the u.s. occupation from that location . that the 66-year-old former leader had been able to elude u.s. forces for so long has been a major distraction for washington .
hussein is suspected of encouraging resistance to the coalition occupation and supporting attacks against american and allied troops . along with a few small arms , sanchez said hussein had around $ 750,000 -lrb- € 611,347 -rrb- in cash with him in the six by eight foot hole .
he did not say whether anyone had tipped off u.s. forces as to hussein 's location or if anyone would qualify for the $ 25 million bounty washington had placed on his head . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul bremer " this is a great day in iraq 's history .

saddam will not be returning , " blair said . blair has been the staunchest ally of u.s. president george bush throughout the conflict with iraq , but the leaders of france and germany , both high-profile opponents of the war , also congratulated washington on sunday . “ i was extremely pleased to hear of the capture of saddam hussein and i offer my congratulations on this successful operation , ” german chancellor gerhard schröder said in an official letter to bush .
“ i hope his arrest will aid the efforts of the international community in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq . ” schröder , french president jacques chirac and the leaders of other countries opposed to the war were angered last week when u.s. deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz announced only companies from nations backing washington in iraq would be able to take part in iraqi reconstruction efforts being funded by the u.s. government worth some $ 18.6 billion . wolfowitz said he hoped the action would put pressure on other nations to join the military efforts in iraq , but it has also been criticized as unnecessarily provoking u.s. allies just as washington is looking for greater nato involvement in iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. bars germany , france from iraqi reconstruction contracts the united states said tuesday only companies from countries that supported the war in iraq would be allowed to bid for large reconstruction contracts , effectively excluding firms from war opponents germany and france .

u.s. officials confirmed on sunday they had captured former iraqi dictator saddam hussein near his hometown of tikrit .
sporadic celebratory gunfire was heard across the country as the news filtered out . on the run from u.s.-led coalition forces since the fall of baghdad in april , hussein has been washington ’ s most-wanted member of the iraqi regime .
his arrest will likely be a huge boost to the american occupation , which has had difficulty stabilizing postwar iraq . “ ladies and gentlemen , we got him , ” paul bremer , the u.s. civilian administrator in iraq , told a televised press conference in baghdad . u.s. lt.-gen.
ricardo sanchez said u.s. special forces raided a farm house near tikrit late on saturday .
he said hussein was captured without resistance after being found in a small underground hideout .
sanchez then also showed a video of a bearded and haggard-looking hussein being given a medical exam . " there were no injuries .
not a single shot was fired , " sanchez , the top u.s. general in iraq , told the press conference .
he said he had no idea how long he had been hiding there or whether he had been coordinating opposition to the u.s. occupation from that location . that the 66-year-old former leader had been able to elude u.s. forces for so long has been a major distraction for washington .
hussein is suspected of encouraging resistance to the coalition occupation and supporting attacks against american and allied troops . along with a few small arms , sanchez said hussein had around $ 750,000 -lrb- € 611,347 -rrb- in cash with him in the six by eight foot hole .
he did not say whether anyone had tipped off u.s. forces as to hussein 's location or if anyone would qualify for the $ 25 million bounty washington had placed on his head . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul bremer " this is a great day in iraq 's history .
the tyrant is a prisoner , " said bremer .
" now is the time for all iraqis - arabs and kurds , sunnis , shia , christian and turkmen - to build a prosperous , democratic iraq , at peace with itself and with its neighbors . " european leaders welcome capture british prime minster tony blair was the first western leader to confirm hussein had been taken alive .
" this has lifted a shadow from the people of iraq .
saddam will not be returning , " blair said . blair has been the staunchest ally of u.s. president george bush throughout the conflict with iraq , but the leaders of france and germany , both high-profile opponents of the war , also congratulated washington on sunday . “ i was extremely pleased to hear of the capture of saddam hussein and i offer my congratulations on this successful operation , ” german chancellor gerhard schröder said in an official letter to bush .
“ i hope his arrest will aid the efforts of the international community in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq . ” schröder , french president jacques chirac and the leaders of other countries opposed to the war were angered last week when u.s. deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz announced only companies from nations backing washington in iraq would be able to take part in iraqi reconstruction efforts being funded by the u.s. government worth some $ 18.6 billion . wolfowitz said he hoped the action would put pressure on other nations to join the military efforts in iraq , but it has also been criticized as unnecessarily provoking u.s. allies just as washington is looking for greater nato involvement in iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. bars germany , france from iraqi reconstruction contracts the united states said tuesday only companies from countries that supported the war in iraq would be allowed to bid for large reconstruction contracts , effectively excluding firms from war opponents germany and france .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday took part in a parliamentary mediation committee meeting in an attempt to keep his economic and welfare reforms on track with a bold new proposal on financing tax cuts . schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens passed labor market reforms and tax cuts in october in the lower house , but the upper house – which represents germany ’ s 16 federal states and is controlled by the conservatives and free-market liberals – rejected them last month .
that ’ s set the stage for a high-stakes legislative poker match that will determine the fate of the biggest reform process in germany in recent history . the mediation committee is charged with hammering out a deal between the lower house , the bundestag , and the upper house , the bundesrat .
schröder , joined by greens leader foreign minister joschka fischer , is hoping to garner the support of the conservatives by offering to finance the € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- tax cuts with less borrowing and a larger share from privatization funds . " the new proposal calls for three-fourths of the costs of the to the federal government being financed without new borrowing , " a government source told the reuters news agency .
" it is conceivable that this could be done with higher privatization revenues . " schröder ’ s decision to personally attend the meeting highlights how important he considers pushing through the reforms before the christmas break .
he has tied his political fate to the so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package of sweeping reforms designed to spark growth and trim the country ’ s bloated welfare state . schröder eager for deal “ i ’ m – as you know – willing to compromise and i expect that from the other side too , ” schröder told journalists on sunday . the two leaders of the conservative opposition , angela merkel from the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and edmund stoiber from the cdu ’ s bavaria sister party the csu , both also attended the meeting sunday .
however , ahead of the meeting it wasn ’ t clear if what schröder was bringing to the negotiating table wouldn ’ t be enough to get the conservatives on board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " we wo n't accept a bad deal , " she said , according to reuters .
" there wo n't be any lousy compromises that only lead to a few days of peace .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday took part in a parliamentary mediation committee meeting in an attempt to keep his economic and welfare reforms on track with a bold new proposal on financing tax cuts . schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens passed labor market reforms and tax cuts in october in the lower house , but the upper house – which represents germany ’ s 16 federal states and is controlled by the conservatives and free-market liberals – rejected them last month .
that ’ s set the stage for a high-stakes legislative poker match that will determine the fate of the biggest reform process in germany in recent history . the mediation committee is charged with hammering out a deal between the lower house , the bundestag , and the upper house , the bundesrat .
schröder , joined by greens leader foreign minister joschka fischer , is hoping to garner the support of the conservatives by offering to finance the € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- tax cuts with less borrowing and a larger share from privatization funds . " the new proposal calls for three-fourths of the costs of the to the federal government being financed without new borrowing , " a government source told the reuters news agency .
" it is conceivable that this could be done with higher privatization revenues . " schröder ’ s decision to personally attend the meeting highlights how important he considers pushing through the reforms before the christmas break .
he has tied his political fate to the so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package of sweeping reforms designed to spark growth and trim the country ’ s bloated welfare state . schröder eager for deal “ i ’ m – as you know – willing to compromise and i expect that from the other side too , ” schröder told journalists on sunday . the two leaders of the conservative opposition , angela merkel from the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and edmund stoiber from the cdu ’ s bavaria sister party the csu , both also attended the meeting sunday .
however , ahead of the meeting it wasn ’ t clear if what schröder was bringing to the negotiating table wouldn ’ t be enough to get the conservatives on board .

u.s. officials confirmed on sunday they had captured former iraqi dictator saddam hussein near his hometown of tikrit .
sporadic celebratory gunfire was heard across the country as the news filtered out . on the run from u.s.-led coalition forces since the fall of baghdad in april , hussein has been washington ’ s most-wanted member of the iraqi regime .
his arrest will likely be a huge boost to the american occupation , which has had difficulty stabilizing postwar iraq . “ ladies and gentlemen , we got him , ” paul bremer , the u.s. civilian administrator in iraq , told a televised press conference in baghdad . u.s. lt.-gen.
ricardo sanchez said u.s. special forces raided a farm house near tikrit late on saturday .
he said hussein was captured without resistance after being found in a small underground hideout .
sanchez then also showed a video of a bearded and haggard-looking hussein being given a medical exam . " there were no injuries .
not a single shot was fired , " sanchez , the top u.s. general in iraq , told the press conference .
he said he had no idea how long he had been hiding there or whether he had been coordinating opposition to the u.s. occupation from that location . that the 66-year-old former leader had been able to elude u.s. forces for so long has been a major distraction for washington .
hussein is suspected of encouraging resistance to the coalition occupation and supporting attacks against american and allied troops . along with a few small arms , sanchez said hussein had around $ 750,000 -lrb- € 611,347 -rrb- in cash with him in the six by eight foot hole .
he did not say whether anyone had tipped off u.s. forces as to hussein 's location or if anyone would qualify for the $ 25 million bounty washington had placed on his head . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul bremer " this is a great day in iraq 's history .

" european leaders welcome capture british prime minster tony blair was the first western leader to confirm hussein had been taken alive .
" this has lifted a shadow from the people of iraq .
saddam will not be returning , " blair said . blair has been the staunchest ally of u.s. president george bush throughout the conflict with iraq , but the leaders of france and germany , both high-profile opponents of the war , also congratulated washington on sunday . “ i was extremely pleased to hear of the capture of saddam hussein and i offer my congratulations on this successful operation , ” german chancellor gerhard schröder said in an official letter to bush .
“ i hope his arrest will aid the efforts of the international community in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq . ” schröder , french president jacques chirac and the leaders of other countries opposed to the war were angered last week when u.s. deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz announced only companies from nations backing washington in iraq would be able to take part in iraqi reconstruction efforts being funded by the u.s. government worth some $ 18.6 billion . wolfowitz said he hoped the action would put pressure on other nations to join the military efforts in iraq , but it has also been criticized as unnecessarily provoking u.s. allies just as washington is looking for greater nato involvement in iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. bars germany , france from iraqi reconstruction contracts the united states said tuesday only companies from countries that supported the war in iraq would be allowed to bid for large reconstruction contracts , effectively excluding firms from war opponents germany and france .

u.s. officials confirmed on sunday they had captured former iraqi dictator saddam hussein near his hometown of tikrit .
sporadic celebratory gunfire was heard across the country as the news filtered out . on the run from u.s.-led coalition forces since the fall of baghdad in april , hussein has been washington ’ s most-wanted member of the iraqi regime .
his arrest will likely be a huge boost to the american occupation , which has had difficulty stabilizing postwar iraq . “ ladies and gentlemen , we got him , ” paul bremer , the u.s. civilian administrator in iraq , told a televised press conference in baghdad . u.s. lt.-gen.
ricardo sanchez said u.s. special forces raided a farm house near tikrit late on saturday .
he said hussein was captured without resistance after being found in a small underground hideout .
sanchez then also showed a video of a bearded and haggard-looking hussein being given a medical exam . " there were no injuries .
not a single shot was fired , " sanchez , the top u.s. general in iraq , told the press conference .
he said he had no idea how long he had been hiding there or whether he had been coordinating opposition to the u.s. occupation from that location . that the 66-year-old former leader had been able to elude u.s. forces for so long has been a major distraction for washington .
hussein is suspected of encouraging resistance to the coalition occupation and supporting attacks against american and allied troops . along with a few small arms , sanchez said hussein had around $ 750,000 -lrb- € 611,347 -rrb- in cash with him in the six by eight foot hole .
he did not say whether anyone had tipped off u.s. forces as to hussein 's location or if anyone would qualify for the $ 25 million bounty washington had placed on his head . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul bremer " this is a great day in iraq 's history .
the tyrant is a prisoner , " said bremer .
" now is the time for all iraqis - arabs and kurds , sunnis , shia , christian and turkmen - to build a prosperous , democratic iraq , at peace with itself and with its neighbors . " european leaders welcome capture british prime minster tony blair was the first western leader to confirm hussein had been taken alive .
" this has lifted a shadow from the people of iraq .
saddam will not be returning , " blair said . blair has been the staunchest ally of u.s. president george bush throughout the conflict with iraq , but the leaders of france and germany , both high-profile opponents of the war , also congratulated washington on sunday . “ i was extremely pleased to hear of the capture of saddam hussein and i offer my congratulations on this successful operation , ” german chancellor gerhard schröder said in an official letter to bush .
“ i hope his arrest will aid the efforts of the international community in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq . ” schröder , french president jacques chirac and the leaders of other countries opposed to the war were angered last week when u.s. deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz announced only companies from nations backing washington in iraq would be able to take part in iraqi reconstruction efforts being funded by the u.s. government worth some $ 18.6 billion . wolfowitz said he hoped the action would put pressure on other nations to join the military efforts in iraq , but it has also been criticized as unnecessarily provoking u.s. allies just as washington is looking for greater nato involvement in iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. bars germany , france from iraqi reconstruction contracts the united states said tuesday only companies from countries that supported the war in iraq would be allowed to bid for large reconstruction contracts , effectively excluding firms from war opponents germany and france .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday took part in a parliamentary mediation committee meeting in an attempt to keep his economic and welfare reforms on track with a bold new proposal on financing tax cuts . schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens passed labor market reforms and tax cuts in october in the lower house , but the upper house – which represents germany ’ s 16 federal states and is controlled by the conservatives and free-market liberals – rejected them last month .
that ’ s set the stage for a high-stakes legislative poker match that will determine the fate of the biggest reform process in germany in recent history . the mediation committee is charged with hammering out a deal between the lower house , the bundestag , and the upper house , the bundesrat .
schröder , joined by greens leader foreign minister joschka fischer , is hoping to garner the support of the conservatives by offering to finance the € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- tax cuts with less borrowing and a larger share from privatization funds . " the new proposal calls for three-fourths of the costs of the to the federal government being financed without new borrowing , " a government source told the reuters news agency .
" it is conceivable that this could be done with higher privatization revenues . " schröder ’ s decision to personally attend the meeting highlights how important he considers pushing through the reforms before the christmas break .
he has tied his political fate to the so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package of sweeping reforms designed to spark growth and trim the country ’ s bloated welfare state . schröder eager for deal “ i ’ m – as you know – willing to compromise and i expect that from the other side too , ” schröder told journalists on sunday . the two leaders of the conservative opposition , angela merkel from the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and edmund stoiber from the cdu ’ s bavaria sister party the csu , both also attended the meeting sunday .
however , ahead of the meeting it wasn ’ t clear if what schröder was bringing to the negotiating table wouldn ’ t be enough to get the conservatives on board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " we wo n't accept a bad deal , " she said , according to reuters .
" there wo n't be any lousy compromises that only lead to a few days of peace . " while it could appear that the opposition has the upper hand in the talks because of schröder ’ s strong desire for a deal , the conservatives are also aware most germans would be upset if the cdu appeared to block the economic reforms for their own political gain at a time when the country is suffering from low growth and high unemployment . “ a total failure won ’ t happen , ” merkel told the bild am sonntag newspaper . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crucial talks will decide fate of german reforms the german government wednesday began a last ditch effort to pass chancellor schröder ’ s key economic and welfare reforms before christmas .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday took part in a parliamentary mediation committee meeting in an attempt to keep his economic and welfare reforms on track with a bold new proposal on financing tax cuts . schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens passed labor market reforms and tax cuts in october in the lower house , but the upper house – which represents germany ’ s 16 federal states and is controlled by the conservatives and free-market liberals – rejected them last month .
that ’ s set the stage for a high-stakes legislative poker match that will determine the fate of the biggest reform process in germany in recent history . the mediation committee is charged with hammering out a deal between the lower house , the bundestag , and the upper house , the bundesrat .
schröder , joined by greens leader foreign minister joschka fischer , is hoping to garner the support of the conservatives by offering to finance the € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- tax cuts with less borrowing and a larger share from privatization funds . " the new proposal calls for three-fourths of the costs of the to the federal government being financed without new borrowing , " a government source told the reuters news agency .
" it is conceivable that this could be done with higher privatization revenues . " schröder ’ s decision to personally attend the meeting highlights how important he considers pushing through the reforms before the christmas break .
he has tied his political fate to the so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package of sweeping reforms designed to spark growth and trim the country ’ s bloated welfare state . schröder eager for deal “ i ’ m – as you know – willing to compromise and i expect that from the other side too , ” schröder told journalists on sunday . the two leaders of the conservative opposition , angela merkel from the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and edmund stoiber from the cdu ’ s bavaria sister party the csu , both also attended the meeting sunday .

u.s. officials confirmed on sunday they had captured former iraqi dictator saddam hussein near his hometown of tikrit .
sporadic celebratory gunfire was heard across the country as the news filtered out . on the run from u.s.-led coalition forces since the fall of baghdad in april , hussein has been washington ’ s most-wanted member of the iraqi regime .
his arrest will likely be a huge boost to the american occupation , which has had difficulty stabilizing postwar iraq . “ ladies and gentlemen , we got him , ” paul bremer , the u.s. civilian administrator in iraq , told a televised press conference in baghdad . u.s. lt.-gen.
ricardo sanchez said u.s. special forces raided a farm house near tikrit late on saturday .
he said hussein was captured without resistance after being found in a small underground hideout .
sanchez then also showed a video of a bearded and haggard-looking hussein being given a medical exam . " there were no injuries .
not a single shot was fired , " sanchez , the top u.s. general in iraq , told the press conference .
he said he had no idea how long he had been hiding there or whether he had been coordinating opposition to the u.s. occupation from that location . that the 66-year-old former leader had been able to elude u.s. forces for so long has been a major distraction for washington .
hussein is suspected of encouraging resistance to the coalition occupation and supporting attacks against american and allied troops . along with a few small arms , sanchez said hussein had around $ 750,000 -lrb- € 611,347 -rrb- in cash with him in the six by eight foot hole .
he did not say whether anyone had tipped off u.s. forces as to hussein 's location or if anyone would qualify for the $ 25 million bounty washington had placed on his head . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul bremer " this is a great day in iraq 's history .
the tyrant is a prisoner , " said bremer .
" now is the time for all iraqis - arabs and kurds , sunnis , shia , christian and turkmen - to build a prosperous , democratic iraq , at peace with itself and with its neighbors . " european leaders welcome capture british prime minster tony blair was the first western leader to confirm hussein had been taken alive .
" this has lifted a shadow from the people of iraq .
saddam will not be returning , " blair said . blair has been the staunchest ally of u.s. president george bush throughout the conflict with iraq , but the leaders of france and germany , both high-profile opponents of the war , also congratulated washington on sunday . “ i was extremely pleased to hear of the capture of saddam hussein and i offer my congratulations on this successful operation , ” german chancellor gerhard schröder said in an official letter to bush .
“ i hope his arrest will aid the efforts of the international community in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq . ” schröder , french president jacques chirac and the leaders of other countries opposed to the war were angered last week when u.s. deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz announced only companies from nations backing washington in iraq would be able to take part in iraqi reconstruction efforts being funded by the u.s. government worth some $ 18.6 billion . wolfowitz said he hoped the action would put pressure on other nations to join the military efforts in iraq , but it has also been criticized as unnecessarily provoking u.s. allies just as washington is looking for greater nato involvement in iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. bars germany , france from iraqi reconstruction contracts the united states said tuesday only companies from countries that supported the war in iraq would be allowed to bid for large reconstruction contracts , effectively excluding firms from war opponents germany and france .

u.s. officials confirmed on sunday they had captured former iraqi dictator saddam hussein near his hometown of tikrit .
sporadic celebratory gunfire was heard across the country as the news filtered out . on the run from u.s.-led coalition forces since the fall of baghdad in april , hussein has been washington ’ s most-wanted member of the iraqi regime .
his arrest will likely be a huge boost to the american occupation , which has had difficulty stabilizing postwar iraq . “ ladies and gentlemen , we got him , ” paul bremer , the u.s. civilian administrator in iraq , told a televised press conference in baghdad . u.s. lt.-gen.
ricardo sanchez said u.s. special forces raided a farm house near tikrit late on saturday .
he said hussein was captured without resistance after being found in a small underground hideout .
sanchez then also showed a video of a bearded and haggard-looking hussein being given a medical exam . " there were no injuries .
not a single shot was fired , " sanchez , the top u.s. general in iraq , told the press conference .
he said he had no idea how long he had been hiding there or whether he had been coordinating opposition to the u.s. occupation from that location . that the 66-year-old former leader had been able to elude u.s. forces for so long has been a major distraction for washington .
hussein is suspected of encouraging resistance to the coalition occupation and supporting attacks against american and allied troops . along with a few small arms , sanchez said hussein had around $ 750,000 -lrb- € 611,347 -rrb- in cash with him in the six by eight foot hole .
he did not say whether anyone had tipped off u.s. forces as to hussein 's location or if anyone would qualify for the $ 25 million bounty washington had placed on his head . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul bremer " this is a great day in iraq 's history .

“ i hope his arrest will aid the efforts of the international community in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq . ” schröder , french president jacques chirac and the leaders of other countries opposed to the war were angered last week when u.s. deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz announced only companies from nations backing washington in iraq would be able to take part in iraqi reconstruction efforts being funded by the u.s. government worth some $ 18.6 billion . wolfowitz said he hoped the action would put pressure on other nations to join the military efforts in iraq , but it has also been criticized as unnecessarily provoking u.s. allies just as washington is looking for greater nato involvement in iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. bars germany , france from iraqi reconstruction contracts the united states said tuesday only companies from countries that supported the war in iraq would be allowed to bid for large reconstruction contracts , effectively excluding firms from war opponents germany and france .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday took part in a parliamentary mediation committee meeting in an attempt to keep his economic and welfare reforms on track with a bold new proposal on financing tax cuts . schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens passed labor market reforms and tax cuts in october in the lower house , but the upper house – which represents germany ’ s 16 federal states and is controlled by the conservatives and free-market liberals – rejected them last month .
that ’ s set the stage for a high-stakes legislative poker match that will determine the fate of the biggest reform process in germany in recent history . the mediation committee is charged with hammering out a deal between the lower house , the bundestag , and the upper house , the bundesrat .
schröder , joined by greens leader foreign minister joschka fischer , is hoping to garner the support of the conservatives by offering to finance the € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- tax cuts with less borrowing and a larger share from privatization funds . " the new proposal calls for three-fourths of the costs of the to the federal government being financed without new borrowing , " a government source told the reuters news agency .
" it is conceivable that this could be done with higher privatization revenues . " schröder ’ s decision to personally attend the meeting highlights how important he considers pushing through the reforms before the christmas break .
he has tied his political fate to the so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package of sweeping reforms designed to spark growth and trim the country ’ s bloated welfare state . schröder eager for deal “ i ’ m – as you know – willing to compromise and i expect that from the other side too , ” schröder told journalists on sunday . the two leaders of the conservative opposition , angela merkel from the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and edmund stoiber from the cdu ’ s bavaria sister party the csu , both also attended the meeting sunday .
however , ahead of the meeting it wasn ’ t clear if what schröder was bringing to the negotiating table wouldn ’ t be enough to get the conservatives on board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " we wo n't accept a bad deal , " she said , according to reuters .
" there wo n't be any lousy compromises that only lead to a few days of peace . " while it could appear that the opposition has the upper hand in the talks because of schröder ’ s strong desire for a deal , the conservatives are also aware most germans would be upset if the cdu appeared to block the economic reforms for their own political gain at a time when the country is suffering from low growth and high unemployment . “ a total failure won ’ t happen , ” merkel told the bild am sonntag newspaper . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crucial talks will decide fate of german reforms the german government wednesday began a last ditch effort to pass chancellor schröder ’ s key economic and welfare reforms before christmas .
whether the conservative opposition will back the proposals is far from certain .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday took part in a parliamentary mediation committee meeting in an attempt to keep his economic and welfare reforms on track with a bold new proposal on financing tax cuts . schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens passed labor market reforms and tax cuts in october in the lower house , but the upper house – which represents germany ’ s 16 federal states and is controlled by the conservatives and free-market liberals – rejected them last month .
that ’ s set the stage for a high-stakes legislative poker match that will determine the fate of the biggest reform process in germany in recent history . the mediation committee is charged with hammering out a deal between the lower house , the bundestag , and the upper house , the bundesrat .
schröder , joined by greens leader foreign minister joschka fischer , is hoping to garner the support of the conservatives by offering to finance the € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- tax cuts with less borrowing and a larger share from privatization funds . " the new proposal calls for three-fourths of the costs of the to the federal government being financed without new borrowing , " a government source told the reuters news agency .
" it is conceivable that this could be done with higher privatization revenues . " schröder ’ s decision to personally attend the meeting highlights how important he considers pushing through the reforms before the christmas break .
he has tied his political fate to the so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package of sweeping reforms designed to spark growth and trim the country ’ s bloated welfare state . schröder eager for deal “ i ’ m – as you know – willing to compromise and i expect that from the other side too , ” schröder told journalists on sunday . the two leaders of the conservative opposition , angela merkel from the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and edmund stoiber from the cdu ’ s bavaria sister party the csu , both also attended the meeting sunday .
however , ahead of the meeting it wasn ’ t clear if what schröder was bringing to the negotiating table wouldn ’ t be enough to get the conservatives on board .

" there wo n't be any lousy compromises that only lead to a few days of peace .

u.s. officials confirmed on sunday they had captured former iraqi dictator saddam hussein near his hometown of tikrit .
sporadic celebratory gunfire was heard across the country as the news filtered out . on the run from u.s.-led coalition forces since the fall of baghdad in april , hussein has been washington ’ s most-wanted member of the iraqi regime .
his arrest will likely be a huge boost to the american occupation , which has had difficulty stabilizing postwar iraq . “ ladies and gentlemen , we got him , ” paul bremer , the u.s. civilian administrator in iraq , told a televised press conference in baghdad . u.s. lt.-gen.
ricardo sanchez said u.s. special forces raided a farm house near tikrit late on saturday .
he said hussein was captured without resistance after being found in a small underground hideout .
sanchez then also showed a video of a bearded and haggard-looking hussein being given a medical exam . " there were no injuries .
not a single shot was fired , " sanchez , the top u.s. general in iraq , told the press conference .
he said he had no idea how long he had been hiding there or whether he had been coordinating opposition to the u.s. occupation from that location . that the 66-year-old former leader had been able to elude u.s. forces for so long has been a major distraction for washington .
hussein is suspected of encouraging resistance to the coalition occupation and supporting attacks against american and allied troops . along with a few small arms , sanchez said hussein had around $ 750,000 -lrb- € 611,347 -rrb- in cash with him in the six by eight foot hole .

“ i hope his arrest will aid the efforts of the international community in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq . ” schröder , french president jacques chirac and the leaders of other countries opposed to the war were angered last week when u.s. deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz announced only companies from nations backing washington in iraq would be able to take part in iraqi reconstruction efforts being funded by the u.s. government worth some $ 18.6 billion . wolfowitz said he hoped the action would put pressure on other nations to join the military efforts in iraq , but it has also been criticized as unnecessarily provoking u.s. allies just as washington is looking for greater nato involvement in iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. bars germany , france from iraqi reconstruction contracts the united states said tuesday only companies from countries that supported the war in iraq would be allowed to bid for large reconstruction contracts , effectively excluding firms from war opponents germany and france .

u.s. officials confirmed on sunday they had captured former iraqi dictator saddam hussein near his hometown of tikrit .
sporadic celebratory gunfire was heard across the country as the news filtered out . on the run from u.s.-led coalition forces since the fall of baghdad in april , hussein has been washington ’ s most-wanted member of the iraqi regime .
his arrest will likely be a huge boost to the american occupation , which has had difficulty stabilizing postwar iraq . “ ladies and gentlemen , we got him , ” paul bremer , the u.s. civilian administrator in iraq , told a televised press conference in baghdad . u.s. lt.-gen.
ricardo sanchez said u.s. special forces raided a farm house near tikrit late on saturday .
he said hussein was captured without resistance after being found in a small underground hideout .
sanchez then also showed a video of a bearded and haggard-looking hussein being given a medical exam . " there were no injuries .
not a single shot was fired , " sanchez , the top u.s. general in iraq , told the press conference .
he said he had no idea how long he had been hiding there or whether he had been coordinating opposition to the u.s. occupation from that location . that the 66-year-old former leader had been able to elude u.s. forces for so long has been a major distraction for washington .
hussein is suspected of encouraging resistance to the coalition occupation and supporting attacks against american and allied troops . along with a few small arms , sanchez said hussein had around $ 750,000 -lrb- € 611,347 -rrb- in cash with him in the six by eight foot hole .
he did not say whether anyone had tipped off u.s. forces as to hussein 's location or if anyone would qualify for the $ 25 million bounty washington had placed on his head . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul bremer " this is a great day in iraq 's history .
the tyrant is a prisoner , " said bremer .
" now is the time for all iraqis - arabs and kurds , sunnis , shia , christian and turkmen - to build a prosperous , democratic iraq , at peace with itself and with its neighbors . " european leaders welcome capture british prime minster tony blair was the first western leader to confirm hussein had been taken alive .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday took part in a parliamentary mediation committee meeting in an attempt to keep his economic and welfare reforms on track with a bold new proposal on financing tax cuts . schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens passed labor market reforms and tax cuts in october in the lower house , but the upper house – which represents germany ’ s 16 federal states and is controlled by the conservatives and free-market liberals – rejected them last month .
that ’ s set the stage for a high-stakes legislative poker match that will determine the fate of the biggest reform process in germany in recent history . the mediation committee is charged with hammering out a deal between the lower house , the bundestag , and the upper house , the bundesrat .
schröder , joined by greens leader foreign minister joschka fischer , is hoping to garner the support of the conservatives by offering to finance the € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- tax cuts with less borrowing and a larger share from privatization funds . " the new proposal calls for three-fourths of the costs of the to the federal government being financed without new borrowing , " a government source told the reuters news agency .
" it is conceivable that this could be done with higher privatization revenues . " schröder ’ s decision to personally attend the meeting highlights how important he considers pushing through the reforms before the christmas break .
he has tied his political fate to the so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package of sweeping reforms designed to spark growth and trim the country ’ s bloated welfare state . schröder eager for deal “ i ’ m – as you know – willing to compromise and i expect that from the other side too , ” schröder told journalists on sunday . the two leaders of the conservative opposition , angela merkel from the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and edmund stoiber from the cdu ’ s bavaria sister party the csu , both also attended the meeting sunday .
however , ahead of the meeting it wasn ’ t clear if what schröder was bringing to the negotiating table wouldn ’ t be enough to get the conservatives on board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " we wo n't accept a bad deal , " she said , according to reuters .
" there wo n't be any lousy compromises that only lead to a few days of peace .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday took part in a parliamentary mediation committee meeting in an attempt to keep his economic and welfare reforms on track with a bold new proposal on financing tax cuts . schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens passed labor market reforms and tax cuts in october in the lower house , but the upper house – which represents germany ’ s 16 federal states and is controlled by the conservatives and free-market liberals – rejected them last month .
that ’ s set the stage for a high-stakes legislative poker match that will determine the fate of the biggest reform process in germany in recent history . the mediation committee is charged with hammering out a deal between the lower house , the bundestag , and the upper house , the bundesrat .
schröder , joined by greens leader foreign minister joschka fischer , is hoping to garner the support of the conservatives by offering to finance the € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- tax cuts with less borrowing and a larger share from privatization funds . " the new proposal calls for three-fourths of the costs of the to the federal government being financed without new borrowing , " a government source told the reuters news agency .
" it is conceivable that this could be done with higher privatization revenues . " schröder ’ s decision to personally attend the meeting highlights how important he considers pushing through the reforms before the christmas break .
he has tied his political fate to the so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package of sweeping reforms designed to spark growth and trim the country ’ s bloated welfare state . schröder eager for deal “ i ’ m – as you know – willing to compromise and i expect that from the other side too , ” schröder told journalists on sunday . the two leaders of the conservative opposition , angela merkel from the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and edmund stoiber from the cdu ’ s bavaria sister party the csu , both also attended the meeting sunday .
however , ahead of the meeting it wasn ’ t clear if what schröder was bringing to the negotiating table wouldn ’ t be enough to get the conservatives on board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " we wo n't accept a bad deal , " she said , according to reuters .
" there wo n't be any lousy compromises that only lead to a few days of peace . " while it could appear that the opposition has the upper hand in the talks because of schröder ’ s strong desire for a deal , the conservatives are also aware most germans would be upset if the cdu appeared to block the economic reforms for their own political gain at a time when the country is suffering from low growth and high unemployment . “ a total failure won ’ t happen , ” merkel told the bild am sonntag newspaper . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crucial talks will decide fate of german reforms the german government wednesday began a last ditch effort to pass chancellor schröder ’ s key economic and welfare reforms before christmas .
whether the conservative opposition will back the proposals is far from certain .

u.s. officials confirmed on sunday they had captured former iraqi dictator saddam hussein near his hometown of tikrit .
sporadic celebratory gunfire was heard across the country as the news filtered out . on the run from u.s.-led coalition forces since the fall of baghdad in april , hussein has been washington ’ s most-wanted member of the iraqi regime .
his arrest will likely be a huge boost to the american occupation , which has had difficulty stabilizing postwar iraq . “ ladies and gentlemen , we got him , ” paul bremer , the u.s. civilian administrator in iraq , told a televised press conference in baghdad . u.s. lt.-gen.
ricardo sanchez said u.s. special forces raided a farm house near tikrit late on saturday .
he said hussein was captured without resistance after being found in a small underground hideout .
sanchez then also showed a video of a bearded and haggard-looking hussein being given a medical exam . " there were no injuries .
not a single shot was fired , " sanchez , the top u.s. general in iraq , told the press conference .
he said he had no idea how long he had been hiding there or whether he had been coordinating opposition to the u.s. occupation from that location . that the 66-year-old former leader had been able to elude u.s. forces for so long has been a major distraction for washington .
hussein is suspected of encouraging resistance to the coalition occupation and supporting attacks against american and allied troops . along with a few small arms , sanchez said hussein had around $ 750,000 -lrb- € 611,347 -rrb- in cash with him in the six by eight foot hole .
he did not say whether anyone had tipped off u.s. forces as to hussein 's location or if anyone would qualify for the $ 25 million bounty washington had placed on his head . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul bremer " this is a great day in iraq 's history .
the tyrant is a prisoner , " said bremer .
" now is the time for all iraqis - arabs and kurds , sunnis , shia , christian and turkmen - to build a prosperous , democratic iraq , at peace with itself and with its neighbors . " european leaders welcome capture british prime minster tony blair was the first western leader to confirm hussein had been taken alive .
" this has lifted a shadow from the people of iraq .
saddam will not be returning , " blair said . blair has been the staunchest ally of u.s. president george bush throughout the conflict with iraq , but the leaders of france and germany , both high-profile opponents of the war , also congratulated washington on sunday . “ i was extremely pleased to hear of the capture of saddam hussein and i offer my congratulations on this successful operation , ” german chancellor gerhard schröder said in an official letter to bush .
“ i hope his arrest will aid the efforts of the international community in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq . ” schröder , french president jacques chirac and the leaders of other countries opposed to the war were angered last week when u.s. deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz announced only companies from nations backing washington in iraq would be able to take part in iraqi reconstruction efforts being funded by the u.s. government worth some $ 18.6 billion . wolfowitz said he hoped the action would put pressure on other nations to join the military efforts in iraq , but it has also been criticized as unnecessarily provoking u.s. allies just as washington is looking for greater nato involvement in iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. bars germany , france from iraqi reconstruction contracts the united states said tuesday only companies from countries that supported the war in iraq would be allowed to bid for large reconstruction contracts , effectively excluding firms from war opponents germany and france .

the panther interface gets back to basics the result is a new front end and some very solid unix technology under the bonnet .
mac os 10.3 or panther is more stable , more capable and more adaptable than any macintosh operating system before it .
in march 2001 apple 's os went from version nine to 10 , considered the company 's most important upgrade .
os9 was proprietary and developed independently by apple based on a graphical user interface that xerox had devised and dismissed in the 1970s .
ironically osx was designed to be a cutting-edge platform for a new century , but apple programmers went backwards before going forwards , using unix as a starting point .
" osx is based now on pure solid unix , " said leonard shostak , of l & d computer consulting , " a really old , tried and tested operating system that is accepted by most major corporations , especially financial institutions . "
tinkering away the initial release of osx was considered incomplete , but in under three years the progress leading to panther has been dramatic .
experts say apple 's way of working ensures a better end result than their competitors .
" apple has always depended on the cleverness of its users to add new software , new features which they have done with relish , " said computer scientist george otto .
apple is hoping to tempt more people to use macs " sometimes there is a problem .
there are so many things that they do , that they step on each others ' toes but that has continued even with osx .
" microsoft has always made it very difficult for people to get in and do things .
they hide the operating system 's features , it is difficult to know how things work and they do n't encourage people getting in and making a lot of modifications . "
that is not to say apple does not make slip-ups along the way .
panther , for example , makes some subtle changes to the once sugary aqua interface .
indeed apple ceo steve jobs called an earlier version " lickable " , a word not normally embraced by techies .
" the panther interface gets back down to the basic look that we associate with the mac os and i think it was apple being responsive , " said matthew rothenberg , managing editor of eweek.com.
" aqua was very pretty , but i think the comfort level was a little bit off for some of these long time mac users . "
crossover potential but apple is not shy about using good ideas from other sources .
panther 's dock for example resembles the microsoft windows taskbar , but apple 's version is more stylish and fun .
panther is based on unix programming of course both oss inspire each other .
windows 95 used the macintosh folders idea and windows xp became very aqua soon after the release of osx .
the unix bedrock has also attracted more and more software developers to the mac platform , like scott lopatin who wrote a new blogging tool called sparkpod .
" mac osx is attractive to developers because they can access not only the core programming languages but also the large selection of unix libraries that are available , " he said .
sparkpod was written entirely with apple web tools , but the majority of its users will undoubtedly access it from a windows machine .
apple needs to increase its small market share and is trying to get windows users to switch to panther .
in the last year or so , steve jobs has dropped some bait that windows fans have gobbled up .
a clear symbol of the crossover that apple has used to its advantage with incredible success is the ipod , an mp3 player that works seamlessly with itunes software , now available on both platforms .
the hope is that as more and more windows users see how easy itunes is to use , they may take a long hard look at panther and decide to drop windows completely .

panther is based on unix programming of course both oss inspire each other .
windows 95 used the macintosh folders idea and windows xp became very aqua soon after the release of osx .
the unix bedrock has also attracted more and more software developers to the mac platform , like scott lopatin who wrote a new blogging tool called sparkpod .
" mac osx is attractive to developers because they can access not only the core programming languages but also the large selection of unix libraries that are available , " he said .
sparkpod was written entirely with apple web tools , but the majority of its users will undoubtedly access it from a windows machine .
apple needs to increase its small market share and is trying to get windows users to switch to panther .
in the last year or so , steve jobs has dropped some bait that windows fans have gobbled up .
a clear symbol of the crossover that apple has used to its advantage with incredible success is the ipod , an mp3 player that works seamlessly with itunes software , now available on both platforms .
the hope is that as more and more windows users see how easy itunes is to use , they may take a long hard look at panther and decide to drop windows completely .

the panther interface gets back to basics the result is a new front end and some very solid unix technology under the bonnet .
mac os 10.3 or panther is more stable , more capable and more adaptable than any macintosh operating system before it .
in march 2001 apple 's os went from version nine to 10 , considered the company 's most important upgrade .
os9 was proprietary and developed independently by apple based on a graphical user interface that xerox had devised and dismissed in the 1970s .
ironically osx was designed to be a cutting-edge platform for a new century , but apple programmers went backwards before going forwards , using unix as a starting point .
" osx is based now on pure solid unix , " said leonard shostak , of l & d computer consulting , " a really old , tried and tested operating system that is accepted by most major corporations , especially financial institutions . "
tinkering away the initial release of osx was considered incomplete , but in under three years the progress leading to panther has been dramatic .
experts say apple 's way of working ensures a better end result than their competitors .
" apple has always depended on the cleverness of its users to add new software , new features which they have done with relish , " said computer scientist george otto .
apple is hoping to tempt more people to use macs " sometimes there is a problem .
there are so many things that they do , that they step on each others ' toes but that has continued even with osx .
" microsoft has always made it very difficult for people to get in and do things .
they hide the operating system 's features , it is difficult to know how things work and they do n't encourage people getting in and making a lot of modifications . "
that is not to say apple does not make slip-ups along the way .
panther , for example , makes some subtle changes to the once sugary aqua interface .
indeed apple ceo steve jobs called an earlier version " lickable " , a word not normally embraced by techies .
" the panther interface gets back down to the basic look that we associate with the mac os and i think it was apple being responsive , " said matthew rothenberg , managing editor of eweek.com.
" aqua was very pretty , but i think the comfort level was a little bit off for some of these long time mac users . "

the panther interface gets back to basics the result is a new front end and some very solid unix technology under the bonnet .
mac os 10.3 or panther is more stable , more capable and more adaptable than any macintosh operating system before it .
in march 2001 apple 's os went from version nine to 10 , considered the company 's most important upgrade .
os9 was proprietary and developed independently by apple based on a graphical user interface that xerox had devised and dismissed in the 1970s .
ironically osx was designed to be a cutting-edge platform for a new century , but apple programmers went backwards before going forwards , using unix as a starting point .
" osx is based now on pure solid unix , " said leonard shostak , of l & d computer consulting , " a really old , tried and tested operating system that is accepted by most major corporations , especially financial institutions . "
tinkering away the initial release of osx was considered incomplete , but in under three years the progress leading to panther has been dramatic .
experts say apple 's way of working ensures a better end result than their competitors .
" apple has always depended on the cleverness of its users to add new software , new features which they have done with relish , " said computer scientist george otto .
apple is hoping to tempt more people to use macs " sometimes there is a problem .
there are so many things that they do , that they step on each others ' toes but that has continued even with osx .
" microsoft has always made it very difficult for people to get in and do things .
they hide the operating system 's features , it is difficult to know how things work and they do n't encourage people getting in and making a lot of modifications . "
that is not to say apple does not make slip-ups along the way .
panther , for example , makes some subtle changes to the once sugary aqua interface .
indeed apple ceo steve jobs called an earlier version " lickable " , a word not normally embraced by techies .
" the panther interface gets back down to the basic look that we associate with the mac os and i think it was apple being responsive , " said matthew rothenberg , managing editor of eweek.com.
" aqua was very pretty , but i think the comfort level was a little bit off for some of these long time mac users . "
crossover potential but apple is not shy about using good ideas from other sources .
panther 's dock for example resembles the microsoft windows taskbar , but apple 's version is more stylish and fun .
panther is based on unix programming of course both oss inspire each other .
windows 95 used the macintosh folders idea and windows xp became very aqua soon after the release of osx .
the unix bedrock has also attracted more and more software developers to the mac platform , like scott lopatin who wrote a new blogging tool called sparkpod .
" mac osx is attractive to developers because they can access not only the core programming languages but also the large selection of unix libraries that are available , " he said .
sparkpod was written entirely with apple web tools , but the majority of its users will undoubtedly access it from a windows machine .
apple needs to increase its small market share and is trying to get windows users to switch to panther .
in the last year or so , steve jobs has dropped some bait that windows fans have gobbled up .

despite the early loss of one of its lasers ; the ice , cloud and land elevation satellite , -lrb- icesat -rrb- is beaming home high-resolution measurements of polar ice and sea ice elevation as well as the stratification of clouds and aerosols .
the instrument sends out pulses in two " colours " - green for the atmospheric properties and infrared for the ice altimetry .
the eventual result is a 3d map of the earth 's surface .
up to now climate scientists have had only spotty measurements of the height of the remote ice sheets .
" it 's the difference between looking down at the tops of buildings and seeing them flat , and then discovering how high the buildings are , " said jay zwally , icesat project scientist from nasa goddard at the fall meeting of the american geophysical union in san francisco .
into a third dimension the satellite data will help scientists determine just how the earth 's ice sheets are changing and what this may mean for global sea level .
the greenland and antarctic ice sheets cover 10 % of earth 's land area .
even a small variation in their average thickness affects sea level , but glaciologists do not even know whether these massive blocks of ice are expanding or shrinking .
their vast size makes accurate ground measurements impossible . "
when you saw -lsb- the first measurements -rsb- you knew right away you were seeing something that would revolutionize the way we study ice sheets " bob schutz knowing their height - the antarctic ice sheet is more than 4,000 metres high at its tallest - allows scientists to calculate total ice mass and how it changes with time .
" we know a lot about the earth in two-dimensions , " said nasa programme scientist waleed abdalati .
" but the major challenge is the vertical dimension . "
this comes from the craft 's single scientific instrument , the geoscience laser altimeter system -lrb- glas -rrb- which sweeps over the earth in a near pole-to-pole orbit , measuring the brief period it takes a light pulse to travel to earth and bounce back .
nasa 's ' shooting star ' as the earth rotates beneath the spacecraft , the resulting crisscross pattern is a bit like winding a ball of string , with the greatest coverage at the high latitudes .
stargazers may catch the green pulse of the laser - the infrared is invisible - as the spacecraft arcs through the sky .
the laser is safe on the eyes , but you have to be in just the right place and know just when to look to catch it .
" people think it 's a shooting star , " said dr abdalati .
while the space shuttle also used laser altimetry to measure topography it was lower in resolution , not as accurate and did not cover the poles .
glas is the first satellite laser altimeter to be used to measure ice mass balance and its 15-centimetre accuracy is unprecedented .
this will help scientists determine exactly how much melting has occurred in areas where previous surveys reveal significant ice loss .
aircraft measurements show increased melting at the edges of the greenland ice sheet and satellite radar has revealed a thinning in the west antarctic ice sheet that scientists believe is contributing to sea level rise .
part-time mission the first few months of icesat operation have provided measurements and surface details that were never before visible from space .
" when you saw them you knew right away you were seeing something that would revolutionize the way we study ice sheets , " said bob schutz , the leader of the glas science team .
this is good news from a mission that suffered a disappointment early this year . "
we 're seeing megadunes on the surface of antarctica that ripple " waleed abdalati a little more than a month after the spacecraft 's launch from vandenberg air force base in california in january , one its three lasers failed .
scientists found a fault in the photo-diode , which pumps the light into the lasing rod .
while the two remaining lasers are working fine , scientists are running them in intervals rather than continuously to maximize their lifetime .
this will reduce the mission somewhat , said dr zwally , but still provide scientists with unprecedented ice measurements .
which include a close-up of polar ice dynamics .
who knew the ice sheet was so busy ...
" we 're seeing megadunes on the surface of antarctica that ripple ... ice falls where the ice dips sharply down ... and the shear margins of ice streams where fast streams and slow-moving ice lie adjacent to each other , " said dr abdalati .
he said the 3d images would help scientists understand the mechanics of ice flow and how flow patterns change .
climate uncertainty icesat is also providing a new look into activity above the ice with 3d maps of cloud and aerosol layering .
" we can see the atmosphere in a way we have n't before , " said jim spinhirne , senior scientist at nasa goddard , who showed the first 3d images of the " brown cloud " of pollution over india and dust over iran .
he said that the effect of aerosols on radiation and clouds is the largest current uncertainly in global warming .
clouds are important in climate change because they trap sunlight .
aerosols are highly variable - carbon soot absorbs heat and warms the earth while the natural aerosols such as sulphates reflect heat and cool it .
it is not clear what their overall contribution is to climate change .
the icesat mission is scheduled to continue for another 2-4 years .
scientists hope new laser-altimeter missions will follow .
europe will launch its own version of icesat next year called cryosat .
cryosat is a radar altimetry mission .

despite the early loss of one of its lasers ; the ice , cloud and land elevation satellite , -lrb- icesat -rrb- is beaming home high-resolution measurements of polar ice and sea ice elevation as well as the stratification of clouds and aerosols .
the instrument sends out pulses in two " colours " - green for the atmospheric properties and infrared for the ice altimetry .
the eventual result is a 3d map of the earth 's surface .
up to now climate scientists have had only spotty measurements of the height of the remote ice sheets .
" it 's the difference between looking down at the tops of buildings and seeing them flat , and then discovering how high the buildings are , " said jay zwally , icesat project scientist from nasa goddard at the fall meeting of the american geophysical union in san francisco .
into a third dimension the satellite data will help scientists determine just how the earth 's ice sheets are changing and what this may mean for global sea level .
the greenland and antarctic ice sheets cover 10 % of earth 's land area .
even a small variation in their average thickness affects sea level , but glaciologists do not even know whether these massive blocks of ice are expanding or shrinking .
their vast size makes accurate ground measurements impossible .
when you saw -lsb- the first measurements -rsb- you knew right away you were seeing something that would revolutionise the way we study ice sheets bob schutz knowing their height - the antarctic ice sheet is more than 4,000 metres high at its tallest - allows scientists to calculate total ice mass and how it changes with time .
" we know a lot about the earth in two-dimensions , " said nasa programme scientist waleed abdalati .
" but the major challenge is the vertical dimension . "
this comes from the craft 's single scientific instrument , the geoscience laser altimeter system -lrb- glas -rrb- which sweeps over the earth in a near pole-to-pole orbit , measuring the brief period it takes a light pulse to travel to earth and bounce back .
nasa 's ' shooting star ' as the earth rotates beneath the spacecraft , the resulting crisscross pattern is a bit like winding a ball of string , with the greatest coverage at the high latitudes .
stargazers may catch the green pulse of the laser - the infrared is invisible - as the spacecraft arcs through the sky .
the laser is safe on the eyes , but you have to be in just the right place and know just when to look to catch it .
" people think it 's a shooting star , " said dr abdalati .
ice cover plays a crucial role in the earth 's climate system while the space shuttle also used laser altimetry to measure topography it was lower in resolution , not as accurate and did not cover the poles .
glas is the first satellite laser altimeter to be used to measure ice mass balance and its 15-centimetre accuracy is unprecedented .
this will help scientists determine exactly how much melting has occurred in areas where previous surveys reveal significant ice loss .
aircraft measurements show increased melting at the edges of the greenland ice sheet and satellite radar has revealed a thinning in the west antarctic ice sheet that scientists believe is contributing to sea level rise .
part-time mission the first few months of icesat operation have provided measurements and surface details that were never before visible from space .
" when you saw them you knew right away you were seeing something that would revolutionise the way we study ice sheets , " said bob schutz , the leader of the glas science team .
this is good news from a mission that suffered a disappointment early this year .
we 're seeing megadunes on the surface of antarctica that ripple waleed abdalati a little more than a month after the spacecraft 's launch from vandenberg air force base in california in january , one its three lasers failed .
scientists found a fault in the photo-diode , which pumps the light into the lasing rod .
while the two remaining lasers are working fine , scientists are running them in intervals rather than continuously to maximize their lifetime .
this will reduce the mission somewhat , said dr zwally , but still provide scientists with unprecedented ice measurements .

david and ozlem grimason will travel to ankara on tuesday and meet deniz baykal of the chp party .
mr baykal has said he intends to pass on the petition to turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
two-year-old alistair , from east kilbride , was hit by a stray bullet when a gunfight broke out in the city of izmir in july .
since their son 's death , mr and mrs grimason have collected 150,000 signatures for their petition and are confident of forcing a change in gun policy .
last thursday , daimi akyuz went on trial accused of killing alistair and murdering a man during the fracas .
david and ozlem grimason will deliver the petition mr akyuz , 32 , said he had been in the cafe in foca with several other men and drew a gun with the intention of shooting a man who had insulted him .
his hand was allegedly grabbed and the bullets went astray .
it was one of those bullets which hit the scottish toddler .

it had been suggested earlier that an in-car satellite tracking system could bill drivers for school runs and travelling on motorways at rush hour .
but a government adviser quoted in the sunday mirror said there would be variable charging on all roads .
the newspaper said charges could be offset by reductions in road tax and petrol duty .
professor david begg was told by transport secretary alistair darling to lead a committee to establish how a national congestion charging scheme would work .
they do n't like it because they do n't think it will work , they do n't like the infringement of their liberties and they think it will cost a fortune to set up paul watters aa the mirror said the cost of travelling would be as low as 1.6p a mile in quiet rural areas to 16p on the most expensive routes .
the scheme would require expensive satellite-tracking equipment to be fitted in all cars .
professor begg said : " it is now a matter of when , not if .
six months ago it was on the shelf , but mr darling is now very serious about it .
" the government has realised that there is only one way to reduce congestion and that does not mean trying to build a way out of it . "
the government-appointed committee , which includes industry representatives , is due to report back next year .
professor begg said the scheme could reduce congestion by 30 % and pollution by 40 % .
the first toll motorway , part of the m6 , opened this week , but had been billed as a one-off .
in june , mr darling said a national toll scheme based on satellite tracking could be a decade away , although lorries will be monitored under the scheme from 2006 .
his proposals to charge school run parents and motorway users at peak times were criticised by motoring groups .
they said motorists would only accept new charges that were " revenue neutral " , with the government reducing other charges correspondingly so that no extra money was made .
last year , the government predicted traffic jams could increase by up to a fifth by the end of the decade .
proper safeguards the success of the congestion charge in reducing traffic in london has led to some commentators saying it is inevitable that some form of charging will be introduced nationwide .
edmund king , of the rac , said charges on every road were neither acceptable nor practical , but that with proper safeguards , charges on the busiest 10 % of roads would be welcome .
the aa motoring trust warned satellite tracking was the most unpopular form of charging .
spokesman paul watters said : " they do n't like it because they do n't think it will work , they do n't like the infringement of their liberties and they think it will cost a fortune to set up .
" people can understand city charging like in london .
they can understand french motorways , where you pay for a premium service .
they can probably get to understand the m6 toll .

there is a lot of work to be done before people are convinced . "

recommendations have been made to develop a midwife-led birth centre , without consultants and doctors , at neath port talbot hospital in baglan .
the £ 64m hospital , which opened last november , has had to temporarily close its maternity unit a number of times because it has been unable to recruit enough medical staff .
opponents of the idea held a protest march in october , claiming the switch would mean many mothers would have to travel to swansea or bridgend to give birth .
before i accept this advice , i want to have a full discussion with the local health board on the questions that we as a council have asked noel crowley a review group set up by neath port talbot local health board - which replaced the health authority for the area - has recommended the downgrading move for the hospital which was built under a private-finance scheme .
at a meeting on friday , it concluded " the current service could not realistically be sustained and the development of a mid-wife led birth centre would be the best way forward for women and babies in neath port talbot . "
but noel crowley , who leads neath port talbot council , said it is unacceptable for a new hospital , which offers first-class facilities in all other services , to be able to offer only a second-class maternity service .
around 100 people protested in october at the downgrading plans on saturday , he told bbc wales the local authority wants to know why consultants in the maternity units at singleton hospital in swansea and princess of wales hospital in bridgend can not be used to cover the hospital at baglan .
he said : " i can understand the position that the review group is in but there is spare capacity in swansea and there is spare capacity in bridgend so why ca n't these consultants be better used to service this hospital ?
" who has looked into the situation of the undercapacity in the hospitals either side of us .
" over 3,000 births used to take place in singleton , they are now down to 2,200 .
what 's happened to all these consultants ?
why ca n't they be better used to service this hospital ?
" before i accept this advice , i want to have a full discussion with the local health board on the questions that we as a council have asked .
" if they can satisfy the questions , about capacity and various other issues , then , of course , a safe service is what we want . "
' not sustainable ' katie norman , chief executive of the local health board , defended the review group 's recommendation .
she said : " the trust concerned had been working extemely hard over the last few months to sustain the service but there have been a number of occasions where medical staff have not been available and the unit has had to close at short notice .
" i think that the review group feels that is not a sustainable position and because of changes to work forces in the future , particularly of medical staff , the review group concluded that that position is unlikely to change . "

' not sustainable ' katie norman , chief executive of the local health board , defended the review group 's recommendation .
she said : " the trust concerned had been working extemely hard over the last few months to sustain the service but there have been a number of occasions where medical staff have not been available and the unit has had to close at short notice .
" i think that the review group feels that is not a sustainable position and because of changes to work forces in the future , particularly of medical staff , the review group concluded that that position is unlikely to change . "
