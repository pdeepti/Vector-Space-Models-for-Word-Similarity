monday 's nato meeting in washington will likely cover europe 's role in postwar iraq and gave germany 's defense minister the chance to bring u.s.-american relations back on track . germany ’ s defense minister traveled to washington on monday for a nato conference , the first time a member of gerhard schröder ’ s cabinet has set foot on american soil since the fall of saddam hussein ’ s regime . peter struck ’ s trip marks the beginning of what is to become a flurry of diplomatic activity on the transatlantic front to sort out international participation in the security of iraq . two other foreign policy experts , from the german foreign ministry and chancellery , are also currently in washington . the united states and britain , who together sent more than 300,000 soldiers to war , now want other nations to pick up security duties as they reduce their presence in iraq .
denmark and poland have already committed soldiers to a planned security force , which so far is without a un or nato mandate .
germany might be asked to as well .
struck has , until now , refused to comment on possible german involvement in a postwar stabilization force in iraq .
his boss , chancellor gerhard schröder , has joined other european leaders in insisting the united nations must play a strong role in postwar iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schröder und us-präsident george w. bush auf dem nato-gipfel in prag -lrb- 21.11.2002 -rrb- schröder and u.s. president george w. bush have not spoken since schröder ’ s phone call to the white house shortly after his election victory last november .
the chancellor ’ s vehement anti-war stance angered washington officials , who felt betrayed by one of their historical allies . defense summit aftermath the washington meeting is scheduled to focus on the ukraine ’ s alliance with nato member nations , but a possible topic will also likely be a recent meeting between four eu nations on setting up a european defense force .
the mini-summit between belgium , france , luxembourg and germany last week was heavily criticized by other european nations including great britain and spain , which fear it could weaken nato . the four , all against the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , restated at the mini-summit an already agreed-upon european pledge to set up a strong european rapid reaction force .
a belgian proposal to set up a separate european command headquarters in brussels , independent of nato , was greeted cooly by france and germany , who didn ’ t want to anger pro-nato washington any further . in a chat with reporters on sunday before his u.s. trip , struck said he would assure his counterpart , u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld , that the summit ’ s goal was nothing more than to “ build-up and strengthen the european arrows in nato . ” friendly chat with rumsfeld after meeting with rumsfeld monday afternoon , struck said the two talked in a " friendly atmosphere . "
he remained tight-lipped about details of the discussion , saying only that there were no " concrete requests " from the united states on germany 's possible security role in postwar iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense secretary donald rumsfeld , left , points to members of the press near the conculsion of a joint news conference with german defense minister peter struck , right , at the pentagon friday , nov .

-lrb- ap photo / pablo martinez monsivais -rrb- rumsfeld and struck have had an up-and-down relationship since struck took over the minister ’ s post in august 2002 .
at struck ’ s first international meeting , a nato summit in prague in september , rumsfeld pointedly refused contact with his german counterpart , referring to him as “ that man . ” two months later , with struck in washington , the two were on better terms .
joking with reporters at a joint press conference , rumsfeld declared ties between germany and the u.s. as “ unpoisoned . ”
struck heralded “ a new beginning in cooperation . ” in january , as the diplomatic fight to head off war in iraq split the u.s. with traditional allies france and germany , rumsfeld gruffly dismissed the two anti-war nations as “ old europe . ”
a few weeks later , when asked in a congressional hearing who refused to provide any aid to a u.s. invasion of iraq , rumsfeld replied : “ libya , cuba , germany : ” the comments caused a stir in germany . struck waxes optimistic following the coalition forces ’ quick victory in iraq , struck said he was optimistic the u.s.-german relationship would return to normal . should he get a meeting with rumsfeld , he said ” i think we would take care of that in five minutes , ” he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world -pipe- 06.05.2003 green point gets results , but trouble lurks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a symbol of recycling in germany germany 's biggest recycling enterprise says more packaging is being used over again in the country , but warns that a new mandatory can deposit law could imperil its success . germany 's long tradition of environmental consciousness precedes the success of the greens , the eco-friendly political party that became a part of the government in 1998 and brought a slew of earth-friendly legislation with it .
as far back as 1990 , the duales system deutschland -lrb- dsd -rrb- was set up as a private limited company to organize recycling of packaging materials in germany .
companies that are members of the non-profit dual system distinguish their packaging with the " green dot " - the " dual " standing for a second system operating parallel to municipal waste collection and disposal .
in its 10th annual report issued on monday , the dual system for collection , sorting and recycling of sales packaging for 2002 recorded a slight increase in comparison to the previous year - with a total of 31 thousand additional tons adding to a total 6.32 million tons .
hans-peter repnik , ceo of duales system , said the numbers speak for themselves , adding : " we will continue to develop the ecological and economic efficiencies of packaging recycling . "
three yellow bags for 24 hours of power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-peter repnik , ceo dual system in terms of recycling , german consumers are as conscientious as they come .
they separate glass and paper - and packaging distinguished with the " green dot " goes in a yellow container that is then taken away by collectors contracted by the duales system .
municipal garbage collectors take care of anything that 's left over .
it may be complicated , but at monday 's press conference , duales system 's repnik said it was worth it .
" three yellow bags save as much power as a household uses in 24 hours , " he maintained .
" every individual packaging represents a quantifiable contribution to preserving the environment .
the green dot system does appear to be effective .
sixty-seven billion megajoules of primary energy were saved last year , and 1.5 million tons less climate-damaging green-house gases emitted .
that 's more than a bus would use to travel three times to the sun and back - and the amount driven by all the buses of the rhine-ruhr public transport system over six years .
can deposit threatens recycling profits but there is trouble on the horizon for the popular system . repnik said he is concerned that germany 's controversial new mandatory deposit system on cans and some other beverage packaging could dampen the success of the green dot program .
the new system , he noted , means that high quality materials that could be recycled at low cost are no longer processed by the dual system .
dsd finances itself chiefly through sales of recycled material and fees paid by manufacturers for packaging materials .
any products removed from its recycling portfolio will result in diminished revenues .
and with € 1.9 billion in reported revenues in 2001 , we 're not talking about chump change here .
dsd officials predict the company will dispose of some 650,000 tons less packaging this year due to the law , resulting in a loss as great as € 300-400 million -lrb- $ 340-453 million -rrb- .
" we are therefore faced with the challenge , despite the worsened framework in which we have to operate , of further enhancing the overall environmental performance of the system , " he said .
" this we will do through the adoption of new working practices and technologies . "
at the end of the day , the system will be made or broken by the commitment of the german people .

as far back as 1990 , the duales system deutschland -lrb- dsd -rrb- was set up as a private limited company to organize recycling of packaging materials in germany .
companies that are members of the non-profit dual system distinguish their packaging with the " green dot " - the " dual " standing for a second system operating parallel to municipal waste collection and disposal .
in its 10th annual report issued on monday , the dual system for collection , sorting and recycling of sales packaging for 2002 recorded a slight increase in comparison to the previous year - with a total of 31 thousand additional tons adding to a total 6.32 million tons .
hans-peter repnik , ceo of duales system , said the numbers speak for themselves , adding : " we will continue to develop the ecological and economic efficiencies of packaging recycling . "
three yellow bags for 24 hours of power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-peter repnik , ceo dual system in terms of recycling , german consumers are as conscientious as they come .
they separate glass and paper - and packaging distinguished with the " green dot " goes in a yellow container that is then taken away by collectors contracted by the duales system .
municipal garbage collectors take care of anything that 's left over .
it may be complicated , but at monday 's press conference , duales system 's repnik said it was worth it .
" three yellow bags save as much power as a household uses in 24 hours , " he maintained .
" every individual packaging represents a quantifiable contribution to preserving the environment .
the green dot system does appear to be effective .
sixty-seven billion megajoules of primary energy were saved last year , and 1.5 million tons less climate-damaging green-house gases emitted .
that 's more than a bus would use to travel three times to the sun and back - and the amount driven by all the buses of the rhine-ruhr public transport system over six years .
can deposit threatens recycling profits but there is trouble on the horizon for the popular system . repnik said he is concerned that germany 's controversial new mandatory deposit system on cans and some other beverage packaging could dampen the success of the green dot program .
the new system , he noted , means that high quality materials that could be recycled at low cost are no longer processed by the dual system .
dsd finances itself chiefly through sales of recycled material and fees paid by manufacturers for packaging materials .
any products removed from its recycling portfolio will result in diminished revenues .
and with € 1.9 billion in reported revenues in 2001 , we 're not talking about chump change here .
dsd officials predict the company will dispose of some 650,000 tons less packaging this year due to the law , resulting in a loss as great as € 300-400 million -lrb- $ 340-453 million -rrb- .
" we are therefore faced with the challenge , despite the worsened framework in which we have to operate , of further enhancing the overall environmental performance of the system , " he said .
" this we will do through the adoption of new working practices and technologies . "
at the end of the day , the system will be made or broken by the commitment of the german people .

the trial of italy 's prime minister comes under the scope of europe 's editorial pages - and most conclude that he 'll get off scott free - even if , as some papers allude , he deserves to be convicted . the corruption trial of italian prime minister silvio berlusconi attracted the attention of many european opinion writers on tuesday .
spain ’ s el pais warns that all italians can fear for their democracy if berlusconi has his way in court .

berlusconi ’ s advisors are working to restore immunity for the state ’ s most-powerful politicians , and the paper predicts that there ’ ll be nothing to stop them from getting such a law passed .
" wiser , but not always right , " comments the london times on the occasion of prime minister tony blair ’ s 50th birthday .

the paper says that while there are doubts about the labour party , support for blair ’ s leadership has rarely been stronger .
this , despite charges that blair has become distant from domestic affairs and obsessed with international matters .
the times says it ’ s hardly surprising that the wider world has come to dominate his agenda , writing : " the prime minister intuitively appreciated from the second he was informed of the events of sept .
11 that a fundamental shift in american foreign policy would be forthcoming . "
and on the topic of the subsequent tightening of relations between america and britain , the paper says that while there is much bush and blair disagree on over domestic policy , this is of no consequence for the conduct of diplomacy .
the german paper dresdner neueste nachrichten is critical of germany 's currently poor relations with the u.s. the paper says a sulking chancellor gerhard schröder should now take a cue from defense minister peter struck and visit washington to ease tensions over iraq .
the paper comments : " even though the u.s. defied international law by invading iraq they did remove a terrible dictator .
and if the u.n. can return to iraq , berlin must do everything to improve relations and support the reconstruction and rebuilding of democracy in the war-torn country . "
commenting on schröder 's planned social and economic reforms , berlin 's die welt writes : " despite warnings by the social democrats that the coalition could collapse if the reforms are not accepted , the opposition shouldn ’ t get too excited .
the coalition is not dead yet .
and now that the opposition has released its reform agenda , the social democrats can make the case that with a change in government , things would only get worse .

monday 's nato meeting in washington will likely cover europe 's role in postwar iraq and gave germany 's defense minister the chance to bring u.s.-american relations back on track . germany ’ s defense minister traveled to washington on monday for a nato conference , the first time a member of gerhard schröder ’ s cabinet has set foot on american soil since the fall of saddam hussein ’ s regime . peter struck ’ s trip marks the beginning of what is to become a flurry of diplomatic activity on the transatlantic front to sort out international participation in the security of iraq . two other foreign policy experts , from the german foreign ministry and chancellery , are also currently in washington . the united states and britain , who together sent more than 300,000 soldiers to war , now want other nations to pick up security duties as they reduce their presence in iraq .
denmark and poland have already committed soldiers to a planned security force , which so far is without a un or nato mandate .
germany might be asked to as well .
struck has , until now , refused to comment on possible german involvement in a postwar stabilization force in iraq .
his boss , chancellor gerhard schröder , has joined other european leaders in insisting the united nations must play a strong role in postwar iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schröder und us-präsident george w. bush auf dem nato-gipfel in prag -lrb- 21.11.2002 -rrb- schröder and u.s. president george w. bush have not spoken since schröder ’ s phone call to the white house shortly after his election victory last november .
the chancellor ’ s vehement anti-war stance angered washington officials , who felt betrayed by one of their historical allies . defense summit aftermath the washington meeting is scheduled to focus on the ukraine ’ s alliance with nato member nations , but a possible topic will also likely be a recent meeting between four eu nations on setting up a european defense force .
the mini-summit between belgium , france , luxembourg and germany last week was heavily criticized by other european nations including great britain and spain , which fear it could weaken nato . the four , all against the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , restated at the mini-summit an already agreed-upon european pledge to set up a strong european rapid reaction force .
a belgian proposal to set up a separate european command headquarters in brussels , independent of nato , was greeted cooly by france and germany , who didn ’ t want to anger pro-nato washington any further . in a chat with reporters on sunday before his u.s. trip , struck said he would assure his counterpart , u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld , that the summit ’ s goal was nothing more than to “ build-up and strengthen the european arrows in nato . ” friendly chat with rumsfeld after meeting with rumsfeld monday afternoon , struck said the two talked in a " friendly atmosphere .

joking with reporters at a joint press conference , rumsfeld declared ties between germany and the u.s. as “ unpoisoned . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world -pipe- 06.05.2003 green point gets results , but trouble lurks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a symbol of recycling in germany germany 's biggest recycling enterprise says more packaging is being used over again in the country , but warns that a new mandatory can deposit law could imperil its success . germany 's long tradition of environmental consciousness precedes the success of the greens , the eco-friendly political party that became a part of the government in 1998 and brought a slew of earth-friendly legislation with it .
as far back as 1990 , the duales system deutschland -lrb- dsd -rrb- was set up as a private limited company to organize recycling of packaging materials in germany .
companies that are members of the non-profit dual system distinguish their packaging with the " green dot " - the " dual " standing for a second system operating parallel to municipal waste collection and disposal .
in its 10th annual report issued on monday , the dual system for collection , sorting and recycling of sales packaging for 2002 recorded a slight increase in comparison to the previous year - with a total of 31 thousand additional tons adding to a total 6.32 million tons .
hans-peter repnik , ceo of duales system , said the numbers speak for themselves , adding : " we will continue to develop the ecological and economic efficiencies of packaging recycling . "
three yellow bags for 24 hours of power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-peter repnik , ceo dual system in terms of recycling , german consumers are as conscientious as they come .
they separate glass and paper - and packaging distinguished with the " green dot " goes in a yellow container that is then taken away by collectors contracted by the duales system .
municipal garbage collectors take care of anything that 's left over .
it may be complicated , but at monday 's press conference , duales system 's repnik said it was worth it .
" three yellow bags save as much power as a household uses in 24 hours , " he maintained .
" every individual packaging represents a quantifiable contribution to preserving the environment .
the green dot system does appear to be effective .
sixty-seven billion megajoules of primary energy were saved last year , and 1.5 million tons less climate-damaging green-house gases emitted .
that 's more than a bus would use to travel three times to the sun and back - and the amount driven by all the buses of the rhine-ruhr public transport system over six years .
can deposit threatens recycling profits but there is trouble on the horizon for the popular system . repnik said he is concerned that germany 's controversial new mandatory deposit system on cans and some other beverage packaging could dampen the success of the green dot program .
the new system , he noted , means that high quality materials that could be recycled at low cost are no longer processed by the dual system .
dsd finances itself chiefly through sales of recycled material and fees paid by manufacturers for packaging materials .
any products removed from its recycling portfolio will result in diminished revenues .
and with € 1.9 billion in reported revenues in 2001 , we 're not talking about chump change here .
dsd officials predict the company will dispose of some 650,000 tons less packaging this year due to the law , resulting in a loss as great as € 300-400 million -lrb- $ 340-453 million -rrb- .
" we are therefore faced with the challenge , despite the worsened framework in which we have to operate , of further enhancing the overall environmental performance of the system , " he said .
" this we will do through the adoption of new working practices and technologies . "
at the end of the day , the system will be made or broken by the commitment of the german people .
" change can only happen with our citizens ' help - and their willingness to separate their garbage on a daily basis , " repnik stressed .
" this is a major factor in conserving our resources .

as far back as 1990 , the duales system deutschland -lrb- dsd -rrb- was set up as a private limited company to organize recycling of packaging materials in germany .
companies that are members of the non-profit dual system distinguish their packaging with the " green dot " - the " dual " standing for a second system operating parallel to municipal waste collection and disposal .
in its 10th annual report issued on monday , the dual system for collection , sorting and recycling of sales packaging for 2002 recorded a slight increase in comparison to the previous year - with a total of 31 thousand additional tons adding to a total 6.32 million tons .
hans-peter repnik , ceo of duales system , said the numbers speak for themselves , adding : " we will continue to develop the ecological and economic efficiencies of packaging recycling . "
three yellow bags for 24 hours of power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-peter repnik , ceo dual system in terms of recycling , german consumers are as conscientious as they come .
they separate glass and paper - and packaging distinguished with the " green dot " goes in a yellow container that is then taken away by collectors contracted by the duales system .
municipal garbage collectors take care of anything that 's left over .
it may be complicated , but at monday 's press conference , duales system 's repnik said it was worth it .
" three yellow bags save as much power as a household uses in 24 hours , " he maintained .
" every individual packaging represents a quantifiable contribution to preserving the environment .
the green dot system does appear to be effective .
sixty-seven billion megajoules of primary energy were saved last year , and 1.5 million tons less climate-damaging green-house gases emitted .
that 's more than a bus would use to travel three times to the sun and back - and the amount driven by all the buses of the rhine-ruhr public transport system over six years .
can deposit threatens recycling profits but there is trouble on the horizon for the popular system . repnik said he is concerned that germany 's controversial new mandatory deposit system on cans and some other beverage packaging could dampen the success of the green dot program .
the new system , he noted , means that high quality materials that could be recycled at low cost are no longer processed by the dual system .
dsd finances itself chiefly through sales of recycled material and fees paid by manufacturers for packaging materials .
any products removed from its recycling portfolio will result in diminished revenues .
and with € 1.9 billion in reported revenues in 2001 , we 're not talking about chump change here .
dsd officials predict the company will dispose of some 650,000 tons less packaging this year due to the law , resulting in a loss as great as € 300-400 million -lrb- $ 340-453 million -rrb- .
" we are therefore faced with the challenge , despite the worsened framework in which we have to operate , of further enhancing the overall environmental performance of the system , " he said .
" this we will do through the adoption of new working practices and technologies . "
at the end of the day , the system will be made or broken by the commitment of the german people .
" change can only happen with our citizens ' help - and their willingness to separate their garbage on a daily basis , " repnik stressed .

and on the topic of the subsequent tightening of relations between america and britain , the paper says that while there is much bush and blair disagree on over domestic policy , this is of no consequence for the conduct of diplomacy .
the german paper dresdner neueste nachrichten is critical of germany 's currently poor relations with the u.s. the paper says a sulking chancellor gerhard schröder should now take a cue from defense minister peter struck and visit washington to ease tensions over iraq .
the paper comments : " even though the u.s. defied international law by invading iraq they did remove a terrible dictator .
and if the u.n. can return to iraq , berlin must do everything to improve relations and support the reconstruction and rebuilding of democracy in the war-torn country . "
commenting on schröder 's planned social and economic reforms , berlin 's die welt writes : " despite warnings by the social democrats that the coalition could collapse if the reforms are not accepted , the opposition shouldn ’ t get too excited .
the coalition is not dead yet .

monday 's nato meeting in washington will likely cover europe 's role in postwar iraq and gave germany 's defense minister the chance to bring u.s.-american relations back on track . germany ’ s defense minister traveled to washington on monday for a nato conference , the first time a member of gerhard schröder ’ s cabinet has set foot on american soil since the fall of saddam hussein ’ s regime . peter struck ’ s trip marks the beginning of what is to become a flurry of diplomatic activity on the transatlantic front to sort out international participation in the security of iraq . two other foreign policy experts , from the german foreign ministry and chancellery , are also currently in washington . the united states and britain , who together sent more than 300,000 soldiers to war , now want other nations to pick up security duties as they reduce their presence in iraq .
denmark and poland have already committed soldiers to a planned security force , which so far is without a un or nato mandate .

the mini-summit between belgium , france , luxembourg and germany last week was heavily criticized by other european nations including great britain and spain , which fear it could weaken nato . the four , all against the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , restated at the mini-summit an already agreed-upon european pledge to set up a strong european rapid reaction force .

as far back as 1990 , the duales system deutschland -lrb- dsd -rrb- was set up as a private limited company to organize recycling of packaging materials in germany .
companies that are members of the non-profit dual system distinguish their packaging with the " green dot " - the " dual " standing for a second system operating parallel to municipal waste collection and disposal .
in its 10th annual report issued on monday , the dual system for collection , sorting and recycling of sales packaging for 2002 recorded a slight increase in comparison to the previous year - with a total of 31 thousand additional tons adding to a total 6.32 million tons .
hans-peter repnik , ceo of duales system , said the numbers speak for themselves , adding : " we will continue to develop the ecological and economic efficiencies of packaging recycling . "
three yellow bags for 24 hours of power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-peter repnik , ceo dual system in terms of recycling , german consumers are as conscientious as they come .
they separate glass and paper - and packaging distinguished with the " green dot " goes in a yellow container that is then taken away by collectors contracted by the duales system .
municipal garbage collectors take care of anything that 's left over .
it may be complicated , but at monday 's press conference , duales system 's repnik said it was worth it .
" three yellow bags save as much power as a household uses in 24 hours , " he maintained .
" every individual packaging represents a quantifiable contribution to preserving the environment .
the green dot system does appear to be effective .
sixty-seven billion megajoules of primary energy were saved last year , and 1.5 million tons less climate-damaging green-house gases emitted .
that 's more than a bus would use to travel three times to the sun and back - and the amount driven by all the buses of the rhine-ruhr public transport system over six years .
can deposit threatens recycling profits but there is trouble on the horizon for the popular system . repnik said he is concerned that germany 's controversial new mandatory deposit system on cans and some other beverage packaging could dampen the success of the green dot program .
the new system , he noted , means that high quality materials that could be recycled at low cost are no longer processed by the dual system .
dsd finances itself chiefly through sales of recycled material and fees paid by manufacturers for packaging materials .
any products removed from its recycling portfolio will result in diminished revenues .
and with € 1.9 billion in reported revenues in 2001 , we 're not talking about chump change here .
dsd officials predict the company will dispose of some 650,000 tons less packaging this year due to the law , resulting in a loss as great as € 300-400 million -lrb- $ 340-453 million -rrb- .
" we are therefore faced with the challenge , despite the worsened framework in which we have to operate , of further enhancing the overall environmental performance of the system , " he said .
" this we will do through the adoption of new working practices and technologies . "
at the end of the day , the system will be made or broken by the commitment of the german people .
" change can only happen with our citizens ' help - and their willingness to separate their garbage on a daily basis , " repnik stressed .

in its 10th annual report issued on monday , the dual system for collection , sorting and recycling of sales packaging for 2002 recorded a slight increase in comparison to the previous year - with a total of 31 thousand additional tons adding to a total 6.32 million tons .
hans-peter repnik , ceo of duales system , said the numbers speak for themselves , adding : " we will continue to develop the ecological and economic efficiencies of packaging recycling . "
three yellow bags for 24 hours of power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-peter repnik , ceo dual system in terms of recycling , german consumers are as conscientious as they come .
they separate glass and paper - and packaging distinguished with the " green dot " goes in a yellow container that is then taken away by collectors contracted by the duales system .
municipal garbage collectors take care of anything that 's left over .
it may be complicated , but at monday 's press conference , duales system 's repnik said it was worth it .
" three yellow bags save as much power as a household uses in 24 hours , " he maintained .
" every individual packaging represents a quantifiable contribution to preserving the environment .
the green dot system does appear to be effective .
sixty-seven billion megajoules of primary energy were saved last year , and 1.5 million tons less climate-damaging green-house gases emitted .
that 's more than a bus would use to travel three times to the sun and back - and the amount driven by all the buses of the rhine-ruhr public transport system over six years .
can deposit threatens recycling profits but there is trouble on the horizon for the popular system . repnik said he is concerned that germany 's controversial new mandatory deposit system on cans and some other beverage packaging could dampen the success of the green dot program .
the new system , he noted , means that high quality materials that could be recycled at low cost are no longer processed by the dual system .
dsd finances itself chiefly through sales of recycled material and fees paid by manufacturers for packaging materials .
any products removed from its recycling portfolio will result in diminished revenues .
and with € 1.9 billion in reported revenues in 2001 , we 're not talking about chump change here .
dsd officials predict the company will dispose of some 650,000 tons less packaging this year due to the law , resulting in a loss as great as € 300-400 million -lrb- $ 340-453 million -rrb- .
" we are therefore faced with the challenge , despite the worsened framework in which we have to operate , of further enhancing the overall environmental performance of the system , " he said .
" this we will do through the adoption of new working practices and technologies . "
at the end of the day , the system will be made or broken by the commitment of the german people .
" change can only happen with our citizens ' help - and their willingness to separate their garbage on a daily basis , " repnik stressed .
" this is a major factor in conserving our resources .

monday 's nato meeting in washington will likely cover europe 's role in postwar iraq and gave germany 's defense minister the chance to bring u.s.-american relations back on track . germany ’ s defense minister traveled to washington on monday for a nato conference , the first time a member of gerhard schröder ’ s cabinet has set foot on american soil since the fall of saddam hussein ’ s regime . peter struck ’ s trip marks the beginning of what is to become a flurry of diplomatic activity on the transatlantic front to sort out international participation in the security of iraq . two other foreign policy experts , from the german foreign ministry and chancellery , are also currently in washington . the united states and britain , who together sent more than 300,000 soldiers to war , now want other nations to pick up security duties as they reduce their presence in iraq .
denmark and poland have already committed soldiers to a planned security force , which so far is without a un or nato mandate .
germany might be asked to as well .
struck has , until now , refused to comment on possible german involvement in a postwar stabilization force in iraq .
his boss , chancellor gerhard schröder , has joined other european leaders in insisting the united nations must play a strong role in postwar iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schröder und us-präsident george w. bush auf dem nato-gipfel in prag -lrb- 21.11.2002 -rrb- schröder and u.s. president george w. bush have not spoken since schröder ’ s phone call to the white house shortly after his election victory last november .
the chancellor ’ s vehement anti-war stance angered washington officials , who felt betrayed by one of their historical allies . defense summit aftermath the washington meeting is scheduled to focus on the ukraine ’ s alliance with nato member nations , but a possible topic will also likely be a recent meeting between four eu nations on setting up a european defense force .
the mini-summit between belgium , france , luxembourg and germany last week was heavily criticized by other european nations including great britain and spain , which fear it could weaken nato . the four , all against the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , restated at the mini-summit an already agreed-upon european pledge to set up a strong european rapid reaction force .
a belgian proposal to set up a separate european command headquarters in brussels , independent of nato , was greeted cooly by france and germany , who didn ’ t want to anger pro-nato washington any further . in a chat with reporters on sunday before his u.s. trip , struck said he would assure his counterpart , u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld , that the summit ’ s goal was nothing more than to “ build-up and strengthen the european arrows in nato . ” friendly chat with rumsfeld after meeting with rumsfeld monday afternoon , struck said the two talked in a " friendly atmosphere . "
he remained tight-lipped about details of the discussion , saying only that there were no " concrete requests " from the united states on germany 's possible security role in postwar iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense secretary donald rumsfeld , left , points to members of the press near the conculsion of a joint news conference with german defense minister peter struck , right , at the pentagon friday , nov .
8 , 2002 .
-lrb- ap photo / pablo martinez monsivais -rrb- rumsfeld and struck have had an up-and-down relationship since struck took over the minister ’ s post in august 2002 .
at struck ’ s first international meeting , a nato summit in prague in september , rumsfeld pointedly refused contact with his german counterpart , referring to him as “ that man . ” two months later , with struck in washington , the two were on better terms .
joking with reporters at a joint press conference , rumsfeld declared ties between germany and the u.s. as “ unpoisoned . ”
struck heralded “ a new beginning in cooperation . ” in january , as the diplomatic fight to head off war in iraq split the u.s. with traditional allies france and germany , rumsfeld gruffly dismissed the two anti-war nations as “ old europe . ”
a few weeks later , when asked in a congressional hearing who refused to provide any aid to a u.s. invasion of iraq , rumsfeld replied : “ libya , cuba , germany : ” the comments caused a stir in germany . struck waxes optimistic following the coalition forces ’ quick victory in iraq , struck said he was optimistic the u.s.-german relationship would return to normal . should he get a meeting with rumsfeld , he said ” i think we would take care of that in five minutes , ” he said .

monday 's nato meeting in washington will likely cover europe 's role in postwar iraq and gave germany 's defense minister the chance to bring u.s.-american relations back on track . germany ’ s defense minister traveled to washington on monday for a nato conference , the first time a member of gerhard schröder ’ s cabinet has set foot on american soil since the fall of saddam hussein ’ s regime . peter struck ’ s trip marks the beginning of what is to become a flurry of diplomatic activity on the transatlantic front to sort out international participation in the security of iraq . two other foreign policy experts , from the german foreign ministry and chancellery , are also currently in washington . the united states and britain , who together sent more than 300,000 soldiers to war , now want other nations to pick up security duties as they reduce their presence in iraq .
denmark and poland have already committed soldiers to a planned security force , which so far is without a un or nato mandate .

at struck ’ s first international meeting , a nato summit in prague in september , rumsfeld pointedly refused contact with his german counterpart , referring to him as “ that man . ” two months later , with struck in washington , the two were on better terms .
joking with reporters at a joint press conference , rumsfeld declared ties between germany and the u.s. as “ unpoisoned . ”

monday 's nato meeting in washington will likely cover europe 's role in postwar iraq and gave germany 's defense minister the chance to bring u.s.-american relations back on track . germany ’ s defense minister traveled to washington on monday for a nato conference , the first time a member of gerhard schröder ’ s cabinet has set foot on american soil since the fall of saddam hussein ’ s regime . peter struck ’ s trip marks the beginning of what is to become a flurry of diplomatic activity on the transatlantic front to sort out international participation in the security of iraq . two other foreign policy experts , from the german foreign ministry and chancellery , are also currently in washington . the united states and britain , who together sent more than 300,000 soldiers to war , now want other nations to pick up security duties as they reduce their presence in iraq .
denmark and poland have already committed soldiers to a planned security force , which so far is without a un or nato mandate .
germany might be asked to as well .
struck has , until now , refused to comment on possible german involvement in a postwar stabilization force in iraq .
his boss , chancellor gerhard schröder , has joined other european leaders in insisting the united nations must play a strong role in postwar iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schröder und us-präsident george w. bush auf dem nato-gipfel in prag -lrb- 21.11.2002 -rrb- schröder and u.s. president george w. bush have not spoken since schröder ’ s phone call to the white house shortly after his election victory last november .

the trial of italy 's prime minister comes under the scope of europe 's editorial pages - and most conclude that he 'll get off scott free - even if , as some papers allude , he deserves to be convicted . the corruption trial of italian prime minister silvio berlusconi attracted the attention of many european opinion writers on tuesday .
spain ’ s el pais warns that all italians can fear for their democracy if berlusconi has his way in court .
" here ’ s a man who controls both the public and private television channels and who mixes state power with personal interests , " the paper writes , adding that this already bears very little resemblance to democracy .
and the russian paper kommersant says that even if berlusconi were sentenced he probably wouldn ’ t end up in prison .
berlusconi ’ s advisors are working to restore immunity for the state ’ s most-powerful politicians , and the paper predicts that there ’ ll be nothing to stop them from getting such a law passed .
" wiser , but not always right , " comments the london times on the occasion of prime minister tony blair ’ s 50th birthday .
the paper says that while there are doubts about the labour party , support for blair ’ s leadership has rarely been stronger .
this , despite charges that blair has become distant from domestic affairs and obsessed with international matters .
the times says it ’ s hardly surprising that the wider world has come to dominate his agenda , writing : " the prime minister intuitively appreciated from the second he was informed of the events of sept .
11 that a fundamental shift in american foreign policy would be forthcoming . "
and on the topic of the subsequent tightening of relations between america and britain , the paper says that while there is much bush and blair disagree on over domestic policy , this is of no consequence for the conduct of diplomacy .
the german paper dresdner neueste nachrichten is critical of germany 's currently poor relations with the u.s. the paper says a sulking chancellor gerhard schröder should now take a cue from defense minister peter struck and visit washington to ease tensions over iraq .
the paper comments : " even though the u.s. defied international law by invading iraq they did remove a terrible dictator .
and if the u.n. can return to iraq , berlin must do everything to improve relations and support the reconstruction and rebuilding of democracy in the war-torn country . "
commenting on schröder 's planned social and economic reforms , berlin 's die welt writes : " despite warnings by the social democrats that the coalition could collapse if the reforms are not accepted , the opposition shouldn ’ t get too excited .
the coalition is not dead yet .
and now that the opposition has released its reform agenda , the social democrats can make the case that with a change in government , things would only get worse .

monday 's nato meeting in washington will likely cover europe 's role in postwar iraq and gave germany 's defense minister the chance to bring u.s.-american relations back on track . germany ’ s defense minister traveled to washington on monday for a nato conference , the first time a member of gerhard schröder ’ s cabinet has set foot on american soil since the fall of saddam hussein ’ s regime . peter struck ’ s trip marks the beginning of what is to become a flurry of diplomatic activity on the transatlantic front to sort out international participation in the security of iraq . two other foreign policy experts , from the german foreign ministry and chancellery , are also currently in washington . the united states and britain , who together sent more than 300,000 soldiers to war , now want other nations to pick up security duties as they reduce their presence in iraq .
denmark and poland have already committed soldiers to a planned security force , which so far is without a un or nato mandate .
germany might be asked to as well .
struck has , until now , refused to comment on possible german involvement in a postwar stabilization force in iraq .
his boss , chancellor gerhard schröder , has joined other european leaders in insisting the united nations must play a strong role in postwar iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schröder und us-präsident george w. bush auf dem nato-gipfel in prag -lrb- 21.11.2002 -rrb- schröder and u.s. president george w. bush have not spoken since schröder ’ s phone call to the white house shortly after his election victory last november .
the chancellor ’ s vehement anti-war stance angered washington officials , who felt betrayed by one of their historical allies . defense summit aftermath the washington meeting is scheduled to focus on the ukraine ’ s alliance with nato member nations , but a possible topic will also likely be a recent meeting between four eu nations on setting up a european defense force .
the mini-summit between belgium , france , luxembourg and germany last week was heavily criticized by other european nations including great britain and spain , which fear it could weaken nato . the four , all against the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , restated at the mini-summit an already agreed-upon european pledge to set up a strong european rapid reaction force .
a belgian proposal to set up a separate european command headquarters in brussels , independent of nato , was greeted cooly by france and germany , who didn ’ t want to anger pro-nato washington any further . in a chat with reporters on sunday before his u.s. trip , struck said he would assure his counterpart , u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld , that the summit ’ s goal was nothing more than to “ build-up and strengthen the european arrows in nato . ” friendly chat with rumsfeld after meeting with rumsfeld monday afternoon , struck said the two talked in a " friendly atmosphere . "
he remained tight-lipped about details of the discussion , saying only that there were no " concrete requests " from the united states on germany 's possible security role in postwar iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense secretary donald rumsfeld , left , points to members of the press near the conculsion of a joint news conference with german defense minister peter struck , right , at the pentagon friday , nov .
8 , 2002 .
-lrb- ap photo / pablo martinez monsivais -rrb- rumsfeld and struck have had an up-and-down relationship since struck took over the minister ’ s post in august 2002 .
at struck ’ s first international meeting , a nato summit in prague in september , rumsfeld pointedly refused contact with his german counterpart , referring to him as “ that man . ” two months later , with struck in washington , the two were on better terms .
joking with reporters at a joint press conference , rumsfeld declared ties between germany and the u.s. as “ unpoisoned . ”
struck heralded “ a new beginning in cooperation . ” in january , as the diplomatic fight to head off war in iraq split the u.s. with traditional allies france and germany , rumsfeld gruffly dismissed the two anti-war nations as “ old europe . ”
a few weeks later , when asked in a congressional hearing who refused to provide any aid to a u.s. invasion of iraq , rumsfeld replied : “ libya , cuba , germany : ” the comments caused a stir in germany . struck waxes optimistic following the coalition forces ’ quick victory in iraq , struck said he was optimistic the u.s.-german relationship would return to normal . should he get a meeting with rumsfeld , he said ” i think we would take care of that in five minutes , ” he said .

as far back as 1990 , the duales system deutschland -lrb- dsd -rrb- was set up as a private limited company to organize recycling of packaging materials in germany .
companies that are members of the non-profit dual system distinguish their packaging with the " green dot " - the " dual " standing for a second system operating parallel to municipal waste collection and disposal .
in its 10th annual report issued on monday , the dual system for collection , sorting and recycling of sales packaging for 2002 recorded a slight increase in comparison to the previous year - with a total of 31 thousand additional tons adding to a total 6.32 million tons .
hans-peter repnik , ceo of duales system , said the numbers speak for themselves , adding : " we will continue to develop the ecological and economic efficiencies of packaging recycling . "

municipal garbage collectors take care of anything that 's left over .
it may be complicated , but at monday 's press conference , duales system 's repnik said it was worth it .
" three yellow bags save as much power as a household uses in 24 hours , " he maintained .
" every individual packaging represents a quantifiable contribution to preserving the environment .
the green dot system does appear to be effective .
sixty-seven billion megajoules of primary energy were saved last year , and 1.5 million tons less climate-damaging green-house gases emitted .
that 's more than a bus would use to travel three times to the sun and back - and the amount driven by all the buses of the rhine-ruhr public transport system over six years .
can deposit threatens recycling profits but there is trouble on the horizon for the popular system . repnik said he is concerned that germany 's controversial new mandatory deposit system on cans and some other beverage packaging could dampen the success of the green dot program .
the new system , he noted , means that high quality materials that could be recycled at low cost are no longer processed by the dual system .
dsd finances itself chiefly through sales of recycled material and fees paid by manufacturers for packaging materials .
any products removed from its recycling portfolio will result in diminished revenues .
and with € 1.9 billion in reported revenues in 2001 , we 're not talking about chump change here .
dsd officials predict the company will dispose of some 650,000 tons less packaging this year due to the law , resulting in a loss as great as € 300-400 million -lrb- $ 340-453 million -rrb- .
" we are therefore faced with the challenge , despite the worsened framework in which we have to operate , of further enhancing the overall environmental performance of the system , " he said .
" this we will do through the adoption of new working practices and technologies . "
at the end of the day , the system will be made or broken by the commitment of the german people .

in its 10th annual report issued on monday , the dual system for collection , sorting and recycling of sales packaging for 2002 recorded a slight increase in comparison to the previous year - with a total of 31 thousand additional tons adding to a total 6.32 million tons .
hans-peter repnik , ceo of duales system , said the numbers speak for themselves , adding : " we will continue to develop the ecological and economic efficiencies of packaging recycling . "
three yellow bags for 24 hours of power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-peter repnik , ceo dual system in terms of recycling , german consumers are as conscientious as they come .
they separate glass and paper - and packaging distinguished with the " green dot " goes in a yellow container that is then taken away by collectors contracted by the duales system .
municipal garbage collectors take care of anything that 's left over .
it may be complicated , but at monday 's press conference , duales system 's repnik said it was worth it .
" three yellow bags save as much power as a household uses in 24 hours , " he maintained .
" every individual packaging represents a quantifiable contribution to preserving the environment .
the green dot system does appear to be effective .
sixty-seven billion megajoules of primary energy were saved last year , and 1.5 million tons less climate-damaging green-house gases emitted .
that 's more than a bus would use to travel three times to the sun and back - and the amount driven by all the buses of the rhine-ruhr public transport system over six years .
can deposit threatens recycling profits but there is trouble on the horizon for the popular system . repnik said he is concerned that germany 's controversial new mandatory deposit system on cans and some other beverage packaging could dampen the success of the green dot program .
the new system , he noted , means that high quality materials that could be recycled at low cost are no longer processed by the dual system .
dsd finances itself chiefly through sales of recycled material and fees paid by manufacturers for packaging materials .
any products removed from its recycling portfolio will result in diminished revenues .
and with € 1.9 billion in reported revenues in 2001 , we 're not talking about chump change here .
dsd officials predict the company will dispose of some 650,000 tons less packaging this year due to the law , resulting in a loss as great as € 300-400 million -lrb- $ 340-453 million -rrb- .
" we are therefore faced with the challenge , despite the worsened framework in which we have to operate , of further enhancing the overall environmental performance of the system , " he said .
" this we will do through the adoption of new working practices and technologies . "
at the end of the day , the system will be made or broken by the commitment of the german people .
" change can only happen with our citizens ' help - and their willingness to separate their garbage on a daily basis , " repnik stressed .
" this is a major factor in conserving our resources .

monday 's nato meeting in washington will likely cover europe 's role in postwar iraq and gave germany 's defense minister the chance to bring u.s.-american relations back on track . germany ’ s defense minister traveled to washington on monday for a nato conference , the first time a member of gerhard schröder ’ s cabinet has set foot on american soil since the fall of saddam hussein ’ s regime . peter struck ’ s trip marks the beginning of what is to become a flurry of diplomatic activity on the transatlantic front to sort out international participation in the security of iraq . two other foreign policy experts , from the german foreign ministry and chancellery , are also currently in washington . the united states and britain , who together sent more than 300,000 soldiers to war , now want other nations to pick up security duties as they reduce their presence in iraq .
denmark and poland have already committed soldiers to a planned security force , which so far is without a un or nato mandate .
germany might be asked to as well .
struck has , until now , refused to comment on possible german involvement in a postwar stabilization force in iraq .
his boss , chancellor gerhard schröder , has joined other european leaders in insisting the united nations must play a strong role in postwar iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schröder und us-präsident george w. bush auf dem nato-gipfel in prag -lrb- 21.11.2002 -rrb- schröder and u.s. president george w. bush have not spoken since schröder ’ s phone call to the white house shortly after his election victory last november .
the chancellor ’ s vehement anti-war stance angered washington officials , who felt betrayed by one of their historical allies . defense summit aftermath the washington meeting is scheduled to focus on the ukraine ’ s alliance with nato member nations , but a possible topic will also likely be a recent meeting between four eu nations on setting up a european defense force .
the mini-summit between belgium , france , luxembourg and germany last week was heavily criticized by other european nations including great britain and spain , which fear it could weaken nato . the four , all against the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , restated at the mini-summit an already agreed-upon european pledge to set up a strong european rapid reaction force .
a belgian proposal to set up a separate european command headquarters in brussels , independent of nato , was greeted cooly by france and germany , who didn ’ t want to anger pro-nato washington any further . in a chat with reporters on sunday before his u.s. trip , struck said he would assure his counterpart , u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld , that the summit ’ s goal was nothing more than to “ build-up and strengthen the european arrows in nato . ” friendly chat with rumsfeld after meeting with rumsfeld monday afternoon , struck said the two talked in a " friendly atmosphere . "
he remained tight-lipped about details of the discussion , saying only that there were no " concrete requests " from the united states on germany 's possible security role in postwar iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense secretary donald rumsfeld , left , points to members of the press near the conculsion of a joint news conference with german defense minister peter struck , right , at the pentagon friday , nov .
8 , 2002 .
-lrb- ap photo / pablo martinez monsivais -rrb- rumsfeld and struck have had an up-and-down relationship since struck took over the minister ’ s post in august 2002 .
at struck ’ s first international meeting , a nato summit in prague in september , rumsfeld pointedly refused contact with his german counterpart , referring to him as “ that man . ” two months later , with struck in washington , the two were on better terms .
joking with reporters at a joint press conference , rumsfeld declared ties between germany and the u.s. as “ unpoisoned . ”
struck heralded “ a new beginning in cooperation . ” in january , as the diplomatic fight to head off war in iraq split the u.s. with traditional allies france and germany , rumsfeld gruffly dismissed the two anti-war nations as “ old europe . ”
a few weeks later , when asked in a congressional hearing who refused to provide any aid to a u.s. invasion of iraq , rumsfeld replied : “ libya , cuba , germany : ” the comments caused a stir in germany . struck waxes optimistic following the coalition forces ’ quick victory in iraq , struck said he was optimistic the u.s.-german relationship would return to normal . should he get a meeting with rumsfeld , he said ” i think we would take care of that in five minutes , ” he said .

monday 's nato meeting in washington will likely cover europe 's role in postwar iraq and gave germany 's defense minister the chance to bring u.s.-american relations back on track . germany ’ s defense minister traveled to washington on monday for a nato conference , the first time a member of gerhard schröder ’ s cabinet has set foot on american soil since the fall of saddam hussein ’ s regime . peter struck ’ s trip marks the beginning of what is to become a flurry of diplomatic activity on the transatlantic front to sort out international participation in the security of iraq . two other foreign policy experts , from the german foreign ministry and chancellery , are also currently in washington . the united states and britain , who together sent more than 300,000 soldiers to war , now want other nations to pick up security duties as they reduce their presence in iraq .
denmark and poland have already committed soldiers to a planned security force , which so far is without a un or nato mandate .
germany might be asked to as well .
struck has , until now , refused to comment on possible german involvement in a postwar stabilization force in iraq .
his boss , chancellor gerhard schröder , has joined other european leaders in insisting the united nations must play a strong role in postwar iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schröder und us-präsident george w. bush auf dem nato-gipfel in prag -lrb- 21.11.2002 -rrb- schröder and u.s. president george w. bush have not spoken since schröder ’ s phone call to the white house shortly after his election victory last november .
the chancellor ’ s vehement anti-war stance angered washington officials , who felt betrayed by one of their historical allies . defense summit aftermath the washington meeting is scheduled to focus on the ukraine ’ s alliance with nato member nations , but a possible topic will also likely be a recent meeting between four eu nations on setting up a european defense force .
the mini-summit between belgium , france , luxembourg and germany last week was heavily criticized by other european nations including great britain and spain , which fear it could weaken nato . the four , all against the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , restated at the mini-summit an already agreed-upon european pledge to set up a strong european rapid reaction force .
a belgian proposal to set up a separate european command headquarters in brussels , independent of nato , was greeted cooly by france and germany , who didn ’ t want to anger pro-nato washington any further . in a chat with reporters on sunday before his u.s. trip , struck said he would assure his counterpart , u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld , that the summit ’ s goal was nothing more than to “ build-up and strengthen the european arrows in nato . ” friendly chat with rumsfeld after meeting with rumsfeld monday afternoon , struck said the two talked in a " friendly atmosphere . "
he remained tight-lipped about details of the discussion , saying only that there were no " concrete requests " from the united states on germany 's possible security role in postwar iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense secretary donald rumsfeld , left , points to members of the press near the conculsion of a joint news conference with german defense minister peter struck , right , at the pentagon friday , nov .
8 , 2002 .
-lrb- ap photo / pablo martinez monsivais -rrb- rumsfeld and struck have had an up-and-down relationship since struck took over the minister ’ s post in august 2002 .
at struck ’ s first international meeting , a nato summit in prague in september , rumsfeld pointedly refused contact with his german counterpart , referring to him as “ that man . ” two months later , with struck in washington , the two were on better terms .
joking with reporters at a joint press conference , rumsfeld declared ties between germany and the u.s. as “ unpoisoned . ”
struck heralded “ a new beginning in cooperation . ” in january , as the diplomatic fight to head off war in iraq split the u.s. with traditional allies france and germany , rumsfeld gruffly dismissed the two anti-war nations as “ old europe . ”
a few weeks later , when asked in a congressional hearing who refused to provide any aid to a u.s. invasion of iraq , rumsfeld replied : “ libya , cuba , germany : ” the comments caused a stir in germany . struck waxes optimistic following the coalition forces ’ quick victory in iraq , struck said he was optimistic the u.s.-german relationship would return to normal . should he get a meeting with rumsfeld , he said ” i think we would take care of that in five minutes , ” he said .

monday 's nato meeting in washington will likely cover europe 's role in postwar iraq and gave germany 's defense minister the chance to bring u.s.-american relations back on track . germany ’ s defense minister traveled to washington on monday for a nato conference , the first time a member of gerhard schröder ’ s cabinet has set foot on american soil since the fall of saddam hussein ’ s regime . peter struck ’ s trip marks the beginning of what is to become a flurry of diplomatic activity on the transatlantic front to sort out international participation in the security of iraq . two other foreign policy experts , from the german foreign ministry and chancellery , are also currently in washington . the united states and britain , who together sent more than 300,000 soldiers to war , now want other nations to pick up security duties as they reduce their presence in iraq .
denmark and poland have already committed soldiers to a planned security force , which so far is without a un or nato mandate .
germany might be asked to as well .
struck has , until now , refused to comment on possible german involvement in a postwar stabilization force in iraq .
his boss , chancellor gerhard schröder , has joined other european leaders in insisting the united nations must play a strong role in postwar iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schröder und us-präsident george w. bush auf dem nato-gipfel in prag -lrb- 21.11.2002 -rrb- schröder and u.s. president george w. bush have not spoken since schröder ’ s phone call to the white house shortly after his election victory last november .
the chancellor ’ s vehement anti-war stance angered washington officials , who felt betrayed by one of their historical allies . defense summit aftermath the washington meeting is scheduled to focus on the ukraine ’ s alliance with nato member nations , but a possible topic will also likely be a recent meeting between four eu nations on setting up a european defense force .
the mini-summit between belgium , france , luxembourg and germany last week was heavily criticized by other european nations including great britain and spain , which fear it could weaken nato . the four , all against the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , restated at the mini-summit an already agreed-upon european pledge to set up a strong european rapid reaction force .
a belgian proposal to set up a separate european command headquarters in brussels , independent of nato , was greeted cooly by france and germany , who didn ’ t want to anger pro-nato washington any further . in a chat with reporters on sunday before his u.s. trip , struck said he would assure his counterpart , u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld , that the summit ’ s goal was nothing more than to “ build-up and strengthen the european arrows in nato . ” friendly chat with rumsfeld after meeting with rumsfeld monday afternoon , struck said the two talked in a " friendly atmosphere . "
he remained tight-lipped about details of the discussion , saying only that there were no " concrete requests " from the united states on germany 's possible security role in postwar iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense secretary donald rumsfeld , left , points to members of the press near the conculsion of a joint news conference with german defense minister peter struck , right , at the pentagon friday , nov .
8 , 2002 .
-lrb- ap photo / pablo martinez monsivais -rrb- rumsfeld and struck have had an up-and-down relationship since struck took over the minister ’ s post in august 2002 .
at struck ’ s first international meeting , a nato summit in prague in september , rumsfeld pointedly refused contact with his german counterpart , referring to him as “ that man . ” two months later , with struck in washington , the two were on better terms .
joking with reporters at a joint press conference , rumsfeld declared ties between germany and the u.s. as “ unpoisoned . ”
struck heralded “ a new beginning in cooperation . ” in january , as the diplomatic fight to head off war in iraq split the u.s. with traditional allies france and germany , rumsfeld gruffly dismissed the two anti-war nations as “ old europe . ”
a few weeks later , when asked in a congressional hearing who refused to provide any aid to a u.s. invasion of iraq , rumsfeld replied : “ libya , cuba , germany : ” the comments caused a stir in germany . struck waxes optimistic following the coalition forces ’ quick victory in iraq , struck said he was optimistic the u.s.-german relationship would return to normal . should he get a meeting with rumsfeld , he said ” i think we would take care of that in five minutes , ” he said .

as far back as 1990 , the duales system deutschland -lrb- dsd -rrb- was set up as a private limited company to organize recycling of packaging materials in germany .
companies that are members of the non-profit dual system distinguish their packaging with the " green dot " - the " dual " standing for a second system operating parallel to municipal waste collection and disposal .
in its 10th annual report issued on monday , the dual system for collection , sorting and recycling of sales packaging for 2002 recorded a slight increase in comparison to the previous year - with a total of 31 thousand additional tons adding to a total 6.32 million tons .
hans-peter repnik , ceo of duales system , said the numbers speak for themselves , adding : " we will continue to develop the ecological and economic efficiencies of packaging recycling . "
three yellow bags for 24 hours of power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-peter repnik , ceo dual system in terms of recycling , german consumers are as conscientious as they come .
they separate glass and paper - and packaging distinguished with the " green dot " goes in a yellow container that is then taken away by collectors contracted by the duales system .
municipal garbage collectors take care of anything that 's left over .
it may be complicated , but at monday 's press conference , duales system 's repnik said it was worth it .
" three yellow bags save as much power as a household uses in 24 hours , " he maintained .
" every individual packaging represents a quantifiable contribution to preserving the environment .
the green dot system does appear to be effective .
sixty-seven billion megajoules of primary energy were saved last year , and 1.5 million tons less climate-damaging green-house gases emitted .
that 's more than a bus would use to travel three times to the sun and back - and the amount driven by all the buses of the rhine-ruhr public transport system over six years .
can deposit threatens recycling profits but there is trouble on the horizon for the popular system . repnik said he is concerned that germany 's controversial new mandatory deposit system on cans and some other beverage packaging could dampen the success of the green dot program .
the new system , he noted , means that high quality materials that could be recycled at low cost are no longer processed by the dual system .
dsd finances itself chiefly through sales of recycled material and fees paid by manufacturers for packaging materials .
any products removed from its recycling portfolio will result in diminished revenues .
and with € 1.9 billion in reported revenues in 2001 , we 're not talking about chump change here .
dsd officials predict the company will dispose of some 650,000 tons less packaging this year due to the law , resulting in a loss as great as € 300-400 million -lrb- $ 340-453 million -rrb- .
" we are therefore faced with the challenge , despite the worsened framework in which we have to operate , of further enhancing the overall environmental performance of the system , " he said .
" this we will do through the adoption of new working practices and technologies . "
at the end of the day , the system will be made or broken by the commitment of the german people .
" change can only happen with our citizens ' help - and their willingness to separate their garbage on a daily basis , " repnik stressed .

monday 's nato meeting in washington will likely cover europe 's role in postwar iraq and gave germany 's defense minister the chance to bring u.s.-american relations back on track . germany ’ s defense minister traveled to washington on monday for a nato conference , the first time a member of gerhard schröder ’ s cabinet has set foot on american soil since the fall of saddam hussein ’ s regime . peter struck ’ s trip marks the beginning of what is to become a flurry of diplomatic activity on the transatlantic front to sort out international participation in the security of iraq . two other foreign policy experts , from the german foreign ministry and chancellery , are also currently in washington . the united states and britain , who together sent more than 300,000 soldiers to war , now want other nations to pick up security duties as they reduce their presence in iraq .
denmark and poland have already committed soldiers to a planned security force , which so far is without a un or nato mandate .
germany might be asked to as well .
struck has , until now , refused to comment on possible german involvement in a postwar stabilization force in iraq .
his boss , chancellor gerhard schröder , has joined other european leaders in insisting the united nations must play a strong role in postwar iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schröder und us-präsident george w. bush auf dem nato-gipfel in prag -lrb- 21.11.2002 -rrb- schröder and u.s. president george w. bush have not spoken since schröder ’ s phone call to the white house shortly after his election victory last november .
the chancellor ’ s vehement anti-war stance angered washington officials , who felt betrayed by one of their historical allies . defense summit aftermath the washington meeting is scheduled to focus on the ukraine ’ s alliance with nato member nations , but a possible topic will also likely be a recent meeting between four eu nations on setting up a european defense force .
the mini-summit between belgium , france , luxembourg and germany last week was heavily criticized by other european nations including great britain and spain , which fear it could weaken nato . the four , all against the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , restated at the mini-summit an already agreed-upon european pledge to set up a strong european rapid reaction force .
a belgian proposal to set up a separate european command headquarters in brussels , independent of nato , was greeted cooly by france and germany , who didn ’ t want to anger pro-nato washington any further . in a chat with reporters on sunday before his u.s. trip , struck said he would assure his counterpart , u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld , that the summit ’ s goal was nothing more than to “ build-up and strengthen the european arrows in nato . ” friendly chat with rumsfeld after meeting with rumsfeld monday afternoon , struck said the two talked in a " friendly atmosphere . "
he remained tight-lipped about details of the discussion , saying only that there were no " concrete requests " from the united states on germany 's possible security role in postwar iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense secretary donald rumsfeld , left , points to members of the press near the conculsion of a joint news conference with german defense minister peter struck , right , at the pentagon friday , nov .
8 , 2002 .
-lrb- ap photo / pablo martinez monsivais -rrb- rumsfeld and struck have had an up-and-down relationship since struck took over the minister ’ s post in august 2002 .
at struck ’ s first international meeting , a nato summit in prague in september , rumsfeld pointedly refused contact with his german counterpart , referring to him as “ that man . ” two months later , with struck in washington , the two were on better terms .

monday 's nato meeting in washington will likely cover europe 's role in postwar iraq and gave germany 's defense minister the chance to bring u.s.-american relations back on track . germany ’ s defense minister traveled to washington on monday for a nato conference , the first time a member of gerhard schröder ’ s cabinet has set foot on american soil since the fall of saddam hussein ’ s regime . peter struck ’ s trip marks the beginning of what is to become a flurry of diplomatic activity on the transatlantic front to sort out international participation in the security of iraq . two other foreign policy experts , from the german foreign ministry and chancellery , are also currently in washington . the united states and britain , who together sent more than 300,000 soldiers to war , now want other nations to pick up security duties as they reduce their presence in iraq .
denmark and poland have already committed soldiers to a planned security force , which so far is without a un or nato mandate .
germany might be asked to as well .
struck has , until now , refused to comment on possible german involvement in a postwar stabilization force in iraq .
his boss , chancellor gerhard schröder , has joined other european leaders in insisting the united nations must play a strong role in postwar iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schröder und us-präsident george w. bush auf dem nato-gipfel in prag -lrb- 21.11.2002 -rrb- schröder and u.s. president george w. bush have not spoken since schröder ’ s phone call to the white house shortly after his election victory last november .
the chancellor ’ s vehement anti-war stance angered washington officials , who felt betrayed by one of their historical allies . defense summit aftermath the washington meeting is scheduled to focus on the ukraine ’ s alliance with nato member nations , but a possible topic will also likely be a recent meeting between four eu nations on setting up a european defense force .
the mini-summit between belgium , france , luxembourg and germany last week was heavily criticized by other european nations including great britain and spain , which fear it could weaken nato . the four , all against the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , restated at the mini-summit an already agreed-upon european pledge to set up a strong european rapid reaction force .
a belgian proposal to set up a separate european command headquarters in brussels , independent of nato , was greeted cooly by france and germany , who didn ’ t want to anger pro-nato washington any further . in a chat with reporters on sunday before his u.s. trip , struck said he would assure his counterpart , u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld , that the summit ’ s goal was nothing more than to “ build-up and strengthen the european arrows in nato . ” friendly chat with rumsfeld after meeting with rumsfeld monday afternoon , struck said the two talked in a " friendly atmosphere . "
he remained tight-lipped about details of the discussion , saying only that there were no " concrete requests " from the united states on germany 's possible security role in postwar iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense secretary donald rumsfeld , left , points to members of the press near the conculsion of a joint news conference with german defense minister peter struck , right , at the pentagon friday , nov .
8 , 2002 .
-lrb- ap photo / pablo martinez monsivais -rrb- rumsfeld and struck have had an up-and-down relationship since struck took over the minister ’ s post in august 2002 .
at struck ’ s first international meeting , a nato summit in prague in september , rumsfeld pointedly refused contact with his german counterpart , referring to him as “ that man . ” two months later , with struck in washington , the two were on better terms .
joking with reporters at a joint press conference , rumsfeld declared ties between germany and the u.s. as “ unpoisoned . ”
struck heralded “ a new beginning in cooperation . ” in january , as the diplomatic fight to head off war in iraq split the u.s. with traditional allies france and germany , rumsfeld gruffly dismissed the two anti-war nations as “ old europe . ”

the trial of italy 's prime minister comes under the scope of europe 's editorial pages - and most conclude that he 'll get off scott free - even if , as some papers allude , he deserves to be convicted . the corruption trial of italian prime minister silvio berlusconi attracted the attention of many european opinion writers on tuesday .
spain ’ s el pais warns that all italians can fear for their democracy if berlusconi has his way in court .
" here ’ s a man who controls both the public and private television channels and who mixes state power with personal interests , " the paper writes , adding that this already bears very little resemblance to democracy .
and the russian paper kommersant says that even if berlusconi were sentenced he probably wouldn ’ t end up in prison .
berlusconi ’ s advisors are working to restore immunity for the state ’ s most-powerful politicians , and the paper predicts that there ’ ll be nothing to stop them from getting such a law passed .
" wiser , but not always right , " comments the london times on the occasion of prime minister tony blair ’ s 50th birthday .

struck says germany would consider a nato deployment in iraq . after getting the meeting he wanted with counterpart donald rumsfeld , german defense minister peter struck told reporters the transatlantic relationship was on its way back to normal .
the two met during a nato summit in washington on monday . it was the first time a member of the german cabinet set foot on u.s. soil following the end of the war in iraq .
" we have now already taken a good step back to normalization between the two countries , " struck said after meeting with rumsfeld .
though a scheduled meeting with u.s. national security adviser condoleezza rice had been secured on the agenda , a meeting between struck and rumsfeld was anything but certain .
despite having agreed to meet with him , rumsfeld notably did not appear with struck for a photo opp following the talk .
germans to reduce security at u.s. installations the two agreed to reduce the number of german soldiers guarding u.s. facilities in germany - including the embassy in berlin , cultural facilities like the america house as well as consulates and other properties - from 3,100 to 2,200 .
prior to the war , major u.s. newspapers reported that washington was considering pulling many of its troops from germany and relocating them to less expensive eastern european countries . more than 57,000 u.s. armed forces troops and their families are currently based in germany and the military has its european command in stuttgart . but on monday that did n't appear to be part of the agenda .
rumsfeld said the pentagon had not yet found a secure location elsewhere in europe .
postwar iraq dominates nato meeting officials at a nato meeting attended by both struck and rumsfeld discussed security in postwar iraq on monday .
though secretary-general lord robertson said nato troops were currently not being considered to stabilize the war-torn country , white house officials said robertson and president george w. bush discussed that possibility during a private meeting .
struck , who has n't followed european allies like spain and italy in promising troops for postwar iraq , said he was open to taking part in a possible nato deployment in the country . earlier in the day , a spokesman for the german government made it clear the country would not participate in the current security force proposed by the united states . spokesman bela anda said the country would not join spain , italy , bulgaria , denmark , the netherlands and the ukraine in sending soldiers to postwar iraq .
in washington , struck also met with rice and deputy secretary of state richard armitage .

as far back as 1990 , the duales system deutschland -lrb- dsd -rrb- was set up as a private limited company to organize recycling of packaging materials in germany .
companies that are members of the non-profit dual system distinguish their packaging with the " green dot " - the " dual " standing for a second system operating parallel to municipal waste collection and disposal .
in its 10th annual report issued on monday , the dual system for collection , sorting and recycling of sales packaging for 2002 recorded a slight increase in comparison to the previous year - with a total of 31 thousand additional tons adding to a total 6.32 million tons .
hans-peter repnik , ceo of duales system , said the numbers speak for themselves , adding : " we will continue to develop the ecological and economic efficiencies of packaging recycling . "

they separate glass and paper - and packaging distinguished with the " green dot " goes in a yellow container that is then taken away by collectors contracted by the duales system .
municipal garbage collectors take care of anything that 's left over .
it may be complicated , but at monday 's press conference , duales system 's repnik said it was worth it .
" three yellow bags save as much power as a household uses in 24 hours , " he maintained .
" every individual packaging represents a quantifiable contribution to preserving the environment .
the green dot system does appear to be effective .
sixty-seven billion megajoules of primary energy were saved last year , and 1.5 million tons less climate-damaging green-house gases emitted .
that 's more than a bus would use to travel three times to the sun and back - and the amount driven by all the buses of the rhine-ruhr public transport system over six years .
can deposit threatens recycling profits but there is trouble on the horizon for the popular system . repnik said he is concerned that germany 's controversial new mandatory deposit system on cans and some other beverage packaging could dampen the success of the green dot program .
the new system , he noted , means that high quality materials that could be recycled at low cost are no longer processed by the dual system .
dsd finances itself chiefly through sales of recycled material and fees paid by manufacturers for packaging materials .
any products removed from its recycling portfolio will result in diminished revenues .
and with € 1.9 billion in reported revenues in 2001 , we 're not talking about chump change here .
dsd officials predict the company will dispose of some 650,000 tons less packaging this year due to the law , resulting in a loss as great as € 300-400 million -lrb- $ 340-453 million -rrb- .
" we are therefore faced with the challenge , despite the worsened framework in which we have to operate , of further enhancing the overall environmental performance of the system , " he said .
" this we will do through the adoption of new working practices and technologies . "
at the end of the day , the system will be made or broken by the commitment of the german people .

as far back as 1990 , the duales system deutschland -lrb- dsd -rrb- was set up as a private limited company to organize recycling of packaging materials in germany .
companies that are members of the non-profit dual system distinguish their packaging with the " green dot " - the " dual " standing for a second system operating parallel to municipal waste collection and disposal .
in its 10th annual report issued on monday , the dual system for collection , sorting and recycling of sales packaging for 2002 recorded a slight increase in comparison to the previous year - with a total of 31 thousand additional tons adding to a total 6.32 million tons .
hans-peter repnik , ceo of duales system , said the numbers speak for themselves , adding : " we will continue to develop the ecological and economic efficiencies of packaging recycling . "

they separate glass and paper - and packaging distinguished with the " green dot " goes in a yellow container that is then taken away by collectors contracted by the duales system .
municipal garbage collectors take care of anything that 's left over .
it may be complicated , but at monday 's press conference , duales system 's repnik said it was worth it .
" three yellow bags save as much power as a household uses in 24 hours , " he maintained .
" every individual packaging represents a quantifiable contribution to preserving the environment .
the green dot system does appear to be effective .
sixty-seven billion megajoules of primary energy were saved last year , and 1.5 million tons less climate-damaging green-house gases emitted .
that 's more than a bus would use to travel three times to the sun and back - and the amount driven by all the buses of the rhine-ruhr public transport system over six years .
can deposit threatens recycling profits but there is trouble on the horizon for the popular system . repnik said he is concerned that germany 's controversial new mandatory deposit system on cans and some other beverage packaging could dampen the success of the green dot program .
the new system , he noted , means that high quality materials that could be recycled at low cost are no longer processed by the dual system .
dsd finances itself chiefly through sales of recycled material and fees paid by manufacturers for packaging materials .
any products removed from its recycling portfolio will result in diminished revenues .
and with € 1.9 billion in reported revenues in 2001 , we 're not talking about chump change here .
dsd officials predict the company will dispose of some 650,000 tons less packaging this year due to the law , resulting in a loss as great as € 300-400 million -lrb- $ 340-453 million -rrb- .
" we are therefore faced with the challenge , despite the worsened framework in which we have to operate , of further enhancing the overall environmental performance of the system , " he said .
" this we will do through the adoption of new working practices and technologies . "
at the end of the day , the system will be made or broken by the commitment of the german people .

researchers have suggested hundreds of thousands of children may have contracted the virus in this way .
the study is the latest to point to contaminated needles as a major cause of hiv in africa .
some researchers believe as many as 40 % of hiv infections in african adults are linked to injections .
united nations agencies have rejected this theory , saying most cases are linked to unsafe sex .
officials have also warned that the theory could damage campaigns to get people in africa to use condoms to protect themselves from the disease .
high rates this latest research looked at a study carried out by the human sciences research council of south africa , published last year .
it revealed that 5.6 % of south african children between the ages of two and 14 have hiv .
this represents 670,000 children .
the matter needs to be much more closely interrogated before we form conclusions dr nono simelela , south african hiv and aids programme however , figures for mother-to-baby transmission - believed to be the main cause of hiv in children - are substantially lower .
this suggests children are contracting the virus in another way .
researchers from the university of tübingen in germany said the findings indicated contaminated needles were to blame .
they rejected claims that children could have contracted hiv through unsafe sex or as a result of abuse .
writing in the journal of obstetrics and gynaecology , they said : " for hundreds of thousands of south african children to have acquired hiv sexually , inordinately high levels of childhood sexual exposure would be required , a phenomenon unlikely to have been overlooked by paediatricians .
recent reports from south africa discourage this hypotheses . "
the researchers also examined other studies .
they said these also showed differences between hiv rates in children and the number of mother-to-child transmissions .
' mounting evidence ' they said the findings showed unsafe sex was no longer the main cause of hiv in africa .
" the common belief that hiv transmission in africa is driven by heterosexual exposure is no longer tenable , " they wrote .
" there is mounting evidence that rapid hiv transmission is fuelled by parenteral exposures in health care settings , especially medical injections but also including transfusion of untested blood and others .
" not only are injections popular among african patients , administered at an estimated 90 % of medical visits , but also often unnecessary and injection equipment is often used . "
the researchers said urgent action is needed to improve standards in south african clinics .
" they must educate their patients in the dangers of non-sterile injections and ensure that their own practices are beyond reproach . "
they said the findings could also be applied to other countries on the continent .
" we must protect patients from their own medical care system in all countries with similar epidemiological characteristics . "
claims rejected south africa has the largest hiv population in the world - one in five people are infected .
however , the south african government rejected claims children were contracting hiv through dirty needles .
dr nono simelela , head of its national hiv and aids programme , told bbc news online : " i have worked in clinics and hospitals in various part of our country - including some that were really poorly equipped .
" but nowhere have i seen practices that would make me conclude that dirty needles are the most probable explanation for this surprising rate of hiv-infection in children .
and i am confident my doubts would be shared by many other clinicians .
" i believe the matter needs to be much more closely interrogated before we form conclusions about the cause . "

the portuguese firm says it has bowed to public pressure and modified plans .
the company intends to replace the incinerator element of the plant with a thermal treatment facility .
hlc chairman horacio luis carvalho said the new plans will reduce harmful emissions .
" we have listened to the concerns about incineration and are responding both by seeking to reduce the volumes of residual waste . and including a state of the art renewable energy plant , " he said .
" this will ensure that wrexham not only meets its recycling targets , but also uses its waste to achieve renewable energy objectives . "

" we 're obviously very pleased that they 're taking public fears seriously but until we see the new plans it 's hard to know if this is a good alternative , " she said .

the final decision on whether it goes ahead will now be made by the welsh assembly planning committee following a public inquiry in june .
if the incinerator is given the go-ahead , the new plant to be built on wrexham industrial estate could deal with 120,000 tonnes of waste each year .
