taxpayers will save € 18 million , which the government will have to offset . chancellor gerhard schröder said on sunday his cabinet had agreed to push forward tax cuts worth € 18 billion -lrb- $ 20.5 billion -rrb- to inject life into germany 's sluggish economy . " we want a signal of revival to go out from this weekend to the people in our country , " schröder told a press conference .
" this government is improving the conditions for more growth in germany . " the government plans to lower income tax levels by 10 percent from 2004 , which will leave a € 18 billion in federal , state and town coffers .
schröder said the cuts would be paid for by reducing subsidies , privatization revenues and increased state debt .
subsidies alone would be reduced by € 45 billion by 2010 , he said . speaking at the end of three days of talks among cabinet members and leading social democrats and green party leaders at neuhardenberg palace outside of berlin , the chancellor said reforms do n't always hurt , they also pay off . encouraging growth the cuts are meant to help revive growth in europe 's biggest economy .
germany has experienced little growth in the past three years and unemployment has reached 4.45 million . the tax cuts will lower the bottom rate of income tax from 19.9 percent to 15.0 percent .
the top rate will decrease from 48.5 percent to 42.0 percent .
the cuts were originally planned for 2005 as the final step in a three-phase income tax reform . the additional € 18 million burden is likely to push the federal budget beyond constitutional limits that require investments to exceed deficit spending for the third successive year . both schröder and finance minister hans eichel said the government would aim to abide by european union agreement that stipulates euro zone members must keep their budget deficit below 3 percent of gross domestic product .
germany overshot the limit in 2002 and is expected to do so this year as well . approval in doubt if the bundesrat - which represents the states - approves the plan , german taxes will be reduced by a total of € 25 billion in one fell swoop in 2004 , when the second tier of tax reforms , worth € 7 million , will go into effect as well .
small- and middle-sized businesses and private households would save € 10 billion , schröder said . but things may not go the government 's way .
opposition leaders have rejected the plans .
christian socialist head edmund stoiber , who is also bavaria 's premier , said the opposition-controlled bundesrat would not approve of pushing forward the tax cuts .
the christian socialists and their larger sister party , the christian democrats , wanted to offer people tax relief , but it " must be accompanied by serious policies , " stoiber told ard television on sunday .
stoiber and christian democrat head angela merkel both said the cuts should not be financed by higher debt . but free democratic party leader guido westerwelle said he supported schröder 's plans , though he opposed increased debts .
" we are part of five state governments .
we wo n't allow a blockade in the bundesrat , " westerwelle stressed .
the head of the business-oriented party shares power with the christian democrats in almost one-third of germany 's 16 states . now finance minister hans eichel may be under additional pressure to rework the 2004 budget proposal he presented on thursday .

" we want a signal of revival to go out from this weekend to the people in our country , " schröder told a press conference .
" this government is improving the conditions for more growth in germany . " the government plans to lower income tax levels by 10 percent from 2004 , which will leave a € 18 billion in federal , state and town coffers .
schröder said the cuts would be paid for by reducing subsidies , privatization revenues and increased state debt .
subsidies alone would be reduced by € 45 billion by 2010 , he said . speaking at the end of three days of talks among cabinet members and leading social democrats and green party leaders at neuhardenberg palace outside of berlin , the chancellor said reforms do n't always hurt , they also pay off . encouraging growth the cuts are meant to help revive growth in europe 's biggest economy .
germany has experienced little growth in the past three years and unemployment has reached 4.45 million . the tax cuts will lower the bottom rate of income tax from 19.9 percent to 15.0 percent .
the top rate will decrease from 48.5 percent to 42.0 percent .
the cuts were originally planned for 2005 as the final step in a three-phase income tax reform . the additional € 18 million burden is likely to push the federal budget beyond constitutional limits that require investments to exceed deficit spending for the third successive year . both schröder and finance minister hans eichel said the government would aim to abide by european union agreement that stipulates euro zone members must keep their budget deficit below 3 percent of gross domestic product .

christian socialist head edmund stoiber , who is also bavaria 's premier , said the opposition-controlled bundesrat would not approve of pushing forward the tax cuts .
the christian socialists and their larger sister party , the christian democrats , wanted to offer people tax relief , but it " must be accompanied by serious policies , " stoiber told ard television on sunday .
stoiber and christian democrat head angela merkel both said the cuts should not be financed by higher debt . but free democratic party leader guido westerwelle said he supported schröder 's plans , though he opposed increased debts .

taxpayers will save € 18 million , which the government will have to offset . chancellor gerhard schröder said on sunday his cabinet had agreed to push forward tax cuts worth € 18 billion -lrb- $ 20.5 billion -rrb- to inject life into germany 's sluggish economy . " we want a signal of revival to go out from this weekend to the people in our country , " schröder told a press conference .
" this government is improving the conditions for more growth in germany . " the government plans to lower income tax levels by 10 percent from 2004 , which will leave a € 18 billion in federal , state and town coffers .
schröder said the cuts would be paid for by reducing subsidies , privatization revenues and increased state debt .
subsidies alone would be reduced by € 45 billion by 2010 , he said . speaking at the end of three days of talks among cabinet members and leading social democrats and green party leaders at neuhardenberg palace outside of berlin , the chancellor said reforms do n't always hurt , they also pay off . encouraging growth the cuts are meant to help revive growth in europe 's biggest economy .

" we want a signal of revival to go out from this weekend to the people in our country , " schröder told a press conference .
" this government is improving the conditions for more growth in germany . " the government plans to lower income tax levels by 10 percent from 2004 , which will leave a € 18 billion in federal , state and town coffers .
schröder said the cuts would be paid for by reducing subsidies , privatization revenues and increased state debt .
subsidies alone would be reduced by € 45 billion by 2010 , he said . speaking at the end of three days of talks among cabinet members and leading social democrats and green party leaders at neuhardenberg palace outside of berlin , the chancellor said reforms do n't always hurt , they also pay off . encouraging growth the cuts are meant to help revive growth in europe 's biggest economy .
germany has experienced little growth in the past three years and unemployment has reached 4.45 million . the tax cuts will lower the bottom rate of income tax from 19.9 percent to 15.0 percent .
the top rate will decrease from 48.5 percent to 42.0 percent .
the cuts were originally planned for 2005 as the final step in a three-phase income tax reform . the additional € 18 million burden is likely to push the federal budget beyond constitutional limits that require investments to exceed deficit spending for the third successive year . both schröder and finance minister hans eichel said the government would aim to abide by european union agreement that stipulates euro zone members must keep their budget deficit below 3 percent of gross domestic product .
germany overshot the limit in 2002 and is expected to do so this year as well . approval in doubt if the bundesrat - which represents the states - approves the plan , german taxes will be reduced by a total of € 25 billion in one fell swoop in 2004 , when the second tier of tax reforms , worth € 7 million , will go into effect as well .
small- and middle-sized businesses and private households would save € 10 billion , schröder said . but things may not go the government 's way .
opposition leaders have rejected the plans .
christian socialist head edmund stoiber , who is also bavaria 's premier , said the opposition-controlled bundesrat would not approve of pushing forward the tax cuts .
the christian socialists and their larger sister party , the christian democrats , wanted to offer people tax relief , but it " must be accompanied by serious policies , " stoiber told ard television on sunday .
stoiber and christian democrat head angela merkel both said the cuts should not be financed by higher debt . but free democratic party leader guido westerwelle said he supported schröder 's plans , though he opposed increased debts .
" we are part of five state governments .
we wo n't allow a blockade in the bundesrat , " westerwelle stressed .

taxpayers will save € 18 million , which the government will have to offset . chancellor gerhard schröder said on sunday his cabinet had agreed to push forward tax cuts worth € 18 billion -lrb- $ 20.5 billion -rrb- to inject life into germany 's sluggish economy . " we want a signal of revival to go out from this weekend to the people in our country , " schröder told a press conference .
" this government is improving the conditions for more growth in germany . " the government plans to lower income tax levels by 10 percent from 2004 , which will leave a € 18 billion in federal , state and town coffers .
schröder said the cuts would be paid for by reducing subsidies , privatization revenues and increased state debt .
subsidies alone would be reduced by € 45 billion by 2010 , he said . speaking at the end of three days of talks among cabinet members and leading social democrats and green party leaders at neuhardenberg palace outside of berlin , the chancellor said reforms do n't always hurt , they also pay off . encouraging growth the cuts are meant to help revive growth in europe 's biggest economy .
germany has experienced little growth in the past three years and unemployment has reached 4.45 million . the tax cuts will lower the bottom rate of income tax from 19.9 percent to 15.0 percent .
the top rate will decrease from 48.5 percent to 42.0 percent .
the cuts were originally planned for 2005 as the final step in a three-phase income tax reform . the additional € 18 million burden is likely to push the federal budget beyond constitutional limits that require investments to exceed deficit spending for the third successive year . both schröder and finance minister hans eichel said the government would aim to abide by european union agreement that stipulates euro zone members must keep their budget deficit below 3 percent of gross domestic product .

small- and middle-sized businesses and private households would save € 10 billion , schröder said . but things may not go the government 's way .
opposition leaders have rejected the plans .
christian socialist head edmund stoiber , who is also bavaria 's premier , said the opposition-controlled bundesrat would not approve of pushing forward the tax cuts .
the christian socialists and their larger sister party , the christian democrats , wanted to offer people tax relief , but it " must be accompanied by serious policies , " stoiber told ard television on sunday .
stoiber and christian democrat head angela merkel both said the cuts should not be financed by higher debt . but free democratic party leader guido westerwelle said he supported schröder 's plans , though he opposed increased debts .
" we are part of five state governments .
we wo n't allow a blockade in the bundesrat , " westerwelle stressed .
the head of the business-oriented party shares power with the christian democrats in almost one-third of germany 's 16 states . now finance minister hans eichel may be under additional pressure to rework the 2004 budget proposal he presented on thursday .

lord herman ouseley , former head of the commission for racial equality , said police were wrong to claim racial tensions did not play a part in the unrest on wrexham 's caia park .
the violence which began late last sunday with a clash between iraqi kurdish refugees and local people continued on monday night when a mob of around 200 attacked police with missiles and petrol bombs .
north wales police said racial tension played a part in the initial outburst but the second clash was prompted by " criminality , pure and simple " .
but lord ouseley , who produced a report on the 2001 race riots in bradford , told bbc radio four 's today programme that racism was an ongoing problem across the whole region .
much of the violence centred on a pub on the caia park estate " there may not appear to be a history that is obvious , but i think in north wales , if you ask anyone from the minority communities , there has been a pattern of low-level racism , harassment , name-calling .
" there is evidence to show that exists .
even though it is not something that has been overtly in the public eye , it has been there .
" it would be wrong for people to be in denial to suggest that race is n't a factor , that there is n't prejudice , that there were n't hostilities or indeed hatred .
" while it always takes a small incident it then brings to the surface the prejudices that exist , particularly as we have seen the way asylum seekers and refugees have been demonised .
and that becomes a factor .
" where you have got the combination of communities who have grievances as was just expressed of poor housing , long-term association with criminals , anti-social drug activity in an area of deprivation , then some of the resentment can spill over in to hostilities to newcomers . "
arrests he said local authorities should make sure people realised that new arrivals in their area did not enjoy preferential treatment .
calm was restored on caia park on tuesday and wednesday evenings , but there has been an increased police presence there since the trouble flared up .
police have arrested 47 people in connection with the disturbances and 30 people have been charged .

lord herman ouseley , former head of the commission for racial equality , said police were wrong to claim racial tensions did not play a part in the unrest on wrexham 's caia park .
the violence which began late last sunday with a clash between iraqi kurdish refugees and local people continued on monday night when a mob of around 200 attacked police with missiles and petrol bombs .
north wales police said racial tension played a part in the initial outburst but the second clash was prompted by " criminality , pure and simple " .
but lord ouseley , who produced a report on the 2001 race riots in bradford , told bbc radio four 's today programme that racism was an ongoing problem across the whole region .
much of the violence centred on a pub on the caia park estate " there may not appear to be a history that is obvious , but i think in north wales , if you ask anyone from the minority communities , there has been a pattern of low-level racism , harassment , name-calling .
" there is evidence to show that exists .
even though it is not something that has been overtly in the public eye , it has been there .
" it would be wrong for people to be in denial to suggest that race is n't a factor , that there is n't prejudice , that there were n't hostilities or indeed hatred .
" while it always takes a small incident it then brings to the surface the prejudices that exist , particularly as we have seen the way asylum seekers and refugees have been demonised .
and that becomes a factor .
" where you have got the combination of communities who have grievances as was just expressed of poor housing , long-term association with criminals , anti-social drug activity in an area of deprivation , then some of the resentment can spill over in to hostilities to newcomers . "
arrests he said local authorities should make sure people realised that new arrivals in their area did not enjoy preferential treatment .
calm was restored on caia park on tuesday and wednesday evenings , but there has been an increased police presence there since the trouble flared up .
police have arrested 47 people in connection with the disturbances and 30 people have been charged .

the pope said eu policy-makers should rediscover their christian roots .
the pope 's stance is supported by italy and poland a draft constitution presented to european leaders at their recent summit in greece referred to the " cultural , religious and humanist inheritance " of europe , but not to its christian tradition .
the pope has issued a lengthy document - a so-called exhortation to the church in europe - in which he urges those drawing up the constitution to include a reference to the religious , and in particular the christian heritage of the continent .
he also wants churches and other religious bodies to have a recognised status as social bodies , arguing that they are far more than merely private entities .
the draft constitution was accepted by the eu leaders as a good basis for negotiation , but it now goes to a commission of member governments which could make substantial changes .
muslim applicants so the lobbying goes on - not just by the vatican , but by the greek orthodox church and centre-right parties in italy , spain , portugal and poland .
but there are strong arguments against endorsing any particular religion in a constitution for the europe of the future .
many european countries have substantial minorities who are not from christian traditions .
and one muslim country , turkey , is already in the queue of countries waiting to join , with bosnia and albania expected to apply in the not-too-distant future .
