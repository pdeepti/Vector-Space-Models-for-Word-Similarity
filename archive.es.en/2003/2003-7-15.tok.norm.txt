after the u.s. senate decided to request nato help in postwar iraq , speculation is spreading in germany about a possible military deployment , despite concerns about the army ’ s overstretched capacities . with the german military or bundeswehr grappling with peacekeeping operations in three continents at present , the political discussion on a possible military involvement in postwar iraq has been dominated by ground realities .
karsten voigt , coordinator for german-u.s. relations in the german government told the berlin daily tagesspiegel on tuesday the bush administration wasn ’ t expecting a quick german contribution in iraq and was aware the german military was stretched to the limit with its foreign deployments .
voigt added foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in the u.s. , would not be " pressurized " by bush on the question .
even parliamentary foreign policy spokesman for germany ’ s opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- said last week , " i think our friends know that we have limited resources . "
indeed , with about 9,000 soldiers scattered in the balkans , afghanistan and as far as the horn of africa , the german army , plagued in recent years by chronic underfunding and in the thick of a radical overhaul , has its hands full .
army overworked , but can still do iraq wilfried stolze , spokesman for the federal armed forces union , told deutsche welle another foreign deployment would massively step up the logistical and financial burden on the bundeswehr .
" after all , the german army right now is undergoing its biggest shake-up in history , " he explained .
restructuring plans include modernizing the army , trimming the number of civilian jobs while at the same time increasing the number of soldiers -lrb- from 282,000 to 300,000 -rrb- , slashing military spending and training troops to gear up for new military challenges , including foreign deployments .
stolze said a u.s. request for military help in iraq would pose a big problem to the overburdened bundeswehr .
" what we lack is manpower – especially specialists such as paramedics and radio operators .
besides , another foreign deployment would involve a huge initial operation within germany .
we simply can ’ t afford that . "
at the same time stolze did not rule out the bundesweher scraping together troops if it came down to it and said realistically about 1,500 to 2,000 soldiers could be sent to iraq .
" however , what ’ s important is that the mandate is a limited and robust one – the soldiers have to be well-armed – and that it takes place under u.n. auspices , " he added .
u.s. turns to nato for help in iraq the present discussion over an iraq deployment follows a request last week by the united states senate to the nato military alliance for support to reinforce the 147,000 american troops serving as occupying forces in iraq .
continuing resistance from iraqi groups , mounting american and british casualties and rising costs of maintaining a huge peacekeeping operation in iraq has forced the u.s. to seek broader international support .
though no concrete request has come in as yet from the u.s. , german government spokesman bela anda said over the weekend it was possible a request would be received at the nato council in brussels after the summer break .
so far the reaction from nato countries , prominently germany and france , has been lukewarm .
both say there is no adequate united nations mandate to legitimize their presence in iraq .
france , like germany , is also heavily involved in foreign military deployments in the balkans , ivory coast , congo and afghanistan .
germany : nothing without a u.n. mandate german chancellor gerhard schröder , whose antiwar and pro-u.n. stance when the u.s. invaded iraq strained relations with washington , said in a television interview last week his government would not send troops to iraq except in a nato context and only with a specific mandate from the u.n. he said the bush administration had already been informed of his position .
the chancellor ’ s coalition government also has the support of the conservative opposition in insisting that the u.n. needs to play the central role in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq .
politicians still divided about possible deployment however , the hard realities of the army ’ s stretched capabilities now has german politicians speculating on what alternative help germany could provide in iraq under a u.n. mandate .
on tuesday , foreign policy speaker of the opposition cdu , friedbert pflüger , said in a newspaper interview that germany would have to contribute towards rebuilding civil society and securing peace in iraq if nato were to receive a request to that effect from the u.n. he suggested reducing the number of german peacekeepers in the balkans in order to facilitate sending troops to iraq .
" we have to watch out in any case that we don ’ t throw away this great chance through mistakes , " he said in a reference to germany ’ s shunning by washington earlier this year after berlin refused to support the u.s.-led war in iraq .
however members of schröder ’ s social democrat and the green government are vehemently against sending german troops to iraq , even under a u.n. mandate .
leader of the social democrat parliamentary group gernot erler said german police and aid workers could be sent to iraq , but not the army .
" nobody can really expect a country , that so clearly rejected the iraq war , to send in soldiers there , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany : no nato in iraq without un if the united states hopes to get nato soldiers side-by-side with their own in iraq , they will have to involve the united nations .
that message came loud and clear out of berlin on friday -lrb- july 12 , 2003 -rrb- .
european press review : the u.n. could at last get its chance in iraq european papers on friday focused on the increasingly risk-fraught attempt by the americans to restore order in postwar iraq and the erosion of president bush 's credibility -lrb- july 11 , 2003 -rrb- .

chirac , speaking in his traditional live televised interview , said he wanted euro zone finance ministers to " examine together provisional ways of easing " the stability and growth pact underpinning their economies .
he added that he wanted to see changes " coherent with the imperative of stability , and ensuring growth is not diminished " .
the french president added that while he respected the pact 's rules , a more political interpretation was needed to allow members of the 12 country euro zone greater freedom to maneuver .
" this is not about modifying the stability pact .
it 's a case of getting the representatives of euro zone nations to examine together the terms of a temporary softening , " he said .

"
austria 's economy minister karl-heinz grasser said , " we should n't even be discussing this - it 's one of the pillars of our economic policy and the single currency . " the pact , which aims to keep public debt levels in check and maintain confidence in the common currency , dictates that a budget deficit can not exceed more than 3 percent of national economic output .

germany ’ s finance minister hans eichel , who is himself grappling with a spiraling budget deficit , stopped short of echoing president chirac 's call for a relaxing of the rules , saying that the pact is , in fact , adapted to the current economic situation .
“ we consider that the pact in its current shape is appropriate to create monetary stability , ” said eichel .
“ but it is also suitable to achieve economic growth which is more important now .
and that is why we don ’ t need a debate about relaxing the pact . ” keeping the budget in line france , germany and portugal have all come under fire from the european commission for allowing their public deficits to exceed the 3 percent limit as they struggle to revive their stagnant economies .
however , france 's more cavalier approach to the stability and growth pact has been one issue on which it has exchanged open disagreement with germany , its key ally . the german government has often pledged to try to keep its deficit in line with the rules – a seemingly empty promise in the light of germany ’ s persistent failure to do so despite recent hefty tax cuts initiated to spur growth .

thirteen years after the collapse of communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- , kitschy nostalgia for a lost culture still lives on in berlin .
plans for a gdr-themed amusement park are now in the works for the capital . whether it ’ s drab wallpaper and tacky east german paraphernalia adorning berlin ’ s hip cafes , bleak prefabricated highrises that are all the rage or the success of films such as goodbye lenin , the german capital ’ s hip and trendy crowd are still enamoured by the former communist east germany ’ s retro-socialist appeal .
" ostalgie , " a twist on the german word for nostalgia -lrb- nostalgie -rrb- seems here to stay .
with little left of the berlin wall , people seem to be scrambling to uncover the remaining traces of the fallen east german state in berlin .

as the bids close on tuesday for the candidate cities vying to host the 2012 summer olympics , germany 's hope , leipzig , is outlining its plans to make itself as attractive as possible . more than 40,000 people celebrated in the streets of leipzig in april when the city was chosen as germany 's hope to host the next olympic games . the east german city beat off competition from hamburg , düsseldorf , frankfurt and stuttgart to host the summer games in 2012 .
rostock , which was chosen to host the olympic sailing competition in the german bid , vied against the port cities of kiel , lübeck , stralsund and cuxhaven . but as candidate cities all over the world enter the second and final selection round to host the oldest competitive games today , the real work starts for leipzig , which is hoping to boost jobs and make its region - which like much of the formerly communist eastern germany is suffering from economic doldrums - into a town the international olympic committee ca n't turn down when it makes its final decision in early 2005 . germany has not hosted the olympics since the 1972 summer games in munich , which where marred after palestinian terrorists held the israeli team hostage .
two were shot dead by gunmen and nine others died during an ill-fated rescue attempt which turned the event into one of the darkest events in olympic history . sprucing up the city leipzig is eager to create some positive olympic history for germany . some € 30 million -lrb- $ 33.98 million -rrb- is set to be invested in the city in preparation for the next stage of its olympic bid . most of the money will come from the state of saxony , of which leipzig is second-largest city after dresden .
leipzig and its partner cities are also expected to contribute .
leipzig has already doubled its order for new trams for the city -lrb- the cost of which has already run into millions of euros -rrb- .
it will also have to prove to the international olympic committee it can provide a minimum of 42,000 hotel rooms and cope with an influx of 150,000 participants and as many as 500,000 spectators during each day of the competition . demands from city leaders are increasing for additional redevelopment projects in the city , where infrastructure languished and deteriorated under decades of communist rule until the fall of the berlin wall in 1990 and german reunification . indeed , the push from outlying leipzig areas to get their hands on funds earmarked for the olympic effort has become a strain .
so much so , in fact , that leipzig mayor wolfgang tiefensee has been forced to decide to keep the olympic efforts within a 10-kilometer radius of the city center . a massive and expensive endeavor all of this does not come cheap , of course .
if leipzig does win its bid , the city will have to raise an estimated € 2.6 billion to construct the sports halls , olympic playing fields and residential village that the enormous event requires .
how this funding will be split between local , state and federal governments remains an open question . but if € 2.6 billion has leipzig 's purse-string holders quaking in their boots , they can take comfort in the fact that the games have served as an economic booster for a number of host cities , which have in many cases made a profit on their initial investment . the games helped places like munich , which hosted the summer olympics in 1972 and barcelona , which played host in 1992 , transform themselves into world cities .
others enjoyed windfalls from sales of tv rights , advertising and ticket sales .
sydney , which hosted the last summer olympics , made a cool € 1.5 billion . but for leipzig , winning the games would mean a whole lot more .
in addition to the symbolic importance of awarding the games to a city that has pushed for the past 12 years to become a business center , it would also create much needed jobs in a languishing labor market . with an average unemployment rate of 18.3 percent , the number of jobless in eastern germany is more than double that in western germany .
between 1992 and 1998 , the federal government poured € 600 billion into the local economy , but it has still failed to bloom . olympics as economic booster shot local business leaders have said the olympics could create as many as 38,000 jobs by 2012 , though many would disappear again after the olympics . the dream might come true for leipzig .
although one of the smaller cities competing to host the games , leipzig has heard encouraging words from the olympic organizers . " germany , leipzig and rostock have good chances .
we know they are exacting in organization and have a team with good experience , " international olympic committee president jacques rogge said in april .
" other small cities have had the olympic games , too , like lillehammer -lrb- in norway -rrb- .

chirac , speaking in his traditional live televised interview , said he wanted euro zone finance ministers to " examine together provisional ways of easing " the stability and growth pact underpinning their economies .
he added that he wanted to see changes " coherent with the imperative of stability , and ensuring growth is not diminished " .
the french president added that while he respected the pact 's rules , a more political interpretation was needed to allow members of the 12 country euro zone greater freedom to maneuver .
" this is not about modifying the stability pact .
it 's a case of getting the representatives of euro zone nations to examine together the terms of a temporary softening , " he said .
“ -lrb- ministers -rrb- must find a solution that is both consistent with the imperative of stability yet that avoids any lowering of growth prospects " . storming the stability pact on a day when france remembered the historic event that led to the formation of the republic , the timing of chirac ’ s statement was not lost on those eu finance ministers who reacted angrily to the french president ’ s words . “ this is july 14 , the day the bastille was stormed , and now it 's the day the stability pact has been stormed , ” said dutch finance minister gerrit zalm angrily going into a meeting of ecofin , the group of eu finance ministers , in brussels on monday night .
“ the storming of the bastille was a better idea . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes .
" the pact does not need to be modified , " said pedro solbes , the eu ’ s economic and monetary affairs commissioner -lrb- photo -rrb- , adding that the european commission had immediately rejected chirac ’ s requests . finland ’ s antii kalliomaki told reporters outside the ecofin meeting , “ we have no room for softening the pact , not even temporarily . "
austria 's economy minister karl-heinz grasser said , " we should n't even be discussing this - it 's one of the pillars of our economic policy and the single currency . " the pact , which aims to keep public debt levels in check and maintain confidence in the common currency , dictates that a budget deficit can not exceed more than 3 percent of national economic output .
france , the euro zone 's second biggest economy behind germany , had a public deficit of 3.1 percent in 2002 and the european commission 's provisional forecasts see it rising to 3.7 percent this year and 3.6 percent in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel .
germany ’ s finance minister hans eichel , who is himself grappling with a spiraling budget deficit , stopped short of echoing president chirac 's call for a relaxing of the rules , saying that the pact is , in fact , adapted to the current economic situation .
“ we consider that the pact in its current shape is appropriate to create monetary stability , ” said eichel .
“ but it is also suitable to achieve economic growth which is more important now .
and that is why we don ’ t need a debate about relaxing the pact . ” keeping the budget in line france , germany and portugal have all come under fire from the european commission for allowing their public deficits to exceed the 3 percent limit as they struggle to revive their stagnant economies .
however , france 's more cavalier approach to the stability and growth pact has been one issue on which it has exchanged open disagreement with germany , its key ally . the german government has often pledged to try to keep its deficit in line with the rules – a seemingly empty promise in the light of germany ’ s persistent failure to do so despite recent hefty tax cuts initiated to spur growth .
france , however , has often brazenly declared that it will not be able to adhere to the pact in its current form and would therefore not even try .
jacques chirac did , however , offer a softener of his own on monday by saying that he would , if possible , continue with his electoral promise of tax cuts to stimulate french growth . france and germany have failed to adhere to the 3 percent deficit limit for two years now .
if the eu ’ s executive commission forecasts are proved right later this year and both countries break the pact for a third year running , the commission will have no other choice but to either impose fines of several billion euro or bow to pressure and ease the pact ’ s conditions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german tax cuts unsettle brussels the announcement that germany ’ s cabinet was approving tax cuts sent ripples through the eu , which worries that the euro zone ’ s biggest economy could incur even more debt and run amiss of the stability and growth pact .

thirteen years after the collapse of communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- , kitschy nostalgia for a lost culture still lives on in berlin .
plans for a gdr-themed amusement park are now in the works for the capital . whether it ’ s drab wallpaper and tacky east german paraphernalia adorning berlin ’ s hip cafes , bleak prefabricated highrises that are all the rage or the success of films such as goodbye lenin , the german capital ’ s hip and trendy crowd are still enamoured by the former communist east germany ’ s retro-socialist appeal .
" ostalgie , " a twist on the german word for nostalgia -lrb- nostalgie -rrb- seems here to stay .
with little left of the berlin wall , people seem to be scrambling to uncover the remaining traces of the fallen east german state in berlin .
enter berlin entrepreneur peter massine , who has big plans to cash in on the rage for all things east german .
famous for producing the local production of the musical grease , his company " massine productions " is now investing € 1.2 million -lrb- $ 1.35 million -rrb- to set up a gdr-themed amusement park in the former east berlin industrial district of oberschöneweide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german trabant cars pass spectators during a procession to mark the ninth anniversary of german reunification symbolizing the fall of the wall ten years ago in berlin october 3 , 1999 .
complete with rides in boxy east german trabant cars -lrb- photo -rrb- , guards outfitted in communist and border patrol uniforms and pedestrian traffic signals with the trademark green walking man with flat-brimmed hat and jaunty step , the sprawling park spread over 10,000 square meters is designed to capture a slice of east german communist life .
organizers plan to hire about 20 long-term jobless east germans over 50 years of age to play border guards , traffic policemen and canteen personnel .
the gdr park is expected to open its doors next summer .
from spreewald cucumbers to secret spies the tour will begin with a formal arrival at a checkpoint where visitors must pass countless guards and officials scrutinizing papers and identification cards , as was the case during the cold war , and will include a forced exchange of western deutsche marks for eastern ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german consumer products .
visitors will then be able to take a trip through east germany ’ s sparse consumer offerings that have today become cult products in the west -lrb- photo -rrb- - offering everything from spreewald forest 's famous small cucumbers to vita-cola to " rondo " coffee to rotkäppchen sparkling wine to drab clothes and colorful shopping bags .
the organizers are even planning to build a model of the karl marx allee , east berlin ’ s expansive shopping boulevard .
visitors can drop in on a real east german living room outfitted with flowery wallpaper , paintings of socialist factory life and cupboards stocked with special plates marking anniversaries of the founding of the east german state .
even models of the east germans ’ beloved dachas or weekend cottages with their own garden patch will offer visitors a rare glimpse into a leisurely break from the socialist system ’ s rigid work routine .
for those craving the thrill and intrigue of the cold war era , omnipresent stasi -lrb- east german secret police -rrb- spies will whet the appetite .
songs praising the virtues of hard work and content will also be piped in throughout the park by outdoor speakers .
not a gdr disneyland massine said the park is primarily targeted at a german audience that would likely spark entirely different reactions from west germans and their eastern counterparts .
but he 's also hoping to lure busloads of ubiquitous jet-setting americans and japanese . he hopes the mini-gdr will become a highlight of their marathon bus tours to places like the postcard-pretty neuschwanstein castle and heidelberg , while at the same time offering what he is promoting as an authentic view of socialist germany .
authentic is the operative word here .
massine has stressed that the amusement park is no way conceived as a gdr disneyland .
instead , the aim is to showcase a real slice of everyday life in the former east germany .
to that end , the organizers have been scrupulously researching the culture of the gdr and have read up on the vast documentation available about the fallen state .
kornelia lobmeier of the contemporary history forum in leipzig said putting the amusement park in the right historical context is of paramount importance .
" the amusement park is fundamentally not a bad idea when it contributes towards people dealing with the history of the gdr , " she said .

thirteen years after the collapse of communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- , kitschy nostalgia for a lost culture still lives on in berlin .
plans for a gdr-themed amusement park are now in the works for the capital . whether it ’ s drab wallpaper and tacky east german paraphernalia adorning berlin ’ s hip cafes , bleak prefabricated highrises that are all the rage or the success of films such as goodbye lenin , the german capital ’ s hip and trendy crowd are still enamoured by the former communist east germany ’ s retro-socialist appeal .
" ostalgie , " a twist on the german word for nostalgia -lrb- nostalgie -rrb- seems here to stay .
with little left of the berlin wall , people seem to be scrambling to uncover the remaining traces of the fallen east german state in berlin .
enter berlin entrepreneur peter massine , who has big plans to cash in on the rage for all things east german .
famous for producing the local production of the musical grease , his company " massine productions " is now investing € 1.2 million -lrb- $ 1.35 million -rrb- to set up a gdr-themed amusement park in the former east berlin industrial district of oberschöneweide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german trabant cars pass spectators during a procession to mark the ninth anniversary of german reunification symbolizing the fall of the wall ten years ago in berlin october 3 , 1999 .
complete with rides in boxy east german trabant cars -lrb- photo -rrb- , guards outfitted in communist and border patrol uniforms and pedestrian traffic signals with the trademark green walking man with flat-brimmed hat and jaunty step , the sprawling park spread over 10,000 square meters is designed to capture a slice of east german communist life .
organizers plan to hire about 20 long-term jobless east germans over 50 years of age to play border guards , traffic policemen and canteen personnel .
the gdr park is expected to open its doors next summer .
from spreewald cucumbers to secret spies the tour will begin with a formal arrival at a checkpoint where visitors must pass countless guards and officials scrutinizing papers and identification cards , as was the case during the cold war , and will include a forced exchange of western deutsche marks for eastern ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german consumer products .
visitors will then be able to take a trip through east germany ’ s sparse consumer offerings that have today become cult products in the west -lrb- photo -rrb- - offering everything from spreewald forest 's famous small cucumbers to vita-cola to " rondo " coffee to rotkäppchen sparkling wine to drab clothes and colorful shopping bags .
the organizers are even planning to build a model of the karl marx allee , east berlin ’ s expansive shopping boulevard .
visitors can drop in on a real east german living room outfitted with flowery wallpaper , paintings of socialist factory life and cupboards stocked with special plates marking anniversaries of the founding of the east german state .
even models of the east germans ’ beloved dachas or weekend cottages with their own garden patch will offer visitors a rare glimpse into a leisurely break from the socialist system ’ s rigid work routine .
for those craving the thrill and intrigue of the cold war era , omnipresent stasi -lrb- east german secret police -rrb- spies will whet the appetite .
songs praising the virtues of hard work and content will also be piped in throughout the park by outdoor speakers .
not a gdr disneyland massine said the park is primarily targeted at a german audience that would likely spark entirely different reactions from west germans and their eastern counterparts .
but he 's also hoping to lure busloads of ubiquitous jet-setting americans and japanese . he hopes the mini-gdr will become a highlight of their marathon bus tours to places like the postcard-pretty neuschwanstein castle and heidelberg , while at the same time offering what he is promoting as an authentic view of socialist germany .
authentic is the operative word here .
massine has stressed that the amusement park is no way conceived as a gdr disneyland .
instead , the aim is to showcase a real slice of everyday life in the former east germany .
to that end , the organizers have been scrupulously researching the culture of the gdr and have read up on the vast documentation available about the fallen state .
kornelia lobmeier of the contemporary history forum in leipzig said putting the amusement park in the right historical context is of paramount importance .
" the amusement park is fundamentally not a bad idea when it contributes towards people dealing with the history of the gdr , " she said .
lobmeier , however , warned that if the park only superficially satisfied curiosity and fueled a nostalgic element , then it ran the danger of playing down the darker side of the gdr - a world where neighbors spied on each other and people were denied basic rights because of their political or religious beliefs .

after the u.s. senate decided to request nato help in postwar iraq , speculation is spreading in germany about a possible military deployment , despite concerns about the army ’ s overstretched capacities . with the german military or bundeswehr grappling with peacekeeping operations in three continents at present , the political discussion on a possible military involvement in postwar iraq has been dominated by ground realities .
karsten voigt , coordinator for german-u.s. relations in the german government told the berlin daily tagesspiegel on tuesday the bush administration wasn ’ t expecting a quick german contribution in iraq and was aware the german military was stretched to the limit with its foreign deployments .
voigt added foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in the u.s. , would not be " pressurized " by bush on the question .
even parliamentary foreign policy spokesman for germany ’ s opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- said last week , " i think our friends know that we have limited resources . "
indeed , with about 9,000 soldiers scattered in the balkans , afghanistan and as far as the horn of africa , the german army , plagued in recent years by chronic underfunding and in the thick of a radical overhaul , has its hands full .
army overworked , but can still do iraq wilfried stolze , spokesman for the federal armed forces union , told deutsche welle another foreign deployment would massively step up the logistical and financial burden on the bundeswehr .
" after all , the german army right now is undergoing its biggest shake-up in history , " he explained .
restructuring plans include modernizing the army , trimming the number of civilian jobs while at the same time increasing the number of soldiers -lrb- from 282,000 to 300,000 -rrb- , slashing military spending and training troops to gear up for new military challenges , including foreign deployments .
stolze said a u.s. request for military help in iraq would pose a big problem to the overburdened bundeswehr .
" what we lack is manpower – especially specialists such as paramedics and radio operators .
besides , another foreign deployment would involve a huge initial operation within germany .
we simply can ’ t afford that . "
at the same time stolze did not rule out the bundesweher scraping together troops if it came down to it and said realistically about 1,500 to 2,000 soldiers could be sent to iraq .
" however , what ’ s important is that the mandate is a limited and robust one – the soldiers have to be well-armed – and that it takes place under u.n. auspices , " he added .
u.s. turns to nato for help in iraq the present discussion over an iraq deployment follows a request last week by the united states senate to the nato military alliance for support to reinforce the 147,000 american troops serving as occupying forces in iraq .
continuing resistance from iraqi groups , mounting american and british casualties and rising costs of maintaining a huge peacekeeping operation in iraq has forced the u.s. to seek broader international support .
though no concrete request has come in as yet from the u.s. , german government spokesman bela anda said over the weekend it was possible a request would be received at the nato council in brussels after the summer break .
so far the reaction from nato countries , prominently germany and france , has been lukewarm .
both say there is no adequate united nations mandate to legitimize their presence in iraq .
france , like germany , is also heavily involved in foreign military deployments in the balkans , ivory coast , congo and afghanistan .
germany : nothing without a u.n. mandate german chancellor gerhard schröder , whose antiwar and pro-u.n. stance when the u.s. invaded iraq strained relations with washington , said in a television interview last week his government would not send troops to iraq except in a nato context and only with a specific mandate from the u.n. he said the bush administration had already been informed of his position .
the chancellor ’ s coalition government also has the support of the conservative opposition in insisting that the u.n. needs to play the central role in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq .
politicians still divided about possible deployment however , the hard realities of the army ’ s stretched capabilities now has german politicians speculating on what alternative help germany could provide in iraq under a u.n. mandate .
on tuesday , foreign policy speaker of the opposition cdu , friedbert pflüger , said in a newspaper interview that germany would have to contribute towards rebuilding civil society and securing peace in iraq if nato were to receive a request to that effect from the u.n. he suggested reducing the number of german peacekeepers in the balkans in order to facilitate sending troops to iraq .
" we have to watch out in any case that we don ’ t throw away this great chance through mistakes , " he said in a reference to germany ’ s shunning by washington earlier this year after berlin refused to support the u.s.-led war in iraq .
however members of schröder ’ s social democrat and the green government are vehemently against sending german troops to iraq , even under a u.n. mandate .
leader of the social democrat parliamentary group gernot erler said german police and aid workers could be sent to iraq , but not the army .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.07.2003 for leipzig , the olympic dream begins großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tired of watching world athletic championships on tv , residents of leipzig want to bring the olympics to their backyards .
as the bids close on tuesday for the candidate cities vying to host the 2012 summer olympics , germany 's hope , leipzig , is outlining its plans to make itself as attractive as possible . more than 40,000 people celebrated in the streets of leipzig in april when the city was chosen as germany 's hope to host the next olympic games . the east german city beat off competition from hamburg , düsseldorf , frankfurt and stuttgart to host the summer games in 2012 .
rostock , which was chosen to host the olympic sailing competition in the german bid , vied against the port cities of kiel , lübeck , stralsund and cuxhaven . but as candidate cities all over the world enter the second and final selection round to host the oldest competitive games today , the real work starts for leipzig , which is hoping to boost jobs and make its region - which like much of the formerly communist eastern germany is suffering from economic doldrums - into a town the international olympic committee ca n't turn down when it makes its final decision in early 2005 . germany has not hosted the olympics since the 1972 summer games in munich , which where marred after palestinian terrorists held the israeli team hostage .
two were shot dead by gunmen and nine others died during an ill-fated rescue attempt which turned the event into one of the darkest events in olympic history . sprucing up the city leipzig is eager to create some positive olympic history for germany . some € 30 million -lrb- $ 33.98 million -rrb- is set to be invested in the city in preparation for the next stage of its olympic bid . most of the money will come from the state of saxony , of which leipzig is second-largest city after dresden .
leipzig and its partner cities are also expected to contribute .
leipzig has already doubled its order for new trams for the city -lrb- the cost of which has already run into millions of euros -rrb- .
it will also have to prove to the international olympic committee it can provide a minimum of 42,000 hotel rooms and cope with an influx of 150,000 participants and as many as 500,000 spectators during each day of the competition . demands from city leaders are increasing for additional redevelopment projects in the city , where infrastructure languished and deteriorated under decades of communist rule until the fall of the berlin wall in 1990 and german reunification . indeed , the push from outlying leipzig areas to get their hands on funds earmarked for the olympic effort has become a strain .
so much so , in fact , that leipzig mayor wolfgang tiefensee has been forced to decide to keep the olympic efforts within a 10-kilometer radius of the city center . a massive and expensive endeavor all of this does not come cheap , of course .
if leipzig does win its bid , the city will have to raise an estimated € 2.6 billion to construct the sports halls , olympic playing fields and residential village that the enormous event requires .
how this funding will be split between local , state and federal governments remains an open question . but if € 2.6 billion has leipzig 's purse-string holders quaking in their boots , they can take comfort in the fact that the games have served as an economic booster for a number of host cities , which have in many cases made a profit on their initial investment . the games helped places like munich , which hosted the summer olympics in 1972 and barcelona , which played host in 1992 , transform themselves into world cities .
others enjoyed windfalls from sales of tv rights , advertising and ticket sales .
sydney , which hosted the last summer olympics , made a cool € 1.5 billion . but for leipzig , winning the games would mean a whole lot more .
in addition to the symbolic importance of awarding the games to a city that has pushed for the past 12 years to become a business center , it would also create much needed jobs in a languishing labor market . with an average unemployment rate of 18.3 percent , the number of jobless in eastern germany is more than double that in western germany .
between 1992 and 1998 , the federal government poured € 600 billion into the local economy , but it has still failed to bloom . olympics as economic booster shot local business leaders have said the olympics could create as many as 38,000 jobs by 2012 , though many would disappear again after the olympics . the dream might come true for leipzig .
although one of the smaller cities competing to host the games , leipzig has heard encouraging words from the olympic organizers . " germany , leipzig and rostock have good chances .
we know they are exacting in organization and have a team with good experience , " international olympic committee president jacques rogge said in april .
" other small cities have had the olympic games , too , like lillehammer -lrb- in norway -rrb- .
helsinki was n't big either .
we want to reduce gigantism . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de and the winner is ...

as the bids close on tuesday for the candidate cities vying to host the 2012 summer olympics , germany 's hope , leipzig , is outlining its plans to make itself as attractive as possible . more than 40,000 people celebrated in the streets of leipzig in april when the city was chosen as germany 's hope to host the next olympic games . the east german city beat off competition from hamburg , düsseldorf , frankfurt and stuttgart to host the summer games in 2012 .
rostock , which was chosen to host the olympic sailing competition in the german bid , vied against the port cities of kiel , lübeck , stralsund and cuxhaven . but as candidate cities all over the world enter the second and final selection round to host the oldest competitive games today , the real work starts for leipzig , which is hoping to boost jobs and make its region - which like much of the formerly communist eastern germany is suffering from economic doldrums - into a town the international olympic committee ca n't turn down when it makes its final decision in early 2005 . germany has not hosted the olympics since the 1972 summer games in munich , which where marred after palestinian terrorists held the israeli team hostage .
two were shot dead by gunmen and nine others died during an ill-fated rescue attempt which turned the event into one of the darkest events in olympic history . sprucing up the city leipzig is eager to create some positive olympic history for germany . some € 30 million -lrb- $ 33.98 million -rrb- is set to be invested in the city in preparation for the next stage of its olympic bid . most of the money will come from the state of saxony , of which leipzig is second-largest city after dresden .
leipzig and its partner cities are also expected to contribute .
leipzig has already doubled its order for new trams for the city -lrb- the cost of which has already run into millions of euros -rrb- .
it will also have to prove to the international olympic committee it can provide a minimum of 42,000 hotel rooms and cope with an influx of 150,000 participants and as many as 500,000 spectators during each day of the competition . demands from city leaders are increasing for additional redevelopment projects in the city , where infrastructure languished and deteriorated under decades of communist rule until the fall of the berlin wall in 1990 and german reunification . indeed , the push from outlying leipzig areas to get their hands on funds earmarked for the olympic effort has become a strain .
so much so , in fact , that leipzig mayor wolfgang tiefensee has been forced to decide to keep the olympic efforts within a 10-kilometer radius of the city center . a massive and expensive endeavor all of this does not come cheap , of course .
if leipzig does win its bid , the city will have to raise an estimated € 2.6 billion to construct the sports halls , olympic playing fields and residential village that the enormous event requires .
how this funding will be split between local , state and federal governments remains an open question . but if € 2.6 billion has leipzig 's purse-string holders quaking in their boots , they can take comfort in the fact that the games have served as an economic booster for a number of host cities , which have in many cases made a profit on their initial investment . the games helped places like munich , which hosted the summer olympics in 1972 and barcelona , which played host in 1992 , transform themselves into world cities .
others enjoyed windfalls from sales of tv rights , advertising and ticket sales .
sydney , which hosted the last summer olympics , made a cool € 1.5 billion . but for leipzig , winning the games would mean a whole lot more .
in addition to the symbolic importance of awarding the games to a city that has pushed for the past 12 years to become a business center , it would also create much needed jobs in a languishing labor market . with an average unemployment rate of 18.3 percent , the number of jobless in eastern germany is more than double that in western germany .
between 1992 and 1998 , the federal government poured € 600 billion into the local economy , but it has still failed to bloom . olympics as economic booster shot local business leaders have said the olympics could create as many as 38,000 jobs by 2012 , though many would disappear again after the olympics . the dream might come true for leipzig .
although one of the smaller cities competing to host the games , leipzig has heard encouraging words from the olympic organizers . " germany , leipzig and rostock have good chances .
we know they are exacting in organization and have a team with good experience , " international olympic committee president jacques rogge said in april .
" other small cities have had the olympic games , too , like lillehammer -lrb- in norway -rrb- .
helsinki was n't big either .

chirac , speaking in his traditional live televised interview , said he wanted euro zone finance ministers to " examine together provisional ways of easing " the stability and growth pact underpinning their economies .
he added that he wanted to see changes " coherent with the imperative of stability , and ensuring growth is not diminished " .
the french president added that while he respected the pact 's rules , a more political interpretation was needed to allow members of the 12 country euro zone greater freedom to maneuver .
" this is not about modifying the stability pact .
it 's a case of getting the representatives of euro zone nations to examine together the terms of a temporary softening , " he said .
“ -lrb- ministers -rrb- must find a solution that is both consistent with the imperative of stability yet that avoids any lowering of growth prospects " . storming the stability pact on a day when france remembered the historic event that led to the formation of the republic , the timing of chirac ’ s statement was not lost on those eu finance ministers who reacted angrily to the french president ’ s words . “ this is july 14 , the day the bastille was stormed , and now it 's the day the stability pact has been stormed , ” said dutch finance minister gerrit zalm angrily going into a meeting of ecofin , the group of eu finance ministers , in brussels on monday night .
“ the storming of the bastille was a better idea . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes .
" the pact does not need to be modified , " said pedro solbes , the eu ’ s economic and monetary affairs commissioner -lrb- photo -rrb- , adding that the european commission had immediately rejected chirac ’ s requests . finland ’ s antii kalliomaki told reporters outside the ecofin meeting , “ we have no room for softening the pact , not even temporarily . "
austria 's economy minister karl-heinz grasser said , " we should n't even be discussing this - it 's one of the pillars of our economic policy and the single currency . " the pact , which aims to keep public debt levels in check and maintain confidence in the common currency , dictates that a budget deficit can not exceed more than 3 percent of national economic output .
france , the euro zone 's second biggest economy behind germany , had a public deficit of 3.1 percent in 2002 and the european commission 's provisional forecasts see it rising to 3.7 percent this year and 3.6 percent in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel .
germany ’ s finance minister hans eichel , who is himself grappling with a spiraling budget deficit , stopped short of echoing president chirac 's call for a relaxing of the rules , saying that the pact is , in fact , adapted to the current economic situation .
“ we consider that the pact in its current shape is appropriate to create monetary stability , ” said eichel .
“ but it is also suitable to achieve economic growth which is more important now .
and that is why we don ’ t need a debate about relaxing the pact . ” keeping the budget in line france , germany and portugal have all come under fire from the european commission for allowing their public deficits to exceed the 3 percent limit as they struggle to revive their stagnant economies .
however , france 's more cavalier approach to the stability and growth pact has been one issue on which it has exchanged open disagreement with germany , its key ally . the german government has often pledged to try to keep its deficit in line with the rules – a seemingly empty promise in the light of germany ’ s persistent failure to do so despite recent hefty tax cuts initiated to spur growth .
france , however , has often brazenly declared that it will not be able to adhere to the pact in its current form and would therefore not even try .
jacques chirac did , however , offer a softener of his own on monday by saying that he would , if possible , continue with his electoral promise of tax cuts to stimulate french growth . france and germany have failed to adhere to the 3 percent deficit limit for two years now .

thirteen years after the collapse of communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- , kitschy nostalgia for a lost culture still lives on in berlin .
plans for a gdr-themed amusement park are now in the works for the capital . whether it ’ s drab wallpaper and tacky east german paraphernalia adorning berlin ’ s hip cafes , bleak prefabricated highrises that are all the rage or the success of films such as goodbye lenin , the german capital ’ s hip and trendy crowd are still enamoured by the former communist east germany ’ s retro-socialist appeal .
" ostalgie , " a twist on the german word for nostalgia -lrb- nostalgie -rrb- seems here to stay .
with little left of the berlin wall , people seem to be scrambling to uncover the remaining traces of the fallen east german state in berlin .
enter berlin entrepreneur peter massine , who has big plans to cash in on the rage for all things east german .
famous for producing the local production of the musical grease , his company " massine productions " is now investing € 1.2 million -lrb- $ 1.35 million -rrb- to set up a gdr-themed amusement park in the former east berlin industrial district of oberschöneweide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german trabant cars pass spectators during a procession to mark the ninth anniversary of german reunification symbolizing the fall of the wall ten years ago in berlin october 3 , 1999 .
complete with rides in boxy east german trabant cars -lrb- photo -rrb- , guards outfitted in communist and border patrol uniforms and pedestrian traffic signals with the trademark green walking man with flat-brimmed hat and jaunty step , the sprawling park spread over 10,000 square meters is designed to capture a slice of east german communist life .
organizers plan to hire about 20 long-term jobless east germans over 50 years of age to play border guards , traffic policemen and canteen personnel .
the gdr park is expected to open its doors next summer .
from spreewald cucumbers to secret spies the tour will begin with a formal arrival at a checkpoint where visitors must pass countless guards and officials scrutinizing papers and identification cards , as was the case during the cold war , and will include a forced exchange of western deutsche marks for eastern ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german consumer products .
visitors will then be able to take a trip through east germany ’ s sparse consumer offerings that have today become cult products in the west -lrb- photo -rrb- - offering everything from spreewald forest 's famous small cucumbers to vita-cola to " rondo " coffee to rotkäppchen sparkling wine to drab clothes and colorful shopping bags .
the organizers are even planning to build a model of the karl marx allee , east berlin ’ s expansive shopping boulevard .
visitors can drop in on a real east german living room outfitted with flowery wallpaper , paintings of socialist factory life and cupboards stocked with special plates marking anniversaries of the founding of the east german state .
even models of the east germans ’ beloved dachas or weekend cottages with their own garden patch will offer visitors a rare glimpse into a leisurely break from the socialist system ’ s rigid work routine .
for those craving the thrill and intrigue of the cold war era , omnipresent stasi -lrb- east german secret police -rrb- spies will whet the appetite .
songs praising the virtues of hard work and content will also be piped in throughout the park by outdoor speakers .
not a gdr disneyland massine said the park is primarily targeted at a german audience that would likely spark entirely different reactions from west germans and their eastern counterparts .
but he 's also hoping to lure busloads of ubiquitous jet-setting americans and japanese . he hopes the mini-gdr will become a highlight of their marathon bus tours to places like the postcard-pretty neuschwanstein castle and heidelberg , while at the same time offering what he is promoting as an authentic view of socialist germany .
authentic is the operative word here .
massine has stressed that the amusement park is no way conceived as a gdr disneyland .
instead , the aim is to showcase a real slice of everyday life in the former east germany .
to that end , the organizers have been scrupulously researching the culture of the gdr and have read up on the vast documentation available about the fallen state .
kornelia lobmeier of the contemporary history forum in leipzig said putting the amusement park in the right historical context is of paramount importance .
" the amusement park is fundamentally not a bad idea when it contributes towards people dealing with the history of the gdr , " she said .
lobmeier , however , warned that if the park only superficially satisfied curiosity and fueled a nostalgic element , then it ran the danger of playing down the darker side of the gdr - a world where neighbors spied on each other and people were denied basic rights because of their political or religious beliefs .
" the background has to be elaborated , it ’ s not enough to just show everyday life and then everybody says , ‘ yeah , i know that , " she said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ' goodbye , lenin , ' hello humor !
germany has been taken by storm by ' goodbye , lenin , ' a film in which east germany is humorously recreated from the ashes .
it 's broken all box office records as well as walls between eastern and western germans .

as the bids close on tuesday for the candidate cities vying to host the 2012 summer olympics , germany 's hope , leipzig , is outlining its plans to make itself as attractive as possible . more than 40,000 people celebrated in the streets of leipzig in april when the city was chosen as germany 's hope to host the next olympic games . the east german city beat off competition from hamburg , düsseldorf , frankfurt and stuttgart to host the summer games in 2012 .
rostock , which was chosen to host the olympic sailing competition in the german bid , vied against the port cities of kiel , lübeck , stralsund and cuxhaven . but as candidate cities all over the world enter the second and final selection round to host the oldest competitive games today , the real work starts for leipzig , which is hoping to boost jobs and make its region - which like much of the formerly communist eastern germany is suffering from economic doldrums - into a town the international olympic committee ca n't turn down when it makes its final decision in early 2005 . germany has not hosted the olympics since the 1972 summer games in munich , which where marred after palestinian terrorists held the israeli team hostage .
two were shot dead by gunmen and nine others died during an ill-fated rescue attempt which turned the event into one of the darkest events in olympic history . sprucing up the city leipzig is eager to create some positive olympic history for germany . some € 30 million -lrb- $ 33.98 million -rrb- is set to be invested in the city in preparation for the next stage of its olympic bid . most of the money will come from the state of saxony , of which leipzig is second-largest city after dresden .
leipzig and its partner cities are also expected to contribute .
leipzig has already doubled its order for new trams for the city -lrb- the cost of which has already run into millions of euros -rrb- .
it will also have to prove to the international olympic committee it can provide a minimum of 42,000 hotel rooms and cope with an influx of 150,000 participants and as many as 500,000 spectators during each day of the competition . demands from city leaders are increasing for additional redevelopment projects in the city , where infrastructure languished and deteriorated under decades of communist rule until the fall of the berlin wall in 1990 and german reunification . indeed , the push from outlying leipzig areas to get their hands on funds earmarked for the olympic effort has become a strain .
so much so , in fact , that leipzig mayor wolfgang tiefensee has been forced to decide to keep the olympic efforts within a 10-kilometer radius of the city center . a massive and expensive endeavor all of this does not come cheap , of course .
if leipzig does win its bid , the city will have to raise an estimated € 2.6 billion to construct the sports halls , olympic playing fields and residential village that the enormous event requires .
how this funding will be split between local , state and federal governments remains an open question . but if € 2.6 billion has leipzig 's purse-string holders quaking in their boots , they can take comfort in the fact that the games have served as an economic booster for a number of host cities , which have in many cases made a profit on their initial investment . the games helped places like munich , which hosted the summer olympics in 1972 and barcelona , which played host in 1992 , transform themselves into world cities .
others enjoyed windfalls from sales of tv rights , advertising and ticket sales .
sydney , which hosted the last summer olympics , made a cool € 1.5 billion . but for leipzig , winning the games would mean a whole lot more .
in addition to the symbolic importance of awarding the games to a city that has pushed for the past 12 years to become a business center , it would also create much needed jobs in a languishing labor market . with an average unemployment rate of 18.3 percent , the number of jobless in eastern germany is more than double that in western germany .
between 1992 and 1998 , the federal government poured € 600 billion into the local economy , but it has still failed to bloom . olympics as economic booster shot local business leaders have said the olympics could create as many as 38,000 jobs by 2012 , though many would disappear again after the olympics . the dream might come true for leipzig .
although one of the smaller cities competing to host the games , leipzig has heard encouraging words from the olympic organizers . " germany , leipzig and rostock have good chances .
we know they are exacting in organization and have a team with good experience , " international olympic committee president jacques rogge said in april .
" other small cities have had the olympic games , too , like lillehammer -lrb- in norway -rrb- .
helsinki was n't big either .
we want to reduce gigantism . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de and the winner is ...

chirac , speaking in his traditional live televised interview , said he wanted euro zone finance ministers to " examine together provisional ways of easing " the stability and growth pact underpinning their economies .
he added that he wanted to see changes " coherent with the imperative of stability , and ensuring growth is not diminished " .
the french president added that while he respected the pact 's rules , a more political interpretation was needed to allow members of the 12 country euro zone greater freedom to maneuver .
" this is not about modifying the stability pact .
it 's a case of getting the representatives of euro zone nations to examine together the terms of a temporary softening , " he said .
“ -lrb- ministers -rrb- must find a solution that is both consistent with the imperative of stability yet that avoids any lowering of growth prospects " . storming the stability pact on a day when france remembered the historic event that led to the formation of the republic , the timing of chirac ’ s statement was not lost on those eu finance ministers who reacted angrily to the french president ’ s words . “ this is july 14 , the day the bastille was stormed , and now it 's the day the stability pact has been stormed , ” said dutch finance minister gerrit zalm angrily going into a meeting of ecofin , the group of eu finance ministers , in brussels on monday night .

" the pact does not need to be modified , " said pedro solbes , the eu ’ s economic and monetary affairs commissioner -lrb- photo -rrb- , adding that the european commission had immediately rejected chirac ’ s requests . finland ’ s antii kalliomaki told reporters outside the ecofin meeting , “ we have no room for softening the pact , not even temporarily . "
austria 's economy minister karl-heinz grasser said , " we should n't even be discussing this - it 's one of the pillars of our economic policy and the single currency . " the pact , which aims to keep public debt levels in check and maintain confidence in the common currency , dictates that a budget deficit can not exceed more than 3 percent of national economic output .
france , the euro zone 's second biggest economy behind germany , had a public deficit of 3.1 percent in 2002 and the european commission 's provisional forecasts see it rising to 3.7 percent this year and 3.6 percent in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel .
germany ’ s finance minister hans eichel , who is himself grappling with a spiraling budget deficit , stopped short of echoing president chirac 's call for a relaxing of the rules , saying that the pact is , in fact , adapted to the current economic situation .
“ we consider that the pact in its current shape is appropriate to create monetary stability , ” said eichel .
“ but it is also suitable to achieve economic growth which is more important now .
and that is why we don ’ t need a debate about relaxing the pact . ” keeping the budget in line france , germany and portugal have all come under fire from the european commission for allowing their public deficits to exceed the 3 percent limit as they struggle to revive their stagnant economies .
however , france 's more cavalier approach to the stability and growth pact has been one issue on which it has exchanged open disagreement with germany , its key ally . the german government has often pledged to try to keep its deficit in line with the rules – a seemingly empty promise in the light of germany ’ s persistent failure to do so despite recent hefty tax cuts initiated to spur growth .
france , however , has often brazenly declared that it will not be able to adhere to the pact in its current form and would therefore not even try .
jacques chirac did , however , offer a softener of his own on monday by saying that he would , if possible , continue with his electoral promise of tax cuts to stimulate french growth . france and germany have failed to adhere to the 3 percent deficit limit for two years now .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.07.2003 touring east germany without the oppression großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's green-hatted " crosswalk man " is an eastern german cult object .
thirteen years after the collapse of communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- , kitschy nostalgia for a lost culture still lives on in berlin .
plans for a gdr-themed amusement park are now in the works for the capital . whether it ’ s drab wallpaper and tacky east german paraphernalia adorning berlin ’ s hip cafes , bleak prefabricated highrises that are all the rage or the success of films such as goodbye lenin , the german capital ’ s hip and trendy crowd are still enamoured by the former communist east germany ’ s retro-socialist appeal .
" ostalgie , " a twist on the german word for nostalgia -lrb- nostalgie -rrb- seems here to stay .
with little left of the berlin wall , people seem to be scrambling to uncover the remaining traces of the fallen east german state in berlin .
enter berlin entrepreneur peter massine , who has big plans to cash in on the rage for all things east german .
famous for producing the local production of the musical grease , his company " massine productions " is now investing € 1.2 million -lrb- $ 1.35 million -rrb- to set up a gdr-themed amusement park in the former east berlin industrial district of oberschöneweide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german trabant cars pass spectators during a procession to mark the ninth anniversary of german reunification symbolizing the fall of the wall ten years ago in berlin october 3 , 1999 .
complete with rides in boxy east german trabant cars -lrb- photo -rrb- , guards outfitted in communist and border patrol uniforms and pedestrian traffic signals with the trademark green walking man with flat-brimmed hat and jaunty step , the sprawling park spread over 10,000 square meters is designed to capture a slice of east german communist life .
organizers plan to hire about 20 long-term jobless east germans over 50 years of age to play border guards , traffic policemen and canteen personnel .
the gdr park is expected to open its doors next summer .
from spreewald cucumbers to secret spies the tour will begin with a formal arrival at a checkpoint where visitors must pass countless guards and officials scrutinizing papers and identification cards , as was the case during the cold war , and will include a forced exchange of western deutsche marks for eastern ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german consumer products .
visitors will then be able to take a trip through east germany ’ s sparse consumer offerings that have today become cult products in the west -lrb- photo -rrb- - offering everything from spreewald forest 's famous small cucumbers to vita-cola to " rondo " coffee to rotkäppchen sparkling wine to drab clothes and colorful shopping bags .
the organizers are even planning to build a model of the karl marx allee , east berlin ’ s expansive shopping boulevard .
visitors can drop in on a real east german living room outfitted with flowery wallpaper , paintings of socialist factory life and cupboards stocked with special plates marking anniversaries of the founding of the east german state .
even models of the east germans ’ beloved dachas or weekend cottages with their own garden patch will offer visitors a rare glimpse into a leisurely break from the socialist system ’ s rigid work routine .
for those craving the thrill and intrigue of the cold war era , omnipresent stasi -lrb- east german secret police -rrb- spies will whet the appetite .
songs praising the virtues of hard work and content will also be piped in throughout the park by outdoor speakers .
not a gdr disneyland massine said the park is primarily targeted at a german audience that would likely spark entirely different reactions from west germans and their eastern counterparts .
but he 's also hoping to lure busloads of ubiquitous jet-setting americans and japanese . he hopes the mini-gdr will become a highlight of their marathon bus tours to places like the postcard-pretty neuschwanstein castle and heidelberg , while at the same time offering what he is promoting as an authentic view of socialist germany .
authentic is the operative word here .
massine has stressed that the amusement park is no way conceived as a gdr disneyland .
instead , the aim is to showcase a real slice of everyday life in the former east germany .
to that end , the organizers have been scrupulously researching the culture of the gdr and have read up on the vast documentation available about the fallen state .
kornelia lobmeier of the contemporary history forum in leipzig said putting the amusement park in the right historical context is of paramount importance .
" the amusement park is fundamentally not a bad idea when it contributes towards people dealing with the history of the gdr , " she said .
lobmeier , however , warned that if the park only superficially satisfied curiosity and fueled a nostalgic element , then it ran the danger of playing down the darker side of the gdr - a world where neighbors spied on each other and people were denied basic rights because of their political or religious beliefs .
" the background has to be elaborated , it ’ s not enough to just show everyday life and then everybody says , ‘ yeah , i know that , " she said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ' goodbye , lenin , ' hello humor !

after the u.s. senate decided to request nato help in postwar iraq , speculation is spreading in germany about a possible military deployment , despite concerns about the army ’ s overstretched capacities . with the german military or bundeswehr grappling with peacekeeping operations in three continents at present , the political discussion on a possible military involvement in postwar iraq has been dominated by ground realities .
karsten voigt , coordinator for german-u.s. relations in the german government told the berlin daily tagesspiegel on tuesday the bush administration wasn ’ t expecting a quick german contribution in iraq and was aware the german military was stretched to the limit with its foreign deployments .
voigt added foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in the u.s. , would not be " pressurized " by bush on the question .
even parliamentary foreign policy spokesman for germany ’ s opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- said last week , " i think our friends know that we have limited resources . "
indeed , with about 9,000 soldiers scattered in the balkans , afghanistan and as far as the horn of africa , the german army , plagued in recent years by chronic underfunding and in the thick of a radical overhaul , has its hands full .
army overworked , but can still do iraq wilfried stolze , spokesman for the federal armed forces union , told deutsche welle another foreign deployment would massively step up the logistical and financial burden on the bundeswehr .
" after all , the german army right now is undergoing its biggest shake-up in history , " he explained .
restructuring plans include modernizing the army , trimming the number of civilian jobs while at the same time increasing the number of soldiers -lrb- from 282,000 to 300,000 -rrb- , slashing military spending and training troops to gear up for new military challenges , including foreign deployments .
stolze said a u.s. request for military help in iraq would pose a big problem to the overburdened bundeswehr .
" what we lack is manpower – especially specialists such as paramedics and radio operators .
besides , another foreign deployment would involve a huge initial operation within germany .
we simply can ’ t afford that . "
at the same time stolze did not rule out the bundesweher scraping together troops if it came down to it and said realistically about 1,500 to 2,000 soldiers could be sent to iraq .
" however , what ’ s important is that the mandate is a limited and robust one – the soldiers have to be well-armed – and that it takes place under u.n. auspices , " he added .
u.s. turns to nato for help in iraq the present discussion over an iraq deployment follows a request last week by the united states senate to the nato military alliance for support to reinforce the 147,000 american troops serving as occupying forces in iraq .
continuing resistance from iraqi groups , mounting american and british casualties and rising costs of maintaining a huge peacekeeping operation in iraq has forced the u.s. to seek broader international support .
though no concrete request has come in as yet from the u.s. , german government spokesman bela anda said over the weekend it was possible a request would be received at the nato council in brussels after the summer break .
so far the reaction from nato countries , prominently germany and france , has been lukewarm .
both say there is no adequate united nations mandate to legitimize their presence in iraq .
france , like germany , is also heavily involved in foreign military deployments in the balkans , ivory coast , congo and afghanistan .
germany : nothing without a u.n. mandate german chancellor gerhard schröder , whose antiwar and pro-u.n. stance when the u.s. invaded iraq strained relations with washington , said in a television interview last week his government would not send troops to iraq except in a nato context and only with a specific mandate from the u.n. he said the bush administration had already been informed of his position .
the chancellor ’ s coalition government also has the support of the conservative opposition in insisting that the u.n. needs to play the central role in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq .
politicians still divided about possible deployment however , the hard realities of the army ’ s stretched capabilities now has german politicians speculating on what alternative help germany could provide in iraq under a u.n. mandate .
on tuesday , foreign policy speaker of the opposition cdu , friedbert pflüger , said in a newspaper interview that germany would have to contribute towards rebuilding civil society and securing peace in iraq if nato were to receive a request to that effect from the u.n. he suggested reducing the number of german peacekeepers in the balkans in order to facilitate sending troops to iraq .
" we have to watch out in any case that we don ’ t throw away this great chance through mistakes , " he said in a reference to germany ’ s shunning by washington earlier this year after berlin refused to support the u.s.-led war in iraq .
however members of schröder ’ s social democrat and the green government are vehemently against sending german troops to iraq , even under a u.n. mandate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 15.07.2003 chirac ’ s call for softer pact creates uproar großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angry ministers accuse jacques chirac of storming the stability pact on bastille day jacques chirac ’ s bastille day statement calling for temporary measures to relax the eu ’ s stability and growth pact has caused outrage among euro zone finance ministers . french president jacques chirac chose monday ’ s bastille day celebrations to call for possible temporary ways for the eu ’ s stability and growth pact to be softened and for legislation within the pact to be amended to avoid restricting economic growth .
chirac , speaking in his traditional live televised interview , said he wanted euro zone finance ministers to " examine together provisional ways of easing " the stability and growth pact underpinning their economies .
he added that he wanted to see changes " coherent with the imperative of stability , and ensuring growth is not diminished " .
the french president added that while he respected the pact 's rules , a more political interpretation was needed to allow members of the 12 country euro zone greater freedom to maneuver .
" this is not about modifying the stability pact .
it 's a case of getting the representatives of euro zone nations to examine together the terms of a temporary softening , " he said .
“ -lrb- ministers -rrb- must find a solution that is both consistent with the imperative of stability yet that avoids any lowering of growth prospects " . storming the stability pact on a day when france remembered the historic event that led to the formation of the republic , the timing of chirac ’ s statement was not lost on those eu finance ministers who reacted angrily to the french president ’ s words . “ this is july 14 , the day the bastille was stormed , and now it 's the day the stability pact has been stormed , ” said dutch finance minister gerrit zalm angrily going into a meeting of ecofin , the group of eu finance ministers , in brussels on monday night .
“ the storming of the bastille was a better idea . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes .
" the pact does not need to be modified , " said pedro solbes , the eu ’ s economic and monetary affairs commissioner -lrb- photo -rrb- , adding that the european commission had immediately rejected chirac ’ s requests . finland ’ s antii kalliomaki told reporters outside the ecofin meeting , “ we have no room for softening the pact , not even temporarily . "
austria 's economy minister karl-heinz grasser said , " we should n't even be discussing this - it 's one of the pillars of our economic policy and the single currency . " the pact , which aims to keep public debt levels in check and maintain confidence in the common currency , dictates that a budget deficit can not exceed more than 3 percent of national economic output .
france , the euro zone 's second biggest economy behind germany , had a public deficit of 3.1 percent in 2002 and the european commission 's provisional forecasts see it rising to 3.7 percent this year and 3.6 percent in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel .
germany ’ s finance minister hans eichel , who is himself grappling with a spiraling budget deficit , stopped short of echoing president chirac 's call for a relaxing of the rules , saying that the pact is , in fact , adapted to the current economic situation .
“ we consider that the pact in its current shape is appropriate to create monetary stability , ” said eichel .
“ but it is also suitable to achieve economic growth which is more important now .
and that is why we don ’ t need a debate about relaxing the pact . ” keeping the budget in line france , germany and portugal have all come under fire from the european commission for allowing their public deficits to exceed the 3 percent limit as they struggle to revive their stagnant economies .
however , france 's more cavalier approach to the stability and growth pact has been one issue on which it has exchanged open disagreement with germany , its key ally . the german government has often pledged to try to keep its deficit in line with the rules – a seemingly empty promise in the light of germany ’ s persistent failure to do so despite recent hefty tax cuts initiated to spur growth .
france , however , has often brazenly declared that it will not be able to adhere to the pact in its current form and would therefore not even try .
jacques chirac did , however , offer a softener of his own on monday by saying that he would , if possible , continue with his electoral promise of tax cuts to stimulate french growth . france and germany have failed to adhere to the 3 percent deficit limit for two years now .
if the eu ’ s executive commission forecasts are proved right later this year and both countries break the pact for a third year running , the commission will have no other choice but to either impose fines of several billion euro or bow to pressure and ease the pact ’ s conditions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german tax cuts unsettle brussels the announcement that germany ’ s cabinet was approving tax cuts sent ripples through the eu , which worries that the euro zone ’ s biggest economy could incur even more debt and run amiss of the stability and growth pact .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.07.2003 for leipzig , the olympic dream begins großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tired of watching world athletic championships on tv , residents of leipzig want to bring the olympics to their backyards .
as the bids close on tuesday for the candidate cities vying to host the 2012 summer olympics , germany 's hope , leipzig , is outlining its plans to make itself as attractive as possible . more than 40,000 people celebrated in the streets of leipzig in april when the city was chosen as germany 's hope to host the next olympic games . the east german city beat off competition from hamburg , düsseldorf , frankfurt and stuttgart to host the summer games in 2012 .
rostock , which was chosen to host the olympic sailing competition in the german bid , vied against the port cities of kiel , lübeck , stralsund and cuxhaven . but as candidate cities all over the world enter the second and final selection round to host the oldest competitive games today , the real work starts for leipzig , which is hoping to boost jobs and make its region - which like much of the formerly communist eastern germany is suffering from economic doldrums - into a town the international olympic committee ca n't turn down when it makes its final decision in early 2005 . germany has not hosted the olympics since the 1972 summer games in munich , which where marred after palestinian terrorists held the israeli team hostage .
two were shot dead by gunmen and nine others died during an ill-fated rescue attempt which turned the event into one of the darkest events in olympic history . sprucing up the city leipzig is eager to create some positive olympic history for germany . some € 30 million -lrb- $ 33.98 million -rrb- is set to be invested in the city in preparation for the next stage of its olympic bid . most of the money will come from the state of saxony , of which leipzig is second-largest city after dresden .
leipzig and its partner cities are also expected to contribute .
leipzig has already doubled its order for new trams for the city -lrb- the cost of which has already run into millions of euros -rrb- .
it will also have to prove to the international olympic committee it can provide a minimum of 42,000 hotel rooms and cope with an influx of 150,000 participants and as many as 500,000 spectators during each day of the competition . demands from city leaders are increasing for additional redevelopment projects in the city , where infrastructure languished and deteriorated under decades of communist rule until the fall of the berlin wall in 1990 and german reunification . indeed , the push from outlying leipzig areas to get their hands on funds earmarked for the olympic effort has become a strain .
so much so , in fact , that leipzig mayor wolfgang tiefensee has been forced to decide to keep the olympic efforts within a 10-kilometer radius of the city center . a massive and expensive endeavor all of this does not come cheap , of course .
if leipzig does win its bid , the city will have to raise an estimated € 2.6 billion to construct the sports halls , olympic playing fields and residential village that the enormous event requires .
how this funding will be split between local , state and federal governments remains an open question . but if € 2.6 billion has leipzig 's purse-string holders quaking in their boots , they can take comfort in the fact that the games have served as an economic booster for a number of host cities , which have in many cases made a profit on their initial investment . the games helped places like munich , which hosted the summer olympics in 1972 and barcelona , which played host in 1992 , transform themselves into world cities .
others enjoyed windfalls from sales of tv rights , advertising and ticket sales .
sydney , which hosted the last summer olympics , made a cool € 1.5 billion . but for leipzig , winning the games would mean a whole lot more .
in addition to the symbolic importance of awarding the games to a city that has pushed for the past 12 years to become a business center , it would also create much needed jobs in a languishing labor market . with an average unemployment rate of 18.3 percent , the number of jobless in eastern germany is more than double that in western germany .
between 1992 and 1998 , the federal government poured € 600 billion into the local economy , but it has still failed to bloom . olympics as economic booster shot local business leaders have said the olympics could create as many as 38,000 jobs by 2012 , though many would disappear again after the olympics . the dream might come true for leipzig .
although one of the smaller cities competing to host the games , leipzig has heard encouraging words from the olympic organizers . " germany , leipzig and rostock have good chances .
we know they are exacting in organization and have a team with good experience , " international olympic committee president jacques rogge said in april .
" other small cities have had the olympic games , too , like lillehammer -lrb- in norway -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.07.2003 for leipzig , the olympic dream begins großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tired of watching world athletic championships on tv , residents of leipzig want to bring the olympics to their backyards .
as the bids close on tuesday for the candidate cities vying to host the 2012 summer olympics , germany 's hope , leipzig , is outlining its plans to make itself as attractive as possible . more than 40,000 people celebrated in the streets of leipzig in april when the city was chosen as germany 's hope to host the next olympic games . the east german city beat off competition from hamburg , düsseldorf , frankfurt and stuttgart to host the summer games in 2012 .
rostock , which was chosen to host the olympic sailing competition in the german bid , vied against the port cities of kiel , lübeck , stralsund and cuxhaven . but as candidate cities all over the world enter the second and final selection round to host the oldest competitive games today , the real work starts for leipzig , which is hoping to boost jobs and make its region - which like much of the formerly communist eastern germany is suffering from economic doldrums - into a town the international olympic committee ca n't turn down when it makes its final decision in early 2005 . germany has not hosted the olympics since the 1972 summer games in munich , which where marred after palestinian terrorists held the israeli team hostage .
two were shot dead by gunmen and nine others died during an ill-fated rescue attempt which turned the event into one of the darkest events in olympic history . sprucing up the city leipzig is eager to create some positive olympic history for germany . some € 30 million -lrb- $ 33.98 million -rrb- is set to be invested in the city in preparation for the next stage of its olympic bid . most of the money will come from the state of saxony , of which leipzig is second-largest city after dresden .
leipzig and its partner cities are also expected to contribute .
leipzig has already doubled its order for new trams for the city -lrb- the cost of which has already run into millions of euros -rrb- .
it will also have to prove to the international olympic committee it can provide a minimum of 42,000 hotel rooms and cope with an influx of 150,000 participants and as many as 500,000 spectators during each day of the competition . demands from city leaders are increasing for additional redevelopment projects in the city , where infrastructure languished and deteriorated under decades of communist rule until the fall of the berlin wall in 1990 and german reunification . indeed , the push from outlying leipzig areas to get their hands on funds earmarked for the olympic effort has become a strain .
so much so , in fact , that leipzig mayor wolfgang tiefensee has been forced to decide to keep the olympic efforts within a 10-kilometer radius of the city center . a massive and expensive endeavor all of this does not come cheap , of course .
if leipzig does win its bid , the city will have to raise an estimated € 2.6 billion to construct the sports halls , olympic playing fields and residential village that the enormous event requires .
how this funding will be split between local , state and federal governments remains an open question . but if € 2.6 billion has leipzig 's purse-string holders quaking in their boots , they can take comfort in the fact that the games have served as an economic booster for a number of host cities , which have in many cases made a profit on their initial investment . the games helped places like munich , which hosted the summer olympics in 1972 and barcelona , which played host in 1992 , transform themselves into world cities .
others enjoyed windfalls from sales of tv rights , advertising and ticket sales .
sydney , which hosted the last summer olympics , made a cool € 1.5 billion . but for leipzig , winning the games would mean a whole lot more .
in addition to the symbolic importance of awarding the games to a city that has pushed for the past 12 years to become a business center , it would also create much needed jobs in a languishing labor market . with an average unemployment rate of 18.3 percent , the number of jobless in eastern germany is more than double that in western germany .
between 1992 and 1998 , the federal government poured € 600 billion into the local economy , but it has still failed to bloom . olympics as economic booster shot local business leaders have said the olympics could create as many as 38,000 jobs by 2012 , though many would disappear again after the olympics . the dream might come true for leipzig .
although one of the smaller cities competing to host the games , leipzig has heard encouraging words from the olympic organizers . " germany , leipzig and rostock have good chances .
we know they are exacting in organization and have a team with good experience , " international olympic committee president jacques rogge said in april .
" other small cities have had the olympic games , too , like lillehammer -lrb- in norway -rrb- .
helsinki was n't big either .
we want to reduce gigantism . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de and the winner is ...

as the bids close on tuesday for the candidate cities vying to host the 2012 summer olympics , germany 's hope , leipzig , is outlining its plans to make itself as attractive as possible . more than 40,000 people celebrated in the streets of leipzig in april when the city was chosen as germany 's hope to host the next olympic games . the east german city beat off competition from hamburg , düsseldorf , frankfurt and stuttgart to host the summer games in 2012 .
rostock , which was chosen to host the olympic sailing competition in the german bid , vied against the port cities of kiel , lübeck , stralsund and cuxhaven . but as candidate cities all over the world enter the second and final selection round to host the oldest competitive games today , the real work starts for leipzig , which is hoping to boost jobs and make its region - which like much of the formerly communist eastern germany is suffering from economic doldrums - into a town the international olympic committee ca n't turn down when it makes its final decision in early 2005 . germany has not hosted the olympics since the 1972 summer games in munich , which where marred after palestinian terrorists held the israeli team hostage .
two were shot dead by gunmen and nine others died during an ill-fated rescue attempt which turned the event into one of the darkest events in olympic history . sprucing up the city leipzig is eager to create some positive olympic history for germany . some € 30 million -lrb- $ 33.98 million -rrb- is set to be invested in the city in preparation for the next stage of its olympic bid . most of the money will come from the state of saxony , of which leipzig is second-largest city after dresden .
leipzig and its partner cities are also expected to contribute .
leipzig has already doubled its order for new trams for the city -lrb- the cost of which has already run into millions of euros -rrb- .
it will also have to prove to the international olympic committee it can provide a minimum of 42,000 hotel rooms and cope with an influx of 150,000 participants and as many as 500,000 spectators during each day of the competition . demands from city leaders are increasing for additional redevelopment projects in the city , where infrastructure languished and deteriorated under decades of communist rule until the fall of the berlin wall in 1990 and german reunification . indeed , the push from outlying leipzig areas to get their hands on funds earmarked for the olympic effort has become a strain .
so much so , in fact , that leipzig mayor wolfgang tiefensee has been forced to decide to keep the olympic efforts within a 10-kilometer radius of the city center . a massive and expensive endeavor all of this does not come cheap , of course .
if leipzig does win its bid , the city will have to raise an estimated € 2.6 billion to construct the sports halls , olympic playing fields and residential village that the enormous event requires .
how this funding will be split between local , state and federal governments remains an open question . but if € 2.6 billion has leipzig 's purse-string holders quaking in their boots , they can take comfort in the fact that the games have served as an economic booster for a number of host cities , which have in many cases made a profit on their initial investment . the games helped places like munich , which hosted the summer olympics in 1972 and barcelona , which played host in 1992 , transform themselves into world cities .
others enjoyed windfalls from sales of tv rights , advertising and ticket sales .
sydney , which hosted the last summer olympics , made a cool € 1.5 billion . but for leipzig , winning the games would mean a whole lot more .
in addition to the symbolic importance of awarding the games to a city that has pushed for the past 12 years to become a business center , it would also create much needed jobs in a languishing labor market . with an average unemployment rate of 18.3 percent , the number of jobless in eastern germany is more than double that in western germany .
between 1992 and 1998 , the federal government poured € 600 billion into the local economy , but it has still failed to bloom . olympics as economic booster shot local business leaders have said the olympics could create as many as 38,000 jobs by 2012 , though many would disappear again after the olympics . the dream might come true for leipzig .
although one of the smaller cities competing to host the games , leipzig has heard encouraging words from the olympic organizers . " germany , leipzig and rostock have good chances .
we know they are exacting in organization and have a team with good experience , " international olympic committee president jacques rogge said in april .
" other small cities have had the olympic games , too , like lillehammer -lrb- in norway -rrb- .
helsinki was n't big either .
we want to reduce gigantism . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de and the winner is ...

thirteen years after the collapse of communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- , kitschy nostalgia for a lost culture still lives on in berlin .
plans for a gdr-themed amusement park are now in the works for the capital . whether it ’ s drab wallpaper and tacky east german paraphernalia adorning berlin ’ s hip cafes , bleak prefabricated highrises that are all the rage or the success of films such as goodbye lenin , the german capital ’ s hip and trendy crowd are still enamoured by the former communist east germany ’ s retro-socialist appeal .
" ostalgie , " a twist on the german word for nostalgia -lrb- nostalgie -rrb- seems here to stay .
with little left of the berlin wall , people seem to be scrambling to uncover the remaining traces of the fallen east german state in berlin .
enter berlin entrepreneur peter massine , who has big plans to cash in on the rage for all things east german .
famous for producing the local production of the musical grease , his company " massine productions " is now investing € 1.2 million -lrb- $ 1.35 million -rrb- to set up a gdr-themed amusement park in the former east berlin industrial district of oberschöneweide .

complete with rides in boxy east german trabant cars -lrb- photo -rrb- , guards outfitted in communist and border patrol uniforms and pedestrian traffic signals with the trademark green walking man with flat-brimmed hat and jaunty step , the sprawling park spread over 10,000 square meters is designed to capture a slice of east german communist life .
organizers plan to hire about 20 long-term jobless east germans over 50 years of age to play border guards , traffic policemen and canteen personnel .
the gdr park is expected to open its doors next summer .
from spreewald cucumbers to secret spies the tour will begin with a formal arrival at a checkpoint where visitors must pass countless guards and officials scrutinizing papers and identification cards , as was the case during the cold war , and will include a forced exchange of western deutsche marks for eastern ones .

the organizers are even planning to build a model of the karl marx allee , east berlin ’ s expansive shopping boulevard .
visitors can drop in on a real east german living room outfitted with flowery wallpaper , paintings of socialist factory life and cupboards stocked with special plates marking anniversaries of the founding of the east german state .

authentic is the operative word here .
massine has stressed that the amusement park is no way conceived as a gdr disneyland .
instead , the aim is to showcase a real slice of everyday life in the former east germany .
to that end , the organizers have been scrupulously researching the culture of the gdr and have read up on the vast documentation available about the fallen state .
kornelia lobmeier of the contemporary history forum in leipzig said putting the amusement park in the right historical context is of paramount importance .
" the amusement park is fundamentally not a bad idea when it contributes towards people dealing with the history of the gdr , " she said .
lobmeier , however , warned that if the park only superficially satisfied curiosity and fueled a nostalgic element , then it ran the danger of playing down the darker side of the gdr - a world where neighbors spied on each other and people were denied basic rights because of their political or religious beliefs .

after the u.s. senate decided to request nato help in postwar iraq , speculation is spreading in germany about a possible military deployment , despite concerns about the army ’ s overstretched capacities . with the german military or bundeswehr grappling with peacekeeping operations in three continents at present , the political discussion on a possible military involvement in postwar iraq has been dominated by ground realities .
karsten voigt , coordinator for german-u.s. relations in the german government told the berlin daily tagesspiegel on tuesday the bush administration wasn ’ t expecting a quick german contribution in iraq and was aware the german military was stretched to the limit with its foreign deployments .
voigt added foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in the u.s. , would not be " pressurized " by bush on the question .
even parliamentary foreign policy spokesman for germany ’ s opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- said last week , " i think our friends know that we have limited resources . "
indeed , with about 9,000 soldiers scattered in the balkans , afghanistan and as far as the horn of africa , the german army , plagued in recent years by chronic underfunding and in the thick of a radical overhaul , has its hands full .
army overworked , but can still do iraq wilfried stolze , spokesman for the federal armed forces union , told deutsche welle another foreign deployment would massively step up the logistical and financial burden on the bundeswehr .
" after all , the german army right now is undergoing its biggest shake-up in history , " he explained .
restructuring plans include modernizing the army , trimming the number of civilian jobs while at the same time increasing the number of soldiers -lrb- from 282,000 to 300,000 -rrb- , slashing military spending and training troops to gear up for new military challenges , including foreign deployments .
stolze said a u.s. request for military help in iraq would pose a big problem to the overburdened bundeswehr .
" what we lack is manpower – especially specialists such as paramedics and radio operators .
besides , another foreign deployment would involve a huge initial operation within germany .
we simply can ’ t afford that . "
at the same time stolze did not rule out the bundesweher scraping together troops if it came down to it and said realistically about 1,500 to 2,000 soldiers could be sent to iraq .
" however , what ’ s important is that the mandate is a limited and robust one – the soldiers have to be well-armed – and that it takes place under u.n. auspices , " he added .
u.s. turns to nato for help in iraq the present discussion over an iraq deployment follows a request last week by the united states senate to the nato military alliance for support to reinforce the 147,000 american troops serving as occupying forces in iraq .
continuing resistance from iraqi groups , mounting american and british casualties and rising costs of maintaining a huge peacekeeping operation in iraq has forced the u.s. to seek broader international support .
though no concrete request has come in as yet from the u.s. , german government spokesman bela anda said over the weekend it was possible a request would be received at the nato council in brussels after the summer break .
so far the reaction from nato countries , prominently germany and france , has been lukewarm .
both say there is no adequate united nations mandate to legitimize their presence in iraq .
france , like germany , is also heavily involved in foreign military deployments in the balkans , ivory coast , congo and afghanistan .
germany : nothing without a u.n. mandate german chancellor gerhard schröder , whose antiwar and pro-u.n. stance when the u.s. invaded iraq strained relations with washington , said in a television interview last week his government would not send troops to iraq except in a nato context and only with a specific mandate from the u.n. he said the bush administration had already been informed of his position .
the chancellor ’ s coalition government also has the support of the conservative opposition in insisting that the u.n. needs to play the central role in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq .
politicians still divided about possible deployment however , the hard realities of the army ’ s stretched capabilities now has german politicians speculating on what alternative help germany could provide in iraq under a u.n. mandate .
on tuesday , foreign policy speaker of the opposition cdu , friedbert pflüger , said in a newspaper interview that germany would have to contribute towards rebuilding civil society and securing peace in iraq if nato were to receive a request to that effect from the u.n. he suggested reducing the number of german peacekeepers in the balkans in order to facilitate sending troops to iraq .
" we have to watch out in any case that we don ’ t throw away this great chance through mistakes , " he said in a reference to germany ’ s shunning by washington earlier this year after berlin refused to support the u.s.-led war in iraq .
however members of schröder ’ s social democrat and the green government are vehemently against sending german troops to iraq , even under a u.n. mandate .
leader of the social democrat parliamentary group gernot erler said german police and aid workers could be sent to iraq , but not the army .
" nobody can really expect a country , that so clearly rejected the iraq war , to send in soldiers there , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany : no nato in iraq without un if the united states hopes to get nato soldiers side-by-side with their own in iraq , they will have to involve the united nations .
that message came loud and clear out of berlin on friday -lrb- july 12 , 2003 -rrb- .
european press review : the u.n. could at last get its chance in iraq european papers on friday focused on the increasingly risk-fraught attempt by the americans to restore order in postwar iraq and the erosion of president bush 's credibility -lrb- july 11 , 2003 -rrb- .

karsten voigt , coordinator for german-u.s. relations in the german government told the berlin daily tagesspiegel on tuesday the bush administration wasn ’ t expecting a quick german contribution in iraq and was aware the german military was stretched to the limit with its foreign deployments .
voigt added foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in the u.s. , would not be " pressurized " by bush on the question .
even parliamentary foreign policy spokesman for germany ’ s opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- said last week , " i think our friends know that we have limited resources . "
indeed , with about 9,000 soldiers scattered in the balkans , afghanistan and as far as the horn of africa , the german army , plagued in recent years by chronic underfunding and in the thick of a radical overhaul , has its hands full .
army overworked , but can still do iraq wilfried stolze , spokesman for the federal armed forces union , told deutsche welle another foreign deployment would massively step up the logistical and financial burden on the bundeswehr .
" after all , the german army right now is undergoing its biggest shake-up in history , " he explained .
restructuring plans include modernizing the army , trimming the number of civilian jobs while at the same time increasing the number of soldiers -lrb- from 282,000 to 300,000 -rrb- , slashing military spending and training troops to gear up for new military challenges , including foreign deployments .
stolze said a u.s. request for military help in iraq would pose a big problem to the overburdened bundeswehr .
" what we lack is manpower – especially specialists such as paramedics and radio operators .
besides , another foreign deployment would involve a huge initial operation within germany .
we simply can ’ t afford that . "
at the same time stolze did not rule out the bundesweher scraping together troops if it came down to it and said realistically about 1,500 to 2,000 soldiers could be sent to iraq .
" however , what ’ s important is that the mandate is a limited and robust one – the soldiers have to be well-armed – and that it takes place under u.n. auspices , " he added .
u.s. turns to nato for help in iraq the present discussion over an iraq deployment follows a request last week by the united states senate to the nato military alliance for support to reinforce the 147,000 american troops serving as occupying forces in iraq .
continuing resistance from iraqi groups , mounting american and british casualties and rising costs of maintaining a huge peacekeeping operation in iraq has forced the u.s. to seek broader international support .
though no concrete request has come in as yet from the u.s. , german government spokesman bela anda said over the weekend it was possible a request would be received at the nato council in brussels after the summer break .
so far the reaction from nato countries , prominently germany and france , has been lukewarm .
both say there is no adequate united nations mandate to legitimize their presence in iraq .
france , like germany , is also heavily involved in foreign military deployments in the balkans , ivory coast , congo and afghanistan .
germany : nothing without a u.n. mandate german chancellor gerhard schröder , whose antiwar and pro-u.n. stance when the u.s. invaded iraq strained relations with washington , said in a television interview last week his government would not send troops to iraq except in a nato context and only with a specific mandate from the u.n. he said the bush administration had already been informed of his position .
the chancellor ’ s coalition government also has the support of the conservative opposition in insisting that the u.n. needs to play the central role in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq .
politicians still divided about possible deployment however , the hard realities of the army ’ s stretched capabilities now has german politicians speculating on what alternative help germany could provide in iraq under a u.n. mandate .
on tuesday , foreign policy speaker of the opposition cdu , friedbert pflüger , said in a newspaper interview that germany would have to contribute towards rebuilding civil society and securing peace in iraq if nato were to receive a request to that effect from the u.n. he suggested reducing the number of german peacekeepers in the balkans in order to facilitate sending troops to iraq .
" we have to watch out in any case that we don ’ t throw away this great chance through mistakes , " he said in a reference to germany ’ s shunning by washington earlier this year after berlin refused to support the u.s.-led war in iraq .
however members of schröder ’ s social democrat and the green government are vehemently against sending german troops to iraq , even under a u.n. mandate .
leader of the social democrat parliamentary group gernot erler said german police and aid workers could be sent to iraq , but not the army .
" nobody can really expect a country , that so clearly rejected the iraq war , to send in soldiers there , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany : no nato in iraq without un if the united states hopes to get nato soldiers side-by-side with their own in iraq , they will have to involve the united nations .
that message came loud and clear out of berlin on friday -lrb- july 12 , 2003 -rrb- .

thirteen years after the collapse of communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- , kitschy nostalgia for a lost culture still lives on in berlin .
plans for a gdr-themed amusement park are now in the works for the capital . whether it ’ s drab wallpaper and tacky east german paraphernalia adorning berlin ’ s hip cafes , bleak prefabricated highrises that are all the rage or the success of films such as goodbye lenin , the german capital ’ s hip and trendy crowd are still enamoured by the former communist east germany ’ s retro-socialist appeal .
" ostalgie , " a twist on the german word for nostalgia -lrb- nostalgie -rrb- seems here to stay .
with little left of the berlin wall , people seem to be scrambling to uncover the remaining traces of the fallen east german state in berlin .
enter berlin entrepreneur peter massine , who has big plans to cash in on the rage for all things east german .
famous for producing the local production of the musical grease , his company " massine productions " is now investing € 1.2 million -lrb- $ 1.35 million -rrb- to set up a gdr-themed amusement park in the former east berlin industrial district of oberschöneweide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german trabant cars pass spectators during a procession to mark the ninth anniversary of german reunification symbolizing the fall of the wall ten years ago in berlin october 3 , 1999 .
complete with rides in boxy east german trabant cars -lrb- photo -rrb- , guards outfitted in communist and border patrol uniforms and pedestrian traffic signals with the trademark green walking man with flat-brimmed hat and jaunty step , the sprawling park spread over 10,000 square meters is designed to capture a slice of east german communist life .
organizers plan to hire about 20 long-term jobless east germans over 50 years of age to play border guards , traffic policemen and canteen personnel .
the gdr park is expected to open its doors next summer .
from spreewald cucumbers to secret spies the tour will begin with a formal arrival at a checkpoint where visitors must pass countless guards and officials scrutinizing papers and identification cards , as was the case during the cold war , and will include a forced exchange of western deutsche marks for eastern ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german consumer products .
visitors will then be able to take a trip through east germany ’ s sparse consumer offerings that have today become cult products in the west -lrb- photo -rrb- - offering everything from spreewald forest 's famous small cucumbers to vita-cola to " rondo " coffee to rotkäppchen sparkling wine to drab clothes and colorful shopping bags .
the organizers are even planning to build a model of the karl marx allee , east berlin ’ s expansive shopping boulevard .
visitors can drop in on a real east german living room outfitted with flowery wallpaper , paintings of socialist factory life and cupboards stocked with special plates marking anniversaries of the founding of the east german state .
even models of the east germans ’ beloved dachas or weekend cottages with their own garden patch will offer visitors a rare glimpse into a leisurely break from the socialist system ’ s rigid work routine .
for those craving the thrill and intrigue of the cold war era , omnipresent stasi -lrb- east german secret police -rrb- spies will whet the appetite .
songs praising the virtues of hard work and content will also be piped in throughout the park by outdoor speakers .
not a gdr disneyland massine said the park is primarily targeted at a german audience that would likely spark entirely different reactions from west germans and their eastern counterparts .
but he 's also hoping to lure busloads of ubiquitous jet-setting americans and japanese . he hopes the mini-gdr will become a highlight of their marathon bus tours to places like the postcard-pretty neuschwanstein castle and heidelberg , while at the same time offering what he is promoting as an authentic view of socialist germany .
authentic is the operative word here .
massine has stressed that the amusement park is no way conceived as a gdr disneyland .
instead , the aim is to showcase a real slice of everyday life in the former east germany .
to that end , the organizers have been scrupulously researching the culture of the gdr and have read up on the vast documentation available about the fallen state .
kornelia lobmeier of the contemporary history forum in leipzig said putting the amusement park in the right historical context is of paramount importance .
" the amusement park is fundamentally not a bad idea when it contributes towards people dealing with the history of the gdr , " she said .
lobmeier , however , warned that if the park only superficially satisfied curiosity and fueled a nostalgic element , then it ran the danger of playing down the darker side of the gdr - a world where neighbors spied on each other and people were denied basic rights because of their political or religious beliefs .
" the background has to be elaborated , it ’ s not enough to just show everyday life and then everybody says , ‘ yeah , i know that , " she said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ' goodbye , lenin , ' hello humor !

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.07.2003 for leipzig , the olympic dream begins großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tired of watching world athletic championships on tv , residents of leipzig want to bring the olympics to their backyards .
as the bids close on tuesday for the candidate cities vying to host the 2012 summer olympics , germany 's hope , leipzig , is outlining its plans to make itself as attractive as possible . more than 40,000 people celebrated in the streets of leipzig in april when the city was chosen as germany 's hope to host the next olympic games . the east german city beat off competition from hamburg , düsseldorf , frankfurt and stuttgart to host the summer games in 2012 .
rostock , which was chosen to host the olympic sailing competition in the german bid , vied against the port cities of kiel , lübeck , stralsund and cuxhaven . but as candidate cities all over the world enter the second and final selection round to host the oldest competitive games today , the real work starts for leipzig , which is hoping to boost jobs and make its region - which like much of the formerly communist eastern germany is suffering from economic doldrums - into a town the international olympic committee ca n't turn down when it makes its final decision in early 2005 . germany has not hosted the olympics since the 1972 summer games in munich , which where marred after palestinian terrorists held the israeli team hostage .
two were shot dead by gunmen and nine others died during an ill-fated rescue attempt which turned the event into one of the darkest events in olympic history . sprucing up the city leipzig is eager to create some positive olympic history for germany . some € 30 million -lrb- $ 33.98 million -rrb- is set to be invested in the city in preparation for the next stage of its olympic bid . most of the money will come from the state of saxony , of which leipzig is second-largest city after dresden .
leipzig and its partner cities are also expected to contribute .
leipzig has already doubled its order for new trams for the city -lrb- the cost of which has already run into millions of euros -rrb- .
it will also have to prove to the international olympic committee it can provide a minimum of 42,000 hotel rooms and cope with an influx of 150,000 participants and as many as 500,000 spectators during each day of the competition . demands from city leaders are increasing for additional redevelopment projects in the city , where infrastructure languished and deteriorated under decades of communist rule until the fall of the berlin wall in 1990 and german reunification . indeed , the push from outlying leipzig areas to get their hands on funds earmarked for the olympic effort has become a strain .
so much so , in fact , that leipzig mayor wolfgang tiefensee has been forced to decide to keep the olympic efforts within a 10-kilometer radius of the city center . a massive and expensive endeavor all of this does not come cheap , of course .
if leipzig does win its bid , the city will have to raise an estimated € 2.6 billion to construct the sports halls , olympic playing fields and residential village that the enormous event requires .
how this funding will be split between local , state and federal governments remains an open question . but if € 2.6 billion has leipzig 's purse-string holders quaking in their boots , they can take comfort in the fact that the games have served as an economic booster for a number of host cities , which have in many cases made a profit on their initial investment . the games helped places like munich , which hosted the summer olympics in 1972 and barcelona , which played host in 1992 , transform themselves into world cities .
others enjoyed windfalls from sales of tv rights , advertising and ticket sales .
sydney , which hosted the last summer olympics , made a cool € 1.5 billion . but for leipzig , winning the games would mean a whole lot more .
in addition to the symbolic importance of awarding the games to a city that has pushed for the past 12 years to become a business center , it would also create much needed jobs in a languishing labor market . with an average unemployment rate of 18.3 percent , the number of jobless in eastern germany is more than double that in western germany .
between 1992 and 1998 , the federal government poured € 600 billion into the local economy , but it has still failed to bloom . olympics as economic booster shot local business leaders have said the olympics could create as many as 38,000 jobs by 2012 , though many would disappear again after the olympics . the dream might come true for leipzig .
although one of the smaller cities competing to host the games , leipzig has heard encouraging words from the olympic organizers . " germany , leipzig and rostock have good chances .
we know they are exacting in organization and have a team with good experience , " international olympic committee president jacques rogge said in april .
" other small cities have had the olympic games , too , like lillehammer -lrb- in norway -rrb- .

chirac , speaking in his traditional live televised interview , said he wanted euro zone finance ministers to " examine together provisional ways of easing " the stability and growth pact underpinning their economies .
he added that he wanted to see changes " coherent with the imperative of stability , and ensuring growth is not diminished " .
the french president added that while he respected the pact 's rules , a more political interpretation was needed to allow members of the 12 country euro zone greater freedom to maneuver .

"
austria 's economy minister karl-heinz grasser said , " we should n't even be discussing this - it 's one of the pillars of our economic policy and the single currency . " the pact , which aims to keep public debt levels in check and maintain confidence in the common currency , dictates that a budget deficit can not exceed more than 3 percent of national economic output .
france , the euro zone 's second biggest economy behind germany , had a public deficit of 3.1 percent in 2002 and the european commission 's provisional forecasts see it rising to 3.7 percent this year and 3.6 percent in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel .
germany ’ s finance minister hans eichel , who is himself grappling with a spiraling budget deficit , stopped short of echoing president chirac 's call for a relaxing of the rules , saying that the pact is , in fact , adapted to the current economic situation .
“ we consider that the pact in its current shape is appropriate to create monetary stability , ” said eichel .
“ but it is also suitable to achieve economic growth which is more important now .
and that is why we don ’ t need a debate about relaxing the pact . ” keeping the budget in line france , germany and portugal have all come under fire from the european commission for allowing their public deficits to exceed the 3 percent limit as they struggle to revive their stagnant economies .
however , france 's more cavalier approach to the stability and growth pact has been one issue on which it has exchanged open disagreement with germany , its key ally . the german government has often pledged to try to keep its deficit in line with the rules – a seemingly empty promise in the light of germany ’ s persistent failure to do so despite recent hefty tax cuts initiated to spur growth .
france , however , has often brazenly declared that it will not be able to adhere to the pact in its current form and would therefore not even try .
jacques chirac did , however , offer a softener of his own on monday by saying that he would , if possible , continue with his electoral promise of tax cuts to stimulate french growth . france and germany have failed to adhere to the 3 percent deficit limit for two years now .

after the u.s. senate decided to request nato help in postwar iraq , speculation is spreading in germany about a possible military deployment , despite concerns about the army ’ s overstretched capacities . with the german military or bundeswehr grappling with peacekeeping operations in three continents at present , the political discussion on a possible military involvement in postwar iraq has been dominated by ground realities .
karsten voigt , coordinator for german-u.s. relations in the german government told the berlin daily tagesspiegel on tuesday the bush administration wasn ’ t expecting a quick german contribution in iraq and was aware the german military was stretched to the limit with its foreign deployments .
voigt added foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in the u.s. , would not be " pressurized " by bush on the question .
even parliamentary foreign policy spokesman for germany ’ s opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- said last week , " i think our friends know that we have limited resources . "
indeed , with about 9,000 soldiers scattered in the balkans , afghanistan and as far as the horn of africa , the german army , plagued in recent years by chronic underfunding and in the thick of a radical overhaul , has its hands full .
army overworked , but can still do iraq wilfried stolze , spokesman for the federal armed forces union , told deutsche welle another foreign deployment would massively step up the logistical and financial burden on the bundeswehr .
" after all , the german army right now is undergoing its biggest shake-up in history , " he explained .
restructuring plans include modernizing the army , trimming the number of civilian jobs while at the same time increasing the number of soldiers -lrb- from 282,000 to 300,000 -rrb- , slashing military spending and training troops to gear up for new military challenges , including foreign deployments .
stolze said a u.s. request for military help in iraq would pose a big problem to the overburdened bundeswehr .
" what we lack is manpower – especially specialists such as paramedics and radio operators .
besides , another foreign deployment would involve a huge initial operation within germany .
we simply can ’ t afford that . "
at the same time stolze did not rule out the bundesweher scraping together troops if it came down to it and said realistically about 1,500 to 2,000 soldiers could be sent to iraq .
" however , what ’ s important is that the mandate is a limited and robust one – the soldiers have to be well-armed – and that it takes place under u.n. auspices , " he added .
u.s. turns to nato for help in iraq the present discussion over an iraq deployment follows a request last week by the united states senate to the nato military alliance for support to reinforce the 147,000 american troops serving as occupying forces in iraq .
continuing resistance from iraqi groups , mounting american and british casualties and rising costs of maintaining a huge peacekeeping operation in iraq has forced the u.s. to seek broader international support .
though no concrete request has come in as yet from the u.s. , german government spokesman bela anda said over the weekend it was possible a request would be received at the nato council in brussels after the summer break .
so far the reaction from nato countries , prominently germany and france , has been lukewarm .
both say there is no adequate united nations mandate to legitimize their presence in iraq .
france , like germany , is also heavily involved in foreign military deployments in the balkans , ivory coast , congo and afghanistan .
germany : nothing without a u.n. mandate german chancellor gerhard schröder , whose antiwar and pro-u.n. stance when the u.s. invaded iraq strained relations with washington , said in a television interview last week his government would not send troops to iraq except in a nato context and only with a specific mandate from the u.n. he said the bush administration had already been informed of his position .
the chancellor ’ s coalition government also has the support of the conservative opposition in insisting that the u.n. needs to play the central role in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq .
politicians still divided about possible deployment however , the hard realities of the army ’ s stretched capabilities now has german politicians speculating on what alternative help germany could provide in iraq under a u.n. mandate .
on tuesday , foreign policy speaker of the opposition cdu , friedbert pflüger , said in a newspaper interview that germany would have to contribute towards rebuilding civil society and securing peace in iraq if nato were to receive a request to that effect from the u.n. he suggested reducing the number of german peacekeepers in the balkans in order to facilitate sending troops to iraq .
" we have to watch out in any case that we don ’ t throw away this great chance through mistakes , " he said in a reference to germany ’ s shunning by washington earlier this year after berlin refused to support the u.s.-led war in iraq .
however members of schröder ’ s social democrat and the green government are vehemently against sending german troops to iraq , even under a u.n. mandate .
leader of the social democrat parliamentary group gernot erler said german police and aid workers could be sent to iraq , but not the army .
" nobody can really expect a country , that so clearly rejected the iraq war , to send in soldiers there , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany : no nato in iraq without un if the united states hopes to get nato soldiers side-by-side with their own in iraq , they will have to involve the united nations .
that message came loud and clear out of berlin on friday -lrb- july 12 , 2003 -rrb- .
european press review : the u.n. could at last get its chance in iraq european papers on friday focused on the increasingly risk-fraught attempt by the americans to restore order in postwar iraq and the erosion of president bush 's credibility -lrb- july 11 , 2003 -rrb- .

after the u.s. senate decided to request nato help in postwar iraq , speculation is spreading in germany about a possible military deployment , despite concerns about the army ’ s overstretched capacities . with the german military or bundeswehr grappling with peacekeeping operations in three continents at present , the political discussion on a possible military involvement in postwar iraq has been dominated by ground realities .
karsten voigt , coordinator for german-u.s. relations in the german government told the berlin daily tagesspiegel on tuesday the bush administration wasn ’ t expecting a quick german contribution in iraq and was aware the german military was stretched to the limit with its foreign deployments .
voigt added foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in the u.s. , would not be " pressurized " by bush on the question .
even parliamentary foreign policy spokesman for germany ’ s opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- said last week , " i think our friends know that we have limited resources . "
indeed , with about 9,000 soldiers scattered in the balkans , afghanistan and as far as the horn of africa , the german army , plagued in recent years by chronic underfunding and in the thick of a radical overhaul , has its hands full .
army overworked , but can still do iraq wilfried stolze , spokesman for the federal armed forces union , told deutsche welle another foreign deployment would massively step up the logistical and financial burden on the bundeswehr .
" after all , the german army right now is undergoing its biggest shake-up in history , " he explained .
restructuring plans include modernizing the army , trimming the number of civilian jobs while at the same time increasing the number of soldiers -lrb- from 282,000 to 300,000 -rrb- , slashing military spending and training troops to gear up for new military challenges , including foreign deployments .
stolze said a u.s. request for military help in iraq would pose a big problem to the overburdened bundeswehr .
" what we lack is manpower – especially specialists such as paramedics and radio operators .
besides , another foreign deployment would involve a huge initial operation within germany .
we simply can ’ t afford that . "
at the same time stolze did not rule out the bundesweher scraping together troops if it came down to it and said realistically about 1,500 to 2,000 soldiers could be sent to iraq .
" however , what ’ s important is that the mandate is a limited and robust one – the soldiers have to be well-armed – and that it takes place under u.n. auspices , " he added .
u.s. turns to nato for help in iraq the present discussion over an iraq deployment follows a request last week by the united states senate to the nato military alliance for support to reinforce the 147,000 american troops serving as occupying forces in iraq .
continuing resistance from iraqi groups , mounting american and british casualties and rising costs of maintaining a huge peacekeeping operation in iraq has forced the u.s. to seek broader international support .
though no concrete request has come in as yet from the u.s. , german government spokesman bela anda said over the weekend it was possible a request would be received at the nato council in brussels after the summer break .
so far the reaction from nato countries , prominently germany and france , has been lukewarm .

france , like germany , is also heavily involved in foreign military deployments in the balkans , ivory coast , congo and afghanistan .
germany : nothing without a u.n. mandate german chancellor gerhard schröder , whose antiwar and pro-u.n. stance when the u.s. invaded iraq strained relations with washington , said in a television interview last week his government would not send troops to iraq except in a nato context and only with a specific mandate from the u.n. he said the bush administration had already been informed of his position .
the chancellor ’ s coalition government also has the support of the conservative opposition in insisting that the u.n. needs to play the central role in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq .
politicians still divided about possible deployment however , the hard realities of the army ’ s stretched capabilities now has german politicians speculating on what alternative help germany could provide in iraq under a u.n. mandate .
on tuesday , foreign policy speaker of the opposition cdu , friedbert pflüger , said in a newspaper interview that germany would have to contribute towards rebuilding civil society and securing peace in iraq if nato were to receive a request to that effect from the u.n. he suggested reducing the number of german peacekeepers in the balkans in order to facilitate sending troops to iraq .
" we have to watch out in any case that we don ’ t throw away this great chance through mistakes , " he said in a reference to germany ’ s shunning by washington earlier this year after berlin refused to support the u.s.-led war in iraq .
however members of schröder ’ s social democrat and the green government are vehemently against sending german troops to iraq , even under a u.n. mandate .

chirac , speaking in his traditional live televised interview , said he wanted euro zone finance ministers to " examine together provisional ways of easing " the stability and growth pact underpinning their economies .
he added that he wanted to see changes " coherent with the imperative of stability , and ensuring growth is not diminished " .
the french president added that while he respected the pact 's rules , a more political interpretation was needed to allow members of the 12 country euro zone greater freedom to maneuver .
" this is not about modifying the stability pact .
it 's a case of getting the representatives of euro zone nations to examine together the terms of a temporary softening , " he said .
“ -lrb- ministers -rrb- must find a solution that is both consistent with the imperative of stability yet that avoids any lowering of growth prospects " . storming the stability pact on a day when france remembered the historic event that led to the formation of the republic , the timing of chirac ’ s statement was not lost on those eu finance ministers who reacted angrily to the french president ’ s words . “ this is july 14 , the day the bastille was stormed , and now it 's the day the stability pact has been stormed , ” said dutch finance minister gerrit zalm angrily going into a meeting of ecofin , the group of eu finance ministers , in brussels on monday night .
“ the storming of the bastille was a better idea . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes .
" the pact does not need to be modified , " said pedro solbes , the eu ’ s economic and monetary affairs commissioner -lrb- photo -rrb- , adding that the european commission had immediately rejected chirac ’ s requests . finland ’ s antii kalliomaki told reporters outside the ecofin meeting , “ we have no room for softening the pact , not even temporarily . "
austria 's economy minister karl-heinz grasser said , " we should n't even be discussing this - it 's one of the pillars of our economic policy and the single currency . " the pact , which aims to keep public debt levels in check and maintain confidence in the common currency , dictates that a budget deficit can not exceed more than 3 percent of national economic output .
france , the euro zone 's second biggest economy behind germany , had a public deficit of 3.1 percent in 2002 and the european commission 's provisional forecasts see it rising to 3.7 percent this year and 3.6 percent in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel .
germany ’ s finance minister hans eichel , who is himself grappling with a spiraling budget deficit , stopped short of echoing president chirac 's call for a relaxing of the rules , saying that the pact is , in fact , adapted to the current economic situation .
“ we consider that the pact in its current shape is appropriate to create monetary stability , ” said eichel .
“ but it is also suitable to achieve economic growth which is more important now .
and that is why we don ’ t need a debate about relaxing the pact . ” keeping the budget in line france , germany and portugal have all come under fire from the european commission for allowing their public deficits to exceed the 3 percent limit as they struggle to revive their stagnant economies .
however , france 's more cavalier approach to the stability and growth pact has been one issue on which it has exchanged open disagreement with germany , its key ally . the german government has often pledged to try to keep its deficit in line with the rules – a seemingly empty promise in the light of germany ’ s persistent failure to do so despite recent hefty tax cuts initiated to spur growth .
france , however , has often brazenly declared that it will not be able to adhere to the pact in its current form and would therefore not even try .
jacques chirac did , however , offer a softener of his own on monday by saying that he would , if possible , continue with his electoral promise of tax cuts to stimulate french growth . france and germany have failed to adhere to the 3 percent deficit limit for two years now .
if the eu ’ s executive commission forecasts are proved right later this year and both countries break the pact for a third year running , the commission will have no other choice but to either impose fines of several billion euro or bow to pressure and ease the pact ’ s conditions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german tax cuts unsettle brussels the announcement that germany ’ s cabinet was approving tax cuts sent ripples through the eu , which worries that the euro zone ’ s biggest economy could incur even more debt and run amiss of the stability and growth pact .

france , the euro zone 's second biggest economy behind germany , had a public deficit of 3.1 percent in 2002 and the european commission 's provisional forecasts see it rising to 3.7 percent this year and 3.6 percent in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel .
germany ’ s finance minister hans eichel , who is himself grappling with a spiraling budget deficit , stopped short of echoing president chirac 's call for a relaxing of the rules , saying that the pact is , in fact , adapted to the current economic situation .
“ we consider that the pact in its current shape is appropriate to create monetary stability , ” said eichel .
“ but it is also suitable to achieve economic growth which is more important now .
and that is why we don ’ t need a debate about relaxing the pact . ” keeping the budget in line france , germany and portugal have all come under fire from the european commission for allowing their public deficits to exceed the 3 percent limit as they struggle to revive their stagnant economies .
however , france 's more cavalier approach to the stability and growth pact has been one issue on which it has exchanged open disagreement with germany , its key ally . the german government has often pledged to try to keep its deficit in line with the rules – a seemingly empty promise in the light of germany ’ s persistent failure to do so despite recent hefty tax cuts initiated to spur growth .
france , however , has often brazenly declared that it will not be able to adhere to the pact in its current form and would therefore not even try .
jacques chirac did , however , offer a softener of his own on monday by saying that he would , if possible , continue with his electoral promise of tax cuts to stimulate french growth . france and germany have failed to adhere to the 3 percent deficit limit for two years now .
if the eu ’ s executive commission forecasts are proved right later this year and both countries break the pact for a third year running , the commission will have no other choice but to either impose fines of several billion euro or bow to pressure and ease the pact ’ s conditions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german tax cuts unsettle brussels the announcement that germany ’ s cabinet was approving tax cuts sent ripples through the eu , which worries that the euro zone ’ s biggest economy could incur even more debt and run amiss of the stability and growth pact .

as the bids close on tuesday for the candidate cities vying to host the 2012 summer olympics , germany 's hope , leipzig , is outlining its plans to make itself as attractive as possible . more than 40,000 people celebrated in the streets of leipzig in april when the city was chosen as germany 's hope to host the next olympic games . the east german city beat off competition from hamburg , düsseldorf , frankfurt and stuttgart to host the summer games in 2012 .
rostock , which was chosen to host the olympic sailing competition in the german bid , vied against the port cities of kiel , lübeck , stralsund and cuxhaven . but as candidate cities all over the world enter the second and final selection round to host the oldest competitive games today , the real work starts for leipzig , which is hoping to boost jobs and make its region - which like much of the formerly communist eastern germany is suffering from economic doldrums - into a town the international olympic committee ca n't turn down when it makes its final decision in early 2005 . germany has not hosted the olympics since the 1972 summer games in munich , which where marred after palestinian terrorists held the israeli team hostage .
two were shot dead by gunmen and nine others died during an ill-fated rescue attempt which turned the event into one of the darkest events in olympic history . sprucing up the city leipzig is eager to create some positive olympic history for germany . some € 30 million -lrb- $ 33.98 million -rrb- is set to be invested in the city in preparation for the next stage of its olympic bid . most of the money will come from the state of saxony , of which leipzig is second-largest city after dresden .
leipzig and its partner cities are also expected to contribute .
leipzig has already doubled its order for new trams for the city -lrb- the cost of which has already run into millions of euros -rrb- .
it will also have to prove to the international olympic committee it can provide a minimum of 42,000 hotel rooms and cope with an influx of 150,000 participants and as many as 500,000 spectators during each day of the competition . demands from city leaders are increasing for additional redevelopment projects in the city , where infrastructure languished and deteriorated under decades of communist rule until the fall of the berlin wall in 1990 and german reunification . indeed , the push from outlying leipzig areas to get their hands on funds earmarked for the olympic effort has become a strain .
so much so , in fact , that leipzig mayor wolfgang tiefensee has been forced to decide to keep the olympic efforts within a 10-kilometer radius of the city center . a massive and expensive endeavor all of this does not come cheap , of course .
if leipzig does win its bid , the city will have to raise an estimated € 2.6 billion to construct the sports halls , olympic playing fields and residential village that the enormous event requires .
how this funding will be split between local , state and federal governments remains an open question . but if € 2.6 billion has leipzig 's purse-string holders quaking in their boots , they can take comfort in the fact that the games have served as an economic booster for a number of host cities , which have in many cases made a profit on their initial investment . the games helped places like munich , which hosted the summer olympics in 1972 and barcelona , which played host in 1992 , transform themselves into world cities .

in addition to the symbolic importance of awarding the games to a city that has pushed for the past 12 years to become a business center , it would also create much needed jobs in a languishing labor market . with an average unemployment rate of 18.3 percent , the number of jobless in eastern germany is more than double that in western germany .
between 1992 and 1998 , the federal government poured € 600 billion into the local economy , but it has still failed to bloom . olympics as economic booster shot local business leaders have said the olympics could create as many as 38,000 jobs by 2012 , though many would disappear again after the olympics . the dream might come true for leipzig .

as the bids close on tuesday for the candidate cities vying to host the 2012 summer olympics , germany 's hope , leipzig , is outlining its plans to make itself as attractive as possible . more than 40,000 people celebrated in the streets of leipzig in april when the city was chosen as germany 's hope to host the next olympic games . the east german city beat off competition from hamburg , düsseldorf , frankfurt and stuttgart to host the summer games in 2012 .
rostock , which was chosen to host the olympic sailing competition in the german bid , vied against the port cities of kiel , lübeck , stralsund and cuxhaven . but as candidate cities all over the world enter the second and final selection round to host the oldest competitive games today , the real work starts for leipzig , which is hoping to boost jobs and make its region - which like much of the formerly communist eastern germany is suffering from economic doldrums - into a town the international olympic committee ca n't turn down when it makes its final decision in early 2005 . germany has not hosted the olympics since the 1972 summer games in munich , which where marred after palestinian terrorists held the israeli team hostage .
two were shot dead by gunmen and nine others died during an ill-fated rescue attempt which turned the event into one of the darkest events in olympic history . sprucing up the city leipzig is eager to create some positive olympic history for germany . some € 30 million -lrb- $ 33.98 million -rrb- is set to be invested in the city in preparation for the next stage of its olympic bid . most of the money will come from the state of saxony , of which leipzig is second-largest city after dresden .
leipzig and its partner cities are also expected to contribute .
leipzig has already doubled its order for new trams for the city -lrb- the cost of which has already run into millions of euros -rrb- .
it will also have to prove to the international olympic committee it can provide a minimum of 42,000 hotel rooms and cope with an influx of 150,000 participants and as many as 500,000 spectators during each day of the competition . demands from city leaders are increasing for additional redevelopment projects in the city , where infrastructure languished and deteriorated under decades of communist rule until the fall of the berlin wall in 1990 and german reunification . indeed , the push from outlying leipzig areas to get their hands on funds earmarked for the olympic effort has become a strain .
so much so , in fact , that leipzig mayor wolfgang tiefensee has been forced to decide to keep the olympic efforts within a 10-kilometer radius of the city center . a massive and expensive endeavor all of this does not come cheap , of course .
if leipzig does win its bid , the city will have to raise an estimated € 2.6 billion to construct the sports halls , olympic playing fields and residential village that the enormous event requires .
how this funding will be split between local , state and federal governments remains an open question . but if € 2.6 billion has leipzig 's purse-string holders quaking in their boots , they can take comfort in the fact that the games have served as an economic booster for a number of host cities , which have in many cases made a profit on their initial investment . the games helped places like munich , which hosted the summer olympics in 1972 and barcelona , which played host in 1992 , transform themselves into world cities .
others enjoyed windfalls from sales of tv rights , advertising and ticket sales .
sydney , which hosted the last summer olympics , made a cool € 1.5 billion . but for leipzig , winning the games would mean a whole lot more .
in addition to the symbolic importance of awarding the games to a city that has pushed for the past 12 years to become a business center , it would also create much needed jobs in a languishing labor market . with an average unemployment rate of 18.3 percent , the number of jobless in eastern germany is more than double that in western germany .
between 1992 and 1998 , the federal government poured € 600 billion into the local economy , but it has still failed to bloom . olympics as economic booster shot local business leaders have said the olympics could create as many as 38,000 jobs by 2012 , though many would disappear again after the olympics . the dream might come true for leipzig .
although one of the smaller cities competing to host the games , leipzig has heard encouraging words from the olympic organizers . " germany , leipzig and rostock have good chances .
we know they are exacting in organization and have a team with good experience , " international olympic committee president jacques rogge said in april .
" other small cities have had the olympic games , too , like lillehammer -lrb- in norway -rrb- .

famous for producing the local production of the musical grease , his company " massine productions " is now investing € 1.2 million -lrb- $ 1.35 million -rrb- to set up a gdr-themed amusement park in the former east berlin industrial district of oberschöneweide .

complete with rides in boxy east german trabant cars -lrb- photo -rrb- , guards outfitted in communist and border patrol uniforms and pedestrian traffic signals with the trademark green walking man with flat-brimmed hat and jaunty step , the sprawling park spread over 10,000 square meters is designed to capture a slice of east german communist life .
organizers plan to hire about 20 long-term jobless east germans over 50 years of age to play border guards , traffic policemen and canteen personnel .
the gdr park is expected to open its doors next summer .
from spreewald cucumbers to secret spies the tour will begin with a formal arrival at a checkpoint where visitors must pass countless guards and officials scrutinizing papers and identification cards , as was the case during the cold war , and will include a forced exchange of western deutsche marks for eastern ones .

the organizers are even planning to build a model of the karl marx allee , east berlin ’ s expansive shopping boulevard .
visitors can drop in on a real east german living room outfitted with flowery wallpaper , paintings of socialist factory life and cupboards stocked with special plates marking anniversaries of the founding of the east german state .
even models of the east germans ’ beloved dachas or weekend cottages with their own garden patch will offer visitors a rare glimpse into a leisurely break from the socialist system ’ s rigid work routine .
for those craving the thrill and intrigue of the cold war era , omnipresent stasi -lrb- east german secret police -rrb- spies will whet the appetite .
songs praising the virtues of hard work and content will also be piped in throughout the park by outdoor speakers .

but he 's also hoping to lure busloads of ubiquitous jet-setting americans and japanese . he hopes the mini-gdr will become a highlight of their marathon bus tours to places like the postcard-pretty neuschwanstein castle and heidelberg , while at the same time offering what he is promoting as an authentic view of socialist germany .
authentic is the operative word here .
massine has stressed that the amusement park is no way conceived as a gdr disneyland .
instead , the aim is to showcase a real slice of everyday life in the former east germany .
to that end , the organizers have been scrupulously researching the culture of the gdr and have read up on the vast documentation available about the fallen state .
kornelia lobmeier of the contemporary history forum in leipzig said putting the amusement park in the right historical context is of paramount importance .
" the amusement park is fundamentally not a bad idea when it contributes towards people dealing with the history of the gdr , " she said .
lobmeier , however , warned that if the park only superficially satisfied curiosity and fueled a nostalgic element , then it ran the danger of playing down the darker side of the gdr - a world where neighbors spied on each other and people were denied basic rights because of their political or religious beliefs .

famous for producing the local production of the musical grease , his company " massine productions " is now investing € 1.2 million -lrb- $ 1.35 million -rrb- to set up a gdr-themed amusement park in the former east berlin industrial district of oberschöneweide .

complete with rides in boxy east german trabant cars -lrb- photo -rrb- , guards outfitted in communist and border patrol uniforms and pedestrian traffic signals with the trademark green walking man with flat-brimmed hat and jaunty step , the sprawling park spread over 10,000 square meters is designed to capture a slice of east german communist life .
organizers plan to hire about 20 long-term jobless east germans over 50 years of age to play border guards , traffic policemen and canteen personnel .
the gdr park is expected to open its doors next summer .
from spreewald cucumbers to secret spies the tour will begin with a formal arrival at a checkpoint where visitors must pass countless guards and officials scrutinizing papers and identification cards , as was the case during the cold war , and will include a forced exchange of western deutsche marks for eastern ones .

the organizers are even planning to build a model of the karl marx allee , east berlin ’ s expansive shopping boulevard .
visitors can drop in on a real east german living room outfitted with flowery wallpaper , paintings of socialist factory life and cupboards stocked with special plates marking anniversaries of the founding of the east german state .
even models of the east germans ’ beloved dachas or weekend cottages with their own garden patch will offer visitors a rare glimpse into a leisurely break from the socialist system ’ s rigid work routine .
for those craving the thrill and intrigue of the cold war era , omnipresent stasi -lrb- east german secret police -rrb- spies will whet the appetite .
songs praising the virtues of hard work and content will also be piped in throughout the park by outdoor speakers .
not a gdr disneyland massine said the park is primarily targeted at a german audience that would likely spark entirely different reactions from west germans and their eastern counterparts .
but he 's also hoping to lure busloads of ubiquitous jet-setting americans and japanese . he hopes the mini-gdr will become a highlight of their marathon bus tours to places like the postcard-pretty neuschwanstein castle and heidelberg , while at the same time offering what he is promoting as an authentic view of socialist germany .
authentic is the operative word here .
massine has stressed that the amusement park is no way conceived as a gdr disneyland .
instead , the aim is to showcase a real slice of everyday life in the former east germany .
to that end , the organizers have been scrupulously researching the culture of the gdr and have read up on the vast documentation available about the fallen state .
kornelia lobmeier of the contemporary history forum in leipzig said putting the amusement park in the right historical context is of paramount importance .
" the amusement park is fundamentally not a bad idea when it contributes towards people dealing with the history of the gdr , " she said .
lobmeier , however , warned that if the park only superficially satisfied curiosity and fueled a nostalgic element , then it ran the danger of playing down the darker side of the gdr - a world where neighbors spied on each other and people were denied basic rights because of their political or religious beliefs .

after the u.s. senate decided to request nato help in postwar iraq , speculation is spreading in germany about a possible military deployment , despite concerns about the army ’ s overstretched capacities . with the german military or bundeswehr grappling with peacekeeping operations in three continents at present , the political discussion on a possible military involvement in postwar iraq has been dominated by ground realities .
karsten voigt , coordinator for german-u.s. relations in the german government told the berlin daily tagesspiegel on tuesday the bush administration wasn ’ t expecting a quick german contribution in iraq and was aware the german military was stretched to the limit with its foreign deployments .

even parliamentary foreign policy spokesman for germany ’ s opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- said last week , " i think our friends know that we have limited resources . "
indeed , with about 9,000 soldiers scattered in the balkans , afghanistan and as far as the horn of africa , the german army , plagued in recent years by chronic underfunding and in the thick of a radical overhaul , has its hands full .
army overworked , but can still do iraq wilfried stolze , spokesman for the federal armed forces union , told deutsche welle another foreign deployment would massively step up the logistical and financial burden on the bundeswehr .
" after all , the german army right now is undergoing its biggest shake-up in history , " he explained .
restructuring plans include modernizing the army , trimming the number of civilian jobs while at the same time increasing the number of soldiers -lrb- from 282,000 to 300,000 -rrb- , slashing military spending and training troops to gear up for new military challenges , including foreign deployments .
stolze said a u.s. request for military help in iraq would pose a big problem to the overburdened bundeswehr .
" what we lack is manpower – especially specialists such as paramedics and radio operators .
besides , another foreign deployment would involve a huge initial operation within germany .
we simply can ’ t afford that . "
at the same time stolze did not rule out the bundesweher scraping together troops if it came down to it and said realistically about 1,500 to 2,000 soldiers could be sent to iraq .
" however , what ’ s important is that the mandate is a limited and robust one – the soldiers have to be well-armed – and that it takes place under u.n. auspices , " he added .
u.s. turns to nato for help in iraq the present discussion over an iraq deployment follows a request last week by the united states senate to the nato military alliance for support to reinforce the 147,000 american troops serving as occupying forces in iraq .
continuing resistance from iraqi groups , mounting american and british casualties and rising costs of maintaining a huge peacekeeping operation in iraq has forced the u.s. to seek broader international support .
though no concrete request has come in as yet from the u.s. , german government spokesman bela anda said over the weekend it was possible a request would be received at the nato council in brussels after the summer break .
so far the reaction from nato countries , prominently germany and france , has been lukewarm .
both say there is no adequate united nations mandate to legitimize their presence in iraq .
france , like germany , is also heavily involved in foreign military deployments in the balkans , ivory coast , congo and afghanistan .
germany : nothing without a u.n. mandate german chancellor gerhard schröder , whose antiwar and pro-u.n. stance when the u.s. invaded iraq strained relations with washington , said in a television interview last week his government would not send troops to iraq except in a nato context and only with a specific mandate from the u.n. he said the bush administration had already been informed of his position .
the chancellor ’ s coalition government also has the support of the conservative opposition in insisting that the u.n. needs to play the central role in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq .

after the u.s. senate decided to request nato help in postwar iraq , speculation is spreading in germany about a possible military deployment , despite concerns about the army ’ s overstretched capacities . with the german military or bundeswehr grappling with peacekeeping operations in three continents at present , the political discussion on a possible military involvement in postwar iraq has been dominated by ground realities .
karsten voigt , coordinator for german-u.s. relations in the german government told the berlin daily tagesspiegel on tuesday the bush administration wasn ’ t expecting a quick german contribution in iraq and was aware the german military was stretched to the limit with its foreign deployments .
voigt added foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in the u.s. , would not be " pressurized " by bush on the question .
even parliamentary foreign policy spokesman for germany ’ s opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- said last week , " i think our friends know that we have limited resources . "

as the bids close on tuesday for the candidate cities vying to host the 2012 summer olympics , germany 's hope , leipzig , is outlining its plans to make itself as attractive as possible . more than 40,000 people celebrated in the streets of leipzig in april when the city was chosen as germany 's hope to host the next olympic games . the east german city beat off competition from hamburg , düsseldorf , frankfurt and stuttgart to host the summer games in 2012 .
rostock , which was chosen to host the olympic sailing competition in the german bid , vied against the port cities of kiel , lübeck , stralsund and cuxhaven . but as candidate cities all over the world enter the second and final selection round to host the oldest competitive games today , the real work starts for leipzig , which is hoping to boost jobs and make its region - which like much of the formerly communist eastern germany is suffering from economic doldrums - into a town the international olympic committee ca n't turn down when it makes its final decision in early 2005 . germany has not hosted the olympics since the 1972 summer games in munich , which where marred after palestinian terrorists held the israeli team hostage .
two were shot dead by gunmen and nine others died during an ill-fated rescue attempt which turned the event into one of the darkest events in olympic history . sprucing up the city leipzig is eager to create some positive olympic history for germany . some € 30 million -lrb- $ 33.98 million -rrb- is set to be invested in the city in preparation for the next stage of its olympic bid . most of the money will come from the state of saxony , of which leipzig is second-largest city after dresden .
leipzig and its partner cities are also expected to contribute .
leipzig has already doubled its order for new trams for the city -lrb- the cost of which has already run into millions of euros -rrb- .
it will also have to prove to the international olympic committee it can provide a minimum of 42,000 hotel rooms and cope with an influx of 150,000 participants and as many as 500,000 spectators during each day of the competition . demands from city leaders are increasing for additional redevelopment projects in the city , where infrastructure languished and deteriorated under decades of communist rule until the fall of the berlin wall in 1990 and german reunification . indeed , the push from outlying leipzig areas to get their hands on funds earmarked for the olympic effort has become a strain .
so much so , in fact , that leipzig mayor wolfgang tiefensee has been forced to decide to keep the olympic efforts within a 10-kilometer radius of the city center . a massive and expensive endeavor all of this does not come cheap , of course .
if leipzig does win its bid , the city will have to raise an estimated € 2.6 billion to construct the sports halls , olympic playing fields and residential village that the enormous event requires .
how this funding will be split between local , state and federal governments remains an open question . but if € 2.6 billion has leipzig 's purse-string holders quaking in their boots , they can take comfort in the fact that the games have served as an economic booster for a number of host cities , which have in many cases made a profit on their initial investment . the games helped places like munich , which hosted the summer olympics in 1972 and barcelona , which played host in 1992 , transform themselves into world cities .
others enjoyed windfalls from sales of tv rights , advertising and ticket sales .
sydney , which hosted the last summer olympics , made a cool € 1.5 billion . but for leipzig , winning the games would mean a whole lot more .
in addition to the symbolic importance of awarding the games to a city that has pushed for the past 12 years to become a business center , it would also create much needed jobs in a languishing labor market . with an average unemployment rate of 18.3 percent , the number of jobless in eastern germany is more than double that in western germany .
between 1992 and 1998 , the federal government poured € 600 billion into the local economy , but it has still failed to bloom . olympics as economic booster shot local business leaders have said the olympics could create as many as 38,000 jobs by 2012 , though many would disappear again after the olympics . the dream might come true for leipzig .
although one of the smaller cities competing to host the games , leipzig has heard encouraging words from the olympic organizers . " germany , leipzig and rostock have good chances .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 15.07.2003 chirac ’ s call for softer pact creates uproar großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angry ministers accuse jacques chirac of storming the stability pact on bastille day jacques chirac ’ s bastille day statement calling for temporary measures to relax the eu ’ s stability and growth pact has caused outrage among euro zone finance ministers . french president jacques chirac chose monday ’ s bastille day celebrations to call for possible temporary ways for the eu ’ s stability and growth pact to be softened and for legislation within the pact to be amended to avoid restricting economic growth .
chirac , speaking in his traditional live televised interview , said he wanted euro zone finance ministers to " examine together provisional ways of easing " the stability and growth pact underpinning their economies .
he added that he wanted to see changes " coherent with the imperative of stability , and ensuring growth is not diminished " .
the french president added that while he respected the pact 's rules , a more political interpretation was needed to allow members of the 12 country euro zone greater freedom to maneuver .
" this is not about modifying the stability pact .
it 's a case of getting the representatives of euro zone nations to examine together the terms of a temporary softening , " he said .
“ -lrb- ministers -rrb- must find a solution that is both consistent with the imperative of stability yet that avoids any lowering of growth prospects " . storming the stability pact on a day when france remembered the historic event that led to the formation of the republic , the timing of chirac ’ s statement was not lost on those eu finance ministers who reacted angrily to the french president ’ s words . “ this is july 14 , the day the bastille was stormed , and now it 's the day the stability pact has been stormed , ” said dutch finance minister gerrit zalm angrily going into a meeting of ecofin , the group of eu finance ministers , in brussels on monday night .
“ the storming of the bastille was a better idea . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes .
" the pact does not need to be modified , " said pedro solbes , the eu ’ s economic and monetary affairs commissioner -lrb- photo -rrb- , adding that the european commission had immediately rejected chirac ’ s requests . finland ’ s antii kalliomaki told reporters outside the ecofin meeting , “ we have no room for softening the pact , not even temporarily . "
austria 's economy minister karl-heinz grasser said , " we should n't even be discussing this - it 's one of the pillars of our economic policy and the single currency . " the pact , which aims to keep public debt levels in check and maintain confidence in the common currency , dictates that a budget deficit can not exceed more than 3 percent of national economic output .
france , the euro zone 's second biggest economy behind germany , had a public deficit of 3.1 percent in 2002 and the european commission 's provisional forecasts see it rising to 3.7 percent this year and 3.6 percent in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel .
germany ’ s finance minister hans eichel , who is himself grappling with a spiraling budget deficit , stopped short of echoing president chirac 's call for a relaxing of the rules , saying that the pact is , in fact , adapted to the current economic situation .
“ we consider that the pact in its current shape is appropriate to create monetary stability , ” said eichel .
“ but it is also suitable to achieve economic growth which is more important now .
and that is why we don ’ t need a debate about relaxing the pact . ” keeping the budget in line france , germany and portugal have all come under fire from the european commission for allowing their public deficits to exceed the 3 percent limit as they struggle to revive their stagnant economies .
however , france 's more cavalier approach to the stability and growth pact has been one issue on which it has exchanged open disagreement with germany , its key ally . the german government has often pledged to try to keep its deficit in line with the rules – a seemingly empty promise in the light of germany ’ s persistent failure to do so despite recent hefty tax cuts initiated to spur growth .

chirac , speaking in his traditional live televised interview , said he wanted euro zone finance ministers to " examine together provisional ways of easing " the stability and growth pact underpinning their economies .
he added that he wanted to see changes " coherent with the imperative of stability , and ensuring growth is not diminished " .
the french president added that while he respected the pact 's rules , a more political interpretation was needed to allow members of the 12 country euro zone greater freedom to maneuver .
" this is not about modifying the stability pact .
it 's a case of getting the representatives of euro zone nations to examine together the terms of a temporary softening , " he said .
“ -lrb- ministers -rrb- must find a solution that is both consistent with the imperative of stability yet that avoids any lowering of growth prospects " . storming the stability pact on a day when france remembered the historic event that led to the formation of the republic , the timing of chirac ’ s statement was not lost on those eu finance ministers who reacted angrily to the french president ’ s words . “ this is july 14 , the day the bastille was stormed , and now it 's the day the stability pact has been stormed , ” said dutch finance minister gerrit zalm angrily going into a meeting of ecofin , the group of eu finance ministers , in brussels on monday night .
“ the storming of the bastille was a better idea . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes .
" the pact does not need to be modified , " said pedro solbes , the eu ’ s economic and monetary affairs commissioner -lrb- photo -rrb- , adding that the european commission had immediately rejected chirac ’ s requests . finland ’ s antii kalliomaki told reporters outside the ecofin meeting , “ we have no room for softening the pact , not even temporarily . "
austria 's economy minister karl-heinz grasser said , " we should n't even be discussing this - it 's one of the pillars of our economic policy and the single currency . " the pact , which aims to keep public debt levels in check and maintain confidence in the common currency , dictates that a budget deficit can not exceed more than 3 percent of national economic output .
france , the euro zone 's second biggest economy behind germany , had a public deficit of 3.1 percent in 2002 and the european commission 's provisional forecasts see it rising to 3.7 percent this year and 3.6 percent in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel .
germany ’ s finance minister hans eichel , who is himself grappling with a spiraling budget deficit , stopped short of echoing president chirac 's call for a relaxing of the rules , saying that the pact is , in fact , adapted to the current economic situation .
“ we consider that the pact in its current shape is appropriate to create monetary stability , ” said eichel .
“ but it is also suitable to achieve economic growth which is more important now .
and that is why we don ’ t need a debate about relaxing the pact . ” keeping the budget in line france , germany and portugal have all come under fire from the european commission for allowing their public deficits to exceed the 3 percent limit as they struggle to revive their stagnant economies .
however , france 's more cavalier approach to the stability and growth pact has been one issue on which it has exchanged open disagreement with germany , its key ally . the german government has often pledged to try to keep its deficit in line with the rules – a seemingly empty promise in the light of germany ’ s persistent failure to do so despite recent hefty tax cuts initiated to spur growth .

chirac , speaking in his traditional live televised interview , said he wanted euro zone finance ministers to " examine together provisional ways of easing " the stability and growth pact underpinning their economies .
he added that he wanted to see changes " coherent with the imperative of stability , and ensuring growth is not diminished " .
the french president added that while he respected the pact 's rules , a more political interpretation was needed to allow members of the 12 country euro zone greater freedom to maneuver .
" this is not about modifying the stability pact .
it 's a case of getting the representatives of euro zone nations to examine together the terms of a temporary softening , " he said .

after the u.s. senate decided to request nato help in postwar iraq , speculation is spreading in germany about a possible military deployment , despite concerns about the army ’ s overstretched capacities . with the german military or bundeswehr grappling with peacekeeping operations in three continents at present , the political discussion on a possible military involvement in postwar iraq has been dominated by ground realities .
karsten voigt , coordinator for german-u.s. relations in the german government told the berlin daily tagesspiegel on tuesday the bush administration wasn ’ t expecting a quick german contribution in iraq and was aware the german military was stretched to the limit with its foreign deployments .
voigt added foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in the u.s. , would not be " pressurized " by bush on the question .
even parliamentary foreign policy spokesman for germany ’ s opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- said last week , " i think our friends know that we have limited resources . "
indeed , with about 9,000 soldiers scattered in the balkans , afghanistan and as far as the horn of africa , the german army , plagued in recent years by chronic underfunding and in the thick of a radical overhaul , has its hands full .
army overworked , but can still do iraq wilfried stolze , spokesman for the federal armed forces union , told deutsche welle another foreign deployment would massively step up the logistical and financial burden on the bundeswehr .
" after all , the german army right now is undergoing its biggest shake-up in history , " he explained .
restructuring plans include modernizing the army , trimming the number of civilian jobs while at the same time increasing the number of soldiers -lrb- from 282,000 to 300,000 -rrb- , slashing military spending and training troops to gear up for new military challenges , including foreign deployments .
stolze said a u.s. request for military help in iraq would pose a big problem to the overburdened bundeswehr .
" what we lack is manpower – especially specialists such as paramedics and radio operators .
besides , another foreign deployment would involve a huge initial operation within germany .
we simply can ’ t afford that . "
at the same time stolze did not rule out the bundesweher scraping together troops if it came down to it and said realistically about 1,500 to 2,000 soldiers could be sent to iraq .
" however , what ’ s important is that the mandate is a limited and robust one – the soldiers have to be well-armed – and that it takes place under u.n. auspices , " he added .
u.s. turns to nato for help in iraq the present discussion over an iraq deployment follows a request last week by the united states senate to the nato military alliance for support to reinforce the 147,000 american troops serving as occupying forces in iraq .
continuing resistance from iraqi groups , mounting american and british casualties and rising costs of maintaining a huge peacekeeping operation in iraq has forced the u.s. to seek broader international support .
though no concrete request has come in as yet from the u.s. , german government spokesman bela anda said over the weekend it was possible a request would be received at the nato council in brussels after the summer break .
so far the reaction from nato countries , prominently germany and france , has been lukewarm .
both say there is no adequate united nations mandate to legitimize their presence in iraq .
france , like germany , is also heavily involved in foreign military deployments in the balkans , ivory coast , congo and afghanistan .
germany : nothing without a u.n. mandate german chancellor gerhard schröder , whose antiwar and pro-u.n. stance when the u.s. invaded iraq strained relations with washington , said in a television interview last week his government would not send troops to iraq except in a nato context and only with a specific mandate from the u.n. he said the bush administration had already been informed of his position .
the chancellor ’ s coalition government also has the support of the conservative opposition in insisting that the u.n. needs to play the central role in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq .
politicians still divided about possible deployment however , the hard realities of the army ’ s stretched capabilities now has german politicians speculating on what alternative help germany could provide in iraq under a u.n. mandate .
on tuesday , foreign policy speaker of the opposition cdu , friedbert pflüger , said in a newspaper interview that germany would have to contribute towards rebuilding civil society and securing peace in iraq if nato were to receive a request to that effect from the u.n. he suggested reducing the number of german peacekeepers in the balkans in order to facilitate sending troops to iraq .
" we have to watch out in any case that we don ’ t throw away this great chance through mistakes , " he said in a reference to germany ’ s shunning by washington earlier this year after berlin refused to support the u.s.-led war in iraq .
however members of schröder ’ s social democrat and the green government are vehemently against sending german troops to iraq , even under a u.n. mandate .
leader of the social democrat parliamentary group gernot erler said german police and aid workers could be sent to iraq , but not the army .

after the u.s. senate decided to request nato help in postwar iraq , speculation is spreading in germany about a possible military deployment , despite concerns about the army ’ s overstretched capacities . with the german military or bundeswehr grappling with peacekeeping operations in three continents at present , the political discussion on a possible military involvement in postwar iraq has been dominated by ground realities .
karsten voigt , coordinator for german-u.s. relations in the german government told the berlin daily tagesspiegel on tuesday the bush administration wasn ’ t expecting a quick german contribution in iraq and was aware the german military was stretched to the limit with its foreign deployments .
voigt added foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in the u.s. , would not be " pressurized " by bush on the question .
even parliamentary foreign policy spokesman for germany ’ s opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- said last week , " i think our friends know that we have limited resources . "
indeed , with about 9,000 soldiers scattered in the balkans , afghanistan and as far as the horn of africa , the german army , plagued in recent years by chronic underfunding and in the thick of a radical overhaul , has its hands full .
army overworked , but can still do iraq wilfried stolze , spokesman for the federal armed forces union , told deutsche welle another foreign deployment would massively step up the logistical and financial burden on the bundeswehr .
" after all , the german army right now is undergoing its biggest shake-up in history , " he explained .
restructuring plans include modernizing the army , trimming the number of civilian jobs while at the same time increasing the number of soldiers -lrb- from 282,000 to 300,000 -rrb- , slashing military spending and training troops to gear up for new military challenges , including foreign deployments .
stolze said a u.s. request for military help in iraq would pose a big problem to the overburdened bundeswehr .
" what we lack is manpower – especially specialists such as paramedics and radio operators .
besides , another foreign deployment would involve a huge initial operation within germany .
we simply can ’ t afford that . "
at the same time stolze did not rule out the bundesweher scraping together troops if it came down to it and said realistically about 1,500 to 2,000 soldiers could be sent to iraq .
" however , what ’ s important is that the mandate is a limited and robust one – the soldiers have to be well-armed – and that it takes place under u.n. auspices , " he added .
u.s. turns to nato for help in iraq the present discussion over an iraq deployment follows a request last week by the united states senate to the nato military alliance for support to reinforce the 147,000 american troops serving as occupying forces in iraq .
continuing resistance from iraqi groups , mounting american and british casualties and rising costs of maintaining a huge peacekeeping operation in iraq has forced the u.s. to seek broader international support .
though no concrete request has come in as yet from the u.s. , german government spokesman bela anda said over the weekend it was possible a request would be received at the nato council in brussels after the summer break .
so far the reaction from nato countries , prominently germany and france , has been lukewarm .
both say there is no adequate united nations mandate to legitimize their presence in iraq .
france , like germany , is also heavily involved in foreign military deployments in the balkans , ivory coast , congo and afghanistan .
germany : nothing without a u.n. mandate german chancellor gerhard schröder , whose antiwar and pro-u.n. stance when the u.s. invaded iraq strained relations with washington , said in a television interview last week his government would not send troops to iraq except in a nato context and only with a specific mandate from the u.n. he said the bush administration had already been informed of his position .

with little left of the berlin wall , people seem to be scrambling to uncover the remaining traces of the fallen east german state in berlin .
enter berlin entrepreneur peter massine , who has big plans to cash in on the rage for all things east german .
famous for producing the local production of the musical grease , his company " massine productions " is now investing € 1.2 million -lrb- $ 1.35 million -rrb- to set up a gdr-themed amusement park in the former east berlin industrial district of oberschöneweide .

complete with rides in boxy east german trabant cars -lrb- photo -rrb- , guards outfitted in communist and border patrol uniforms and pedestrian traffic signals with the trademark green walking man with flat-brimmed hat and jaunty step , the sprawling park spread over 10,000 square meters is designed to capture a slice of east german communist life .
organizers plan to hire about 20 long-term jobless east germans over 50 years of age to play border guards , traffic policemen and canteen personnel .
the gdr park is expected to open its doors next summer .
from spreewald cucumbers to secret spies the tour will begin with a formal arrival at a checkpoint where visitors must pass countless guards and officials scrutinizing papers and identification cards , as was the case during the cold war , and will include a forced exchange of western deutsche marks for eastern ones .

the organizers are even planning to build a model of the karl marx allee , east berlin ’ s expansive shopping boulevard .
visitors can drop in on a real east german living room outfitted with flowery wallpaper , paintings of socialist factory life and cupboards stocked with special plates marking anniversaries of the founding of the east german state .
even models of the east germans ’ beloved dachas or weekend cottages with their own garden patch will offer visitors a rare glimpse into a leisurely break from the socialist system ’ s rigid work routine .

but he 's also hoping to lure busloads of ubiquitous jet-setting americans and japanese . he hopes the mini-gdr will become a highlight of their marathon bus tours to places like the postcard-pretty neuschwanstein castle and heidelberg , while at the same time offering what he is promoting as an authentic view of socialist germany .
authentic is the operative word here .
massine has stressed that the amusement park is no way conceived as a gdr disneyland .
instead , the aim is to showcase a real slice of everyday life in the former east germany .
to that end , the organizers have been scrupulously researching the culture of the gdr and have read up on the vast documentation available about the fallen state .
kornelia lobmeier of the contemporary history forum in leipzig said putting the amusement park in the right historical context is of paramount importance .
" the amusement park is fundamentally not a bad idea when it contributes towards people dealing with the history of the gdr , " she said .

plans for a gdr-themed amusement park are now in the works for the capital . whether it ’ s drab wallpaper and tacky east german paraphernalia adorning berlin ’ s hip cafes , bleak prefabricated highrises that are all the rage or the success of films such as goodbye lenin , the german capital ’ s hip and trendy crowd are still enamoured by the former communist east germany ’ s retro-socialist appeal .
" ostalgie , " a twist on the german word for nostalgia -lrb- nostalgie -rrb- seems here to stay .
with little left of the berlin wall , people seem to be scrambling to uncover the remaining traces of the fallen east german state in berlin .
enter berlin entrepreneur peter massine , who has big plans to cash in on the rage for all things east german .
famous for producing the local production of the musical grease , his company " massine productions " is now investing € 1.2 million -lrb- $ 1.35 million -rrb- to set up a gdr-themed amusement park in the former east berlin industrial district of oberschöneweide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german trabant cars pass spectators during a procession to mark the ninth anniversary of german reunification symbolizing the fall of the wall ten years ago in berlin october 3 , 1999 .
complete with rides in boxy east german trabant cars -lrb- photo -rrb- , guards outfitted in communist and border patrol uniforms and pedestrian traffic signals with the trademark green walking man with flat-brimmed hat and jaunty step , the sprawling park spread over 10,000 square meters is designed to capture a slice of east german communist life .
organizers plan to hire about 20 long-term jobless east germans over 50 years of age to play border guards , traffic policemen and canteen personnel .
the gdr park is expected to open its doors next summer .
from spreewald cucumbers to secret spies the tour will begin with a formal arrival at a checkpoint where visitors must pass countless guards and officials scrutinizing papers and identification cards , as was the case during the cold war , and will include a forced exchange of western deutsche marks for eastern ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german consumer products .
visitors will then be able to take a trip through east germany ’ s sparse consumer offerings that have today become cult products in the west -lrb- photo -rrb- - offering everything from spreewald forest 's famous small cucumbers to vita-cola to " rondo " coffee to rotkäppchen sparkling wine to drab clothes and colorful shopping bags .
the organizers are even planning to build a model of the karl marx allee , east berlin ’ s expansive shopping boulevard .
visitors can drop in on a real east german living room outfitted with flowery wallpaper , paintings of socialist factory life and cupboards stocked with special plates marking anniversaries of the founding of the east german state .
even models of the east germans ’ beloved dachas or weekend cottages with their own garden patch will offer visitors a rare glimpse into a leisurely break from the socialist system ’ s rigid work routine .
for those craving the thrill and intrigue of the cold war era , omnipresent stasi -lrb- east german secret police -rrb- spies will whet the appetite .
songs praising the virtues of hard work and content will also be piped in throughout the park by outdoor speakers .
not a gdr disneyland massine said the park is primarily targeted at a german audience that would likely spark entirely different reactions from west germans and their eastern counterparts .
but he 's also hoping to lure busloads of ubiquitous jet-setting americans and japanese . he hopes the mini-gdr will become a highlight of their marathon bus tours to places like the postcard-pretty neuschwanstein castle and heidelberg , while at the same time offering what he is promoting as an authentic view of socialist germany .
authentic is the operative word here .
massine has stressed that the amusement park is no way conceived as a gdr disneyland .
instead , the aim is to showcase a real slice of everyday life in the former east germany .
to that end , the organizers have been scrupulously researching the culture of the gdr and have read up on the vast documentation available about the fallen state .

after the u.s. senate decided to request nato help in postwar iraq , speculation is spreading in germany about a possible military deployment , despite concerns about the army ’ s overstretched capacities . with the german military or bundeswehr grappling with peacekeeping operations in three continents at present , the political discussion on a possible military involvement in postwar iraq has been dominated by ground realities .
karsten voigt , coordinator for german-u.s. relations in the german government told the berlin daily tagesspiegel on tuesday the bush administration wasn ’ t expecting a quick german contribution in iraq and was aware the german military was stretched to the limit with its foreign deployments .
voigt added foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in the u.s. , would not be " pressurized " by bush on the question .
even parliamentary foreign policy spokesman for germany ’ s opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- said last week , " i think our friends know that we have limited resources . "
indeed , with about 9,000 soldiers scattered in the balkans , afghanistan and as far as the horn of africa , the german army , plagued in recent years by chronic underfunding and in the thick of a radical overhaul , has its hands full .
army overworked , but can still do iraq wilfried stolze , spokesman for the federal armed forces union , told deutsche welle another foreign deployment would massively step up the logistical and financial burden on the bundeswehr .
" after all , the german army right now is undergoing its biggest shake-up in history , " he explained .
restructuring plans include modernizing the army , trimming the number of civilian jobs while at the same time increasing the number of soldiers -lrb- from 282,000 to 300,000 -rrb- , slashing military spending and training troops to gear up for new military challenges , including foreign deployments .
stolze said a u.s. request for military help in iraq would pose a big problem to the overburdened bundeswehr .
" what we lack is manpower – especially specialists such as paramedics and radio operators .
besides , another foreign deployment would involve a huge initial operation within germany .
we simply can ’ t afford that . "
at the same time stolze did not rule out the bundesweher scraping together troops if it came down to it and said realistically about 1,500 to 2,000 soldiers could be sent to iraq .
" however , what ’ s important is that the mandate is a limited and robust one – the soldiers have to be well-armed – and that it takes place under u.n. auspices , " he added .
u.s. turns to nato for help in iraq the present discussion over an iraq deployment follows a request last week by the united states senate to the nato military alliance for support to reinforce the 147,000 american troops serving as occupying forces in iraq .
continuing resistance from iraqi groups , mounting american and british casualties and rising costs of maintaining a huge peacekeeping operation in iraq has forced the u.s. to seek broader international support .
though no concrete request has come in as yet from the u.s. , german government spokesman bela anda said over the weekend it was possible a request would be received at the nato council in brussels after the summer break .
so far the reaction from nato countries , prominently germany and france , has been lukewarm .
both say there is no adequate united nations mandate to legitimize their presence in iraq .
france , like germany , is also heavily involved in foreign military deployments in the balkans , ivory coast , congo and afghanistan .
germany : nothing without a u.n. mandate german chancellor gerhard schröder , whose antiwar and pro-u.n. stance when the u.s. invaded iraq strained relations with washington , said in a television interview last week his government would not send troops to iraq except in a nato context and only with a specific mandate from the u.n. he said the bush administration had already been informed of his position .
the chancellor ’ s coalition government also has the support of the conservative opposition in insisting that the u.n. needs to play the central role in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq .
politicians still divided about possible deployment however , the hard realities of the army ’ s stretched capabilities now has german politicians speculating on what alternative help germany could provide in iraq under a u.n. mandate .
on tuesday , foreign policy speaker of the opposition cdu , friedbert pflüger , said in a newspaper interview that germany would have to contribute towards rebuilding civil society and securing peace in iraq if nato were to receive a request to that effect from the u.n. he suggested reducing the number of german peacekeepers in the balkans in order to facilitate sending troops to iraq .
" we have to watch out in any case that we don ’ t throw away this great chance through mistakes , " he said in a reference to germany ’ s shunning by washington earlier this year after berlin refused to support the u.s.-led war in iraq .
however members of schröder ’ s social democrat and the green government are vehemently against sending german troops to iraq , even under a u.n. mandate .
leader of the social democrat parliamentary group gernot erler said german police and aid workers could be sent to iraq , but not the army .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.07.2003 for leipzig , the olympic dream begins großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tired of watching world athletic championships on tv , residents of leipzig want to bring the olympics to their backyards .
as the bids close on tuesday for the candidate cities vying to host the 2012 summer olympics , germany 's hope , leipzig , is outlining its plans to make itself as attractive as possible . more than 40,000 people celebrated in the streets of leipzig in april when the city was chosen as germany 's hope to host the next olympic games . the east german city beat off competition from hamburg , düsseldorf , frankfurt and stuttgart to host the summer games in 2012 .
rostock , which was chosen to host the olympic sailing competition in the german bid , vied against the port cities of kiel , lübeck , stralsund and cuxhaven . but as candidate cities all over the world enter the second and final selection round to host the oldest competitive games today , the real work starts for leipzig , which is hoping to boost jobs and make its region - which like much of the formerly communist eastern germany is suffering from economic doldrums - into a town the international olympic committee ca n't turn down when it makes its final decision in early 2005 . germany has not hosted the olympics since the 1972 summer games in munich , which where marred after palestinian terrorists held the israeli team hostage .
two were shot dead by gunmen and nine others died during an ill-fated rescue attempt which turned the event into one of the darkest events in olympic history . sprucing up the city leipzig is eager to create some positive olympic history for germany . some € 30 million -lrb- $ 33.98 million -rrb- is set to be invested in the city in preparation for the next stage of its olympic bid . most of the money will come from the state of saxony , of which leipzig is second-largest city after dresden .
leipzig and its partner cities are also expected to contribute .
leipzig has already doubled its order for new trams for the city -lrb- the cost of which has already run into millions of euros -rrb- .
it will also have to prove to the international olympic committee it can provide a minimum of 42,000 hotel rooms and cope with an influx of 150,000 participants and as many as 500,000 spectators during each day of the competition . demands from city leaders are increasing for additional redevelopment projects in the city , where infrastructure languished and deteriorated under decades of communist rule until the fall of the berlin wall in 1990 and german reunification . indeed , the push from outlying leipzig areas to get their hands on funds earmarked for the olympic effort has become a strain .
so much so , in fact , that leipzig mayor wolfgang tiefensee has been forced to decide to keep the olympic efforts within a 10-kilometer radius of the city center . a massive and expensive endeavor all of this does not come cheap , of course .
if leipzig does win its bid , the city will have to raise an estimated € 2.6 billion to construct the sports halls , olympic playing fields and residential village that the enormous event requires .
how this funding will be split between local , state and federal governments remains an open question . but if € 2.6 billion has leipzig 's purse-string holders quaking in their boots , they can take comfort in the fact that the games have served as an economic booster for a number of host cities , which have in many cases made a profit on their initial investment . the games helped places like munich , which hosted the summer olympics in 1972 and barcelona , which played host in 1992 , transform themselves into world cities .
others enjoyed windfalls from sales of tv rights , advertising and ticket sales .
sydney , which hosted the last summer olympics , made a cool € 1.5 billion . but for leipzig , winning the games would mean a whole lot more .
in addition to the symbolic importance of awarding the games to a city that has pushed for the past 12 years to become a business center , it would also create much needed jobs in a languishing labor market . with an average unemployment rate of 18.3 percent , the number of jobless in eastern germany is more than double that in western germany .
between 1992 and 1998 , the federal government poured € 600 billion into the local economy , but it has still failed to bloom . olympics as economic booster shot local business leaders have said the olympics could create as many as 38,000 jobs by 2012 , though many would disappear again after the olympics . the dream might come true for leipzig .
although one of the smaller cities competing to host the games , leipzig has heard encouraging words from the olympic organizers . " germany , leipzig and rostock have good chances .
we know they are exacting in organization and have a team with good experience , " international olympic committee president jacques rogge said in april .
" other small cities have had the olympic games , too , like lillehammer -lrb- in norway -rrb- .
helsinki was n't big either .
we want to reduce gigantism . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de and the winner is ...

as the bids close on tuesday for the candidate cities vying to host the 2012 summer olympics , germany 's hope , leipzig , is outlining its plans to make itself as attractive as possible . more than 40,000 people celebrated in the streets of leipzig in april when the city was chosen as germany 's hope to host the next olympic games . the east german city beat off competition from hamburg , düsseldorf , frankfurt and stuttgart to host the summer games in 2012 .
rostock , which was chosen to host the olympic sailing competition in the german bid , vied against the port cities of kiel , lübeck , stralsund and cuxhaven . but as candidate cities all over the world enter the second and final selection round to host the oldest competitive games today , the real work starts for leipzig , which is hoping to boost jobs and make its region - which like much of the formerly communist eastern germany is suffering from economic doldrums - into a town the international olympic committee ca n't turn down when it makes its final decision in early 2005 . germany has not hosted the olympics since the 1972 summer games in munich , which where marred after palestinian terrorists held the israeli team hostage .
two were shot dead by gunmen and nine others died during an ill-fated rescue attempt which turned the event into one of the darkest events in olympic history . sprucing up the city leipzig is eager to create some positive olympic history for germany . some € 30 million -lrb- $ 33.98 million -rrb- is set to be invested in the city in preparation for the next stage of its olympic bid . most of the money will come from the state of saxony , of which leipzig is second-largest city after dresden .
leipzig and its partner cities are also expected to contribute .
leipzig has already doubled its order for new trams for the city -lrb- the cost of which has already run into millions of euros -rrb- .
it will also have to prove to the international olympic committee it can provide a minimum of 42,000 hotel rooms and cope with an influx of 150,000 participants and as many as 500,000 spectators during each day of the competition . demands from city leaders are increasing for additional redevelopment projects in the city , where infrastructure languished and deteriorated under decades of communist rule until the fall of the berlin wall in 1990 and german reunification . indeed , the push from outlying leipzig areas to get their hands on funds earmarked for the olympic effort has become a strain .
so much so , in fact , that leipzig mayor wolfgang tiefensee has been forced to decide to keep the olympic efforts within a 10-kilometer radius of the city center . a massive and expensive endeavor all of this does not come cheap , of course .
if leipzig does win its bid , the city will have to raise an estimated € 2.6 billion to construct the sports halls , olympic playing fields and residential village that the enormous event requires .
how this funding will be split between local , state and federal governments remains an open question . but if € 2.6 billion has leipzig 's purse-string holders quaking in their boots , they can take comfort in the fact that the games have served as an economic booster for a number of host cities , which have in many cases made a profit on their initial investment . the games helped places like munich , which hosted the summer olympics in 1972 and barcelona , which played host in 1992 , transform themselves into world cities .
others enjoyed windfalls from sales of tv rights , advertising and ticket sales .
sydney , which hosted the last summer olympics , made a cool € 1.5 billion . but for leipzig , winning the games would mean a whole lot more .
in addition to the symbolic importance of awarding the games to a city that has pushed for the past 12 years to become a business center , it would also create much needed jobs in a languishing labor market . with an average unemployment rate of 18.3 percent , the number of jobless in eastern germany is more than double that in western germany .
between 1992 and 1998 , the federal government poured € 600 billion into the local economy , but it has still failed to bloom . olympics as economic booster shot local business leaders have said the olympics could create as many as 38,000 jobs by 2012 , though many would disappear again after the olympics . the dream might come true for leipzig .
although one of the smaller cities competing to host the games , leipzig has heard encouraging words from the olympic organizers . " germany , leipzig and rostock have good chances .
we know they are exacting in organization and have a team with good experience , " international olympic committee president jacques rogge said in april .
" other small cities have had the olympic games , too , like lillehammer -lrb- in norway -rrb- .
helsinki was n't big either .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.07.2003 overburdened german army not likely to head to iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under pressure - american and british troops in iraq are hoping for reinforcements from nato .
after the u.s. senate decided to request nato help in postwar iraq , speculation is spreading in germany about a possible military deployment , despite concerns about the army ’ s overstretched capacities . with the german military or bundeswehr grappling with peacekeeping operations in three continents at present , the political discussion on a possible military involvement in postwar iraq has been dominated by ground realities .
karsten voigt , coordinator for german-u.s. relations in the german government told the berlin daily tagesspiegel on tuesday the bush administration wasn ’ t expecting a quick german contribution in iraq and was aware the german military was stretched to the limit with its foreign deployments .
voigt added foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in the u.s. , would not be " pressurized " by bush on the question .
even parliamentary foreign policy spokesman for germany ’ s opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- said last week , " i think our friends know that we have limited resources . "
indeed , with about 9,000 soldiers scattered in the balkans , afghanistan and as far as the horn of africa , the german army , plagued in recent years by chronic underfunding and in the thick of a radical overhaul , has its hands full .
army overworked , but can still do iraq wilfried stolze , spokesman for the federal armed forces union , told deutsche welle another foreign deployment would massively step up the logistical and financial burden on the bundeswehr .
" after all , the german army right now is undergoing its biggest shake-up in history , " he explained .
restructuring plans include modernizing the army , trimming the number of civilian jobs while at the same time increasing the number of soldiers -lrb- from 282,000 to 300,000 -rrb- , slashing military spending and training troops to gear up for new military challenges , including foreign deployments .
stolze said a u.s. request for military help in iraq would pose a big problem to the overburdened bundeswehr .
" what we lack is manpower – especially specialists such as paramedics and radio operators .
besides , another foreign deployment would involve a huge initial operation within germany .
we simply can ’ t afford that . "
at the same time stolze did not rule out the bundesweher scraping together troops if it came down to it and said realistically about 1,500 to 2,000 soldiers could be sent to iraq .
" however , what ’ s important is that the mandate is a limited and robust one – the soldiers have to be well-armed – and that it takes place under u.n. auspices , " he added .
u.s. turns to nato for help in iraq the present discussion over an iraq deployment follows a request last week by the united states senate to the nato military alliance for support to reinforce the 147,000 american troops serving as occupying forces in iraq .
continuing resistance from iraqi groups , mounting american and british casualties and rising costs of maintaining a huge peacekeeping operation in iraq has forced the u.s. to seek broader international support .
though no concrete request has come in as yet from the u.s. , german government spokesman bela anda said over the weekend it was possible a request would be received at the nato council in brussels after the summer break .
so far the reaction from nato countries , prominently germany and france , has been lukewarm .
both say there is no adequate united nations mandate to legitimize their presence in iraq .
france , like germany , is also heavily involved in foreign military deployments in the balkans , ivory coast , congo and afghanistan .
germany : nothing without a u.n. mandate german chancellor gerhard schröder , whose antiwar and pro-u.n. stance when the u.s. invaded iraq strained relations with washington , said in a television interview last week his government would not send troops to iraq except in a nato context and only with a specific mandate from the u.n. he said the bush administration had already been informed of his position .
the chancellor ’ s coalition government also has the support of the conservative opposition in insisting that the u.n. needs to play the central role in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq .
politicians still divided about possible deployment however , the hard realities of the army ’ s stretched capabilities now has german politicians speculating on what alternative help germany could provide in iraq under a u.n. mandate .
on tuesday , foreign policy speaker of the opposition cdu , friedbert pflüger , said in a newspaper interview that germany would have to contribute towards rebuilding civil society and securing peace in iraq if nato were to receive a request to that effect from the u.n. he suggested reducing the number of german peacekeepers in the balkans in order to facilitate sending troops to iraq .
" we have to watch out in any case that we don ’ t throw away this great chance through mistakes , " he said in a reference to germany ’ s shunning by washington earlier this year after berlin refused to support the u.s.-led war in iraq .
however members of schröder ’ s social democrat and the green government are vehemently against sending german troops to iraq , even under a u.n. mandate .
leader of the social democrat parliamentary group gernot erler said german police and aid workers could be sent to iraq , but not the army .
" nobody can really expect a country , that so clearly rejected the iraq war , to send in soldiers there , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany : no nato in iraq without un if the united states hopes to get nato soldiers side-by-side with their own in iraq , they will have to involve the united nations .
that message came loud and clear out of berlin on friday -lrb- july 12 , 2003 -rrb- .
european press review : the u.n. could at last get its chance in iraq european papers on friday focused on the increasingly risk-fraught attempt by the americans to restore order in postwar iraq and the erosion of president bush 's credibility -lrb- july 11 , 2003 -rrb- .

chirac , speaking in his traditional live televised interview , said he wanted euro zone finance ministers to " examine together provisional ways of easing " the stability and growth pact underpinning their economies .
he added that he wanted to see changes " coherent with the imperative of stability , and ensuring growth is not diminished " .
the french president added that while he respected the pact 's rules , a more political interpretation was needed to allow members of the 12 country euro zone greater freedom to maneuver .
" this is not about modifying the stability pact .
it 's a case of getting the representatives of euro zone nations to examine together the terms of a temporary softening , " he said .

"
austria 's economy minister karl-heinz grasser said , " we should n't even be discussing this - it 's one of the pillars of our economic policy and the single currency . " the pact , which aims to keep public debt levels in check and maintain confidence in the common currency , dictates that a budget deficit can not exceed more than 3 percent of national economic output .
france , the euro zone 's second biggest economy behind germany , had a public deficit of 3.1 percent in 2002 and the european commission 's provisional forecasts see it rising to 3.7 percent this year and 3.6 percent in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel .
germany ’ s finance minister hans eichel , who is himself grappling with a spiraling budget deficit , stopped short of echoing president chirac 's call for a relaxing of the rules , saying that the pact is , in fact , adapted to the current economic situation .
“ we consider that the pact in its current shape is appropriate to create monetary stability , ” said eichel .
“ but it is also suitable to achieve economic growth which is more important now .
and that is why we don ’ t need a debate about relaxing the pact . ” keeping the budget in line france , germany and portugal have all come under fire from the european commission for allowing their public deficits to exceed the 3 percent limit as they struggle to revive their stagnant economies .
however , france 's more cavalier approach to the stability and growth pact has been one issue on which it has exchanged open disagreement with germany , its key ally . the german government has often pledged to try to keep its deficit in line with the rules – a seemingly empty promise in the light of germany ’ s persistent failure to do so despite recent hefty tax cuts initiated to spur growth .
france , however , has often brazenly declared that it will not be able to adhere to the pact in its current form and would therefore not even try .

after the u.s. senate decided to request nato help in postwar iraq , speculation is spreading in germany about a possible military deployment , despite concerns about the army ’ s overstretched capacities . with the german military or bundeswehr grappling with peacekeeping operations in three continents at present , the political discussion on a possible military involvement in postwar iraq has been dominated by ground realities .
karsten voigt , coordinator for german-u.s. relations in the german government told the berlin daily tagesspiegel on tuesday the bush administration wasn ’ t expecting a quick german contribution in iraq and was aware the german military was stretched to the limit with its foreign deployments .
voigt added foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in the u.s. , would not be " pressurized " by bush on the question .
even parliamentary foreign policy spokesman for germany ’ s opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- said last week , " i think our friends know that we have limited resources . "
indeed , with about 9,000 soldiers scattered in the balkans , afghanistan and as far as the horn of africa , the german army , plagued in recent years by chronic underfunding and in the thick of a radical overhaul , has its hands full .
army overworked , but can still do iraq wilfried stolze , spokesman for the federal armed forces union , told deutsche welle another foreign deployment would massively step up the logistical and financial burden on the bundeswehr .
" after all , the german army right now is undergoing its biggest shake-up in history , " he explained .
restructuring plans include modernizing the army , trimming the number of civilian jobs while at the same time increasing the number of soldiers -lrb- from 282,000 to 300,000 -rrb- , slashing military spending and training troops to gear up for new military challenges , including foreign deployments .
stolze said a u.s. request for military help in iraq would pose a big problem to the overburdened bundeswehr .
" what we lack is manpower – especially specialists such as paramedics and radio operators .
besides , another foreign deployment would involve a huge initial operation within germany .
we simply can ’ t afford that . "
at the same time stolze did not rule out the bundesweher scraping together troops if it came down to it and said realistically about 1,500 to 2,000 soldiers could be sent to iraq .
" however , what ’ s important is that the mandate is a limited and robust one – the soldiers have to be well-armed – and that it takes place under u.n. auspices , " he added .
u.s. turns to nato for help in iraq the present discussion over an iraq deployment follows a request last week by the united states senate to the nato military alliance for support to reinforce the 147,000 american troops serving as occupying forces in iraq .
continuing resistance from iraqi groups , mounting american and british casualties and rising costs of maintaining a huge peacekeeping operation in iraq has forced the u.s. to seek broader international support .
though no concrete request has come in as yet from the u.s. , german government spokesman bela anda said over the weekend it was possible a request would be received at the nato council in brussels after the summer break .
so far the reaction from nato countries , prominently germany and france , has been lukewarm .
both say there is no adequate united nations mandate to legitimize their presence in iraq .
france , like germany , is also heavily involved in foreign military deployments in the balkans , ivory coast , congo and afghanistan .
germany : nothing without a u.n. mandate german chancellor gerhard schröder , whose antiwar and pro-u.n. stance when the u.s. invaded iraq strained relations with washington , said in a television interview last week his government would not send troops to iraq except in a nato context and only with a specific mandate from the u.n. he said the bush administration had already been informed of his position .
the chancellor ’ s coalition government also has the support of the conservative opposition in insisting that the u.n. needs to play the central role in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq .
politicians still divided about possible deployment however , the hard realities of the army ’ s stretched capabilities now has german politicians speculating on what alternative help germany could provide in iraq under a u.n. mandate .
on tuesday , foreign policy speaker of the opposition cdu , friedbert pflüger , said in a newspaper interview that germany would have to contribute towards rebuilding civil society and securing peace in iraq if nato were to receive a request to that effect from the u.n. he suggested reducing the number of german peacekeepers in the balkans in order to facilitate sending troops to iraq .
" we have to watch out in any case that we don ’ t throw away this great chance through mistakes , " he said in a reference to germany ’ s shunning by washington earlier this year after berlin refused to support the u.s.-led war in iraq .
however members of schröder ’ s social democrat and the green government are vehemently against sending german troops to iraq , even under a u.n. mandate .
leader of the social democrat parliamentary group gernot erler said german police and aid workers could be sent to iraq , but not the army .
" nobody can really expect a country , that so clearly rejected the iraq war , to send in soldiers there , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany : no nato in iraq without un if the united states hopes to get nato soldiers side-by-side with their own in iraq , they will have to involve the united nations .
that message came loud and clear out of berlin on friday -lrb- july 12 , 2003 -rrb- .
european press review : the u.n. could at last get its chance in iraq european papers on friday focused on the increasingly risk-fraught attempt by the americans to restore order in postwar iraq and the erosion of president bush 's credibility -lrb- july 11 , 2003 -rrb- .

thirteen years after the collapse of communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- , kitschy nostalgia for a lost culture still lives on in berlin .
plans for a gdr-themed amusement park are now in the works for the capital . whether it ’ s drab wallpaper and tacky east german paraphernalia adorning berlin ’ s hip cafes , bleak prefabricated highrises that are all the rage or the success of films such as goodbye lenin , the german capital ’ s hip and trendy crowd are still enamoured by the former communist east germany ’ s retro-socialist appeal .
" ostalgie , " a twist on the german word for nostalgia -lrb- nostalgie -rrb- seems here to stay .
with little left of the berlin wall , people seem to be scrambling to uncover the remaining traces of the fallen east german state in berlin .
enter berlin entrepreneur peter massine , who has big plans to cash in on the rage for all things east german .
famous for producing the local production of the musical grease , his company " massine productions " is now investing € 1.2 million -lrb- $ 1.35 million -rrb- to set up a gdr-themed amusement park in the former east berlin industrial district of oberschöneweide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german trabant cars pass spectators during a procession to mark the ninth anniversary of german reunification symbolizing the fall of the wall ten years ago in berlin october 3 , 1999 .
complete with rides in boxy east german trabant cars -lrb- photo -rrb- , guards outfitted in communist and border patrol uniforms and pedestrian traffic signals with the trademark green walking man with flat-brimmed hat and jaunty step , the sprawling park spread over 10,000 square meters is designed to capture a slice of east german communist life .
organizers plan to hire about 20 long-term jobless east germans over 50 years of age to play border guards , traffic policemen and canteen personnel .
the gdr park is expected to open its doors next summer .
from spreewald cucumbers to secret spies the tour will begin with a formal arrival at a checkpoint where visitors must pass countless guards and officials scrutinizing papers and identification cards , as was the case during the cold war , and will include a forced exchange of western deutsche marks for eastern ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german consumer products .
visitors will then be able to take a trip through east germany ’ s sparse consumer offerings that have today become cult products in the west -lrb- photo -rrb- - offering everything from spreewald forest 's famous small cucumbers to vita-cola to " rondo " coffee to rotkäppchen sparkling wine to drab clothes and colorful shopping bags .
the organizers are even planning to build a model of the karl marx allee , east berlin ’ s expansive shopping boulevard .
visitors can drop in on a real east german living room outfitted with flowery wallpaper , paintings of socialist factory life and cupboards stocked with special plates marking anniversaries of the founding of the east german state .
even models of the east germans ’ beloved dachas or weekend cottages with their own garden patch will offer visitors a rare glimpse into a leisurely break from the socialist system ’ s rigid work routine .
for those craving the thrill and intrigue of the cold war era , omnipresent stasi -lrb- east german secret police -rrb- spies will whet the appetite .
songs praising the virtues of hard work and content will also be piped in throughout the park by outdoor speakers .
not a gdr disneyland massine said the park is primarily targeted at a german audience that would likely spark entirely different reactions from west germans and their eastern counterparts .
but he 's also hoping to lure busloads of ubiquitous jet-setting americans and japanese . he hopes the mini-gdr will become a highlight of their marathon bus tours to places like the postcard-pretty neuschwanstein castle and heidelberg , while at the same time offering what he is promoting as an authentic view of socialist germany .
authentic is the operative word here .
massine has stressed that the amusement park is no way conceived as a gdr disneyland .
instead , the aim is to showcase a real slice of everyday life in the former east germany .
to that end , the organizers have been scrupulously researching the culture of the gdr and have read up on the vast documentation available about the fallen state .
kornelia lobmeier of the contemporary history forum in leipzig said putting the amusement park in the right historical context is of paramount importance .
" the amusement park is fundamentally not a bad idea when it contributes towards people dealing with the history of the gdr , " she said .
lobmeier , however , warned that if the park only superficially satisfied curiosity and fueled a nostalgic element , then it ran the danger of playing down the darker side of the gdr - a world where neighbors spied on each other and people were denied basic rights because of their political or religious beliefs .
" the background has to be elaborated , it ’ s not enough to just show everyday life and then everybody says , ‘ yeah , i know that , " she said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ' goodbye , lenin , ' hello humor !
germany has been taken by storm by ' goodbye , lenin , ' a film in which east germany is humorously recreated from the ashes .

as the bids close on tuesday for the candidate cities vying to host the 2012 summer olympics , germany 's hope , leipzig , is outlining its plans to make itself as attractive as possible . more than 40,000 people celebrated in the streets of leipzig in april when the city was chosen as germany 's hope to host the next olympic games . the east german city beat off competition from hamburg , düsseldorf , frankfurt and stuttgart to host the summer games in 2012 .
rostock , which was chosen to host the olympic sailing competition in the german bid , vied against the port cities of kiel , lübeck , stralsund and cuxhaven . but as candidate cities all over the world enter the second and final selection round to host the oldest competitive games today , the real work starts for leipzig , which is hoping to boost jobs and make its region - which like much of the formerly communist eastern germany is suffering from economic doldrums - into a town the international olympic committee ca n't turn down when it makes its final decision in early 2005 . germany has not hosted the olympics since the 1972 summer games in munich , which where marred after palestinian terrorists held the israeli team hostage .
two were shot dead by gunmen and nine others died during an ill-fated rescue attempt which turned the event into one of the darkest events in olympic history . sprucing up the city leipzig is eager to create some positive olympic history for germany . some € 30 million -lrb- $ 33.98 million -rrb- is set to be invested in the city in preparation for the next stage of its olympic bid . most of the money will come from the state of saxony , of which leipzig is second-largest city after dresden .
leipzig and its partner cities are also expected to contribute .
leipzig has already doubled its order for new trams for the city -lrb- the cost of which has already run into millions of euros -rrb- .
it will also have to prove to the international olympic committee it can provide a minimum of 42,000 hotel rooms and cope with an influx of 150,000 participants and as many as 500,000 spectators during each day of the competition . demands from city leaders are increasing for additional redevelopment projects in the city , where infrastructure languished and deteriorated under decades of communist rule until the fall of the berlin wall in 1990 and german reunification . indeed , the push from outlying leipzig areas to get their hands on funds earmarked for the olympic effort has become a strain .
so much so , in fact , that leipzig mayor wolfgang tiefensee has been forced to decide to keep the olympic efforts within a 10-kilometer radius of the city center . a massive and expensive endeavor all of this does not come cheap , of course .
if leipzig does win its bid , the city will have to raise an estimated € 2.6 billion to construct the sports halls , olympic playing fields and residential village that the enormous event requires .
how this funding will be split between local , state and federal governments remains an open question . but if € 2.6 billion has leipzig 's purse-string holders quaking in their boots , they can take comfort in the fact that the games have served as an economic booster for a number of host cities , which have in many cases made a profit on their initial investment . the games helped places like munich , which hosted the summer olympics in 1972 and barcelona , which played host in 1992 , transform themselves into world cities .

sydney , which hosted the last summer olympics , made a cool € 1.5 billion . but for leipzig , winning the games would mean a whole lot more .
in addition to the symbolic importance of awarding the games to a city that has pushed for the past 12 years to become a business center , it would also create much needed jobs in a languishing labor market . with an average unemployment rate of 18.3 percent , the number of jobless in eastern germany is more than double that in western germany .
between 1992 and 1998 , the federal government poured € 600 billion into the local economy , but it has still failed to bloom . olympics as economic booster shot local business leaders have said the olympics could create as many as 38,000 jobs by 2012 , though many would disappear again after the olympics . the dream might come true for leipzig .

after the u.s. senate decided to request nato help in postwar iraq , speculation is spreading in germany about a possible military deployment , despite concerns about the army ’ s overstretched capacities . with the german military or bundeswehr grappling with peacekeeping operations in three continents at present , the political discussion on a possible military involvement in postwar iraq has been dominated by ground realities .
karsten voigt , coordinator for german-u.s. relations in the german government told the berlin daily tagesspiegel on tuesday the bush administration wasn ’ t expecting a quick german contribution in iraq and was aware the german military was stretched to the limit with its foreign deployments .
voigt added foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in the u.s. , would not be " pressurized " by bush on the question .
even parliamentary foreign policy spokesman for germany ’ s opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- said last week , " i think our friends know that we have limited resources . "
indeed , with about 9,000 soldiers scattered in the balkans , afghanistan and as far as the horn of africa , the german army , plagued in recent years by chronic underfunding and in the thick of a radical overhaul , has its hands full .
army overworked , but can still do iraq wilfried stolze , spokesman for the federal armed forces union , told deutsche welle another foreign deployment would massively step up the logistical and financial burden on the bundeswehr .
" after all , the german army right now is undergoing its biggest shake-up in history , " he explained .
restructuring plans include modernizing the army , trimming the number of civilian jobs while at the same time increasing the number of soldiers -lrb- from 282,000 to 300,000 -rrb- , slashing military spending and training troops to gear up for new military challenges , including foreign deployments .
stolze said a u.s. request for military help in iraq would pose a big problem to the overburdened bundeswehr .
" what we lack is manpower – especially specialists such as paramedics and radio operators .
besides , another foreign deployment would involve a huge initial operation within germany .
we simply can ’ t afford that . "
at the same time stolze did not rule out the bundesweher scraping together troops if it came down to it and said realistically about 1,500 to 2,000 soldiers could be sent to iraq .
" however , what ’ s important is that the mandate is a limited and robust one – the soldiers have to be well-armed – and that it takes place under u.n. auspices , " he added .
u.s. turns to nato for help in iraq the present discussion over an iraq deployment follows a request last week by the united states senate to the nato military alliance for support to reinforce the 147,000 american troops serving as occupying forces in iraq .
continuing resistance from iraqi groups , mounting american and british casualties and rising costs of maintaining a huge peacekeeping operation in iraq has forced the u.s. to seek broader international support .
though no concrete request has come in as yet from the u.s. , german government spokesman bela anda said over the weekend it was possible a request would be received at the nato council in brussels after the summer break .
so far the reaction from nato countries , prominently germany and france , has been lukewarm .
both say there is no adequate united nations mandate to legitimize their presence in iraq .
france , like germany , is also heavily involved in foreign military deployments in the balkans , ivory coast , congo and afghanistan .
germany : nothing without a u.n. mandate german chancellor gerhard schröder , whose antiwar and pro-u.n. stance when the u.s. invaded iraq strained relations with washington , said in a television interview last week his government would not send troops to iraq except in a nato context and only with a specific mandate from the u.n. he said the bush administration had already been informed of his position .
the chancellor ’ s coalition government also has the support of the conservative opposition in insisting that the u.n. needs to play the central role in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq .
politicians still divided about possible deployment however , the hard realities of the army ’ s stretched capabilities now has german politicians speculating on what alternative help germany could provide in iraq under a u.n. mandate .
on tuesday , foreign policy speaker of the opposition cdu , friedbert pflüger , said in a newspaper interview that germany would have to contribute towards rebuilding civil society and securing peace in iraq if nato were to receive a request to that effect from the u.n. he suggested reducing the number of german peacekeepers in the balkans in order to facilitate sending troops to iraq .
" we have to watch out in any case that we don ’ t throw away this great chance through mistakes , " he said in a reference to germany ’ s shunning by washington earlier this year after berlin refused to support the u.s.-led war in iraq .
however members of schröder ’ s social democrat and the green government are vehemently against sending german troops to iraq , even under a u.n. mandate .
leader of the social democrat parliamentary group gernot erler said german police and aid workers could be sent to iraq , but not the army .

famous for producing the local production of the musical grease , his company " massine productions " is now investing € 1.2 million -lrb- $ 1.35 million -rrb- to set up a gdr-themed amusement park in the former east berlin industrial district of oberschöneweide .

complete with rides in boxy east german trabant cars -lrb- photo -rrb- , guards outfitted in communist and border patrol uniforms and pedestrian traffic signals with the trademark green walking man with flat-brimmed hat and jaunty step , the sprawling park spread over 10,000 square meters is designed to capture a slice of east german communist life .

as the bids close on tuesday for the candidate cities vying to host the 2012 summer olympics , germany 's hope , leipzig , is outlining its plans to make itself as attractive as possible . more than 40,000 people celebrated in the streets of leipzig in april when the city was chosen as germany 's hope to host the next olympic games . the east german city beat off competition from hamburg , düsseldorf , frankfurt and stuttgart to host the summer games in 2012 .
rostock , which was chosen to host the olympic sailing competition in the german bid , vied against the port cities of kiel , lübeck , stralsund and cuxhaven . but as candidate cities all over the world enter the second and final selection round to host the oldest competitive games today , the real work starts for leipzig , which is hoping to boost jobs and make its region - which like much of the formerly communist eastern germany is suffering from economic doldrums - into a town the international olympic committee ca n't turn down when it makes its final decision in early 2005 . germany has not hosted the olympics since the 1972 summer games in munich , which where marred after palestinian terrorists held the israeli team hostage .
two were shot dead by gunmen and nine others died during an ill-fated rescue attempt which turned the event into one of the darkest events in olympic history . sprucing up the city leipzig is eager to create some positive olympic history for germany . some € 30 million -lrb- $ 33.98 million -rrb- is set to be invested in the city in preparation for the next stage of its olympic bid . most of the money will come from the state of saxony , of which leipzig is second-largest city after dresden .
leipzig and its partner cities are also expected to contribute .
leipzig has already doubled its order for new trams for the city -lrb- the cost of which has already run into millions of euros -rrb- .
it will also have to prove to the international olympic committee it can provide a minimum of 42,000 hotel rooms and cope with an influx of 150,000 participants and as many as 500,000 spectators during each day of the competition . demands from city leaders are increasing for additional redevelopment projects in the city , where infrastructure languished and deteriorated under decades of communist rule until the fall of the berlin wall in 1990 and german reunification . indeed , the push from outlying leipzig areas to get their hands on funds earmarked for the olympic effort has become a strain .
so much so , in fact , that leipzig mayor wolfgang tiefensee has been forced to decide to keep the olympic efforts within a 10-kilometer radius of the city center . a massive and expensive endeavor all of this does not come cheap , of course .
if leipzig does win its bid , the city will have to raise an estimated € 2.6 billion to construct the sports halls , olympic playing fields and residential village that the enormous event requires .
how this funding will be split between local , state and federal governments remains an open question . but if € 2.6 billion has leipzig 's purse-string holders quaking in their boots , they can take comfort in the fact that the games have served as an economic booster for a number of host cities , which have in many cases made a profit on their initial investment . the games helped places like munich , which hosted the summer olympics in 1972 and barcelona , which played host in 1992 , transform themselves into world cities .
others enjoyed windfalls from sales of tv rights , advertising and ticket sales .
sydney , which hosted the last summer olympics , made a cool € 1.5 billion . but for leipzig , winning the games would mean a whole lot more .
in addition to the symbolic importance of awarding the games to a city that has pushed for the past 12 years to become a business center , it would also create much needed jobs in a languishing labor market . with an average unemployment rate of 18.3 percent , the number of jobless in eastern germany is more than double that in western germany .
between 1992 and 1998 , the federal government poured € 600 billion into the local economy , but it has still failed to bloom . olympics as economic booster shot local business leaders have said the olympics could create as many as 38,000 jobs by 2012 , though many would disappear again after the olympics . the dream might come true for leipzig .
although one of the smaller cities competing to host the games , leipzig has heard encouraging words from the olympic organizers . " germany , leipzig and rostock have good chances .
we know they are exacting in organization and have a team with good experience , " international olympic committee president jacques rogge said in april .

organizers plan to hire about 20 long-term jobless east germans over 50 years of age to play border guards , traffic policemen and canteen personnel .
the gdr park is expected to open its doors next summer .

after the u.s. senate decided to request nato help in postwar iraq , speculation is spreading in germany about a possible military deployment , despite concerns about the army ’ s overstretched capacities . with the german military or bundeswehr grappling with peacekeeping operations in three continents at present , the political discussion on a possible military involvement in postwar iraq has been dominated by ground realities .
karsten voigt , coordinator for german-u.s. relations in the german government told the berlin daily tagesspiegel on tuesday the bush administration wasn ’ t expecting a quick german contribution in iraq and was aware the german military was stretched to the limit with its foreign deployments .
voigt added foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in the u.s. , would not be " pressurized " by bush on the question .
even parliamentary foreign policy spokesman for germany ’ s opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- said last week , " i think our friends know that we have limited resources . "
indeed , with about 9,000 soldiers scattered in the balkans , afghanistan and as far as the horn of africa , the german army , plagued in recent years by chronic underfunding and in the thick of a radical overhaul , has its hands full .
army overworked , but can still do iraq wilfried stolze , spokesman for the federal armed forces union , told deutsche welle another foreign deployment would massively step up the logistical and financial burden on the bundeswehr .
" after all , the german army right now is undergoing its biggest shake-up in history , " he explained .
restructuring plans include modernizing the army , trimming the number of civilian jobs while at the same time increasing the number of soldiers -lrb- from 282,000 to 300,000 -rrb- , slashing military spending and training troops to gear up for new military challenges , including foreign deployments .
stolze said a u.s. request for military help in iraq would pose a big problem to the overburdened bundeswehr .
" what we lack is manpower – especially specialists such as paramedics and radio operators .
besides , another foreign deployment would involve a huge initial operation within germany .
we simply can ’ t afford that . "
at the same time stolze did not rule out the bundesweher scraping together troops if it came down to it and said realistically about 1,500 to 2,000 soldiers could be sent to iraq .
" however , what ’ s important is that the mandate is a limited and robust one – the soldiers have to be well-armed – and that it takes place under u.n. auspices , " he added .
u.s. turns to nato for help in iraq the present discussion over an iraq deployment follows a request last week by the united states senate to the nato military alliance for support to reinforce the 147,000 american troops serving as occupying forces in iraq .
continuing resistance from iraqi groups , mounting american and british casualties and rising costs of maintaining a huge peacekeeping operation in iraq has forced the u.s. to seek broader international support .
though no concrete request has come in as yet from the u.s. , german government spokesman bela anda said over the weekend it was possible a request would be received at the nato council in brussels after the summer break .
so far the reaction from nato countries , prominently germany and france , has been lukewarm .
both say there is no adequate united nations mandate to legitimize their presence in iraq .
france , like germany , is also heavily involved in foreign military deployments in the balkans , ivory coast , congo and afghanistan .
germany : nothing without a u.n. mandate german chancellor gerhard schröder , whose antiwar and pro-u.n. stance when the u.s. invaded iraq strained relations with washington , said in a television interview last week his government would not send troops to iraq except in a nato context and only with a specific mandate from the u.n. he said the bush administration had already been informed of his position .
the chancellor ’ s coalition government also has the support of the conservative opposition in insisting that the u.n. needs to play the central role in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq .
politicians still divided about possible deployment however , the hard realities of the army ’ s stretched capabilities now has german politicians speculating on what alternative help germany could provide in iraq under a u.n. mandate .
on tuesday , foreign policy speaker of the opposition cdu , friedbert pflüger , said in a newspaper interview that germany would have to contribute towards rebuilding civil society and securing peace in iraq if nato were to receive a request to that effect from the u.n. he suggested reducing the number of german peacekeepers in the balkans in order to facilitate sending troops to iraq .
" we have to watch out in any case that we don ’ t throw away this great chance through mistakes , " he said in a reference to germany ’ s shunning by washington earlier this year after berlin refused to support the u.s.-led war in iraq .
however members of schröder ’ s social democrat and the green government are vehemently against sending german troops to iraq , even under a u.n. mandate .
leader of the social democrat parliamentary group gernot erler said german police and aid workers could be sent to iraq , but not the army .
" nobody can really expect a country , that so clearly rejected the iraq war , to send in soldiers there , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany : no nato in iraq without un if the united states hopes to get nato soldiers side-by-side with their own in iraq , they will have to involve the united nations .
that message came loud and clear out of berlin on friday -lrb- july 12 , 2003 -rrb- .
european press review : the u.n. could at last get its chance in iraq european papers on friday focused on the increasingly risk-fraught attempt by the americans to restore order in postwar iraq and the erosion of president bush 's credibility -lrb- july 11 , 2003 -rrb- .
surveys if the u.s. asks germany to contribute to the reconstruction efforts in postwar iraq , what should chancellor gerhard schröder offer ?
troops , he can withdraw soldiers from elsewhere money , good relations more important than economy neither , he should stick to his anti-war stance results 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

segundo - who starred in wim wenders ' film buena vista social club - died on monday at the age of 95 .
mourners filed past his coffin in havana , which was draped with a cuban flag and topped with his trademark white hat .
his body is due to be taken to his hometown of santiago de cuba , some 900 kilometres -lrb- 550 miles -rrb- east of the capital , for burial .
on monday musician juan de marco gonzalez called segundo " an encyclopaedia of cuban music " .
cuban television showed footage from his popular videos , and the national press credited him with reviving the traditional afro-cuban music called " son " .
" his death creates an unfillable void , " the country 's official prensa latina news agency wrote .
the performer suffered from a severe kidney infection , and had to cancel a series of concerts planned for this summer around europe .
fame segundo played the clarinet and a cuban string instrument called the tres .
he came to worldwide attention in 1999 with the release of wenders ' film , which followed the legendary buena vista social club musicians as they played in cuba and abroad .
the soundtrack to the film sold more than four million copies around the world .
born francisco repilado in santiago in 1907 , segundo learned his musical skills in the 1920s , but did not pick up his nickname until the 1940s - compay was slang for compadre and segundo referred to his bass harmony voice .
his group , compay segundo y sus muchachos , was formed in 1956 and was still active at the time of his death .
however , following the 1958 revolution , he disappeared from music to roll cigars for a living .

the legion says the civic party should no longer be at the front in the parish church , to give more prominence to younger people from the town .
but the legion also wants infirm members to be given places at the front .
some members of the local authority however , feel it is their civic role to represent the people of the town on such an important occasion .
they have always led the parade and been allocated seating at the front of the parish church .
back seat alan kershaw , the new chairman of the sidmouth branch of the royal british legion , said : " in the past the town council and their spouses have taken up the forefront , pushing everybody else out .
" so we have asked them to take a back seat . "
mr kershaw said he was surprised at the reaction of the town council which had expressed its objection at a meeting .
he said : " i have seen active service and i want to be at the front , to pay my respects to people who have lost their lives .
" but in the last 20 years the council has taken up all the front seats , and given nobody else a chance .
" we are just asking them now to take a back seat and allow the younger generation and royal british legion members to be at the forefront for a change . "
a further meeting is to be held between the two groups to try and resolve the matter before this year 's service on 9 november .

in his traditional bastille day interview , president jacques chirac called for a softening of the so-called stability and growth pact which aims to keep public debt levels in check and maintain confidence in the euro .
" this is july 14 , the day the bastille was stormed , and now it 's the day the stability pact has been stormed , " said dutch finance minister gerrit zalm angrily going into the meeting .
" the storming of the bastille was a better idea . "
" we have no room for softening the pact , not even temporarily , " said finnish finance minister antti kalliomaki .
" we should n't even be discussing this - it 's one of the pillars of our economic policy and the single currency , " said austria 's economy minister karl-heinz grasser .
germany stops short the row over the stability pact has been raging for months , reaching a climax when the president of the european commission called the rules " stupid " and then backtracked furiously .
stability and growth pact 12 member countries signed in 1997 budget deficits must be within 3 % of gdp 60 % limit for government borrowing european commission can fine those in breach of pact the rules - which dictate that a budget deficit can not exceed more than 3 % of national economic output - were designed to help regulate the economies of the 12 nations that use the euro .
but , with germany and france in particular suffering from an economic slowdown , these countries have already exceeded the limit in order to stimulate growth .
france , the eurozone 's second biggest economy , had a public deficit of 3.1 % in 2002 and the european commission 's provisional forecasts see it rising to 3.7 % this year and 3.6 % in 2004 .
germany , meanwhile , has just initiated hefty tax cuts in order to spur growth , but insists it can still keep its deficit below 3 % .
" stability is not the priority right now , " said german finance minister hans eichel , " we need growth . "
but he stopped short of echoing president chirac 's call for a relaxing of the rules , saying the finance ministers knew how to apply the rules in a " reasonable and coordinated way " .
prior to mr chirac 's comments , the ministers had been hoping to avoid discussing the controversial pact again , leaving it for the autumn agenda .
then ministers will have an even tougher decision to make - whether to impose hefty fines on those countries who continue to offend .

tantivy holiday coach tours ltd lost the tendering process to operate a bus service in jersey , when connex took over last year .
but earlier this year the old tantivy buses reappeared as the easylink service , running between town and tourist destinations across the island .
the committee claims it is breaking the law by doing this without a licence , because it makes stops to pick up and let off people along the route .
tantivy says it only takes people to and from specific sites , which it argues does not need a licence .
the case will be heard in the royal court .

the exhibition detailing the life and career of arthur wharton is due to be opened on tuesday by viv anderson - the first black player to be a full member of the england squad .
wharton was one of the leading goalkeepers of his time , in a career which spanned 16 years between 1886 and 1902 .
during that time he played for preston north end , stockport county , sheffield united and rotherham town .
speaking ahead of the launch , at the preston museum , mr anderson said : " it is an incredible story .
" the accounts of the day say that wharton should have played in goal for his country , but the administrators at the fa only selected white , english gentlemen to play for the national side . "
skilled keeper wharton came to england from africa 's gold coast , now ghana , but never played for his adopted homeland .
many contemporary newspaper reports testified to his skill between the sticks .
but others used the racist language of the day , often comparing him to an animal in the way he moved between the posts .
the museum 's curator mark bushell said : " many people think black players only began to play the game in this country in the 1960s and 70s .
" fans are genuinely amazed when they find out there was a black player in the late 1880s .
" it 's unbelievable that it took almost 100 years for a black player to break through at international level when , finally , viv represented his country against czechoslovakia in 1978 . "
