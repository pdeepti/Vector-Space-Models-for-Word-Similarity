german foreign minister joschka fischer on thursday distanced berlin from plans to create eu military headquarters separate from nato .
the proposal had created tension with washington . in a move likely to be seen as an olive branch in the continuing smoothing of relations between germany and the united states , the german government has softened its stance on the creation of a large and independent military planning headquarters for eu-led military operations . " i do not believe you need another big operational headquarters such as -lrb- nato ’ s planning arm -rrb- shape , " said joschka fischer , the german foreign minister .
" you have a nato planning headquarters , and there are headquarters in britain , france and germany . " the conciliatory message from berlin makes it almost certain that germany will support a more modest alternative to the proposed eu headquarters in brussels that will not compete with or duplicate existing or future nato facilities .
eight months to make u-turn germany ’ s new position is in direct contrast to that taken in april when the subject was first mooted at a meeting with france , luxembourg and belgium .
the so-called " mini summit , " especially the claim from the four nations that the eu 's defense and security policy should be backed up by an independent military planning headquarters , upset london and washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us and uk fear nato duplication .
britain and the united states quickly dismissed the proposals , fearing the creation of such a headquarters would not only compete with nato but would also create autonomous european defense structures which would undermine the transatlantic alliance .
operational planning staff still needed despite the change in tone coming from berlin on thursday , german and french officials remain committed to having some operational planning capability in brussels , where the eu 's military staff is involved only in strategic planning .
javier solana , the eu foreign policy chief and the man also responsible for the bloc 's defense and security policy , has also voiced his support for such a move .
fischer ’ s remarks seem to have been well-planned and delivered as part of a two-pronged strategy aimed at continuing the mending of relations with washington . german-american ties were badly damaged during the run-up to the u.s.-led war against iraq , which berlin strongly opposed . reconciliation continues fischer will travel to the united states next week to meet with u.s. secretary of state colin powell and national security adviser condoleezza rice in washington .

london ’ s stance has also softened in recent weeks and it looks possible that a compromise can be found at the negotiations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.11.2003 germany starts nuclear energy phase-out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stade was germany 's second-oldest nuclear reactor .
germany 's future is looking a lot greener with the closure of the stade nuclear reactor power plant on friday .
but critics of germany 's ambitious nuclear phase-out law say the country still needs atomic energy . there will be no cermonial shut-off switch for environment minister jürgen trittin to flick when the stade nuclear power plant in northern germany goes offline on friday , but chances are the champagne corks will be popping in the green party headquarters this evening .
with the early closure of the country 's second-oldest nuclear reactor , germany will take the first step of an ambitious nuclear phase-out law engineered by the greens three years ago .
“ it ’ s of course wonderful , and the first of many , ” said michaela hustedt , the greens ' environmental expert in an interview .
under the 2002 law , germany ’ s 19 nuclear reactors will close down after reaching 32 years of operation .
stade is the first reactor to be removed from the grid .
when the last reactor goes off the grid in around 2020 , nuclear and coal power , which currently provide the country with 80 percent of its electricity , will have bowed out in favor of renewable energy .
but the plan is coming under increasing criticism from energy companies and opposition politicians , who say the prohibitive cost of renewable energy and recent blackouts in the united states prove the country still needs its nuclear plants .
“ looking at it technically , renewable energy can ’ t cover as our basic source of energy , ” said peter poppe , a spokesman for vatenfall europe , one of the four utility companies to agree on the “ nuclear consensus ” in 2000 .
“ the sun , we all know , isn ’ t a regular in germany and the wind , as it says in the bible , the wind blows where it wants to . ”
other countries holding off of nuclear power nuclear reactors , though heavily subsidized by the government , still provide the more stable form of energy , say phase-out opponents .
across europe countries that have sworn off nuclear energy , like spain , italy , the netherlands and belgium , continue to rely heavily on their reactors .
sweden which decided to phase out nuclear power in 1980 , has so far taken only one reactor off the grid and has been hesitating recently on shutting down the second .
with the kyoto protocol requiring countries in the future to keep carbon emissions like those from coal-burning plants down , german energy experts are concerned that the country won ’ t have a stable source of power to make up for the 40,000 megawatts in power lost when plants go off the grid in the coming 20 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preussen-elektra coal fired power plant , grosskrotzenburg-hessen , germany “ you either phase-out nuclear energy , or you reduce greenhouse gas emissions , but you can ’ t do both , ” says wolfgang pfaffenberger , director of the bremen energy insitute .
energy companies hoping for delay germany ’ s big four energy companies – vatenfall , energie baden-wuerttemberg , e.on and rwe – are secretly hoping the country follows the european trend and delay deadlines for shutting their reactors , says pfaffenberger .
their problem would also be solved if the opposition christian democratic party , which wants to keep nuclear energy around longer , boots out the chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s red-green coalition government in the 2006 federal elections .
“ they are hoping that day comes but they don ’ t want to say it because it would decrease the likelihood of it happening , ” pfaffenberger says .
environmentalists say they should instead be focusing on developing their renewable energy technology .
the gradual transition from nuclear power will be covered by a temporary combination of coal , wind and gas power , according to the environment ministry .
eventually , coal will be phase out as new energy sources like the geo-thermic plant that opened in northeastern germany this week , become economicallly viable .
“ we just can ’ t switch our energy sources from today to tomorrow , ” says björn pieprzyk , of the association for renewable energy . “ but the direction has to be right . ”
the growing power of wind germany has so far favored wind over other renewable energy resources .
the more than 12,000 wind turbines that dot the german countryside in the north and southwest of the country are indirectly subsidized by the government .
the early subsidies have helped mid-sized german companies become worldwide leaders in the wind market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ wind is already a classic energy source , even if some don ’ t see it , or want to see it , ” says andreas düser , whose company enercon is second in the worldwide market and has production plants in sweden , brazil and india .
the green party has high hopes for additional renewable energy sources , eventually wanting them to increase their current eight percent share of the german electricity market to 20 percent by 2020 .
critics want energy puzzle solved “ we want a broad palette of renewable energies .
micro-turbines , solar technology , and so on , ” says hustedt .
“ but it is difficult to predict , ” what will take off economically .
the economic uncertainty on what renewable energy source will take off when has only added fuel to the argument of the phase-out naysayers .
though the transition from nuclear power is only just beginning , skeptics say germany needs to have a better concept of what makes up the rest of the energy puzzle .
if the greens increase renewable energy to 20 percent , " you still have 80 percent you need to take care of , and no nuclear energy , " says pfaffenberger , co-author of a book on power supply .
" up until now , people have n't been worried ... and who looks 10 years into the future anyway ?
but the experts are annoyed that we have n't found an alternative yet , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy storm turns to a breeze after weeks of discord in germany ’ s coalition government over the future of the nation ’ s energy supply , ministers from both camps are working together to reach a compromise on traditional and renewable forms of energy .

germany 's future is looking a lot greener with the closure of the stade nuclear reactor power plant on friday .
but critics of germany 's ambitious nuclear phase-out law say the country still needs atomic energy . there will be no cermonial shut-off switch for environment minister jürgen trittin to flick when the stade nuclear power plant in northern germany goes offline on friday , but chances are the champagne corks will be popping in the green party headquarters this evening .
with the early closure of the country 's second-oldest nuclear reactor , germany will take the first step of an ambitious nuclear phase-out law engineered by the greens three years ago .
“ it ’ s of course wonderful , and the first of many , ” said michaela hustedt , the greens ' environmental expert in an interview .
under the 2002 law , germany ’ s 19 nuclear reactors will close down after reaching 32 years of operation .
stade is the first reactor to be removed from the grid .
when the last reactor goes off the grid in around 2020 , nuclear and coal power , which currently provide the country with 80 percent of its electricity , will have bowed out in favor of renewable energy .
but the plan is coming under increasing criticism from energy companies and opposition politicians , who say the prohibitive cost of renewable energy and recent blackouts in the united states prove the country still needs its nuclear plants .
“ looking at it technically , renewable energy can ’ t cover as our basic source of energy , ” said peter poppe , a spokesman for vatenfall europe , one of the four utility companies to agree on the “ nuclear consensus ” in 2000 .
“ the sun , we all know , isn ’ t a regular in germany and the wind , as it says in the bible , the wind blows where it wants to . ”
other countries holding off of nuclear power nuclear reactors , though heavily subsidized by the government , still provide the more stable form of energy , say phase-out opponents .
across europe countries that have sworn off nuclear energy , like spain , italy , the netherlands and belgium , continue to rely heavily on their reactors .
sweden which decided to phase out nuclear power in 1980 , has so far taken only one reactor off the grid and has been hesitating recently on shutting down the second .
with the kyoto protocol requiring countries in the future to keep carbon emissions like those from coal-burning plants down , german energy experts are concerned that the country won ’ t have a stable source of power to make up for the 40,000 megawatts in power lost when plants go off the grid in the coming 20 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preussen-elektra coal fired power plant , grosskrotzenburg-hessen , germany “ you either phase-out nuclear energy , or you reduce greenhouse gas emissions , but you can ’ t do both , ” says wolfgang pfaffenberger , director of the bremen energy insitute .
energy companies hoping for delay germany ’ s big four energy companies – vatenfall , energie baden-wuerttemberg , e.on and rwe – are secretly hoping the country follows the european trend and delay deadlines for shutting their reactors , says pfaffenberger .
their problem would also be solved if the opposition christian democratic party , which wants to keep nuclear energy around longer , boots out the chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s red-green coalition government in the 2006 federal elections .
“ they are hoping that day comes but they don ’ t want to say it because it would decrease the likelihood of it happening , ” pfaffenberger says .
environmentalists say they should instead be focusing on developing their renewable energy technology .
the gradual transition from nuclear power will be covered by a temporary combination of coal , wind and gas power , according to the environment ministry .
eventually , coal will be phase out as new energy sources like the geo-thermic plant that opened in northeastern germany this week , become economicallly viable .
“ we just can ’ t switch our energy sources from today to tomorrow , ” says björn pieprzyk , of the association for renewable energy . “ but the direction has to be right . ”
the growing power of wind germany has so far favored wind over other renewable energy resources .
the more than 12,000 wind turbines that dot the german countryside in the north and southwest of the country are indirectly subsidized by the government .
the early subsidies have helped mid-sized german companies become worldwide leaders in the wind market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ wind is already a classic energy source , even if some don ’ t see it , or want to see it , ” says andreas düser , whose company enercon is second in the worldwide market and has production plants in sweden , brazil and india .
the green party has high hopes for additional renewable energy sources , eventually wanting them to increase their current eight percent share of the german electricity market to 20 percent by 2020 .
critics want energy puzzle solved “ we want a broad palette of renewable energies .
micro-turbines , solar technology , and so on , ” says hustedt .
“ but it is difficult to predict , ” what will take off economically .
the economic uncertainty on what renewable energy source will take off when has only added fuel to the argument of the phase-out naysayers .
though the transition from nuclear power is only just beginning , skeptics say germany needs to have a better concept of what makes up the rest of the energy puzzle .
if the greens increase renewable energy to 20 percent , " you still have 80 percent you need to take care of , and no nuclear energy , " says pfaffenberger , co-author of a book on power supply .

martin hohmann , the parliamentarian who called jews a " race of perpetrators " in a speech , was expelled from his parliamentary group on friday .
christian democratic union leaders also plan to revoke his party membership . " it 's a difficult day for everyone , " said cdu party leader angela merkel shortly after friday morning 's vote .
minutes earlier , 195 of the parliamentary group 's 248 members had voted to expel hohmann , ensuring a two-thirds majority necessary for the move . " the result is unambiguous , " merkel said , adding that the expulsion was the right thing to do from a political standpoint . futile final plea by hohmann , supporters a last-ditch attempt by hohmann to avoid the expulsion obviously had no effect on the vote .
in an explanation to the parliamentary group , he said he had apologized several times , and was prepared to do anything he could to heal the wounds he had caused .
in the explanation , published by a newspaper in hohmann 's central german hometown of fulda , he said he had not described jews as " a race of perpetrators , " but that the media had taken his words out of context .
cdu leaders said they had given hohmann several chances to apologize and retract his statements before pushing for a vote to expel him .
while willing to apologize , hohmann allegedly said he would only do so for tactical reasons to keep his group and party membership and not because he had changed his views on the matter , party officials revealed .
jewish leaders have complained about hohmann on a number of occassions and media reported this week that he had given speeches of a similar tone in the past . hohmann 's supporters also tried one more time to sway parliamentarians .
on friday , they called for a " critical solidarity " with hohmann in ads in national newspapers .
several of the 26 people who signed the appeal to party leaders have made right extremist remarks in the past . expulsion a first for german conservatives hohmann 's expulsion is a first for the cdu and her sister party , the bavarian christian social union .
group leaders expressed their disappointment that 28 parliamentarians had voted against the expulsion - 16 others abstained , four votes were invalid and five mps were absent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democratic party leader angela merkel had called for hohmann 's expulsion from the parliamentary group .
" i 'd wished for a different result , " wolfgang bosbach , a deputy group leader , said .
angela merkel explained the opposing votes as a reflection of people 's personal sympathies for hohmann rather than an implicit endorsement of his remarks .
hohmann 's expulsion from the party is also under way , but that process could take several months .
anti-semitic remarks caused national debate in a speech given on germany 's national day on oct .
3 , hohmann had compared the russian revolution with the holocaust .
hohmann said that primarily jewish bolsheviks were responsible for crimes committed against civilians during the russian revolution .
he then went on to compare what he claimed was bloodshed orchestrated by jews in russia in the early 1900s with the murder of europe ’ s jews by the nazis in the third reich .
" jews were active in great numbers in the leadership as well as in the soviet secret police firing squads , " hohmann told constituents in his hometown of neuhof .
" thus one could describe jews with some justification as a tätervolk -lsb- roughly translated as race of perpetrators -rsb- . "
although he admitted in his speech that such a comparison " may sound horrible , " hohmann said it followed the " same logic with which one describes the germans as a race of perpetrators . "
the contents of that speech became highly publicized after a public television station broadcast a report on it .
it sparked a national debate about anti-semitic sentiment among german politicians and military leaders .
a former brigadier gen. reinhard günzel , head of germany ’ s ksk special forces , was sacked by the government after he publicly endorsed hohmann ’ s comments . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : why hohmann has to go german editorial writers comment on the christian democratic union ’ s struggle to expel right-wing backbencher martin hohmann after he called jews a “ race of perpetrators ” in a recent speech .

starting this year , germans who want to become undertakers can receive a formal education for the job .
while thousands of young people are still looking for apprenticeships , 75 have already signed up for the program . christiane hossdorf found her dream job while still in high school .
the 19-year-old interned at a funeral home and decided she wanted to work in the field .
she does n't fear the sight of people who died in traffic accidents .
she 's not disgusted by handling bodies .
hossdorf can only think of one situation where she 'd be hesitant to do her job : burying a child is not something she 's looking forward to .
" i 'd let others do that for now and just watch them , " she said .
a job independent of economic cycles the young woman is lucky to have found an apprenticeship - 24,000 germans are still on the look-out this year and the government is now considering fining companies unwilling to train people . the funeral business is a stable one , " independent of economic cycles " , as the federal association of german undertakers states in a leaflet .
people die , no matter what happens .
last year , 842,000 germans were buried or cremated and anyone training to become an undertaker stands a good chance of landing a job afterwards . but while some of hossdorf 's friends are fascinated by what she 's doing , others still ca n't understand why she chose her line of work . still a men 's world " some think i 'm crazy , " she said .
" they ask me : ' why are you doing this ?
these people just go crazy in their heads , because they constantly have to deal with mourners . " ' her parents initially did n't like the idea , either .
they feared she would not be able to deal with the psychological pressure .
hossdorf also gets asked over and over again why she 's chosen a job that 's still done mainly by men . " people tell me : ' that 's a man 's job and people don ’ t like to see women do it , " ' hossdorf said .
" i see things differently .
there are women who become roofers .
sure , some bodies weigh a little more and i have to stop and rest once in a while , but it always works out somehow . " psychology of mourning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish cemetary in berlin .
graves here can not be reused .
hossdorf said she does n't want to limit her work to helping relatives organize funerals and deal with the necessary paperwork .
she hopes to help them deal with emotional issues as well . to learn how to do that , hossdorf attends school every couple of weeks during her three-year apprenticeship .
besides embalming , business management and funeral logistics , subjects there include the psychology of mourning , counseling , and the funeral customs and rites of various religions . hossdorf 's boss , elke birghölzer , has organized a hindu funeral , which required a special permit , because german law prohibits open caskets during funeral services .
she 's more familiar with muslim funerals , where ritual washings of the body are required and the grave site needs to be permanent and not limited to 25 years - the standard in germany . " when you bury people of russian orthodox faith , it 's customary to have a sip of vodka at the grave , " birghölzer said .
" undertakers have to be prepared for that . " a new benchmark for quality funerals a formal preparation for the job has been lacking until now .
while most german tradesmen still have to pass exams to start working , the funeral industry had no universally accepted standard of training . " a baker could become an undertaker , " birghölzer said . " all he had to do was to put a few coffins in his store . " the new training program is therefore also expected to ensure a certain quality level common to all funeral homes .
but it wo n't be a requirement for working as an undertaker : the baker can still bury people should he choose to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bikers carry the coffin of austrian pop singer falco in 1998 : ensuring quality funerals independet of customers ' special requests is the goal of the new training program for undertakers .

starting this year , germans who want to become undertakers can receive a formal education for the job .
while thousands of young people are still looking for apprenticeships , 75 have already signed up for the program . christiane hossdorf found her dream job while still in high school .
the 19-year-old interned at a funeral home and decided she wanted to work in the field .
she does n't fear the sight of people who died in traffic accidents .
she 's not disgusted by handling bodies .
hossdorf can only think of one situation where she 'd be hesitant to do her job : burying a child is not something she 's looking forward to .
" i 'd let others do that for now and just watch them , " she said .
a job independent of economic cycles the young woman is lucky to have found an apprenticeship - 24,000 germans are still on the look-out this year and the government is now considering fining companies unwilling to train people . the funeral business is a stable one , " independent of economic cycles " , as the federal association of german undertakers states in a leaflet .
people die , no matter what happens .
last year , 842,000 germans were buried or cremated and anyone training to become an undertaker stands a good chance of landing a job afterwards . but while some of hossdorf 's friends are fascinated by what she 's doing , others still ca n't understand why she chose her line of work . still a men 's world " some think i 'm crazy , " she said .
" they ask me : ' why are you doing this ?
these people just go crazy in their heads , because they constantly have to deal with mourners . " ' her parents initially did n't like the idea , either .
they feared she would not be able to deal with the psychological pressure .
hossdorf also gets asked over and over again why she 's chosen a job that 's still done mainly by men . " people tell me : ' that 's a man 's job and people don ’ t like to see women do it , " ' hossdorf said .
" i see things differently .
there are women who become roofers .
sure , some bodies weigh a little more and i have to stop and rest once in a while , but it always works out somehow . " psychology of mourning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish cemetary in berlin .
graves here can not be reused .
hossdorf said she does n't want to limit her work to helping relatives organize funerals and deal with the necessary paperwork .
she hopes to help them deal with emotional issues as well . to learn how to do that , hossdorf attends school every couple of weeks during her three-year apprenticeship .
besides embalming , business management and funeral logistics , subjects there include the psychology of mourning , counseling , and the funeral customs and rites of various religions . hossdorf 's boss , elke birghölzer , has organized a hindu funeral , which required a special permit , because german law prohibits open caskets during funeral services .
she 's more familiar with muslim funerals , where ritual washings of the body are required and the grave site needs to be permanent and not limited to 25 years - the standard in germany . " when you bury people of russian orthodox faith , it 's customary to have a sip of vodka at the grave , " birghölzer said .
" undertakers have to be prepared for that . " a new benchmark for quality funerals a formal preparation for the job has been lacking until now .
while most german tradesmen still have to pass exams to start working , the funeral industry had no universally accepted standard of training . " a baker could become an undertaker , " birghölzer said . " all he had to do was to put a few coffins in his store . " the new training program is therefore also expected to ensure a certain quality level common to all funeral homes .

in an explanation to the parliamentary group , he said he had apologized several times , and was prepared to do anything he could to heal the wounds he had caused .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 14.11.2003 prodi raises profile at home , anger in brussels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romani prodi denies he wants to enter italian politics .
european commission president romano prodi caused waves in italy by issuing a political manifesto seen as signaling a desire to return to domestic politics – now , the ripple effect has reached brussels . earlier this week , prodi circulated a 55-page page manifesto on the future of europe and the leftist parties in italy . entitled “ europe : the dream , the choices , ” the document urges italy ’ s center-left parties , referred to as the “ olive tree ” bloc after former italian prime minister prodi ’ s own 1996 center-left coalition government , to unite and run under a single banner in next year ’ s european parliament elections . the european commission denied on wednesday that prodi wants to step back into the fray of italian politics , and said he would stay in his post as head of the brussels executive until his term ends next year . rivalry with berlusconi but the move has caused many of prodi ’ s colleagues in the european commission to wonder what provoked the normally reserved economics professor from bologna to release such a document .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 14.11.2003 hohmann expelled from cdu group over anti-semitic remarks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin hohmann behind the logo of his former parliamentary group .
martin hohmann , the parliamentarian who called jews a " race of perpetrators " in a speech , was expelled from his parliamentary group on friday .
christian democratic union leaders also plan to revoke his party membership . " it 's a difficult day for everyone , " said cdu party leader angela merkel shortly after friday morning 's vote .
minutes earlier , 195 of the parliamentary group 's 248 members had voted to expel hohmann , ensuring a two-thirds majority necessary for the move . " the result is unambiguous , " merkel said , adding that the expulsion was the right thing to do from a political standpoint . futile final plea by hohmann , supporters a last-ditch attempt by hohmann to avoid the expulsion obviously had no effect on the vote .
in an explanation to the parliamentary group , he said he had apologized several times , and was prepared to do anything he could to heal the wounds he had caused .
in the explanation , published by a newspaper in hohmann 's central german hometown of fulda , he said he had not described jews as " a race of perpetrators , " but that the media had taken his words out of context .
cdu leaders said they had given hohmann several chances to apologize and retract his statements before pushing for a vote to expel him .
while willing to apologize , hohmann allegedly said he would only do so for tactical reasons to keep his group and party membership and not because he had changed his views on the matter , party officials revealed .
jewish leaders have complained about hohmann on a number of occassions and media reported this week that he had given speeches of a similar tone in the past . hohmann 's supporters also tried one more time to sway parliamentarians .
on friday , they called for a " critical solidarity " with hohmann in ads in national newspapers .
several of the 26 people who signed the appeal to party leaders have made right extremist remarks in the past . expulsion a first for german conservatives hohmann 's expulsion is a first for the cdu and her sister party , the bavarian christian social union .
group leaders expressed their disappointment that 28 parliamentarians had voted against the expulsion - 16 others abstained , four votes were invalid and five mps were absent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democratic party leader angela merkel had called for hohmann 's expulsion from the parliamentary group .
" i 'd wished for a different result , " wolfgang bosbach , a deputy group leader , said .
angela merkel explained the opposing votes as a reflection of people 's personal sympathies for hohmann rather than an implicit endorsement of his remarks .
hohmann 's expulsion from the party is also under way , but that process could take several months .
anti-semitic remarks caused national debate in a speech given on germany 's national day on oct .
3 , hohmann had compared the russian revolution with the holocaust .
hohmann said that primarily jewish bolsheviks were responsible for crimes committed against civilians during the russian revolution .
he then went on to compare what he claimed was bloodshed orchestrated by jews in russia in the early 1900s with the murder of europe ’ s jews by the nazis in the third reich .
" jews were active in great numbers in the leadership as well as in the soviet secret police firing squads , " hohmann told constituents in his hometown of neuhof .
" thus one could describe jews with some justification as a tätervolk -lsb- roughly translated as race of perpetrators -rsb- . "
although he admitted in his speech that such a comparison " may sound horrible , " hohmann said it followed the " same logic with which one describes the germans as a race of perpetrators . "
the contents of that speech became highly publicized after a public television station broadcast a report on it .
it sparked a national debate about anti-semitic sentiment among german politicians and military leaders .

german foreign minister joschka fischer on thursday distanced berlin from plans to create eu military headquarters separate from nato .
the proposal had created tension with washington . in a move likely to be seen as an olive branch in the continuing smoothing of relations between germany and the united states , the german government has softened its stance on the creation of a large and independent military planning headquarters for eu-led military operations . " i do not believe you need another big operational headquarters such as -lrb- nato ’ s planning arm -rrb- shape , " said joschka fischer , the german foreign minister .
" you have a nato planning headquarters , and there are headquarters in britain , france and germany . " the conciliatory message from berlin makes it almost certain that germany will support a more modest alternative to the proposed eu headquarters in brussels that will not compete with or duplicate existing or future nato facilities .
eight months to make u-turn germany ’ s new position is in direct contrast to that taken in april when the subject was first mooted at a meeting with france , luxembourg and belgium .

javier solana , the eu foreign policy chief and the man also responsible for the bloc 's defense and security policy , has also voiced his support for such a move .
fischer ’ s remarks seem to have been well-planned and delivered as part of a two-pronged strategy aimed at continuing the mending of relations with washington . german-american ties were badly damaged during the run-up to the u.s.-led war against iraq , which berlin strongly opposed . reconciliation continues fischer will travel to the united states next week to meet with u.s. secretary of state colin powell and national security adviser condoleezza rice in washington .

starting this year , germans who want to become undertakers can receive a formal education for the job .
while thousands of young people are still looking for apprenticeships , 75 have already signed up for the program . christiane hossdorf found her dream job while still in high school .
the 19-year-old interned at a funeral home and decided she wanted to work in the field .
she does n't fear the sight of people who died in traffic accidents .
she 's not disgusted by handling bodies .
hossdorf can only think of one situation where she 'd be hesitant to do her job : burying a child is not something she 's looking forward to .
" i 'd let others do that for now and just watch them , " she said .
a job independent of economic cycles the young woman is lucky to have found an apprenticeship - 24,000 germans are still on the look-out this year and the government is now considering fining companies unwilling to train people . the funeral business is a stable one , " independent of economic cycles " , as the federal association of german undertakers states in a leaflet .
people die , no matter what happens .
last year , 842,000 germans were buried or cremated and anyone training to become an undertaker stands a good chance of landing a job afterwards . but while some of hossdorf 's friends are fascinated by what she 's doing , others still ca n't understand why she chose her line of work . still a men 's world " some think i 'm crazy , " she said .
" they ask me : ' why are you doing this ?
these people just go crazy in their heads , because they constantly have to deal with mourners . " ' her parents initially did n't like the idea , either .
they feared she would not be able to deal with the psychological pressure .
hossdorf also gets asked over and over again why she 's chosen a job that 's still done mainly by men . " people tell me : ' that 's a man 's job and people don ’ t like to see women do it , " ' hossdorf said .
" i see things differently .
there are women who become roofers .
sure , some bodies weigh a little more and i have to stop and rest once in a while , but it always works out somehow . " psychology of mourning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish cemetary in berlin .
graves here can not be reused .
hossdorf said she does n't want to limit her work to helping relatives organize funerals and deal with the necessary paperwork .
she hopes to help them deal with emotional issues as well . to learn how to do that , hossdorf attends school every couple of weeks during her three-year apprenticeship .
besides embalming , business management and funeral logistics , subjects there include the psychology of mourning , counseling , and the funeral customs and rites of various religions . hossdorf 's boss , elke birghölzer , has organized a hindu funeral , which required a special permit , because german law prohibits open caskets during funeral services .
she 's more familiar with muslim funerals , where ritual washings of the body are required and the grave site needs to be permanent and not limited to 25 years - the standard in germany . " when you bury people of russian orthodox faith , it 's customary to have a sip of vodka at the grave , " birghölzer said .
" undertakers have to be prepared for that . " a new benchmark for quality funerals a formal preparation for the job has been lacking until now .
while most german tradesmen still have to pass exams to start working , the funeral industry had no universally accepted standard of training . " a baker could become an undertaker , " birghölzer said . " all he had to do was to put a few coffins in his store . " the new training program is therefore also expected to ensure a certain quality level common to all funeral homes .
but it wo n't be a requirement for working as an undertaker : the baker can still bury people should he choose to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bikers carry the coffin of austrian pop singer falco in 1998 : ensuring quality funerals independet of customers ' special requests is the goal of the new training program for undertakers .

" that 's as far as the law is concerned .

martin hohmann , the parliamentarian who called jews a " race of perpetrators " in a speech , was expelled from his parliamentary group on friday .
christian democratic union leaders also plan to revoke his party membership . " it 's a difficult day for everyone , " said cdu party leader angela merkel shortly after friday morning 's vote .
minutes earlier , 195 of the parliamentary group 's 248 members had voted to expel hohmann , ensuring a two-thirds majority necessary for the move . " the result is unambiguous , " merkel said , adding that the expulsion was the right thing to do from a political standpoint . futile final plea by hohmann , supporters a last-ditch attempt by hohmann to avoid the expulsion obviously had no effect on the vote .
in an explanation to the parliamentary group , he said he had apologized several times , and was prepared to do anything he could to heal the wounds he had caused .
in the explanation , published by a newspaper in hohmann 's central german hometown of fulda , he said he had not described jews as " a race of perpetrators , " but that the media had taken his words out of context .
cdu leaders said they had given hohmann several chances to apologize and retract his statements before pushing for a vote to expel him .
while willing to apologize , hohmann allegedly said he would only do so for tactical reasons to keep his group and party membership and not because he had changed his views on the matter , party officials revealed .
jewish leaders have complained about hohmann on a number of occassions and media reported this week that he had given speeches of a similar tone in the past . hohmann 's supporters also tried one more time to sway parliamentarians .
on friday , they called for a " critical solidarity " with hohmann in ads in national newspapers .
several of the 26 people who signed the appeal to party leaders have made right extremist remarks in the past . expulsion a first for german conservatives hohmann 's expulsion is a first for the cdu and her sister party , the bavarian christian social union .
group leaders expressed their disappointment that 28 parliamentarians had voted against the expulsion - 16 others abstained , four votes were invalid and five mps were absent .

" i 'd wished for a different result , " wolfgang bosbach , a deputy group leader , said .
angela merkel explained the opposing votes as a reflection of people 's personal sympathies for hohmann rather than an implicit endorsement of his remarks .
hohmann 's expulsion from the party is also under way , but that process could take several months .
anti-semitic remarks caused national debate in a speech given on germany 's national day on oct .
3 , hohmann had compared the russian revolution with the holocaust .
hohmann said that primarily jewish bolsheviks were responsible for crimes committed against civilians during the russian revolution .
he then went on to compare what he claimed was bloodshed orchestrated by jews in russia in the early 1900s with the murder of europe ’ s jews by the nazis in the third reich .
" jews were active in great numbers in the leadership as well as in the soviet secret police firing squads , " hohmann told constituents in his hometown of neuhof .
" thus one could describe jews with some justification as a tätervolk -lsb- roughly translated as race of perpetrators -rsb- . "
although he admitted in his speech that such a comparison " may sound horrible , " hohmann said it followed the " same logic with which one describes the germans as a race of perpetrators . "
the contents of that speech became highly publicized after a public television station broadcast a report on it .
it sparked a national debate about anti-semitic sentiment among german politicians and military leaders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.11.2003 germany starts nuclear energy phase-out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stade was germany 's second-oldest nuclear reactor .
germany 's future is looking a lot greener with the closure of the stade nuclear reactor power plant on friday .
but critics of germany 's ambitious nuclear phase-out law say the country still needs atomic energy . there will be no cermonial shut-off switch for environment minister jürgen trittin to flick when the stade nuclear power plant in northern germany goes offline on friday , but chances are the champagne corks will be popping in the green party headquarters this evening .
with the early closure of the country 's second-oldest nuclear reactor , germany will take the first step of an ambitious nuclear phase-out law engineered by the greens three years ago .
“ it ’ s of course wonderful , and the first of many , ” said michaela hustedt , the greens ' environmental expert in an interview .
under the 2002 law , germany ’ s 19 nuclear reactors will close down after reaching 32 years of operation .
stade is the first reactor to be removed from the grid .
when the last reactor goes off the grid in around 2020 , nuclear and coal power , which currently provide the country with 80 percent of its electricity , will have bowed out in favor of renewable energy .
but the plan is coming under increasing criticism from energy companies and opposition politicians , who say the prohibitive cost of renewable energy and recent blackouts in the united states prove the country still needs its nuclear plants .
“ looking at it technically , renewable energy can ’ t cover as our basic source of energy , ” said peter poppe , a spokesman for vatenfall europe , one of the four utility companies to agree on the “ nuclear consensus ” in 2000 .
“ the sun , we all know , isn ’ t a regular in germany and the wind , as it says in the bible , the wind blows where it wants to . ”
other countries holding off of nuclear power nuclear reactors , though heavily subsidized by the government , still provide the more stable form of energy , say phase-out opponents .
across europe countries that have sworn off nuclear energy , like spain , italy , the netherlands and belgium , continue to rely heavily on their reactors .
sweden which decided to phase out nuclear power in 1980 , has so far taken only one reactor off the grid and has been hesitating recently on shutting down the second .
with the kyoto protocol requiring countries in the future to keep carbon emissions like those from coal-burning plants down , german energy experts are concerned that the country won ’ t have a stable source of power to make up for the 40,000 megawatts in power lost when plants go off the grid in the coming 20 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preussen-elektra coal fired power plant , grosskrotzenburg-hessen , germany “ you either phase-out nuclear energy , or you reduce greenhouse gas emissions , but you can ’ t do both , ” says wolfgang pfaffenberger , director of the bremen energy insitute .
energy companies hoping for delay germany ’ s big four energy companies – vatenfall , energie baden-wuerttemberg , e.on and rwe – are secretly hoping the country follows the european trend and delay deadlines for shutting their reactors , says pfaffenberger .
their problem would also be solved if the opposition christian democratic party , which wants to keep nuclear energy around longer , boots out the chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s red-green coalition government in the 2006 federal elections .
“ they are hoping that day comes but they don ’ t want to say it because it would decrease the likelihood of it happening , ” pfaffenberger says .
environmentalists say they should instead be focusing on developing their renewable energy technology .
the gradual transition from nuclear power will be covered by a temporary combination of coal , wind and gas power , according to the environment ministry .
eventually , coal will be phase out as new energy sources like the geo-thermic plant that opened in northeastern germany this week , become economicallly viable .
“ we just can ’ t switch our energy sources from today to tomorrow , ” says björn pieprzyk , of the association for renewable energy . “ but the direction has to be right . ”
the growing power of wind germany has so far favored wind over other renewable energy resources .
the more than 12,000 wind turbines that dot the german countryside in the north and southwest of the country are indirectly subsidized by the government .
the early subsidies have helped mid-sized german companies become worldwide leaders in the wind market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ wind is already a classic energy source , even if some don ’ t see it , or want to see it , ” says andreas düser , whose company enercon is second in the worldwide market and has production plants in sweden , brazil and india .
the green party has high hopes for additional renewable energy sources , eventually wanting them to increase their current eight percent share of the german electricity market to 20 percent by 2020 .
critics want energy puzzle solved “ we want a broad palette of renewable energies .
micro-turbines , solar technology , and so on , ” says hustedt .
“ but it is difficult to predict , ” what will take off economically .
the economic uncertainty on what renewable energy source will take off when has only added fuel to the argument of the phase-out naysayers .
though the transition from nuclear power is only just beginning , skeptics say germany needs to have a better concept of what makes up the rest of the energy puzzle .
if the greens increase renewable energy to 20 percent , " you still have 80 percent you need to take care of , and no nuclear energy , " says pfaffenberger , co-author of a book on power supply .
" up until now , people have n't been worried ... and who looks 10 years into the future anyway ?
but the experts are annoyed that we have n't found an alternative yet , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy storm turns to a breeze after weeks of discord in germany ’ s coalition government over the future of the nation ’ s energy supply , ministers from both camps are working together to reach a compromise on traditional and renewable forms of energy .

germany 's future is looking a lot greener with the closure of the stade nuclear reactor power plant on friday .
but critics of germany 's ambitious nuclear phase-out law say the country still needs atomic energy . there will be no cermonial shut-off switch for environment minister jürgen trittin to flick when the stade nuclear power plant in northern germany goes offline on friday , but chances are the champagne corks will be popping in the green party headquarters this evening .
with the early closure of the country 's second-oldest nuclear reactor , germany will take the first step of an ambitious nuclear phase-out law engineered by the greens three years ago .
“ it ’ s of course wonderful , and the first of many , ” said michaela hustedt , the greens ' environmental expert in an interview .
under the 2002 law , germany ’ s 19 nuclear reactors will close down after reaching 32 years of operation .
stade is the first reactor to be removed from the grid .
when the last reactor goes off the grid in around 2020 , nuclear and coal power , which currently provide the country with 80 percent of its electricity , will have bowed out in favor of renewable energy .
but the plan is coming under increasing criticism from energy companies and opposition politicians , who say the prohibitive cost of renewable energy and recent blackouts in the united states prove the country still needs its nuclear plants .
“ looking at it technically , renewable energy can ’ t cover as our basic source of energy , ” said peter poppe , a spokesman for vatenfall europe , one of the four utility companies to agree on the “ nuclear consensus ” in 2000 .
“ the sun , we all know , isn ’ t a regular in germany and the wind , as it says in the bible , the wind blows where it wants to . ”
other countries holding off of nuclear power nuclear reactors , though heavily subsidized by the government , still provide the more stable form of energy , say phase-out opponents .
across europe countries that have sworn off nuclear energy , like spain , italy , the netherlands and belgium , continue to rely heavily on their reactors .
sweden which decided to phase out nuclear power in 1980 , has so far taken only one reactor off the grid and has been hesitating recently on shutting down the second .
with the kyoto protocol requiring countries in the future to keep carbon emissions like those from coal-burning plants down , german energy experts are concerned that the country won ’ t have a stable source of power to make up for the 40,000 megawatts in power lost when plants go off the grid in the coming 20 years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.11.2003 germany backs down on eu military hq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer is heading to washington next week for talks .
german foreign minister joschka fischer on thursday distanced berlin from plans to create eu military headquarters separate from nato .
the proposal had created tension with washington . in a move likely to be seen as an olive branch in the continuing smoothing of relations between germany and the united states , the german government has softened its stance on the creation of a large and independent military planning headquarters for eu-led military operations . " i do not believe you need another big operational headquarters such as -lrb- nato ’ s planning arm -rrb- shape , " said joschka fischer , the german foreign minister .
" you have a nato planning headquarters , and there are headquarters in britain , france and germany . " the conciliatory message from berlin makes it almost certain that germany will support a more modest alternative to the proposed eu headquarters in brussels that will not compete with or duplicate existing or future nato facilities .
eight months to make u-turn germany ’ s new position is in direct contrast to that taken in april when the subject was first mooted at a meeting with france , luxembourg and belgium .
the so-called " mini summit , " especially the claim from the four nations that the eu 's defense and security policy should be backed up by an independent military planning headquarters , upset london and washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us and uk fear nato duplication .
britain and the united states quickly dismissed the proposals , fearing the creation of such a headquarters would not only compete with nato but would also create autonomous european defense structures which would undermine the transatlantic alliance .
operational planning staff still needed despite the change in tone coming from berlin on thursday , german and french officials remain committed to having some operational planning capability in brussels , where the eu 's military staff is involved only in strategic planning .
javier solana , the eu foreign policy chief and the man also responsible for the bloc 's defense and security policy , has also voiced his support for such a move .
fischer ’ s remarks seem to have been well-planned and delivered as part of a two-pronged strategy aimed at continuing the mending of relations with washington . german-american ties were badly damaged during the run-up to the u.s.-led war against iraq , which berlin strongly opposed . reconciliation continues fischer will travel to the united states next week to meet with u.s. secretary of state colin powell and national security adviser condoleezza rice in washington .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.11.2003 germany starts nuclear energy phase-out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stade was germany 's second-oldest nuclear reactor .
germany 's future is looking a lot greener with the closure of the stade nuclear reactor power plant on friday .
but critics of germany 's ambitious nuclear phase-out law say the country still needs atomic energy . there will be no cermonial shut-off switch for environment minister jürgen trittin to flick when the stade nuclear power plant in northern germany goes offline on friday , but chances are the champagne corks will be popping in the green party headquarters this evening .
with the early closure of the country 's second-oldest nuclear reactor , germany will take the first step of an ambitious nuclear phase-out law engineered by the greens three years ago .
“ it ’ s of course wonderful , and the first of many , ” said michaela hustedt , the greens ' environmental expert in an interview .
under the 2002 law , germany ’ s 19 nuclear reactors will close down after reaching 32 years of operation .
stade is the first reactor to be removed from the grid .
when the last reactor goes off the grid in around 2020 , nuclear and coal power , which currently provide the country with 80 percent of its electricity , will have bowed out in favor of renewable energy .
but the plan is coming under increasing criticism from energy companies and opposition politicians , who say the prohibitive cost of renewable energy and recent blackouts in the united states prove the country still needs its nuclear plants .
“ looking at it technically , renewable energy can ’ t cover as our basic source of energy , ” said peter poppe , a spokesman for vatenfall europe , one of the four utility companies to agree on the “ nuclear consensus ” in 2000 .
“ the sun , we all know , isn ’ t a regular in germany and the wind , as it says in the bible , the wind blows where it wants to . ”
other countries holding off of nuclear power nuclear reactors , though heavily subsidized by the government , still provide the more stable form of energy , say phase-out opponents .
across europe countries that have sworn off nuclear energy , like spain , italy , the netherlands and belgium , continue to rely heavily on their reactors .
sweden which decided to phase out nuclear power in 1980 , has so far taken only one reactor off the grid and has been hesitating recently on shutting down the second .
with the kyoto protocol requiring countries in the future to keep carbon emissions like those from coal-burning plants down , german energy experts are concerned that the country won ’ t have a stable source of power to make up for the 40,000 megawatts in power lost when plants go off the grid in the coming 20 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preussen-elektra coal fired power plant , grosskrotzenburg-hessen , germany “ you either phase-out nuclear energy , or you reduce greenhouse gas emissions , but you can ’ t do both , ” says wolfgang pfaffenberger , director of the bremen energy insitute .
energy companies hoping for delay germany ’ s big four energy companies – vatenfall , energie baden-wuerttemberg , e.on and rwe – are secretly hoping the country follows the european trend and delay deadlines for shutting their reactors , says pfaffenberger .
their problem would also be solved if the opposition christian democratic party , which wants to keep nuclear energy around longer , boots out the chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s red-green coalition government in the 2006 federal elections .
“ they are hoping that day comes but they don ’ t want to say it because it would decrease the likelihood of it happening , ” pfaffenberger says .
environmentalists say they should instead be focusing on developing their renewable energy technology .
the gradual transition from nuclear power will be covered by a temporary combination of coal , wind and gas power , according to the environment ministry .
eventually , coal will be phase out as new energy sources like the geo-thermic plant that opened in northeastern germany this week , become economicallly viable .
“ we just can ’ t switch our energy sources from today to tomorrow , ” says björn pieprzyk , of the association for renewable energy . “ but the direction has to be right . ”
the growing power of wind germany has so far favored wind over other renewable energy resources .
the more than 12,000 wind turbines that dot the german countryside in the north and southwest of the country are indirectly subsidized by the government .
the early subsidies have helped mid-sized german companies become worldwide leaders in the wind market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ wind is already a classic energy source , even if some don ’ t see it , or want to see it , ” says andreas düser , whose company enercon is second in the worldwide market and has production plants in sweden , brazil and india .
the green party has high hopes for additional renewable energy sources , eventually wanting them to increase their current eight percent share of the german electricity market to 20 percent by 2020 .
critics want energy puzzle solved “ we want a broad palette of renewable energies .
micro-turbines , solar technology , and so on , ” says hustedt .
“ but it is difficult to predict , ” what will take off economically .
the economic uncertainty on what renewable energy source will take off when has only added fuel to the argument of the phase-out naysayers .
though the transition from nuclear power is only just beginning , skeptics say germany needs to have a better concept of what makes up the rest of the energy puzzle .
if the greens increase renewable energy to 20 percent , " you still have 80 percent you need to take care of , and no nuclear energy , " says pfaffenberger , co-author of a book on power supply .
" up until now , people have n't been worried ... and who looks 10 years into the future anyway ?
but the experts are annoyed that we have n't found an alternative yet , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy storm turns to a breeze after weeks of discord in germany ’ s coalition government over the future of the nation ’ s energy supply , ministers from both camps are working together to reach a compromise on traditional and renewable forms of energy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.11.2003 germany backs down on eu military hq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer is heading to washington next week for talks .
german foreign minister joschka fischer on thursday distanced berlin from plans to create eu military headquarters separate from nato .
the proposal had created tension with washington . in a move likely to be seen as an olive branch in the continuing smoothing of relations between germany and the united states , the german government has softened its stance on the creation of a large and independent military planning headquarters for eu-led military operations . " i do not believe you need another big operational headquarters such as -lrb- nato ’ s planning arm -rrb- shape , " said joschka fischer , the german foreign minister .
" you have a nato planning headquarters , and there are headquarters in britain , france and germany . " the conciliatory message from berlin makes it almost certain that germany will support a more modest alternative to the proposed eu headquarters in brussels that will not compete with or duplicate existing or future nato facilities .
eight months to make u-turn germany ’ s new position is in direct contrast to that taken in april when the subject was first mooted at a meeting with france , luxembourg and belgium .
the so-called " mini summit , " especially the claim from the four nations that the eu 's defense and security policy should be backed up by an independent military planning headquarters , upset london and washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us and uk fear nato duplication .
britain and the united states quickly dismissed the proposals , fearing the creation of such a headquarters would not only compete with nato but would also create autonomous european defense structures which would undermine the transatlantic alliance .
operational planning staff still needed despite the change in tone coming from berlin on thursday , german and french officials remain committed to having some operational planning capability in brussels , where the eu 's military staff is involved only in strategic planning .
javier solana , the eu foreign policy chief and the man also responsible for the bloc 's defense and security policy , has also voiced his support for such a move .
fischer ’ s remarks seem to have been well-planned and delivered as part of a two-pronged strategy aimed at continuing the mending of relations with washington . german-american ties were badly damaged during the run-up to the u.s.-led war against iraq , which berlin strongly opposed . reconciliation continues fischer will travel to the united states next week to meet with u.s. secretary of state colin powell and national security adviser condoleezza rice in washington .
meanwhile , german chancellor gerhard schröder will hold discussions in new york with u.s. business leaders on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the mood improving across the atlantic , the germans will also be anxious to secure britain 's support on eu security issues at the intergovernmental conference negotiations that could give europe 's defense policy a push forward .
london ’ s stance has also softened in recent weeks and it looks possible that a compromise can be found at the negotiations .
british prime minister tony blair will reiterate the british suggestion that a separate eu planning center is created in mons near brussels , in order to maintain maximum links between nato and the eu 's defense forces . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu meeting to discuss joint security and defense foreign ministers of the european union are scheduled to meet on the picturesque greek island of rhodes on friday for some tough talking about defense , iraq and the middle east .

starting this year , germans who want to become undertakers can receive a formal education for the job .
while thousands of young people are still looking for apprenticeships , 75 have already signed up for the program . christiane hossdorf found her dream job while still in high school .
the 19-year-old interned at a funeral home and decided she wanted to work in the field .

she 's not disgusted by handling bodies .
hossdorf can only think of one situation where she 'd be hesitant to do her job : burying a child is not something she 's looking forward to .
" i 'd let others do that for now and just watch them , " she said .
a job independent of economic cycles the young woman is lucky to have found an apprenticeship - 24,000 germans are still on the look-out this year and the government is now considering fining companies unwilling to train people . the funeral business is a stable one , " independent of economic cycles " , as the federal association of german undertakers states in a leaflet .
people die , no matter what happens .
last year , 842,000 germans were buried or cremated and anyone training to become an undertaker stands a good chance of landing a job afterwards . but while some of hossdorf 's friends are fascinated by what she 's doing , others still ca n't understand why she chose her line of work . still a men 's world " some think i 'm crazy , " she said .
" they ask me : ' why are you doing this ?
these people just go crazy in their heads , because they constantly have to deal with mourners . " ' her parents initially did n't like the idea , either .

hossdorf said she does n't want to limit her work to helping relatives organize funerals and deal with the necessary paperwork .
she hopes to help them deal with emotional issues as well . to learn how to do that , hossdorf attends school every couple of weeks during her three-year apprenticeship .
besides embalming , business management and funeral logistics , subjects there include the psychology of mourning , counseling , and the funeral customs and rites of various religions . hossdorf 's boss , elke birghölzer , has organized a hindu funeral , which required a special permit , because german law prohibits open caskets during funeral services .
she 's more familiar with muslim funerals , where ritual washings of the body are required and the grave site needs to be permanent and not limited to 25 years - the standard in germany . " when you bury people of russian orthodox faith , it 's customary to have a sip of vodka at the grave , " birghölzer said .

german foreign minister joschka fischer on thursday distanced berlin from plans to create eu military headquarters separate from nato .
the proposal had created tension with washington . in a move likely to be seen as an olive branch in the continuing smoothing of relations between germany and the united states , the german government has softened its stance on the creation of a large and independent military planning headquarters for eu-led military operations . " i do not believe you need another big operational headquarters such as -lrb- nato ’ s planning arm -rrb- shape , " said joschka fischer , the german foreign minister .
" you have a nato planning headquarters , and there are headquarters in britain , france and germany . " the conciliatory message from berlin makes it almost certain that germany will support a more modest alternative to the proposed eu headquarters in brussels that will not compete with or duplicate existing or future nato facilities .

european commission president romano prodi caused waves in italy by issuing a political manifesto seen as signaling a desire to return to domestic politics – now , the ripple effect has reached brussels . earlier this week , prodi circulated a 55-page page manifesto on the future of europe and the leftist parties in italy . entitled “ europe : the dream , the choices , ” the document urges italy ’ s center-left parties , referred to as the “ olive tree ” bloc after former italian prime minister prodi ’ s own 1996 center-left coalition government , to unite and run under a single banner in next year ’ s european parliament elections . the european commission denied on wednesday that prodi wants to step back into the fray of italian politics , and said he would stay in his post as head of the brussels executive until his term ends next year . rivalry with berlusconi but the move has caused many of prodi ’ s colleagues in the european commission to wonder what provoked the normally reserved economics professor from bologna to release such a document .
they suspect that it has to do with the ongoing rivalry between prodi and italy ’ s current prime minister , silvio berlusconi . seven years ago , prodi chased the effusive businessman out of office , only to watch him return to power in 2001 . since july , when berlusconi took over the rotating presidency of the european union , the two political arch-enemies have clashed several times . berlusconi drew the ire of the commission when this summer he compared german member of the european parliament , martin schulz to a nazi concentration camp guard . berlusconi also surprised the brussels executive by inviting russia and israel to join the european union . earlier this month , prodi disowned berlusconi ’ s views on russia ’ s handling of the arrest of yukos ceo mikhail khodorkovsky and its behaviour in chechnya , only a day after berlusconi publicly praised russian president vladimir putin . not electioneering now it ’ s prodi ’ s turn to come under criticism from the very body he heads . in his defense , european commission spokesman gerassimor thomas said prodi ’ s manifesto was not an attempt to enter italian politics . “ as far as i ’ m aware there isn ’ t a manifesto , but a document presented by prodi containing the president ’ s vision of the future of europe , ” he said in a briefing . he added that prodi drafted the document as a private person , not as the commission ’ s president . in the document – which is currently only available in italian – prodi discusses alternatives to italy ’ s present conservative coalition under berlusconi . he also alleges that italy ’ s media are being increasingly manipulated by the prime minister , who is also a billionaire media tycoon . the bitter rivalry between prodi and berlusconi is now being fought out in the ranks of the european parliament . pat cox , the parliament ’ s president , said he wants to hear an explanation from prodi . “ mr. cox feels that there is a question to be answered .

starting this year , germans who want to become undertakers can receive a formal education for the job .
while thousands of young people are still looking for apprenticeships , 75 have already signed up for the program . christiane hossdorf found her dream job while still in high school .
the 19-year-old interned at a funeral home and decided she wanted to work in the field .
she does n't fear the sight of people who died in traffic accidents .
she 's not disgusted by handling bodies .
hossdorf can only think of one situation where she 'd be hesitant to do her job : burying a child is not something she 's looking forward to .
" i 'd let others do that for now and just watch them , " she said .
a job independent of economic cycles the young woman is lucky to have found an apprenticeship - 24,000 germans are still on the look-out this year and the government is now considering fining companies unwilling to train people . the funeral business is a stable one , " independent of economic cycles " , as the federal association of german undertakers states in a leaflet .
people die , no matter what happens .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.11.2003 germany backs down on eu military hq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer is heading to washington next week for talks .
german foreign minister joschka fischer on thursday distanced berlin from plans to create eu military headquarters separate from nato .
the proposal had created tension with washington . in a move likely to be seen as an olive branch in the continuing smoothing of relations between germany and the united states , the german government has softened its stance on the creation of a large and independent military planning headquarters for eu-led military operations . " i do not believe you need another big operational headquarters such as -lrb- nato ’ s planning arm -rrb- shape , " said joschka fischer , the german foreign minister .
" you have a nato planning headquarters , and there are headquarters in britain , france and germany . " the conciliatory message from berlin makes it almost certain that germany will support a more modest alternative to the proposed eu headquarters in brussels that will not compete with or duplicate existing or future nato facilities .
eight months to make u-turn germany ’ s new position is in direct contrast to that taken in april when the subject was first mooted at a meeting with france , luxembourg and belgium .
the so-called " mini summit , " especially the claim from the four nations that the eu 's defense and security policy should be backed up by an independent military planning headquarters , upset london and washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us and uk fear nato duplication .
britain and the united states quickly dismissed the proposals , fearing the creation of such a headquarters would not only compete with nato but would also create autonomous european defense structures which would undermine the transatlantic alliance .
operational planning staff still needed despite the change in tone coming from berlin on thursday , german and french officials remain committed to having some operational planning capability in brussels , where the eu 's military staff is involved only in strategic planning .
javier solana , the eu foreign policy chief and the man also responsible for the bloc 's defense and security policy , has also voiced his support for such a move .
fischer ’ s remarks seem to have been well-planned and delivered as part of a two-pronged strategy aimed at continuing the mending of relations with washington . german-american ties were badly damaged during the run-up to the u.s.-led war against iraq , which berlin strongly opposed . reconciliation continues fischer will travel to the united states next week to meet with u.s. secretary of state colin powell and national security adviser condoleezza rice in washington .
meanwhile , german chancellor gerhard schröder will hold discussions in new york with u.s. business leaders on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the mood improving across the atlantic , the germans will also be anxious to secure britain 's support on eu security issues at the intergovernmental conference negotiations that could give europe 's defense policy a push forward .
london ’ s stance has also softened in recent weeks and it looks possible that a compromise can be found at the negotiations .
british prime minister tony blair will reiterate the british suggestion that a separate eu planning center is created in mons near brussels , in order to maintain maximum links between nato and the eu 's defense forces . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu meeting to discuss joint security and defense foreign ministers of the european union are scheduled to meet on the picturesque greek island of rhodes on friday for some tough talking about defense , iraq and the middle east .

european commission president romano prodi caused waves in italy by issuing a political manifesto seen as signaling a desire to return to domestic politics – now , the ripple effect has reached brussels . earlier this week , prodi circulated a 55-page page manifesto on the future of europe and the leftist parties in italy . entitled “ europe : the dream , the choices , ” the document urges italy ’ s center-left parties , referred to as the “ olive tree ” bloc after former italian prime minister prodi ’ s own 1996 center-left coalition government , to unite and run under a single banner in next year ’ s european parliament elections . the european commission denied on wednesday that prodi wants to step back into the fray of italian politics , and said he would stay in his post as head of the brussels executive until his term ends next year . rivalry with berlusconi but the move has caused many of prodi ’ s colleagues in the european commission to wonder what provoked the normally reserved economics professor from bologna to release such a document .
they suspect that it has to do with the ongoing rivalry between prodi and italy ’ s current prime minister , silvio berlusconi . seven years ago , prodi chased the effusive businessman out of office , only to watch him return to power in 2001 . since july , when berlusconi took over the rotating presidency of the european union , the two political arch-enemies have clashed several times . berlusconi drew the ire of the commission when this summer he compared german member of the european parliament , martin schulz to a nazi concentration camp guard . berlusconi also surprised the brussels executive by inviting russia and israel to join the european union . earlier this month , prodi disowned berlusconi ’ s views on russia ’ s handling of the arrest of yukos ceo mikhail khodorkovsky and its behaviour in chechnya , only a day after berlusconi publicly praised russian president vladimir putin . not electioneering now it ’ s prodi ’ s turn to come under criticism from the very body he heads . in his defense , european commission spokesman gerassimor thomas said prodi ’ s manifesto was not an attempt to enter italian politics . “ as far as i ’ m aware there isn ’ t a manifesto , but a document presented by prodi containing the president ’ s vision of the future of europe , ” he said in a briefing . he added that prodi drafted the document as a private person , not as the commission ’ s president . in the document – which is currently only available in italian – prodi discusses alternatives to italy ’ s present conservative coalition under berlusconi . he also alleges that italy ’ s media are being increasingly manipulated by the prime minister , who is also a billionaire media tycoon . the bitter rivalry between prodi and berlusconi is now being fought out in the ranks of the european parliament . pat cox , the parliament ’ s president , said he wants to hear an explanation from prodi . “ mr. cox feels that there is a question to be answered .
we want to know exactly what is going on , ” cox ’ s spokesman , david harley , told the reuters news agency . german european parliament member , markus ferber of the conservative christian democratic union reacted angrily to prodi ’ s document .
“ prodi can not dance at two weddings at the same time , ” he said in a statement . another german mep from the conservative faction , hans-gert pöttering , told an italian newspaper that prodi should maintain neutrality and not get mixed up in domestic politics . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi refutes apology for nazi remark did he or didn ’ t he apologize ?

they suspect that it has to do with the ongoing rivalry between prodi and italy ’ s current prime minister , silvio berlusconi . seven years ago , prodi chased the effusive businessman out of office , only to watch him return to power in 2001 . since july , when berlusconi took over the rotating presidency of the european union , the two political arch-enemies have clashed several times . berlusconi drew the ire of the commission when this summer he compared german member of the european parliament , martin schulz to a nazi concentration camp guard . berlusconi also surprised the brussels executive by inviting russia and israel to join the european union . earlier this month , prodi disowned berlusconi ’ s views on russia ’ s handling of the arrest of yukos ceo mikhail khodorkovsky and its behaviour in chechnya , only a day after berlusconi publicly praised russian president vladimir putin . not electioneering now it ’ s prodi ’ s turn to come under criticism from the very body he heads . in his defense , european commission spokesman gerassimor thomas said prodi ’ s manifesto was not an attempt to enter italian politics . “ as far as i ’ m aware there isn ’ t a manifesto , but a document presented by prodi containing the president ’ s vision of the future of europe , ” he said in a briefing . he added that prodi drafted the document as a private person , not as the commission ’ s president . in the document – which is currently only available in italian – prodi discusses alternatives to italy ’ s present conservative coalition under berlusconi . he also alleges that italy ’ s media are being increasingly manipulated by the prime minister , who is also a billionaire media tycoon . the bitter rivalry between prodi and berlusconi is now being fought out in the ranks of the european parliament . pat cox , the parliament ’ s president , said he wants to hear an explanation from prodi . “ mr. cox feels that there is a question to be answered .
we want to know exactly what is going on , ” cox ’ s spokesman , david harley , told the reuters news agency . german european parliament member , markus ferber of the conservative christian democratic union reacted angrily to prodi ’ s document .
“ prodi can not dance at two weddings at the same time , ” he said in a statement . another german mep from the conservative faction , hans-gert pöttering , told an italian newspaper that prodi should maintain neutrality and not get mixed up in domestic politics . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi refutes apology for nazi remark did he or didn ’ t he apologize ?

starting this year , germans who want to become undertakers can receive a formal education for the job .
while thousands of young people are still looking for apprenticeships , 75 have already signed up for the program . christiane hossdorf found her dream job while still in high school .
the 19-year-old interned at a funeral home and decided she wanted to work in the field .
she does n't fear the sight of people who died in traffic accidents .
she 's not disgusted by handling bodies .
hossdorf can only think of one situation where she 'd be hesitant to do her job : burying a child is not something she 's looking forward to .
" i 'd let others do that for now and just watch them , " she said .
a job independent of economic cycles the young woman is lucky to have found an apprenticeship - 24,000 germans are still on the look-out this year and the government is now considering fining companies unwilling to train people . the funeral business is a stable one , " independent of economic cycles " , as the federal association of german undertakers states in a leaflet .
people die , no matter what happens .
last year , 842,000 germans were buried or cremated and anyone training to become an undertaker stands a good chance of landing a job afterwards . but while some of hossdorf 's friends are fascinated by what she 's doing , others still ca n't understand why she chose her line of work . still a men 's world " some think i 'm crazy , " she said .
" they ask me : ' why are you doing this ?
these people just go crazy in their heads , because they constantly have to deal with mourners . " ' her parents initially did n't like the idea , either .
they feared she would not be able to deal with the psychological pressure .
hossdorf also gets asked over and over again why she 's chosen a job that 's still done mainly by men . " people tell me : ' that 's a man 's job and people don ’ t like to see women do it , " ' hossdorf said .
" i see things differently .
there are women who become roofers .
sure , some bodies weigh a little more and i have to stop and rest once in a while , but it always works out somehow . " psychology of mourning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish cemetary in berlin .
graves here can not be reused .
hossdorf said she does n't want to limit her work to helping relatives organize funerals and deal with the necessary paperwork .
she hopes to help them deal with emotional issues as well . to learn how to do that , hossdorf attends school every couple of weeks during her three-year apprenticeship .
besides embalming , business management and funeral logistics , subjects there include the psychology of mourning , counseling , and the funeral customs and rites of various religions . hossdorf 's boss , elke birghölzer , has organized a hindu funeral , which required a special permit , because german law prohibits open caskets during funeral services .
she 's more familiar with muslim funerals , where ritual washings of the body are required and the grave site needs to be permanent and not limited to 25 years - the standard in germany . " when you bury people of russian orthodox faith , it 's customary to have a sip of vodka at the grave , " birghölzer said .
" undertakers have to be prepared for that . " a new benchmark for quality funerals a formal preparation for the job has been lacking until now .
while most german tradesmen still have to pass exams to start working , the funeral industry had no universally accepted standard of training . " a baker could become an undertaker , " birghölzer said . " all he had to do was to put a few coffins in his store . " the new training program is therefore also expected to ensure a certain quality level common to all funeral homes .
but it wo n't be a requirement for working as an undertaker : the baker can still bury people should he choose to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bikers carry the coffin of austrian pop singer falco in 1998 : ensuring quality funerals independet of customers ' special requests is the goal of the new training program for undertakers .

starting this year , germans who want to become undertakers can receive a formal education for the job .
while thousands of young people are still looking for apprenticeships , 75 have already signed up for the program . christiane hossdorf found her dream job while still in high school .
the 19-year-old interned at a funeral home and decided she wanted to work in the field .
she does n't fear the sight of people who died in traffic accidents .
she 's not disgusted by handling bodies .
hossdorf can only think of one situation where she 'd be hesitant to do her job : burying a child is not something she 's looking forward to .
" i 'd let others do that for now and just watch them , " she said .
a job independent of economic cycles the young woman is lucky to have found an apprenticeship - 24,000 germans are still on the look-out this year and the government is now considering fining companies unwilling to train people . the funeral business is a stable one , " independent of economic cycles " , as the federal association of german undertakers states in a leaflet .
people die , no matter what happens .
last year , 842,000 germans were buried or cremated and anyone training to become an undertaker stands a good chance of landing a job afterwards . but while some of hossdorf 's friends are fascinated by what she 's doing , others still ca n't understand why she chose her line of work . still a men 's world " some think i 'm crazy , " she said .
" they ask me : ' why are you doing this ?
these people just go crazy in their heads , because they constantly have to deal with mourners . " ' her parents initially did n't like the idea , either .
they feared she would not be able to deal with the psychological pressure .
hossdorf also gets asked over and over again why she 's chosen a job that 's still done mainly by men . " people tell me : ' that 's a man 's job and people don ’ t like to see women do it , " ' hossdorf said .
" i see things differently .
there are women who become roofers .
sure , some bodies weigh a little more and i have to stop and rest once in a while , but it always works out somehow . " psychology of mourning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish cemetary in berlin .
graves here can not be reused .
hossdorf said she does n't want to limit her work to helping relatives organize funerals and deal with the necessary paperwork .
she hopes to help them deal with emotional issues as well . to learn how to do that , hossdorf attends school every couple of weeks during her three-year apprenticeship .
besides embalming , business management and funeral logistics , subjects there include the psychology of mourning , counseling , and the funeral customs and rites of various religions . hossdorf 's boss , elke birghölzer , has organized a hindu funeral , which required a special permit , because german law prohibits open caskets during funeral services .
she 's more familiar with muslim funerals , where ritual washings of the body are required and the grave site needs to be permanent and not limited to 25 years - the standard in germany . " when you bury people of russian orthodox faith , it 's customary to have a sip of vodka at the grave , " birghölzer said .
" undertakers have to be prepared for that . " a new benchmark for quality funerals a formal preparation for the job has been lacking until now .
while most german tradesmen still have to pass exams to start working , the funeral industry had no universally accepted standard of training . " a baker could become an undertaker , " birghölzer said . " all he had to do was to put a few coffins in his store . " the new training program is therefore also expected to ensure a certain quality level common to all funeral homes .
but it wo n't be a requirement for working as an undertaker : the baker can still bury people should he choose to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bikers carry the coffin of austrian pop singer falco in 1998 : ensuring quality funerals independet of customers ' special requests is the goal of the new training program for undertakers .
" everyone with a business license can open a funeral home , " rolf fichtner , the executive director of the federal association of german undertakers , said .
" that 's as far as the law is concerned .
but basically it wo n't be possible any longer to work as an undertaker without formal training or a certain quality of service . " christiane lammert send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de skeletons in the backyard ?

martin hohmann , the parliamentarian who called jews a " race of perpetrators " in a speech , was expelled from his parliamentary group on friday .
christian democratic union leaders also plan to revoke his party membership . " it 's a difficult day for everyone , " said cdu party leader angela merkel shortly after friday morning 's vote .
minutes earlier , 195 of the parliamentary group 's 248 members had voted to expel hohmann , ensuring a two-thirds majority necessary for the move . " the result is unambiguous , " merkel said , adding that the expulsion was the right thing to do from a political standpoint . futile final plea by hohmann , supporters a last-ditch attempt by hohmann to avoid the expulsion obviously had no effect on the vote .
in an explanation to the parliamentary group , he said he had apologized several times , and was prepared to do anything he could to heal the wounds he had caused .
in the explanation , published by a newspaper in hohmann 's central german hometown of fulda , he said he had not described jews as " a race of perpetrators , " but that the media had taken his words out of context .
cdu leaders said they had given hohmann several chances to apologize and retract his statements before pushing for a vote to expel him .
while willing to apologize , hohmann allegedly said he would only do so for tactical reasons to keep his group and party membership and not because he had changed his views on the matter , party officials revealed .
jewish leaders have complained about hohmann on a number of occassions and media reported this week that he had given speeches of a similar tone in the past . hohmann 's supporters also tried one more time to sway parliamentarians .
on friday , they called for a " critical solidarity " with hohmann in ads in national newspapers .
several of the 26 people who signed the appeal to party leaders have made right extremist remarks in the past . expulsion a first for german conservatives hohmann 's expulsion is a first for the cdu and her sister party , the bavarian christian social union .
group leaders expressed their disappointment that 28 parliamentarians had voted against the expulsion - 16 others abstained , four votes were invalid and five mps were absent .

" i 'd wished for a different result , " wolfgang bosbach , a deputy group leader , said .
angela merkel explained the opposing votes as a reflection of people 's personal sympathies for hohmann rather than an implicit endorsement of his remarks .

hohmann said that primarily jewish bolsheviks were responsible for crimes committed against civilians during the russian revolution .
he then went on to compare what he claimed was bloodshed orchestrated by jews in russia in the early 1900s with the murder of europe ’ s jews by the nazis in the third reich .
" jews were active in great numbers in the leadership as well as in the soviet secret police firing squads , " hohmann told constituents in his hometown of neuhof .
" thus one could describe jews with some justification as a tätervolk -lsb- roughly translated as race of perpetrators -rsb- . "
although he admitted in his speech that such a comparison " may sound horrible , " hohmann said it followed the " same logic with which one describes the germans as a race of perpetrators . "
the contents of that speech became highly publicized after a public television station broadcast a report on it .
it sparked a national debate about anti-semitic sentiment among german politicians and military leaders .

germany 's future is looking a lot greener with the closure of the stade nuclear reactor power plant on friday .
but critics of germany 's ambitious nuclear phase-out law say the country still needs atomic energy . there will be no cermonial shut-off switch for environment minister jürgen trittin to flick when the stade nuclear power plant in northern germany goes offline on friday , but chances are the champagne corks will be popping in the green party headquarters this evening .
with the early closure of the country 's second-oldest nuclear reactor , germany will take the first step of an ambitious nuclear phase-out law engineered by the greens three years ago .
“ it ’ s of course wonderful , and the first of many , ” said michaela hustedt , the greens ' environmental expert in an interview .
under the 2002 law , germany ’ s 19 nuclear reactors will close down after reaching 32 years of operation .
stade is the first reactor to be removed from the grid .
when the last reactor goes off the grid in around 2020 , nuclear and coal power , which currently provide the country with 80 percent of its electricity , will have bowed out in favor of renewable energy .
but the plan is coming under increasing criticism from energy companies and opposition politicians , who say the prohibitive cost of renewable energy and recent blackouts in the united states prove the country still needs its nuclear plants .
“ looking at it technically , renewable energy can ’ t cover as our basic source of energy , ” said peter poppe , a spokesman for vatenfall europe , one of the four utility companies to agree on the “ nuclear consensus ” in 2000 .
“ the sun , we all know , isn ’ t a regular in germany and the wind , as it says in the bible , the wind blows where it wants to . ”
other countries holding off of nuclear power nuclear reactors , though heavily subsidized by the government , still provide the more stable form of energy , say phase-out opponents .
across europe countries that have sworn off nuclear energy , like spain , italy , the netherlands and belgium , continue to rely heavily on their reactors .
sweden which decided to phase out nuclear power in 1980 , has so far taken only one reactor off the grid and has been hesitating recently on shutting down the second .
with the kyoto protocol requiring countries in the future to keep carbon emissions like those from coal-burning plants down , german energy experts are concerned that the country won ’ t have a stable source of power to make up for the 40,000 megawatts in power lost when plants go off the grid in the coming 20 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preussen-elektra coal fired power plant , grosskrotzenburg-hessen , germany “ you either phase-out nuclear energy , or you reduce greenhouse gas emissions , but you can ’ t do both , ” says wolfgang pfaffenberger , director of the bremen energy insitute .
energy companies hoping for delay germany ’ s big four energy companies – vatenfall , energie baden-wuerttemberg , e.on and rwe – are secretly hoping the country follows the european trend and delay deadlines for shutting their reactors , says pfaffenberger .
their problem would also be solved if the opposition christian democratic party , which wants to keep nuclear energy around longer , boots out the chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s red-green coalition government in the 2006 federal elections .
“ they are hoping that day comes but they don ’ t want to say it because it would decrease the likelihood of it happening , ” pfaffenberger says .
environmentalists say they should instead be focusing on developing their renewable energy technology .
the gradual transition from nuclear power will be covered by a temporary combination of coal , wind and gas power , according to the environment ministry .
eventually , coal will be phase out as new energy sources like the geo-thermic plant that opened in northeastern germany this week , become economicallly viable .
“ we just can ’ t switch our energy sources from today to tomorrow , ” says björn pieprzyk , of the association for renewable energy . “ but the direction has to be right . ”
the growing power of wind germany has so far favored wind over other renewable energy resources .
the more than 12,000 wind turbines that dot the german countryside in the north and southwest of the country are indirectly subsidized by the government .
the early subsidies have helped mid-sized german companies become worldwide leaders in the wind market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ wind is already a classic energy source , even if some don ’ t see it , or want to see it , ” says andreas düser , whose company enercon is second in the worldwide market and has production plants in sweden , brazil and india .
the green party has high hopes for additional renewable energy sources , eventually wanting them to increase their current eight percent share of the german electricity market to 20 percent by 2020 .
critics want energy puzzle solved “ we want a broad palette of renewable energies .
micro-turbines , solar technology , and so on , ” says hustedt .
“ but it is difficult to predict , ” what will take off economically .
the economic uncertainty on what renewable energy source will take off when has only added fuel to the argument of the phase-out naysayers .
though the transition from nuclear power is only just beginning , skeptics say germany needs to have a better concept of what makes up the rest of the energy puzzle .
if the greens increase renewable energy to 20 percent , " you still have 80 percent you need to take care of , and no nuclear energy , " says pfaffenberger , co-author of a book on power supply .
" up until now , people have n't been worried ... and who looks 10 years into the future anyway ?
but the experts are annoyed that we have n't found an alternative yet , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy storm turns to a breeze after weeks of discord in germany ’ s coalition government over the future of the nation ’ s energy supply , ministers from both camps are working together to reach a compromise on traditional and renewable forms of energy .

germany 's future is looking a lot greener with the closure of the stade nuclear reactor power plant on friday .
but critics of germany 's ambitious nuclear phase-out law say the country still needs atomic energy . there will be no cermonial shut-off switch for environment minister jürgen trittin to flick when the stade nuclear power plant in northern germany goes offline on friday , but chances are the champagne corks will be popping in the green party headquarters this evening .
with the early closure of the country 's second-oldest nuclear reactor , germany will take the first step of an ambitious nuclear phase-out law engineered by the greens three years ago .
“ it ’ s of course wonderful , and the first of many , ” said michaela hustedt , the greens ' environmental expert in an interview .
under the 2002 law , germany ’ s 19 nuclear reactors will close down after reaching 32 years of operation .
stade is the first reactor to be removed from the grid .
when the last reactor goes off the grid in around 2020 , nuclear and coal power , which currently provide the country with 80 percent of its electricity , will have bowed out in favor of renewable energy .
but the plan is coming under increasing criticism from energy companies and opposition politicians , who say the prohibitive cost of renewable energy and recent blackouts in the united states prove the country still needs its nuclear plants .
“ looking at it technically , renewable energy can ’ t cover as our basic source of energy , ” said peter poppe , a spokesman for vatenfall europe , one of the four utility companies to agree on the “ nuclear consensus ” in 2000 .
“ the sun , we all know , isn ’ t a regular in germany and the wind , as it says in the bible , the wind blows where it wants to . ”
other countries holding off of nuclear power nuclear reactors , though heavily subsidized by the government , still provide the more stable form of energy , say phase-out opponents .
across europe countries that have sworn off nuclear energy , like spain , italy , the netherlands and belgium , continue to rely heavily on their reactors .
sweden which decided to phase out nuclear power in 1980 , has so far taken only one reactor off the grid and has been hesitating recently on shutting down the second .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.11.2003 germany backs down on eu military hq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer is heading to washington next week for talks .
german foreign minister joschka fischer on thursday distanced berlin from plans to create eu military headquarters separate from nato .
the proposal had created tension with washington . in a move likely to be seen as an olive branch in the continuing smoothing of relations between germany and the united states , the german government has softened its stance on the creation of a large and independent military planning headquarters for eu-led military operations . " i do not believe you need another big operational headquarters such as -lrb- nato ’ s planning arm -rrb- shape , " said joschka fischer , the german foreign minister .
" you have a nato planning headquarters , and there are headquarters in britain , france and germany . " the conciliatory message from berlin makes it almost certain that germany will support a more modest alternative to the proposed eu headquarters in brussels that will not compete with or duplicate existing or future nato facilities .
eight months to make u-turn germany ’ s new position is in direct contrast to that taken in april when the subject was first mooted at a meeting with france , luxembourg and belgium .
the so-called " mini summit , " especially the claim from the four nations that the eu 's defense and security policy should be backed up by an independent military planning headquarters , upset london and washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us and uk fear nato duplication .
britain and the united states quickly dismissed the proposals , fearing the creation of such a headquarters would not only compete with nato but would also create autonomous european defense structures which would undermine the transatlantic alliance .
operational planning staff still needed despite the change in tone coming from berlin on thursday , german and french officials remain committed to having some operational planning capability in brussels , where the eu 's military staff is involved only in strategic planning .
javier solana , the eu foreign policy chief and the man also responsible for the bloc 's defense and security policy , has also voiced his support for such a move .
fischer ’ s remarks seem to have been well-planned and delivered as part of a two-pronged strategy aimed at continuing the mending of relations with washington . german-american ties were badly damaged during the run-up to the u.s.-led war against iraq , which berlin strongly opposed . reconciliation continues fischer will travel to the united states next week to meet with u.s. secretary of state colin powell and national security adviser condoleezza rice in washington .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 14.11.2003 prodi raises profile at home , anger in brussels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romani prodi denies he wants to enter italian politics .
european commission president romano prodi caused waves in italy by issuing a political manifesto seen as signaling a desire to return to domestic politics – now , the ripple effect has reached brussels . earlier this week , prodi circulated a 55-page page manifesto on the future of europe and the leftist parties in italy . entitled “ europe : the dream , the choices , ” the document urges italy ’ s center-left parties , referred to as the “ olive tree ” bloc after former italian prime minister prodi ’ s own 1996 center-left coalition government , to unite and run under a single banner in next year ’ s european parliament elections . the european commission denied on wednesday that prodi wants to step back into the fray of italian politics , and said he would stay in his post as head of the brussels executive until his term ends next year . rivalry with berlusconi but the move has caused many of prodi ’ s colleagues in the european commission to wonder what provoked the normally reserved economics professor from bologna to release such a document .
they suspect that it has to do with the ongoing rivalry between prodi and italy ’ s current prime minister , silvio berlusconi . seven years ago , prodi chased the effusive businessman out of office , only to watch him return to power in 2001 . since july , when berlusconi took over the rotating presidency of the european union , the two political arch-enemies have clashed several times . berlusconi drew the ire of the commission when this summer he compared german member of the european parliament , martin schulz to a nazi concentration camp guard . berlusconi also surprised the brussels executive by inviting russia and israel to join the european union . earlier this month , prodi disowned berlusconi ’ s views on russia ’ s handling of the arrest of yukos ceo mikhail khodorkovsky and its behaviour in chechnya , only a day after berlusconi publicly praised russian president vladimir putin . not electioneering now it ’ s prodi ’ s turn to come under criticism from the very body he heads . in his defense , european commission spokesman gerassimor thomas said prodi ’ s manifesto was not an attempt to enter italian politics . “ as far as i ’ m aware there isn ’ t a manifesto , but a document presented by prodi containing the president ’ s vision of the future of europe , ” he said in a briefing . he added that prodi drafted the document as a private person , not as the commission ’ s president . in the document – which is currently only available in italian – prodi discusses alternatives to italy ’ s present conservative coalition under berlusconi . he also alleges that italy ’ s media are being increasingly manipulated by the prime minister , who is also a billionaire media tycoon . the bitter rivalry between prodi and berlusconi is now being fought out in the ranks of the european parliament . pat cox , the parliament ’ s president , said he wants to hear an explanation from prodi . “ mr. cox feels that there is a question to be answered .
we want to know exactly what is going on , ” cox ’ s spokesman , david harley , told the reuters news agency . german european parliament member , markus ferber of the conservative christian democratic union reacted angrily to prodi ’ s document .
“ prodi can not dance at two weddings at the same time , ” he said in a statement . another german mep from the conservative faction , hans-gert pöttering , told an italian newspaper that prodi should maintain neutrality and not get mixed up in domestic politics . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi refutes apology for nazi remark did he or didn ’ t he apologize ?

martin hohmann , the parliamentarian who called jews a " race of perpetrators " in a speech , was expelled from his parliamentary group on friday .
christian democratic union leaders also plan to revoke his party membership . " it 's a difficult day for everyone , " said cdu party leader angela merkel shortly after friday morning 's vote .
minutes earlier , 195 of the parliamentary group 's 248 members had voted to expel hohmann , ensuring a two-thirds majority necessary for the move . " the result is unambiguous , " merkel said , adding that the expulsion was the right thing to do from a political standpoint . futile final plea by hohmann , supporters a last-ditch attempt by hohmann to avoid the expulsion obviously had no effect on the vote .
in an explanation to the parliamentary group , he said he had apologized several times , and was prepared to do anything he could to heal the wounds he had caused .
in the explanation , published by a newspaper in hohmann 's central german hometown of fulda , he said he had not described jews as " a race of perpetrators , " but that the media had taken his words out of context .
cdu leaders said they had given hohmann several chances to apologize and retract his statements before pushing for a vote to expel him .
while willing to apologize , hohmann allegedly said he would only do so for tactical reasons to keep his group and party membership and not because he had changed his views on the matter , party officials revealed .
jewish leaders have complained about hohmann on a number of occassions and media reported this week that he had given speeches of a similar tone in the past . hohmann 's supporters also tried one more time to sway parliamentarians .
on friday , they called for a " critical solidarity " with hohmann in ads in national newspapers .

hohmann said that primarily jewish bolsheviks were responsible for crimes committed against civilians during the russian revolution .

" jews were active in great numbers in the leadership as well as in the soviet secret police firing squads , " hohmann told constituents in his hometown of neuhof .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.11.2003 germany starts nuclear energy phase-out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stade was germany 's second-oldest nuclear reactor .
germany 's future is looking a lot greener with the closure of the stade nuclear reactor power plant on friday .
but critics of germany 's ambitious nuclear phase-out law say the country still needs atomic energy . there will be no cermonial shut-off switch for environment minister jürgen trittin to flick when the stade nuclear power plant in northern germany goes offline on friday , but chances are the champagne corks will be popping in the green party headquarters this evening .
with the early closure of the country 's second-oldest nuclear reactor , germany will take the first step of an ambitious nuclear phase-out law engineered by the greens three years ago .
“ it ’ s of course wonderful , and the first of many , ” said michaela hustedt , the greens ' environmental expert in an interview .
under the 2002 law , germany ’ s 19 nuclear reactors will close down after reaching 32 years of operation .
stade is the first reactor to be removed from the grid .
when the last reactor goes off the grid in around 2020 , nuclear and coal power , which currently provide the country with 80 percent of its electricity , will have bowed out in favor of renewable energy .
but the plan is coming under increasing criticism from energy companies and opposition politicians , who say the prohibitive cost of renewable energy and recent blackouts in the united states prove the country still needs its nuclear plants .
“ looking at it technically , renewable energy can ’ t cover as our basic source of energy , ” said peter poppe , a spokesman for vatenfall europe , one of the four utility companies to agree on the “ nuclear consensus ” in 2000 .
“ the sun , we all know , isn ’ t a regular in germany and the wind , as it says in the bible , the wind blows where it wants to . ”
other countries holding off of nuclear power nuclear reactors , though heavily subsidized by the government , still provide the more stable form of energy , say phase-out opponents .
across europe countries that have sworn off nuclear energy , like spain , italy , the netherlands and belgium , continue to rely heavily on their reactors .
sweden which decided to phase out nuclear power in 1980 , has so far taken only one reactor off the grid and has been hesitating recently on shutting down the second .
with the kyoto protocol requiring countries in the future to keep carbon emissions like those from coal-burning plants down , german energy experts are concerned that the country won ’ t have a stable source of power to make up for the 40,000 megawatts in power lost when plants go off the grid in the coming 20 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preussen-elektra coal fired power plant , grosskrotzenburg-hessen , germany “ you either phase-out nuclear energy , or you reduce greenhouse gas emissions , but you can ’ t do both , ” says wolfgang pfaffenberger , director of the bremen energy insitute .
energy companies hoping for delay germany ’ s big four energy companies – vatenfall , energie baden-wuerttemberg , e.on and rwe – are secretly hoping the country follows the european trend and delay deadlines for shutting their reactors , says pfaffenberger .
their problem would also be solved if the opposition christian democratic party , which wants to keep nuclear energy around longer , boots out the chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s red-green coalition government in the 2006 federal elections .
“ they are hoping that day comes but they don ’ t want to say it because it would decrease the likelihood of it happening , ” pfaffenberger says .
environmentalists say they should instead be focusing on developing their renewable energy technology .
the gradual transition from nuclear power will be covered by a temporary combination of coal , wind and gas power , according to the environment ministry .
eventually , coal will be phase out as new energy sources like the geo-thermic plant that opened in northeastern germany this week , become economicallly viable .
“ we just can ’ t switch our energy sources from today to tomorrow , ” says björn pieprzyk , of the association for renewable energy . “ but the direction has to be right . ”
the growing power of wind germany has so far favored wind over other renewable energy resources .
the more than 12,000 wind turbines that dot the german countryside in the north and southwest of the country are indirectly subsidized by the government .
the early subsidies have helped mid-sized german companies become worldwide leaders in the wind market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ wind is already a classic energy source , even if some don ’ t see it , or want to see it , ” says andreas düser , whose company enercon is second in the worldwide market and has production plants in sweden , brazil and india .
the green party has high hopes for additional renewable energy sources , eventually wanting them to increase their current eight percent share of the german electricity market to 20 percent by 2020 .
critics want energy puzzle solved “ we want a broad palette of renewable energies .
micro-turbines , solar technology , and so on , ” says hustedt .
“ but it is difficult to predict , ” what will take off economically .
the economic uncertainty on what renewable energy source will take off when has only added fuel to the argument of the phase-out naysayers .
though the transition from nuclear power is only just beginning , skeptics say germany needs to have a better concept of what makes up the rest of the energy puzzle .
if the greens increase renewable energy to 20 percent , " you still have 80 percent you need to take care of , and no nuclear energy , " says pfaffenberger , co-author of a book on power supply .
" up until now , people have n't been worried ... and who looks 10 years into the future anyway ?
but the experts are annoyed that we have n't found an alternative yet , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy storm turns to a breeze after weeks of discord in germany ’ s coalition government over the future of the nation ’ s energy supply , ministers from both camps are working together to reach a compromise on traditional and renewable forms of energy .

germany 's future is looking a lot greener with the closure of the stade nuclear reactor power plant on friday .
but critics of germany 's ambitious nuclear phase-out law say the country still needs atomic energy . there will be no cermonial shut-off switch for environment minister jürgen trittin to flick when the stade nuclear power plant in northern germany goes offline on friday , but chances are the champagne corks will be popping in the green party headquarters this evening .
with the early closure of the country 's second-oldest nuclear reactor , germany will take the first step of an ambitious nuclear phase-out law engineered by the greens three years ago .
“ it ’ s of course wonderful , and the first of many , ” said michaela hustedt , the greens ' environmental expert in an interview .
under the 2002 law , germany ’ s 19 nuclear reactors will close down after reaching 32 years of operation .
stade is the first reactor to be removed from the grid .
when the last reactor goes off the grid in around 2020 , nuclear and coal power , which currently provide the country with 80 percent of its electricity , will have bowed out in favor of renewable energy .
but the plan is coming under increasing criticism from energy companies and opposition politicians , who say the prohibitive cost of renewable energy and recent blackouts in the united states prove the country still needs its nuclear plants .
“ looking at it technically , renewable energy can ’ t cover as our basic source of energy , ” said peter poppe , a spokesman for vatenfall europe , one of the four utility companies to agree on the “ nuclear consensus ” in 2000 .
“ the sun , we all know , isn ’ t a regular in germany and the wind , as it says in the bible , the wind blows where it wants to . ”
other countries holding off of nuclear power nuclear reactors , though heavily subsidized by the government , still provide the more stable form of energy , say phase-out opponents .
across europe countries that have sworn off nuclear energy , like spain , italy , the netherlands and belgium , continue to rely heavily on their reactors .
sweden which decided to phase out nuclear power in 1980 , has so far taken only one reactor off the grid and has been hesitating recently on shutting down the second .
with the kyoto protocol requiring countries in the future to keep carbon emissions like those from coal-burning plants down , german energy experts are concerned that the country won ’ t have a stable source of power to make up for the 40,000 megawatts in power lost when plants go off the grid in the coming 20 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preussen-elektra coal fired power plant , grosskrotzenburg-hessen , germany “ you either phase-out nuclear energy , or you reduce greenhouse gas emissions , but you can ’ t do both , ” says wolfgang pfaffenberger , director of the bremen energy insitute .
energy companies hoping for delay germany ’ s big four energy companies – vatenfall , energie baden-wuerttemberg , e.on and rwe – are secretly hoping the country follows the european trend and delay deadlines for shutting their reactors , says pfaffenberger .
their problem would also be solved if the opposition christian democratic party , which wants to keep nuclear energy around longer , boots out the chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s red-green coalition government in the 2006 federal elections .
“ they are hoping that day comes but they don ’ t want to say it because it would decrease the likelihood of it happening , ” pfaffenberger says .
environmentalists say they should instead be focusing on developing their renewable energy technology .
the gradual transition from nuclear power will be covered by a temporary combination of coal , wind and gas power , according to the environment ministry .
eventually , coal will be phase out as new energy sources like the geo-thermic plant that opened in northeastern germany this week , become economicallly viable .
“ we just can ’ t switch our energy sources from today to tomorrow , ” says björn pieprzyk , of the association for renewable energy . “ but the direction has to be right . ”
the growing power of wind germany has so far favored wind over other renewable energy resources .
the more than 12,000 wind turbines that dot the german countryside in the north and southwest of the country are indirectly subsidized by the government .
the early subsidies have helped mid-sized german companies become worldwide leaders in the wind market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ wind is already a classic energy source , even if some don ’ t see it , or want to see it , ” says andreas düser , whose company enercon is second in the worldwide market and has production plants in sweden , brazil and india .
the green party has high hopes for additional renewable energy sources , eventually wanting them to increase their current eight percent share of the german electricity market to 20 percent by 2020 .
critics want energy puzzle solved “ we want a broad palette of renewable energies .
micro-turbines , solar technology , and so on , ” says hustedt .
“ but it is difficult to predict , ” what will take off economically .
the economic uncertainty on what renewable energy source will take off when has only added fuel to the argument of the phase-out naysayers .
though the transition from nuclear power is only just beginning , skeptics say germany needs to have a better concept of what makes up the rest of the energy puzzle .
if the greens increase renewable energy to 20 percent , " you still have 80 percent you need to take care of , and no nuclear energy , " says pfaffenberger , co-author of a book on power supply .
" up until now , people have n't been worried ... and who looks 10 years into the future anyway ?

starting this year , germans who want to become undertakers can receive a formal education for the job .
while thousands of young people are still looking for apprenticeships , 75 have already signed up for the program . christiane hossdorf found her dream job while still in high school .
the 19-year-old interned at a funeral home and decided she wanted to work in the field .
she does n't fear the sight of people who died in traffic accidents .
she 's not disgusted by handling bodies .
hossdorf can only think of one situation where she 'd be hesitant to do her job : burying a child is not something she 's looking forward to .
" i 'd let others do that for now and just watch them , " she said .
a job independent of economic cycles the young woman is lucky to have found an apprenticeship - 24,000 germans are still on the look-out this year and the government is now considering fining companies unwilling to train people . the funeral business is a stable one , " independent of economic cycles " , as the federal association of german undertakers states in a leaflet .
people die , no matter what happens .
last year , 842,000 germans were buried or cremated and anyone training to become an undertaker stands a good chance of landing a job afterwards . but while some of hossdorf 's friends are fascinated by what she 's doing , others still ca n't understand why she chose her line of work . still a men 's world " some think i 'm crazy , " she said .
" they ask me : ' why are you doing this ?
these people just go crazy in their heads , because they constantly have to deal with mourners . " ' her parents initially did n't like the idea , either .
they feared she would not be able to deal with the psychological pressure .
hossdorf also gets asked over and over again why she 's chosen a job that 's still done mainly by men . " people tell me : ' that 's a man 's job and people don ’ t like to see women do it , " ' hossdorf said .
" i see things differently .
there are women who become roofers .
sure , some bodies weigh a little more and i have to stop and rest once in a while , but it always works out somehow . " psychology of mourning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish cemetary in berlin .
graves here can not be reused .
hossdorf said she does n't want to limit her work to helping relatives organize funerals and deal with the necessary paperwork .
she hopes to help them deal with emotional issues as well . to learn how to do that , hossdorf attends school every couple of weeks during her three-year apprenticeship .
besides embalming , business management and funeral logistics , subjects there include the psychology of mourning , counseling , and the funeral customs and rites of various religions . hossdorf 's boss , elke birghölzer , has organized a hindu funeral , which required a special permit , because german law prohibits open caskets during funeral services .
she 's more familiar with muslim funerals , where ritual washings of the body are required and the grave site needs to be permanent and not limited to 25 years - the standard in germany . " when you bury people of russian orthodox faith , it 's customary to have a sip of vodka at the grave , " birghölzer said .
" undertakers have to be prepared for that . " a new benchmark for quality funerals a formal preparation for the job has been lacking until now .
while most german tradesmen still have to pass exams to start working , the funeral industry had no universally accepted standard of training . " a baker could become an undertaker , " birghölzer said . " all he had to do was to put a few coffins in his store . " the new training program is therefore also expected to ensure a certain quality level common to all funeral homes .
but it wo n't be a requirement for working as an undertaker : the baker can still bury people should he choose to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bikers carry the coffin of austrian pop singer falco in 1998 : ensuring quality funerals independet of customers ' special requests is the goal of the new training program for undertakers .

last year , 842,000 germans were buried or cremated and anyone training to become an undertaker stands a good chance of landing a job afterwards . but while some of hossdorf 's friends are fascinated by what she 's doing , others still ca n't understand why she chose her line of work . still a men 's world " some think i 'm crazy , " she said .
" they ask me : ' why are you doing this ?
these people just go crazy in their heads , because they constantly have to deal with mourners . " ' her parents initially did n't like the idea , either .
they feared she would not be able to deal with the psychological pressure .
hossdorf also gets asked over and over again why she 's chosen a job that 's still done mainly by men . " people tell me : ' that 's a man 's job and people don ’ t like to see women do it , " ' hossdorf said .
" i see things differently .
there are women who become roofers .
sure , some bodies weigh a little more and i have to stop and rest once in a while , but it always works out somehow . " psychology of mourning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish cemetary in berlin .
graves here can not be reused .
hossdorf said she does n't want to limit her work to helping relatives organize funerals and deal with the necessary paperwork .
she hopes to help them deal with emotional issues as well . to learn how to do that , hossdorf attends school every couple of weeks during her three-year apprenticeship .
besides embalming , business management and funeral logistics , subjects there include the psychology of mourning , counseling , and the funeral customs and rites of various religions . hossdorf 's boss , elke birghölzer , has organized a hindu funeral , which required a special permit , because german law prohibits open caskets during funeral services .
she 's more familiar with muslim funerals , where ritual washings of the body are required and the grave site needs to be permanent and not limited to 25 years - the standard in germany . " when you bury people of russian orthodox faith , it 's customary to have a sip of vodka at the grave , " birghölzer said .
" undertakers have to be prepared for that . " a new benchmark for quality funerals a formal preparation for the job has been lacking until now .
while most german tradesmen still have to pass exams to start working , the funeral industry had no universally accepted standard of training . " a baker could become an undertaker , " birghölzer said . " all he had to do was to put a few coffins in his store . " the new training program is therefore also expected to ensure a certain quality level common to all funeral homes .
but it wo n't be a requirement for working as an undertaker : the baker can still bury people should he choose to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bikers carry the coffin of austrian pop singer falco in 1998 : ensuring quality funerals independet of customers ' special requests is the goal of the new training program for undertakers .
" everyone with a business license can open a funeral home , " rolf fichtner , the executive director of the federal association of german undertakers , said .
" that 's as far as the law is concerned .
but basically it wo n't be possible any longer to work as an undertaker without formal training or a certain quality of service . " christiane lammert send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de skeletons in the backyard ?

germany 's future is looking a lot greener with the closure of the stade nuclear reactor power plant on friday .
but critics of germany 's ambitious nuclear phase-out law say the country still needs atomic energy . there will be no cermonial shut-off switch for environment minister jürgen trittin to flick when the stade nuclear power plant in northern germany goes offline on friday , but chances are the champagne corks will be popping in the green party headquarters this evening .
with the early closure of the country 's second-oldest nuclear reactor , germany will take the first step of an ambitious nuclear phase-out law engineered by the greens three years ago .
“ it ’ s of course wonderful , and the first of many , ” said michaela hustedt , the greens ' environmental expert in an interview .
under the 2002 law , germany ’ s 19 nuclear reactors will close down after reaching 32 years of operation .
stade is the first reactor to be removed from the grid .
when the last reactor goes off the grid in around 2020 , nuclear and coal power , which currently provide the country with 80 percent of its electricity , will have bowed out in favor of renewable energy .
but the plan is coming under increasing criticism from energy companies and opposition politicians , who say the prohibitive cost of renewable energy and recent blackouts in the united states prove the country still needs its nuclear plants .
“ looking at it technically , renewable energy can ’ t cover as our basic source of energy , ” said peter poppe , a spokesman for vatenfall europe , one of the four utility companies to agree on the “ nuclear consensus ” in 2000 .
“ the sun , we all know , isn ’ t a regular in germany and the wind , as it says in the bible , the wind blows where it wants to . ”
other countries holding off of nuclear power nuclear reactors , though heavily subsidized by the government , still provide the more stable form of energy , say phase-out opponents .
across europe countries that have sworn off nuclear energy , like spain , italy , the netherlands and belgium , continue to rely heavily on their reactors .
sweden which decided to phase out nuclear power in 1980 , has so far taken only one reactor off the grid and has been hesitating recently on shutting down the second .
with the kyoto protocol requiring countries in the future to keep carbon emissions like those from coal-burning plants down , german energy experts are concerned that the country won ’ t have a stable source of power to make up for the 40,000 megawatts in power lost when plants go off the grid in the coming 20 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preussen-elektra coal fired power plant , grosskrotzenburg-hessen , germany “ you either phase-out nuclear energy , or you reduce greenhouse gas emissions , but you can ’ t do both , ” says wolfgang pfaffenberger , director of the bremen energy insitute .
energy companies hoping for delay germany ’ s big four energy companies – vatenfall , energie baden-wuerttemberg , e.on and rwe – are secretly hoping the country follows the european trend and delay deadlines for shutting their reactors , says pfaffenberger .
their problem would also be solved if the opposition christian democratic party , which wants to keep nuclear energy around longer , boots out the chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s red-green coalition government in the 2006 federal elections .
“ they are hoping that day comes but they don ’ t want to say it because it would decrease the likelihood of it happening , ” pfaffenberger says .
environmentalists say they should instead be focusing on developing their renewable energy technology .
the gradual transition from nuclear power will be covered by a temporary combination of coal , wind and gas power , according to the environment ministry .
eventually , coal will be phase out as new energy sources like the geo-thermic plant that opened in northeastern germany this week , become economicallly viable .
“ we just can ’ t switch our energy sources from today to tomorrow , ” says björn pieprzyk , of the association for renewable energy . “ but the direction has to be right . ”
the growing power of wind germany has so far favored wind over other renewable energy resources .
the more than 12,000 wind turbines that dot the german countryside in the north and southwest of the country are indirectly subsidized by the government .
the early subsidies have helped mid-sized german companies become worldwide leaders in the wind market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ wind is already a classic energy source , even if some don ’ t see it , or want to see it , ” says andreas düser , whose company enercon is second in the worldwide market and has production plants in sweden , brazil and india .
the green party has high hopes for additional renewable energy sources , eventually wanting them to increase their current eight percent share of the german electricity market to 20 percent by 2020 .
critics want energy puzzle solved “ we want a broad palette of renewable energies .
micro-turbines , solar technology , and so on , ” says hustedt .
“ but it is difficult to predict , ” what will take off economically .
the economic uncertainty on what renewable energy source will take off when has only added fuel to the argument of the phase-out naysayers .
though the transition from nuclear power is only just beginning , skeptics say germany needs to have a better concept of what makes up the rest of the energy puzzle .
if the greens increase renewable energy to 20 percent , " you still have 80 percent you need to take care of , and no nuclear energy , " says pfaffenberger , co-author of a book on power supply .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.11.2003 germany backs down on eu military hq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer is heading to washington next week for talks .
german foreign minister joschka fischer on thursday distanced berlin from plans to create eu military headquarters separate from nato .
the proposal had created tension with washington . in a move likely to be seen as an olive branch in the continuing smoothing of relations between germany and the united states , the german government has softened its stance on the creation of a large and independent military planning headquarters for eu-led military operations . " i do not believe you need another big operational headquarters such as -lrb- nato ’ s planning arm -rrb- shape , " said joschka fischer , the german foreign minister .
" you have a nato planning headquarters , and there are headquarters in britain , france and germany . " the conciliatory message from berlin makes it almost certain that germany will support a more modest alternative to the proposed eu headquarters in brussels that will not compete with or duplicate existing or future nato facilities .
eight months to make u-turn germany ’ s new position is in direct contrast to that taken in april when the subject was first mooted at a meeting with france , luxembourg and belgium .
the so-called " mini summit , " especially the claim from the four nations that the eu 's defense and security policy should be backed up by an independent military planning headquarters , upset london and washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us and uk fear nato duplication .
britain and the united states quickly dismissed the proposals , fearing the creation of such a headquarters would not only compete with nato but would also create autonomous european defense structures which would undermine the transatlantic alliance .
operational planning staff still needed despite the change in tone coming from berlin on thursday , german and french officials remain committed to having some operational planning capability in brussels , where the eu 's military staff is involved only in strategic planning .
javier solana , the eu foreign policy chief and the man also responsible for the bloc 's defense and security policy , has also voiced his support for such a move .

german foreign minister joschka fischer on thursday distanced berlin from plans to create eu military headquarters separate from nato .
the proposal had created tension with washington . in a move likely to be seen as an olive branch in the continuing smoothing of relations between germany and the united states , the german government has softened its stance on the creation of a large and independent military planning headquarters for eu-led military operations . " i do not believe you need another big operational headquarters such as -lrb- nato ’ s planning arm -rrb- shape , " said joschka fischer , the german foreign minister .
" you have a nato planning headquarters , and there are headquarters in britain , france and germany . " the conciliatory message from berlin makes it almost certain that germany will support a more modest alternative to the proposed eu headquarters in brussels that will not compete with or duplicate existing or future nato facilities .
eight months to make u-turn germany ’ s new position is in direct contrast to that taken in april when the subject was first mooted at a meeting with france , luxembourg and belgium .
the so-called " mini summit , " especially the claim from the four nations that the eu 's defense and security policy should be backed up by an independent military planning headquarters , upset london and washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us and uk fear nato duplication .
britain and the united states quickly dismissed the proposals , fearing the creation of such a headquarters would not only compete with nato but would also create autonomous european defense structures which would undermine the transatlantic alliance .
operational planning staff still needed despite the change in tone coming from berlin on thursday , german and french officials remain committed to having some operational planning capability in brussels , where the eu 's military staff is involved only in strategic planning .
javier solana , the eu foreign policy chief and the man also responsible for the bloc 's defense and security policy , has also voiced his support for such a move .

starting this year , germans who want to become undertakers can receive a formal education for the job .
while thousands of young people are still looking for apprenticeships , 75 have already signed up for the program . christiane hossdorf found her dream job while still in high school .
the 19-year-old interned at a funeral home and decided she wanted to work in the field .
she does n't fear the sight of people who died in traffic accidents .
she 's not disgusted by handling bodies .
hossdorf can only think of one situation where she 'd be hesitant to do her job : burying a child is not something she 's looking forward to .
" i 'd let others do that for now and just watch them , " she said .
a job independent of economic cycles the young woman is lucky to have found an apprenticeship - 24,000 germans are still on the look-out this year and the government is now considering fining companies unwilling to train people . the funeral business is a stable one , " independent of economic cycles " , as the federal association of german undertakers states in a leaflet .
people die , no matter what happens .
last year , 842,000 germans were buried or cremated and anyone training to become an undertaker stands a good chance of landing a job afterwards . but while some of hossdorf 's friends are fascinated by what she 's doing , others still ca n't understand why she chose her line of work . still a men 's world " some think i 'm crazy , " she said .
" they ask me : ' why are you doing this ?
these people just go crazy in their heads , because they constantly have to deal with mourners . " ' her parents initially did n't like the idea , either .
they feared she would not be able to deal with the psychological pressure .
hossdorf also gets asked over and over again why she 's chosen a job that 's still done mainly by men . " people tell me : ' that 's a man 's job and people don ’ t like to see women do it , " ' hossdorf said .
" i see things differently .
there are women who become roofers .
sure , some bodies weigh a little more and i have to stop and rest once in a while , but it always works out somehow . " psychology of mourning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish cemetary in berlin .
graves here can not be reused .
hossdorf said she does n't want to limit her work to helping relatives organize funerals and deal with the necessary paperwork .
she hopes to help them deal with emotional issues as well . to learn how to do that , hossdorf attends school every couple of weeks during her three-year apprenticeship .
besides embalming , business management and funeral logistics , subjects there include the psychology of mourning , counseling , and the funeral customs and rites of various religions . hossdorf 's boss , elke birghölzer , has organized a hindu funeral , which required a special permit , because german law prohibits open caskets during funeral services .
she 's more familiar with muslim funerals , where ritual washings of the body are required and the grave site needs to be permanent and not limited to 25 years - the standard in germany . " when you bury people of russian orthodox faith , it 's customary to have a sip of vodka at the grave , " birghölzer said .
" undertakers have to be prepared for that . " a new benchmark for quality funerals a formal preparation for the job has been lacking until now .
while most german tradesmen still have to pass exams to start working , the funeral industry had no universally accepted standard of training . " a baker could become an undertaker , " birghölzer said . " all he had to do was to put a few coffins in his store . " the new training program is therefore also expected to ensure a certain quality level common to all funeral homes .
but it wo n't be a requirement for working as an undertaker : the baker can still bury people should he choose to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bikers carry the coffin of austrian pop singer falco in 1998 : ensuring quality funerals independet of customers ' special requests is the goal of the new training program for undertakers .
" everyone with a business license can open a funeral home , " rolf fichtner , the executive director of the federal association of german undertakers , said .
" that 's as far as the law is concerned .
but basically it wo n't be possible any longer to work as an undertaker without formal training or a certain quality of service . " christiane lammert send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de skeletons in the backyard ?

european commission president romano prodi caused waves in italy by issuing a political manifesto seen as signaling a desire to return to domestic politics – now , the ripple effect has reached brussels . earlier this week , prodi circulated a 55-page page manifesto on the future of europe and the leftist parties in italy . entitled “ europe : the dream , the choices , ” the document urges italy ’ s center-left parties , referred to as the “ olive tree ” bloc after former italian prime minister prodi ’ s own 1996 center-left coalition government , to unite and run under a single banner in next year ’ s european parliament elections . the european commission denied on wednesday that prodi wants to step back into the fray of italian politics , and said he would stay in his post as head of the brussels executive until his term ends next year . rivalry with berlusconi but the move has caused many of prodi ’ s colleagues in the european commission to wonder what provoked the normally reserved economics professor from bologna to release such a document .
they suspect that it has to do with the ongoing rivalry between prodi and italy ’ s current prime minister , silvio berlusconi . seven years ago , prodi chased the effusive businessman out of office , only to watch him return to power in 2001 . since july , when berlusconi took over the rotating presidency of the european union , the two political arch-enemies have clashed several times . berlusconi drew the ire of the commission when this summer he compared german member of the european parliament , martin schulz to a nazi concentration camp guard . berlusconi also surprised the brussels executive by inviting russia and israel to join the european union . earlier this month , prodi disowned berlusconi ’ s views on russia ’ s handling of the arrest of yukos ceo mikhail khodorkovsky and its behaviour in chechnya , only a day after berlusconi publicly praised russian president vladimir putin . not electioneering now it ’ s prodi ’ s turn to come under criticism from the very body he heads . in his defense , european commission spokesman gerassimor thomas said prodi ’ s manifesto was not an attempt to enter italian politics . “ as far as i ’ m aware there isn ’ t a manifesto , but a document presented by prodi containing the president ’ s vision of the future of europe , ” he said in a briefing . he added that prodi drafted the document as a private person , not as the commission ’ s president . in the document – which is currently only available in italian – prodi discusses alternatives to italy ’ s present conservative coalition under berlusconi . he also alleges that italy ’ s media are being increasingly manipulated by the prime minister , who is also a billionaire media tycoon . the bitter rivalry between prodi and berlusconi is now being fought out in the ranks of the european parliament . pat cox , the parliament ’ s president , said he wants to hear an explanation from prodi . “ mr. cox feels that there is a question to be answered .
we want to know exactly what is going on , ” cox ’ s spokesman , david harley , told the reuters news agency . german european parliament member , markus ferber of the conservative christian democratic union reacted angrily to prodi ’ s document .

on friday , they called for a " critical solidarity " with hohmann in ads in national newspapers .
several of the 26 people who signed the appeal to party leaders have made right extremist remarks in the past . expulsion a first for german conservatives hohmann 's expulsion is a first for the cdu and her sister party , the bavarian christian social union .
group leaders expressed their disappointment that 28 parliamentarians had voted against the expulsion - 16 others abstained , four votes were invalid and five mps were absent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democratic party leader angela merkel had called for hohmann 's expulsion from the parliamentary group .
" i 'd wished for a different result , " wolfgang bosbach , a deputy group leader , said .
angela merkel explained the opposing votes as a reflection of people 's personal sympathies for hohmann rather than an implicit endorsement of his remarks .
hohmann 's expulsion from the party is also under way , but that process could take several months .
anti-semitic remarks caused national debate in a speech given on germany 's national day on oct .
3 , hohmann had compared the russian revolution with the holocaust .
hohmann said that primarily jewish bolsheviks were responsible for crimes committed against civilians during the russian revolution .
he then went on to compare what he claimed was bloodshed orchestrated by jews in russia in the early 1900s with the murder of europe ’ s jews by the nazis in the third reich .
" jews were active in great numbers in the leadership as well as in the soviet secret police firing squads , " hohmann told constituents in his hometown of neuhof .
" thus one could describe jews with some justification as a tätervolk -lsb- roughly translated as race of perpetrators -rsb- . "
although he admitted in his speech that such a comparison " may sound horrible , " hohmann said it followed the " same logic with which one describes the germans as a race of perpetrators . "
the contents of that speech became highly publicized after a public television station broadcast a report on it .
it sparked a national debate about anti-semitic sentiment among german politicians and military leaders .
a former brigadier gen. reinhard günzel , head of germany ’ s ksk special forces , was sacked by the government after he publicly endorsed hohmann ’ s comments . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : why hohmann has to go german editorial writers comment on the christian democratic union ’ s struggle to expel right-wing backbencher martin hohmann after he called jews a “ race of perpetrators ” in a recent speech .

european commission president romano prodi caused waves in italy by issuing a political manifesto seen as signaling a desire to return to domestic politics – now , the ripple effect has reached brussels . earlier this week , prodi circulated a 55-page page manifesto on the future of europe and the leftist parties in italy . entitled “ europe : the dream , the choices , ” the document urges italy ’ s center-left parties , referred to as the “ olive tree ” bloc after former italian prime minister prodi ’ s own 1996 center-left coalition government , to unite and run under a single banner in next year ’ s european parliament elections . the european commission denied on wednesday that prodi wants to step back into the fray of italian politics , and said he would stay in his post as head of the brussels executive until his term ends next year . rivalry with berlusconi but the move has caused many of prodi ’ s colleagues in the european commission to wonder what provoked the normally reserved economics professor from bologna to release such a document .
they suspect that it has to do with the ongoing rivalry between prodi and italy ’ s current prime minister , silvio berlusconi . seven years ago , prodi chased the effusive businessman out of office , only to watch him return to power in 2001 . since july , when berlusconi took over the rotating presidency of the european union , the two political arch-enemies have clashed several times . berlusconi drew the ire of the commission when this summer he compared german member of the european parliament , martin schulz to a nazi concentration camp guard . berlusconi also surprised the brussels executive by inviting russia and israel to join the european union . earlier this month , prodi disowned berlusconi ’ s views on russia ’ s handling of the arrest of yukos ceo mikhail khodorkovsky and its behaviour in chechnya , only a day after berlusconi publicly praised russian president vladimir putin . not electioneering now it ’ s prodi ’ s turn to come under criticism from the very body he heads . in his defense , european commission spokesman gerassimor thomas said prodi ’ s manifesto was not an attempt to enter italian politics . “ as far as i ’ m aware there isn ’ t a manifesto , but a document presented by prodi containing the president ’ s vision of the future of europe , ” he said in a briefing . he added that prodi drafted the document as a private person , not as the commission ’ s president . in the document – which is currently only available in italian – prodi discusses alternatives to italy ’ s present conservative coalition under berlusconi . he also alleges that italy ’ s media are being increasingly manipulated by the prime minister , who is also a billionaire media tycoon . the bitter rivalry between prodi and berlusconi is now being fought out in the ranks of the european parliament . pat cox , the parliament ’ s president , said he wants to hear an explanation from prodi . “ mr. cox feels that there is a question to be answered .
we want to know exactly what is going on , ” cox ’ s spokesman , david harley , told the reuters news agency . german european parliament member , markus ferber of the conservative christian democratic union reacted angrily to prodi ’ s document .

german foreign minister joschka fischer on thursday distanced berlin from plans to create eu military headquarters separate from nato .
the proposal had created tension with washington . in a move likely to be seen as an olive branch in the continuing smoothing of relations between germany and the united states , the german government has softened its stance on the creation of a large and independent military planning headquarters for eu-led military operations . " i do not believe you need another big operational headquarters such as -lrb- nato ’ s planning arm -rrb- shape , " said joschka fischer , the german foreign minister .
" you have a nato planning headquarters , and there are headquarters in britain , france and germany . " the conciliatory message from berlin makes it almost certain that germany will support a more modest alternative to the proposed eu headquarters in brussels that will not compete with or duplicate existing or future nato facilities .

german foreign minister joschka fischer on thursday distanced berlin from plans to create eu military headquarters separate from nato .
the proposal had created tension with washington . in a move likely to be seen as an olive branch in the continuing smoothing of relations between germany and the united states , the german government has softened its stance on the creation of a large and independent military planning headquarters for eu-led military operations . " i do not believe you need another big operational headquarters such as -lrb- nato ’ s planning arm -rrb- shape , " said joschka fischer , the german foreign minister .
" you have a nato planning headquarters , and there are headquarters in britain , france and germany . " the conciliatory message from berlin makes it almost certain that germany will support a more modest alternative to the proposed eu headquarters in brussels that will not compete with or duplicate existing or future nato facilities .
eight months to make u-turn germany ’ s new position is in direct contrast to that taken in april when the subject was first mooted at a meeting with france , luxembourg and belgium .

javier solana , the eu foreign policy chief and the man also responsible for the bloc 's defense and security policy , has also voiced his support for such a move .
fischer ’ s remarks seem to have been well-planned and delivered as part of a two-pronged strategy aimed at continuing the mending of relations with washington . german-american ties were badly damaged during the run-up to the u.s.-led war against iraq , which berlin strongly opposed . reconciliation continues fischer will travel to the united states next week to meet with u.s. secretary of state colin powell and national security adviser condoleezza rice in washington .

germany 's future is looking a lot greener with the closure of the stade nuclear reactor power plant on friday .
but critics of germany 's ambitious nuclear phase-out law say the country still needs atomic energy . there will be no cermonial shut-off switch for environment minister jürgen trittin to flick when the stade nuclear power plant in northern germany goes offline on friday , but chances are the champagne corks will be popping in the green party headquarters this evening .
with the early closure of the country 's second-oldest nuclear reactor , germany will take the first step of an ambitious nuclear phase-out law engineered by the greens three years ago .
“ it ’ s of course wonderful , and the first of many , ” said michaela hustedt , the greens ' environmental expert in an interview .
under the 2002 law , germany ’ s 19 nuclear reactors will close down after reaching 32 years of operation .
stade is the first reactor to be removed from the grid .
when the last reactor goes off the grid in around 2020 , nuclear and coal power , which currently provide the country with 80 percent of its electricity , will have bowed out in favor of renewable energy .
but the plan is coming under increasing criticism from energy companies and opposition politicians , who say the prohibitive cost of renewable energy and recent blackouts in the united states prove the country still needs its nuclear plants .
“ looking at it technically , renewable energy can ’ t cover as our basic source of energy , ” said peter poppe , a spokesman for vatenfall europe , one of the four utility companies to agree on the “ nuclear consensus ” in 2000 .
“ the sun , we all know , isn ’ t a regular in germany and the wind , as it says in the bible , the wind blows where it wants to . ”
other countries holding off of nuclear power nuclear reactors , though heavily subsidized by the government , still provide the more stable form of energy , say phase-out opponents .
across europe countries that have sworn off nuclear energy , like spain , italy , the netherlands and belgium , continue to rely heavily on their reactors .
sweden which decided to phase out nuclear power in 1980 , has so far taken only one reactor off the grid and has been hesitating recently on shutting down the second .
with the kyoto protocol requiring countries in the future to keep carbon emissions like those from coal-burning plants down , german energy experts are concerned that the country won ’ t have a stable source of power to make up for the 40,000 megawatts in power lost when plants go off the grid in the coming 20 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preussen-elektra coal fired power plant , grosskrotzenburg-hessen , germany “ you either phase-out nuclear energy , or you reduce greenhouse gas emissions , but you can ’ t do both , ” says wolfgang pfaffenberger , director of the bremen energy insitute .
energy companies hoping for delay germany ’ s big four energy companies – vatenfall , energie baden-wuerttemberg , e.on and rwe – are secretly hoping the country follows the european trend and delay deadlines for shutting their reactors , says pfaffenberger .
their problem would also be solved if the opposition christian democratic party , which wants to keep nuclear energy around longer , boots out the chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s red-green coalition government in the 2006 federal elections .
“ they are hoping that day comes but they don ’ t want to say it because it would decrease the likelihood of it happening , ” pfaffenberger says .
environmentalists say they should instead be focusing on developing their renewable energy technology .
the gradual transition from nuclear power will be covered by a temporary combination of coal , wind and gas power , according to the environment ministry .
eventually , coal will be phase out as new energy sources like the geo-thermic plant that opened in northeastern germany this week , become economicallly viable .
“ we just can ’ t switch our energy sources from today to tomorrow , ” says björn pieprzyk , of the association for renewable energy . “ but the direction has to be right . ”
the growing power of wind germany has so far favored wind over other renewable energy resources .
the more than 12,000 wind turbines that dot the german countryside in the north and southwest of the country are indirectly subsidized by the government .
the early subsidies have helped mid-sized german companies become worldwide leaders in the wind market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ wind is already a classic energy source , even if some don ’ t see it , or want to see it , ” says andreas düser , whose company enercon is second in the worldwide market and has production plants in sweden , brazil and india .
the green party has high hopes for additional renewable energy sources , eventually wanting them to increase their current eight percent share of the german electricity market to 20 percent by 2020 .
critics want energy puzzle solved “ we want a broad palette of renewable energies .
micro-turbines , solar technology , and so on , ” says hustedt .
“ but it is difficult to predict , ” what will take off economically .
the economic uncertainty on what renewable energy source will take off when has only added fuel to the argument of the phase-out naysayers .
though the transition from nuclear power is only just beginning , skeptics say germany needs to have a better concept of what makes up the rest of the energy puzzle .
if the greens increase renewable energy to 20 percent , " you still have 80 percent you need to take care of , and no nuclear energy , " says pfaffenberger , co-author of a book on power supply .
" up until now , people have n't been worried ... and who looks 10 years into the future anyway ?
but the experts are annoyed that we have n't found an alternative yet , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy storm turns to a breeze after weeks of discord in germany ’ s coalition government over the future of the nation ’ s energy supply , ministers from both camps are working together to reach a compromise on traditional and renewable forms of energy .

starting this year , germans who want to become undertakers can receive a formal education for the job .
while thousands of young people are still looking for apprenticeships , 75 have already signed up for the program . christiane hossdorf found her dream job while still in high school .
the 19-year-old interned at a funeral home and decided she wanted to work in the field .
she does n't fear the sight of people who died in traffic accidents .
she 's not disgusted by handling bodies .
hossdorf can only think of one situation where she 'd be hesitant to do her job : burying a child is not something she 's looking forward to .
" i 'd let others do that for now and just watch them , " she said .
a job independent of economic cycles the young woman is lucky to have found an apprenticeship - 24,000 germans are still on the look-out this year and the government is now considering fining companies unwilling to train people . the funeral business is a stable one , " independent of economic cycles " , as the federal association of german undertakers states in a leaflet .
people die , no matter what happens .
last year , 842,000 germans were buried or cremated and anyone training to become an undertaker stands a good chance of landing a job afterwards . but while some of hossdorf 's friends are fascinated by what she 's doing , others still ca n't understand why she chose her line of work . still a men 's world " some think i 'm crazy , " she said .
" they ask me : ' why are you doing this ?
these people just go crazy in their heads , because they constantly have to deal with mourners . " ' her parents initially did n't like the idea , either .
they feared she would not be able to deal with the psychological pressure .
hossdorf also gets asked over and over again why she 's chosen a job that 's still done mainly by men . " people tell me : ' that 's a man 's job and people don ’ t like to see women do it , " ' hossdorf said .
" i see things differently .
there are women who become roofers .
sure , some bodies weigh a little more and i have to stop and rest once in a while , but it always works out somehow . " psychology of mourning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish cemetary in berlin .
graves here can not be reused .
hossdorf said she does n't want to limit her work to helping relatives organize funerals and deal with the necessary paperwork .
she hopes to help them deal with emotional issues as well . to learn how to do that , hossdorf attends school every couple of weeks during her three-year apprenticeship .
besides embalming , business management and funeral logistics , subjects there include the psychology of mourning , counseling , and the funeral customs and rites of various religions . hossdorf 's boss , elke birghölzer , has organized a hindu funeral , which required a special permit , because german law prohibits open caskets during funeral services .
she 's more familiar with muslim funerals , where ritual washings of the body are required and the grave site needs to be permanent and not limited to 25 years - the standard in germany . " when you bury people of russian orthodox faith , it 's customary to have a sip of vodka at the grave , " birghölzer said .
" undertakers have to be prepared for that . " a new benchmark for quality funerals a formal preparation for the job has been lacking until now .
while most german tradesmen still have to pass exams to start working , the funeral industry had no universally accepted standard of training . " a baker could become an undertaker , " birghölzer said . " all he had to do was to put a few coffins in his store . " the new training program is therefore also expected to ensure a certain quality level common to all funeral homes .
but it wo n't be a requirement for working as an undertaker : the baker can still bury people should he choose to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bikers carry the coffin of austrian pop singer falco in 1998 : ensuring quality funerals independet of customers ' special requests is the goal of the new training program for undertakers .
" everyone with a business license can open a funeral home , " rolf fichtner , the executive director of the federal association of german undertakers , said .
" that 's as far as the law is concerned .
but basically it wo n't be possible any longer to work as an undertaker without formal training or a certain quality of service . " christiane lammert send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de skeletons in the backyard ?

starting this year , germans who want to become undertakers can receive a formal education for the job .
while thousands of young people are still looking for apprenticeships , 75 have already signed up for the program . christiane hossdorf found her dream job while still in high school .
the 19-year-old interned at a funeral home and decided she wanted to work in the field .
she does n't fear the sight of people who died in traffic accidents .
she 's not disgusted by handling bodies .
hossdorf can only think of one situation where she 'd be hesitant to do her job : burying a child is not something she 's looking forward to .
" i 'd let others do that for now and just watch them , " she said .
a job independent of economic cycles the young woman is lucky to have found an apprenticeship - 24,000 germans are still on the look-out this year and the government is now considering fining companies unwilling to train people . the funeral business is a stable one , " independent of economic cycles " , as the federal association of german undertakers states in a leaflet .
people die , no matter what happens .
last year , 842,000 germans were buried or cremated and anyone training to become an undertaker stands a good chance of landing a job afterwards . but while some of hossdorf 's friends are fascinated by what she 's doing , others still ca n't understand why she chose her line of work . still a men 's world " some think i 'm crazy , " she said .
" they ask me : ' why are you doing this ?
these people just go crazy in their heads , because they constantly have to deal with mourners . " ' her parents initially did n't like the idea , either .
they feared she would not be able to deal with the psychological pressure .
hossdorf also gets asked over and over again why she 's chosen a job that 's still done mainly by men . " people tell me : ' that 's a man 's job and people don ’ t like to see women do it , " ' hossdorf said .
" i see things differently .
there are women who become roofers .
sure , some bodies weigh a little more and i have to stop and rest once in a while , but it always works out somehow . " psychology of mourning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish cemetary in berlin .
graves here can not be reused .
hossdorf said she does n't want to limit her work to helping relatives organize funerals and deal with the necessary paperwork .
she hopes to help them deal with emotional issues as well . to learn how to do that , hossdorf attends school every couple of weeks during her three-year apprenticeship .
besides embalming , business management and funeral logistics , subjects there include the psychology of mourning , counseling , and the funeral customs and rites of various religions . hossdorf 's boss , elke birghölzer , has organized a hindu funeral , which required a special permit , because german law prohibits open caskets during funeral services .
she 's more familiar with muslim funerals , where ritual washings of the body are required and the grave site needs to be permanent and not limited to 25 years - the standard in germany . " when you bury people of russian orthodox faith , it 's customary to have a sip of vodka at the grave , " birghölzer said .
" undertakers have to be prepared for that . " a new benchmark for quality funerals a formal preparation for the job has been lacking until now .
while most german tradesmen still have to pass exams to start working , the funeral industry had no universally accepted standard of training . " a baker could become an undertaker , " birghölzer said . " all he had to do was to put a few coffins in his store . " the new training program is therefore also expected to ensure a certain quality level common to all funeral homes .
but it wo n't be a requirement for working as an undertaker : the baker can still bury people should he choose to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bikers carry the coffin of austrian pop singer falco in 1998 : ensuring quality funerals independet of customers ' special requests is the goal of the new training program for undertakers .
" everyone with a business license can open a funeral home , " rolf fichtner , the executive director of the federal association of german undertakers , said .
" that 's as far as the law is concerned .
but basically it wo n't be possible any longer to work as an undertaker without formal training or a certain quality of service . " christiane lammert send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de skeletons in the backyard ?

" a baker could become an undertaker , " birghölzer said . " all he had to do was to put a few coffins in his store . " the new training program is therefore also expected to ensure a certain quality level common to all funeral homes .
but it wo n't be a requirement for working as an undertaker : the baker can still bury people should he choose to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bikers carry the coffin of austrian pop singer falco in 1998 : ensuring quality funerals independet of customers ' special requests is the goal of the new training program for undertakers .
" everyone with a business license can open a funeral home , " rolf fichtner , the executive director of the federal association of german undertakers , said .
" that 's as far as the law is concerned .

germany 's future is looking a lot greener with the closure of the stade nuclear reactor power plant on friday .
but critics of germany 's ambitious nuclear phase-out law say the country still needs atomic energy . there will be no cermonial shut-off switch for environment minister jürgen trittin to flick when the stade nuclear power plant in northern germany goes offline on friday , but chances are the champagne corks will be popping in the green party headquarters this evening .
with the early closure of the country 's second-oldest nuclear reactor , germany will take the first step of an ambitious nuclear phase-out law engineered by the greens three years ago .
“ it ’ s of course wonderful , and the first of many , ” said michaela hustedt , the greens ' environmental expert in an interview .
under the 2002 law , germany ’ s 19 nuclear reactors will close down after reaching 32 years of operation .
stade is the first reactor to be removed from the grid .
when the last reactor goes off the grid in around 2020 , nuclear and coal power , which currently provide the country with 80 percent of its electricity , will have bowed out in favor of renewable energy .
but the plan is coming under increasing criticism from energy companies and opposition politicians , who say the prohibitive cost of renewable energy and recent blackouts in the united states prove the country still needs its nuclear plants .
“ looking at it technically , renewable energy can ’ t cover as our basic source of energy , ” said peter poppe , a spokesman for vatenfall europe , one of the four utility companies to agree on the “ nuclear consensus ” in 2000 .
“ the sun , we all know , isn ’ t a regular in germany and the wind , as it says in the bible , the wind blows where it wants to . ”
other countries holding off of nuclear power nuclear reactors , though heavily subsidized by the government , still provide the more stable form of energy , say phase-out opponents .
across europe countries that have sworn off nuclear energy , like spain , italy , the netherlands and belgium , continue to rely heavily on their reactors .
sweden which decided to phase out nuclear power in 1980 , has so far taken only one reactor off the grid and has been hesitating recently on shutting down the second .
with the kyoto protocol requiring countries in the future to keep carbon emissions like those from coal-burning plants down , german energy experts are concerned that the country won ’ t have a stable source of power to make up for the 40,000 megawatts in power lost when plants go off the grid in the coming 20 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preussen-elektra coal fired power plant , grosskrotzenburg-hessen , germany “ you either phase-out nuclear energy , or you reduce greenhouse gas emissions , but you can ’ t do both , ” says wolfgang pfaffenberger , director of the bremen energy insitute .
energy companies hoping for delay germany ’ s big four energy companies – vatenfall , energie baden-wuerttemberg , e.on and rwe – are secretly hoping the country follows the european trend and delay deadlines for shutting their reactors , says pfaffenberger .
their problem would also be solved if the opposition christian democratic party , which wants to keep nuclear energy around longer , boots out the chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s red-green coalition government in the 2006 federal elections .
“ they are hoping that day comes but they don ’ t want to say it because it would decrease the likelihood of it happening , ” pfaffenberger says .
environmentalists say they should instead be focusing on developing their renewable energy technology .
the gradual transition from nuclear power will be covered by a temporary combination of coal , wind and gas power , according to the environment ministry .
eventually , coal will be phase out as new energy sources like the geo-thermic plant that opened in northeastern germany this week , become economicallly viable .
“ we just can ’ t switch our energy sources from today to tomorrow , ” says björn pieprzyk , of the association for renewable energy . “ but the direction has to be right . ”
the growing power of wind germany has so far favored wind over other renewable energy resources .
the more than 12,000 wind turbines that dot the german countryside in the north and southwest of the country are indirectly subsidized by the government .
the early subsidies have helped mid-sized german companies become worldwide leaders in the wind market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ wind is already a classic energy source , even if some don ’ t see it , or want to see it , ” says andreas düser , whose company enercon is second in the worldwide market and has production plants in sweden , brazil and india .
the green party has high hopes for additional renewable energy sources , eventually wanting them to increase their current eight percent share of the german electricity market to 20 percent by 2020 .
critics want energy puzzle solved “ we want a broad palette of renewable energies .
micro-turbines , solar technology , and so on , ” says hustedt .
“ but it is difficult to predict , ” what will take off economically .
the economic uncertainty on what renewable energy source will take off when has only added fuel to the argument of the phase-out naysayers .
though the transition from nuclear power is only just beginning , skeptics say germany needs to have a better concept of what makes up the rest of the energy puzzle .
if the greens increase renewable energy to 20 percent , " you still have 80 percent you need to take care of , and no nuclear energy , " says pfaffenberger , co-author of a book on power supply .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.11.2003 germany starts nuclear energy phase-out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stade was germany 's second-oldest nuclear reactor .
germany 's future is looking a lot greener with the closure of the stade nuclear reactor power plant on friday .
but critics of germany 's ambitious nuclear phase-out law say the country still needs atomic energy . there will be no cermonial shut-off switch for environment minister jürgen trittin to flick when the stade nuclear power plant in northern germany goes offline on friday , but chances are the champagne corks will be popping in the green party headquarters this evening .
with the early closure of the country 's second-oldest nuclear reactor , germany will take the first step of an ambitious nuclear phase-out law engineered by the greens three years ago .
“ it ’ s of course wonderful , and the first of many , ” said michaela hustedt , the greens ' environmental expert in an interview .
under the 2002 law , germany ’ s 19 nuclear reactors will close down after reaching 32 years of operation .
stade is the first reactor to be removed from the grid .
when the last reactor goes off the grid in around 2020 , nuclear and coal power , which currently provide the country with 80 percent of its electricity , will have bowed out in favor of renewable energy .
but the plan is coming under increasing criticism from energy companies and opposition politicians , who say the prohibitive cost of renewable energy and recent blackouts in the united states prove the country still needs its nuclear plants .
“ looking at it technically , renewable energy can ’ t cover as our basic source of energy , ” said peter poppe , a spokesman for vatenfall europe , one of the four utility companies to agree on the “ nuclear consensus ” in 2000 .
“ the sun , we all know , isn ’ t a regular in germany and the wind , as it says in the bible , the wind blows where it wants to . ”
other countries holding off of nuclear power nuclear reactors , though heavily subsidized by the government , still provide the more stable form of energy , say phase-out opponents .
across europe countries that have sworn off nuclear energy , like spain , italy , the netherlands and belgium , continue to rely heavily on their reactors .
sweden which decided to phase out nuclear power in 1980 , has so far taken only one reactor off the grid and has been hesitating recently on shutting down the second .
with the kyoto protocol requiring countries in the future to keep carbon emissions like those from coal-burning plants down , german energy experts are concerned that the country won ’ t have a stable source of power to make up for the 40,000 megawatts in power lost when plants go off the grid in the coming 20 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preussen-elektra coal fired power plant , grosskrotzenburg-hessen , germany “ you either phase-out nuclear energy , or you reduce greenhouse gas emissions , but you can ’ t do both , ” says wolfgang pfaffenberger , director of the bremen energy insitute .
energy companies hoping for delay germany ’ s big four energy companies – vatenfall , energie baden-wuerttemberg , e.on and rwe – are secretly hoping the country follows the european trend and delay deadlines for shutting their reactors , says pfaffenberger .
their problem would also be solved if the opposition christian democratic party , which wants to keep nuclear energy around longer , boots out the chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s red-green coalition government in the 2006 federal elections .
“ they are hoping that day comes but they don ’ t want to say it because it would decrease the likelihood of it happening , ” pfaffenberger says .
environmentalists say they should instead be focusing on developing their renewable energy technology .
the gradual transition from nuclear power will be covered by a temporary combination of coal , wind and gas power , according to the environment ministry .
eventually , coal will be phase out as new energy sources like the geo-thermic plant that opened in northeastern germany this week , become economicallly viable .
“ we just can ’ t switch our energy sources from today to tomorrow , ” says björn pieprzyk , of the association for renewable energy . “ but the direction has to be right . ”
the growing power of wind germany has so far favored wind over other renewable energy resources .
the more than 12,000 wind turbines that dot the german countryside in the north and southwest of the country are indirectly subsidized by the government .
the early subsidies have helped mid-sized german companies become worldwide leaders in the wind market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ wind is already a classic energy source , even if some don ’ t see it , or want to see it , ” says andreas düser , whose company enercon is second in the worldwide market and has production plants in sweden , brazil and india .
the green party has high hopes for additional renewable energy sources , eventually wanting them to increase their current eight percent share of the german electricity market to 20 percent by 2020 .
critics want energy puzzle solved “ we want a broad palette of renewable energies .
micro-turbines , solar technology , and so on , ” says hustedt .
“ but it is difficult to predict , ” what will take off economically .
the economic uncertainty on what renewable energy source will take off when has only added fuel to the argument of the phase-out naysayers .
though the transition from nuclear power is only just beginning , skeptics say germany needs to have a better concept of what makes up the rest of the energy puzzle .

european commission president romano prodi caused waves in italy by issuing a political manifesto seen as signaling a desire to return to domestic politics – now , the ripple effect has reached brussels . earlier this week , prodi circulated a 55-page page manifesto on the future of europe and the leftist parties in italy . entitled “ europe : the dream , the choices , ” the document urges italy ’ s center-left parties , referred to as the “ olive tree ” bloc after former italian prime minister prodi ’ s own 1996 center-left coalition government , to unite and run under a single banner in next year ’ s european parliament elections . the european commission denied on wednesday that prodi wants to step back into the fray of italian politics , and said he would stay in his post as head of the brussels executive until his term ends next year . rivalry with berlusconi but the move has caused many of prodi ’ s colleagues in the european commission to wonder what provoked the normally reserved economics professor from bologna to release such a document .
they suspect that it has to do with the ongoing rivalry between prodi and italy ’ s current prime minister , silvio berlusconi . seven years ago , prodi chased the effusive businessman out of office , only to watch him return to power in 2001 . since july , when berlusconi took over the rotating presidency of the european union , the two political arch-enemies have clashed several times . berlusconi drew the ire of the commission when this summer he compared german member of the european parliament , martin schulz to a nazi concentration camp guard . berlusconi also surprised the brussels executive by inviting russia and israel to join the european union . earlier this month , prodi disowned berlusconi ’ s views on russia ’ s handling of the arrest of yukos ceo mikhail khodorkovsky and its behaviour in chechnya , only a day after berlusconi publicly praised russian president vladimir putin . not electioneering now it ’ s prodi ’ s turn to come under criticism from the very body he heads . in his defense , european commission spokesman gerassimor thomas said prodi ’ s manifesto was not an attempt to enter italian politics . “ as far as i ’ m aware there isn ’ t a manifesto , but a document presented by prodi containing the president ’ s vision of the future of europe , ” he said in a briefing . he added that prodi drafted the document as a private person , not as the commission ’ s president . in the document – which is currently only available in italian – prodi discusses alternatives to italy ’ s present conservative coalition under berlusconi . he also alleges that italy ’ s media are being increasingly manipulated by the prime minister , who is also a billionaire media tycoon . the bitter rivalry between prodi and berlusconi is now being fought out in the ranks of the european parliament . pat cox , the parliament ’ s president , said he wants to hear an explanation from prodi . “ mr. cox feels that there is a question to be answered .

the mandate , which will expire in mid-december 2004 , was reduced by 800 soldiers .
a maximum of 3,100 troops will take part in the u.s.-led mission .
the numbers were pared down , since it is no longer expected that troops equipped to detect chemical and biological attacks - some of which had been stationed in kuwait - will be needed .
so far the bundeswehr 's mandate has not been used to its fullest extent . only 300 german soldiers are currently stationed abroad under the aegis of the operation in kenya and in the waters around the horn of africa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.11.2003 germany starts nuclear energy phase-out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stade was germany 's second-oldest nuclear reactor .
germany 's future is looking a lot greener with the closure of the stade nuclear reactor power plant on friday .
but critics of germany 's ambitious nuclear phase-out law say the country still needs atomic energy . there will be no cermonial shut-off switch for environment minister jürgen trittin to flick when the stade nuclear power plant in northern germany goes offline on friday , but chances are the champagne corks will be popping in the green party headquarters this evening .
with the early closure of the country 's second-oldest nuclear reactor , germany will take the first step of an ambitious nuclear phase-out law engineered by the greens three years ago .
“ it ’ s of course wonderful , and the first of many , ” said michaela hustedt , the greens ' environmental expert in an interview .
under the 2002 law , germany ’ s 19 nuclear reactors will close down after reaching 32 years of operation .
stade is the first reactor to be removed from the grid .
when the last reactor goes off the grid in around 2020 , nuclear and coal power , which currently provide the country with 80 percent of its electricity , will have bowed out in favor of renewable energy .
but the plan is coming under increasing criticism from energy companies and opposition politicians , who say the prohibitive cost of renewable energy and recent blackouts in the united states prove the country still needs its nuclear plants .
“ looking at it technically , renewable energy can ’ t cover as our basic source of energy , ” said peter poppe , a spokesman for vatenfall europe , one of the four utility companies to agree on the “ nuclear consensus ” in 2000 .
“ the sun , we all know , isn ’ t a regular in germany and the wind , as it says in the bible , the wind blows where it wants to . ”
other countries holding off of nuclear power nuclear reactors , though heavily subsidized by the government , still provide the more stable form of energy , say phase-out opponents .
across europe countries that have sworn off nuclear energy , like spain , italy , the netherlands and belgium , continue to rely heavily on their reactors .
sweden which decided to phase out nuclear power in 1980 , has so far taken only one reactor off the grid and has been hesitating recently on shutting down the second .
with the kyoto protocol requiring countries in the future to keep carbon emissions like those from coal-burning plants down , german energy experts are concerned that the country won ’ t have a stable source of power to make up for the 40,000 megawatts in power lost when plants go off the grid in the coming 20 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preussen-elektra coal fired power plant , grosskrotzenburg-hessen , germany “ you either phase-out nuclear energy , or you reduce greenhouse gas emissions , but you can ’ t do both , ” says wolfgang pfaffenberger , director of the bremen energy insitute .
energy companies hoping for delay germany ’ s big four energy companies – vatenfall , energie baden-wuerttemberg , e.on and rwe – are secretly hoping the country follows the european trend and delay deadlines for shutting their reactors , says pfaffenberger .
their problem would also be solved if the opposition christian democratic party , which wants to keep nuclear energy around longer , boots out the chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s red-green coalition government in the 2006 federal elections .
“ they are hoping that day comes but they don ’ t want to say it because it would decrease the likelihood of it happening , ” pfaffenberger says .
environmentalists say they should instead be focusing on developing their renewable energy technology .
the gradual transition from nuclear power will be covered by a temporary combination of coal , wind and gas power , according to the environment ministry .
eventually , coal will be phase out as new energy sources like the geo-thermic plant that opened in northeastern germany this week , become economicallly viable .
“ we just can ’ t switch our energy sources from today to tomorrow , ” says björn pieprzyk , of the association for renewable energy . “ but the direction has to be right . ”
the growing power of wind germany has so far favored wind over other renewable energy resources .
the more than 12,000 wind turbines that dot the german countryside in the north and southwest of the country are indirectly subsidized by the government .
the early subsidies have helped mid-sized german companies become worldwide leaders in the wind market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ wind is already a classic energy source , even if some don ’ t see it , or want to see it , ” says andreas düser , whose company enercon is second in the worldwide market and has production plants in sweden , brazil and india .
the green party has high hopes for additional renewable energy sources , eventually wanting them to increase their current eight percent share of the german electricity market to 20 percent by 2020 .
critics want energy puzzle solved “ we want a broad palette of renewable energies .
micro-turbines , solar technology , and so on , ” says hustedt .
“ but it is difficult to predict , ” what will take off economically .
the economic uncertainty on what renewable energy source will take off when has only added fuel to the argument of the phase-out naysayers .
though the transition from nuclear power is only just beginning , skeptics say germany needs to have a better concept of what makes up the rest of the energy puzzle .
if the greens increase renewable energy to 20 percent , " you still have 80 percent you need to take care of , and no nuclear energy , " says pfaffenberger , co-author of a book on power supply .
" up until now , people have n't been worried ... and who looks 10 years into the future anyway ?
but the experts are annoyed that we have n't found an alternative yet , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy storm turns to a breeze after weeks of discord in germany ’ s coalition government over the future of the nation ’ s energy supply , ministers from both camps are working together to reach a compromise on traditional and renewable forms of energy .

“ looking at it technically , renewable energy can ’ t cover as our basic source of energy , ” said peter poppe , a spokesman for vatenfall europe , one of the four utility companies to agree on the “ nuclear consensus ” in 2000 .
“ the sun , we all know , isn ’ t a regular in germany and the wind , as it says in the bible , the wind blows where it wants to . ”
other countries holding off of nuclear power nuclear reactors , though heavily subsidized by the government , still provide the more stable form of energy , say phase-out opponents .
across europe countries that have sworn off nuclear energy , like spain , italy , the netherlands and belgium , continue to rely heavily on their reactors .
sweden which decided to phase out nuclear power in 1980 , has so far taken only one reactor off the grid and has been hesitating recently on shutting down the second .
with the kyoto protocol requiring countries in the future to keep carbon emissions like those from coal-burning plants down , german energy experts are concerned that the country won ’ t have a stable source of power to make up for the 40,000 megawatts in power lost when plants go off the grid in the coming 20 years .

energy companies hoping for delay germany ’ s big four energy companies – vatenfall , energie baden-wuerttemberg , e.on and rwe – are secretly hoping the country follows the european trend and delay deadlines for shutting their reactors , says pfaffenberger .
their problem would also be solved if the opposition christian democratic party , which wants to keep nuclear energy around longer , boots out the chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s red-green coalition government in the 2006 federal elections .
“ they are hoping that day comes but they don ’ t want to say it because it would decrease the likelihood of it happening , ” pfaffenberger says .
environmentalists say they should instead be focusing on developing their renewable energy technology .
the gradual transition from nuclear power will be covered by a temporary combination of coal , wind and gas power , according to the environment ministry .
eventually , coal will be phase out as new energy sources like the geo-thermic plant that opened in northeastern germany this week , become economicallly viable .
“ we just can ’ t switch our energy sources from today to tomorrow , ” says björn pieprzyk , of the association for renewable energy . “ but the direction has to be right . ”
the growing power of wind germany has so far favored wind over other renewable energy resources .
the more than 12,000 wind turbines that dot the german countryside in the north and southwest of the country are indirectly subsidized by the government .
the early subsidies have helped mid-sized german companies become worldwide leaders in the wind market .

the green party has high hopes for additional renewable energy sources , eventually wanting them to increase their current eight percent share of the german electricity market to 20 percent by 2020 .

“ but it is difficult to predict , ” what will take off economically .
the economic uncertainty on what renewable energy source will take off when has only added fuel to the argument of the phase-out naysayers .
though the transition from nuclear power is only just beginning , skeptics say germany needs to have a better concept of what makes up the rest of the energy puzzle .
if the greens increase renewable energy to 20 percent , " you still have 80 percent you need to take care of , and no nuclear energy , " says pfaffenberger , co-author of a book on power supply .

with the kyoto protocol requiring countries in the future to keep carbon emissions like those from coal-burning plants down , german energy experts are concerned that the country won ’ t have a stable source of power to make up for the 40,000 megawatts in power lost when plants go off the grid in the coming 20 years .

germany 's future is looking a lot greener with the closure of the stade nuclear reactor power plant on friday .
but critics of germany 's ambitious nuclear phase-out law say the country still needs atomic energy . there will be no cermonial shut-off switch for environment minister jürgen trittin to flick when the stade nuclear power plant in northern germany goes offline on friday , but chances are the champagne corks will be popping in the green party headquarters this evening .
with the early closure of the country 's second-oldest nuclear reactor , germany will take the first step of an ambitious nuclear phase-out law engineered by the greens three years ago .
“ it ’ s of course wonderful , and the first of many , ” said michaela hustedt , the greens ' environmental expert in an interview .
under the 2002 law , germany ’ s 19 nuclear reactors will close down after reaching 32 years of operation .
stade is the first reactor to be removed from the grid .
when the last reactor goes off the grid in around 2020 , nuclear and coal power , which currently provide the country with 80 percent of its electricity , will have bowed out in favor of renewable energy .
but the plan is coming under increasing criticism from energy companies and opposition politicians , who say the prohibitive cost of renewable energy and recent blackouts in the united states prove the country still needs its nuclear plants .
“ looking at it technically , renewable energy can ’ t cover as our basic source of energy , ” said peter poppe , a spokesman for vatenfall europe , one of the four utility companies to agree on the “ nuclear consensus ” in 2000 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preussen-elektra coal fired power plant , grosskrotzenburg-hessen , germany “ you either phase-out nuclear energy , or you reduce greenhouse gas emissions , but you can ’ t do both , ” says wolfgang pfaffenberger , director of the bremen energy insitute .
energy companies hoping for delay germany ’ s big four energy companies – vatenfall , energie baden-wuerttemberg , e.on and rwe – are secretly hoping the country follows the european trend and delay deadlines for shutting their reactors , says pfaffenberger .
their problem would also be solved if the opposition christian democratic party , which wants to keep nuclear energy around longer , boots out the chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s red-green coalition government in the 2006 federal elections .
“ they are hoping that day comes but they don ’ t want to say it because it would decrease the likelihood of it happening , ” pfaffenberger says .
environmentalists say they should instead be focusing on developing their renewable energy technology .
the gradual transition from nuclear power will be covered by a temporary combination of coal , wind and gas power , according to the environment ministry .
eventually , coal will be phase out as new energy sources like the geo-thermic plant that opened in northeastern germany this week , become economicallly viable .
“ we just can ’ t switch our energy sources from today to tomorrow , ” says björn pieprzyk , of the association for renewable energy . “ but the direction has to be right . ”
the growing power of wind germany has so far favored wind over other renewable energy resources .
the more than 12,000 wind turbines that dot the german countryside in the north and southwest of the country are indirectly subsidized by the government .
the early subsidies have helped mid-sized german companies become worldwide leaders in the wind market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ wind is already a classic energy source , even if some don ’ t see it , or want to see it , ” says andreas düser , whose company enercon is second in the worldwide market and has production plants in sweden , brazil and india .
the green party has high hopes for additional renewable energy sources , eventually wanting them to increase their current eight percent share of the german electricity market to 20 percent by 2020 .
critics want energy puzzle solved “ we want a broad palette of renewable energies .
micro-turbines , solar technology , and so on , ” says hustedt .
“ but it is difficult to predict , ” what will take off economically .
the economic uncertainty on what renewable energy source will take off when has only added fuel to the argument of the phase-out naysayers .
though the transition from nuclear power is only just beginning , skeptics say germany needs to have a better concept of what makes up the rest of the energy puzzle .
if the greens increase renewable energy to 20 percent , " you still have 80 percent you need to take care of , and no nuclear energy , " says pfaffenberger , co-author of a book on power supply .
" up until now , people have n't been worried ... and who looks 10 years into the future anyway ?
but the experts are annoyed that we have n't found an alternative yet , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy storm turns to a breeze after weeks of discord in germany ’ s coalition government over the future of the nation ’ s energy supply , ministers from both camps are working together to reach a compromise on traditional and renewable forms of energy .

german foreign minister joschka fischer on thursday distanced berlin from plans to create eu military headquarters separate from nato .
the proposal had created tension with washington . in a move likely to be seen as an olive branch in the continuing smoothing of relations between germany and the united states , the german government has softened its stance on the creation of a large and independent military planning headquarters for eu-led military operations . " i do not believe you need another big operational headquarters such as -lrb- nato ’ s planning arm -rrb- shape , " said joschka fischer , the german foreign minister .
" you have a nato planning headquarters , and there are headquarters in britain , france and germany .

german foreign minister joschka fischer on thursday distanced berlin from plans to create eu military headquarters separate from nato .
the proposal had created tension with washington . in a move likely to be seen as an olive branch in the continuing smoothing of relations between germany and the united states , the german government has softened its stance on the creation of a large and independent military planning headquarters for eu-led military operations . " i do not believe you need another big operational headquarters such as -lrb- nato ’ s planning arm -rrb- shape , " said joschka fischer , the german foreign minister .
" you have a nato planning headquarters , and there are headquarters in britain , france and germany . " the conciliatory message from berlin makes it almost certain that germany will support a more modest alternative to the proposed eu headquarters in brussels that will not compete with or duplicate existing or future nato facilities .
eight months to make u-turn germany ’ s new position is in direct contrast to that taken in april when the subject was first mooted at a meeting with france , luxembourg and belgium .

britain and the united states quickly dismissed the proposals , fearing the creation of such a headquarters would not only compete with nato but would also create autonomous european defense structures which would undermine the transatlantic alliance .
operational planning staff still needed despite the change in tone coming from berlin on thursday , german and french officials remain committed to having some operational planning capability in brussels , where the eu 's military staff is involved only in strategic planning .
javier solana , the eu foreign policy chief and the man also responsible for the bloc 's defense and security policy , has also voiced his support for such a move .
fischer ’ s remarks seem to have been well-planned and delivered as part of a two-pronged strategy aimed at continuing the mending of relations with washington . german-american ties were badly damaged during the run-up to the u.s.-led war against iraq , which berlin strongly opposed . reconciliation continues fischer will travel to the united states next week to meet with u.s. secretary of state colin powell and national security adviser condoleezza rice in washington .

the mandate , which will expire in mid-december 2004 , was reduced by 800 soldiers .
a maximum of 3,100 troops will take part in the u.s.-led mission .
the numbers were pared down , since it is no longer expected that troops equipped to detect chemical and biological attacks - some of which had been stationed in kuwait - will be needed .
so far the bundeswehr 's mandate has not been used to its fullest extent . only 300 german soldiers are currently stationed abroad under the aegis of the operation in kenya and in the waters around the horn of africa .
a year ago 1,200 troops were deployed in the mission . more briefs 14.11.2003 -pipe- yemeni terror suspects face extradition to u.s. 14.11.2003 -pipe- court rejects first german tobacco case 13.11.2003 -pipe- price hike in 2004 for german beer 13.11.2003 -pipe- hohmann asks for forgiveness for remarks 12.11.2003 -pipe- germany pledges winter aid for afghan refugees 12.11.2003 -pipe- norway ’ s royals consider german legal action 12.11.2003 -pipe- german party girls auction themselves on ebay 12.11.2003 -pipe- germany sends military logistics experts to iraq radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.11.2003 degussa to continue work on holocaust memorial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work on the holocaust memorial in berlin was halted in late october .
the foundation in charge of berlin 's holocaust memorial decided on thursday to allow chemicals maker degussa to participate in building the monument .
the firm had a unit that produced poison gas for nazi death camps . despite degussa 's involvement with the nazis in the 1940s , the düsseldorf-based company - and the other participating firms that collaborated with the national socialists - will be permitted to continue its work on the " memorial to the murdered jews of europe . " the chairman of the foundation board and the president of germany 's parliament , wolfgang thierse , explained on thursday that opinions continued to differ among the 22 foundation board members but that a " very clear " majority supported the decision . " this monument is a monument that the whole of german society is building , " thierse said .
" neither in the parliamentary decision nor in the past among the public nor in the foundation board have we heard any argument calling for parts of this society to be excluded . "
thus , thierse said , the board decided that certain companies should not be excluded now , " even if their predecessors were connected to the nazi regime 's crimes in the worst way . " thierse pointed out that bayer - which is also involved in building the monument - was , like degussa , also a successor firm of ig farben , which had been closely intertwined with hitler 's third reich .
but he also stressed that the decision was influenced by concerns that searching for a replacement for degussa could have disrupted the project 's schedule and forced it to go beyond its budget , which could have jeopardized the entire undertaking . hostage to political correctness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. architect peter eisenman designed the monument .
u.s. architect peter eisenman , who designed the monument , welcomed the decision .
discussing the company 's role in national socialism was important in germany , he said in an interview with german tv broadcaster zdf .

the foundation in charge of berlin 's holocaust memorial decided on thursday to allow chemicals maker degussa to participate in building the monument .
the firm had a unit that produced poison gas for nazi death camps . despite degussa 's involvement with the nazis in the 1940s , the düsseldorf-based company - and the other participating firms that collaborated with the national socialists - will be permitted to continue its work on the " memorial to the murdered jews of europe . " the chairman of the foundation board and the president of germany 's parliament , wolfgang thierse , explained on thursday that opinions continued to differ among the 22 foundation board members but that a " very clear " majority supported the decision . " this monument is a monument that the whole of german society is building , " thierse said .
" neither in the parliamentary decision nor in the past among the public nor in the foundation board have we heard any argument calling for parts of this society to be excluded . "
thus , thierse said , the board decided that certain companies should not be excluded now , " even if their predecessors were connected to the nazi regime 's crimes in the worst way . " thierse pointed out that bayer - which is also involved in building the monument - was , like degussa , also a successor firm of ig farben , which had been closely intertwined with hitler 's third reich .
but he also stressed that the decision was influenced by concerns that searching for a replacement for degussa could have disrupted the project 's schedule and forced it to go beyond its budget , which could have jeopardized the entire undertaking . hostage to political correctness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. architect peter eisenman designed the monument .

the foundation in charge of berlin 's holocaust memorial decided on thursday to allow chemicals maker degussa to participate in building the monument .
the firm had a unit that produced poison gas for nazi death camps . despite degussa 's involvement with the nazis in the 1940s , the düsseldorf-based company - and the other participating firms that collaborated with the national socialists - will be permitted to continue its work on the " memorial to the murdered jews of europe . " the chairman of the foundation board and the president of germany 's parliament , wolfgang thierse , explained on thursday that opinions continued to differ among the 22 foundation board members but that a " very clear " majority supported the decision . " this monument is a monument that the whole of german society is building , " thierse said .
" neither in the parliamentary decision nor in the past among the public nor in the foundation board have we heard any argument calling for parts of this society to be excluded . "
thus , thierse said , the board decided that certain companies should not be excluded now , " even if their predecessors were connected to the nazi regime 's crimes in the worst way . " thierse pointed out that bayer - which is also involved in building the monument - was , like degussa , also a successor firm of ig farben , which had been closely intertwined with hitler 's third reich .
but he also stressed that the decision was influenced by concerns that searching for a replacement for degussa could have disrupted the project 's schedule and forced it to go beyond its budget , which could have jeopardized the entire undertaking . hostage to political correctness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. architect peter eisenman designed the monument .
u.s. architect peter eisenman , who designed the monument , welcomed the decision .
discussing the company 's role in national socialism was important in germany , he said in an interview with german tv broadcaster zdf .
" one must always forgive .
that is the essence if this monument , " he added .
previously eisenman had criticized the efforts to exclude degussa and claimed that the project was becoming a hostage to political correctness . lea rosh , the controversial initiator of the monument and a board member , said it was important that the monument be built .
" the thought that jewish people and the descendents of holocaust victims wo n't come to the memorial is horrible to me , " she said .
rosh , who strongly opposed degussa 's participation , said the memorial should to include documentation about the firm . three weeks ago foundation board members cancelled a contract with degussa after objections surfaced against the firm coating the memorial to protect it from graffiti .
but the discussion did n't end there .
a degussa-subsidiary , it was later discovered , also provided a product used to make the concrete foundation for the monument of some 2,700 pillars . a foundation report estimated that the cost of the much-delayed monument would have increased by € 2.34 million -lrb- $ 2.73 million -rrb- if degussa did not provide the anti-graffiti coating .
the monument is expected to cost € 27.6 million and be completed in spring 2005 .
it has been in the planning for 15 years . rosh and berlin jewish leader alexander brenner , also a board member , had advocated preventing degussa 's further involvement , but not undoing the work it had already done . " an encouraging signal " but german protestant church council head wolfgang huber appealed to include degussa in the monument since it had engaged in a thorough examination of its past .
" it would be an encouraging signal , " the bishop wrote in a letter to thierse . the former israeli ambassador to berlin , avi primor , also spoke out in favor of degussa being allowed to stay involved in the project .
" degussa is no longer the company it was during the third reich , " he said in an interview with the german broadcaster ard last week .
he said it had made a significant contribution to redressing its past . degussa head utz-hellmuth felcht said on thursday that the firm was open to discussing its history and that in continuing to work on the memorial it could make a contribution to remenberance .
degussa was one of numerous german firms that paid into a government-administered fund to compensate world war ii forced laborers several years ago . ig farben , once the world 's biggest chemical maker , had a holding in degesch , the degussa unit that produced zyklon b. after world war ii , the allies stripped ig farben of its assets and transferred them to the three chemical firms bayer , hoechst -lrb- now aventis -rrb- and basf . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi chemical giant declares bankruptcy the infamous nazi poison-gas manufacturer ig farben is insolvent , possibly leaving thousands of former forced laborers trying to claim compensation out in the cold .

starting this year , germans who want to become undertakers can receive a formal education for the job .
while thousands of young people are still looking for apprenticeships , 75 have already signed up for the program . christiane hossdorf found her dream job while still in high school .
the 19-year-old interned at a funeral home and decided she wanted to work in the field .
she does n't fear the sight of people who died in traffic accidents .
she 's not disgusted by handling bodies .
hossdorf can only think of one situation where she 'd be hesitant to do her job : burying a child is not something she 's looking forward to .
" i 'd let others do that for now and just watch them , " she said .
a job independent of economic cycles the young woman is lucky to have found an apprenticeship - 24,000 germans are still on the look-out this year and the government is now considering fining companies unwilling to train people . the funeral business is a stable one , " independent of economic cycles " , as the federal association of german undertakers states in a leaflet .
people die , no matter what happens .
last year , 842,000 germans were buried or cremated and anyone training to become an undertaker stands a good chance of landing a job afterwards . but while some of hossdorf 's friends are fascinated by what she 's doing , others still ca n't understand why she chose her line of work . still a men 's world " some think i 'm crazy , " she said .
" they ask me : ' why are you doing this ?
these people just go crazy in their heads , because they constantly have to deal with mourners . " ' her parents initially did n't like the idea , either .
they feared she would not be able to deal with the psychological pressure .
hossdorf also gets asked over and over again why she 's chosen a job that 's still done mainly by men . " people tell me : ' that 's a man 's job and people don ’ t like to see women do it , " ' hossdorf said .
" i see things differently .
there are women who become roofers .

graves here can not be reused .
hossdorf said she does n't want to limit her work to helping relatives organize funerals and deal with the necessary paperwork .
she hopes to help them deal with emotional issues as well . to learn how to do that , hossdorf attends school every couple of weeks during her three-year apprenticeship .
besides embalming , business management and funeral logistics , subjects there include the psychology of mourning , counseling , and the funeral customs and rites of various religions . hossdorf 's boss , elke birghölzer , has organized a hindu funeral , which required a special permit , because german law prohibits open caskets during funeral services .
she 's more familiar with muslim funerals , where ritual washings of the body are required and the grave site needs to be permanent and not limited to 25 years - the standard in germany . " when you bury people of russian orthodox faith , it 's customary to have a sip of vodka at the grave , " birghölzer said .
" undertakers have to be prepared for that . " a new benchmark for quality funerals a formal preparation for the job has been lacking until now .
while most german tradesmen still have to pass exams to start working , the funeral industry had no universally accepted standard of training . " a baker could become an undertaker , " birghölzer said . " all he had to do was to put a few coffins in his store . " the new training program is therefore also expected to ensure a certain quality level common to all funeral homes .
but it wo n't be a requirement for working as an undertaker : the baker can still bury people should he choose to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bikers carry the coffin of austrian pop singer falco in 1998 : ensuring quality funerals independet of customers ' special requests is the goal of the new training program for undertakers .
" everyone with a business license can open a funeral home , " rolf fichtner , the executive director of the federal association of german undertakers , said .

starting this year , germans who want to become undertakers can receive a formal education for the job .
while thousands of young people are still looking for apprenticeships , 75 have already signed up for the program . christiane hossdorf found her dream job while still in high school .
the 19-year-old interned at a funeral home and decided she wanted to work in the field .
she does n't fear the sight of people who died in traffic accidents .
she 's not disgusted by handling bodies .
hossdorf can only think of one situation where she 'd be hesitant to do her job : burying a child is not something she 's looking forward to .
" i 'd let others do that for now and just watch them , " she said .
a job independent of economic cycles the young woman is lucky to have found an apprenticeship - 24,000 germans are still on the look-out this year and the government is now considering fining companies unwilling to train people . the funeral business is a stable one , " independent of economic cycles " , as the federal association of german undertakers states in a leaflet .
people die , no matter what happens .
last year , 842,000 germans were buried or cremated and anyone training to become an undertaker stands a good chance of landing a job afterwards . but while some of hossdorf 's friends are fascinated by what she 's doing , others still ca n't understand why she chose her line of work . still a men 's world " some think i 'm crazy , " she said .
" they ask me : ' why are you doing this ?
these people just go crazy in their heads , because they constantly have to deal with mourners . " ' her parents initially did n't like the idea , either .
they feared she would not be able to deal with the psychological pressure .
hossdorf also gets asked over and over again why she 's chosen a job that 's still done mainly by men . " people tell me : ' that 's a man 's job and people don ’ t like to see women do it , " ' hossdorf said .
" i see things differently .
there are women who become roofers .
sure , some bodies weigh a little more and i have to stop and rest once in a while , but it always works out somehow . " psychology of mourning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish cemetary in berlin .
graves here can not be reused .
hossdorf said she does n't want to limit her work to helping relatives organize funerals and deal with the necessary paperwork .
she hopes to help them deal with emotional issues as well . to learn how to do that , hossdorf attends school every couple of weeks during her three-year apprenticeship .
besides embalming , business management and funeral logistics , subjects there include the psychology of mourning , counseling , and the funeral customs and rites of various religions . hossdorf 's boss , elke birghölzer , has organized a hindu funeral , which required a special permit , because german law prohibits open caskets during funeral services .

a job independent of economic cycles the young woman is lucky to have found an apprenticeship - 24,000 germans are still on the look-out this year and the government is now considering fining companies unwilling to train people . the funeral business is a stable one , " independent of economic cycles " , as the federal association of german undertakers states in a leaflet .
people die , no matter what happens .
last year , 842,000 germans were buried or cremated and anyone training to become an undertaker stands a good chance of landing a job afterwards . but while some of hossdorf 's friends are fascinated by what she 's doing , others still ca n't understand why she chose her line of work . still a men 's world " some think i 'm crazy , " she said .
" they ask me : ' why are you doing this ?
these people just go crazy in their heads , because they constantly have to deal with mourners . " ' her parents initially did n't like the idea , either .
they feared she would not be able to deal with the psychological pressure .
hossdorf also gets asked over and over again why she 's chosen a job that 's still done mainly by men . " people tell me : ' that 's a man 's job and people don ’ t like to see women do it , " ' hossdorf said .

hossdorf said she does n't want to limit her work to helping relatives organize funerals and deal with the necessary paperwork .
she hopes to help them deal with emotional issues as well . to learn how to do that , hossdorf attends school every couple of weeks during her three-year apprenticeship .
besides embalming , business management and funeral logistics , subjects there include the psychology of mourning , counseling , and the funeral customs and rites of various religions . hossdorf 's boss , elke birghölzer , has organized a hindu funeral , which required a special permit , because german law prohibits open caskets during funeral services .
she 's more familiar with muslim funerals , where ritual washings of the body are required and the grave site needs to be permanent and not limited to 25 years - the standard in germany . " when you bury people of russian orthodox faith , it 's customary to have a sip of vodka at the grave , " birghölzer said .
" undertakers have to be prepared for that . " a new benchmark for quality funerals a formal preparation for the job has been lacking until now .
while most german tradesmen still have to pass exams to start working , the funeral industry had no universally accepted standard of training . " a baker could become an undertaker , " birghölzer said . " all he had to do was to put a few coffins in his store . " the new training program is therefore also expected to ensure a certain quality level common to all funeral homes .

european commission president romano prodi caused waves in italy by issuing a political manifesto seen as signaling a desire to return to domestic politics – now , the ripple effect has reached brussels . earlier this week , prodi circulated a 55-page page manifesto on the future of europe and the leftist parties in italy . entitled “ europe : the dream , the choices , ” the document urges italy ’ s center-left parties , referred to as the “ olive tree ” bloc after former italian prime minister prodi ’ s own 1996 center-left coalition government , to unite and run under a single banner in next year ’ s european parliament elections . the european commission denied on wednesday that prodi wants to step back into the fray of italian politics , and said he would stay in his post as head of the brussels executive until his term ends next year . rivalry with berlusconi but the move has caused many of prodi ’ s colleagues in the european commission to wonder what provoked the normally reserved economics professor from bologna to release such a document .
they suspect that it has to do with the ongoing rivalry between prodi and italy ’ s current prime minister , silvio berlusconi . seven years ago , prodi chased the effusive businessman out of office , only to watch him return to power in 2001 . since july , when berlusconi took over the rotating presidency of the european union , the two political arch-enemies have clashed several times . berlusconi drew the ire of the commission when this summer he compared german member of the european parliament , martin schulz to a nazi concentration camp guard . berlusconi also surprised the brussels executive by inviting russia and israel to join the european union . earlier this month , prodi disowned berlusconi ’ s views on russia ’ s handling of the arrest of yukos ceo mikhail khodorkovsky and its behaviour in chechnya , only a day after berlusconi publicly praised russian president vladimir putin . not electioneering now it ’ s prodi ’ s turn to come under criticism from the very body he heads . in his defense , european commission spokesman gerassimor thomas said prodi ’ s manifesto was not an attempt to enter italian politics . “ as far as i ’ m aware there isn ’ t a manifesto , but a document presented by prodi containing the president ’ s vision of the future of europe , ” he said in a briefing . he added that prodi drafted the document as a private person , not as the commission ’ s president . in the document – which is currently only available in italian – prodi discusses alternatives to italy ’ s present conservative coalition under berlusconi . he also alleges that italy ’ s media are being increasingly manipulated by the prime minister , who is also a billionaire media tycoon . the bitter rivalry between prodi and berlusconi is now being fought out in the ranks of the european parliament . pat cox , the parliament ’ s president , said he wants to hear an explanation from prodi . “ mr. cox feels that there is a question to be answered .

european commission president romano prodi caused waves in italy by issuing a political manifesto seen as signaling a desire to return to domestic politics – now , the ripple effect has reached brussels . earlier this week , prodi circulated a 55-page page manifesto on the future of europe and the leftist parties in italy . entitled “ europe : the dream , the choices , ” the document urges italy ’ s center-left parties , referred to as the “ olive tree ” bloc after former italian prime minister prodi ’ s own 1996 center-left coalition government , to unite and run under a single banner in next year ’ s european parliament elections . the european commission denied on wednesday that prodi wants to step back into the fray of italian politics , and said he would stay in his post as head of the brussels executive until his term ends next year . rivalry with berlusconi but the move has caused many of prodi ’ s colleagues in the european commission to wonder what provoked the normally reserved economics professor from bologna to release such a document .
they suspect that it has to do with the ongoing rivalry between prodi and italy ’ s current prime minister , silvio berlusconi . seven years ago , prodi chased the effusive businessman out of office , only to watch him return to power in 2001 . since july , when berlusconi took over the rotating presidency of the european union , the two political arch-enemies have clashed several times . berlusconi drew the ire of the commission when this summer he compared german member of the european parliament , martin schulz to a nazi concentration camp guard . berlusconi also surprised the brussels executive by inviting russia and israel to join the european union . earlier this month , prodi disowned berlusconi ’ s views on russia ’ s handling of the arrest of yukos ceo mikhail khodorkovsky and its behaviour in chechnya , only a day after berlusconi publicly praised russian president vladimir putin . not electioneering now it ’ s prodi ’ s turn to come under criticism from the very body he heads . in his defense , european commission spokesman gerassimor thomas said prodi ’ s manifesto was not an attempt to enter italian politics . “ as far as i ’ m aware there isn ’ t a manifesto , but a document presented by prodi containing the president ’ s vision of the future of europe , ” he said in a briefing . he added that prodi drafted the document as a private person , not as the commission ’ s president . in the document – which is currently only available in italian – prodi discusses alternatives to italy ’ s present conservative coalition under berlusconi . he also alleges that italy ’ s media are being increasingly manipulated by the prime minister , who is also a billionaire media tycoon . the bitter rivalry between prodi and berlusconi is now being fought out in the ranks of the european parliament . pat cox , the parliament ’ s president , said he wants to hear an explanation from prodi . “ mr. cox feels that there is a question to be answered .
we want to know exactly what is going on , ” cox ’ s spokesman , david harley , told the reuters news agency . german european parliament member , markus ferber of the conservative christian democratic union reacted angrily to prodi ’ s document .
“ prodi can not dance at two weddings at the same time , ” he said in a statement . another german mep from the conservative faction , hans-gert pöttering , told an italian newspaper that prodi should maintain neutrality and not get mixed up in domestic politics . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi refutes apology for nazi remark did he or didn ’ t he apologize ?

the figure would cut a third off this year ’ s record deficit of € 43.4 billion -lrb- $ 50.9 billion -rrb- by trimming spending and selling € 7 billion -lrb- $ 8.2 billion -rrb- of the government ’ s shares in deutsche telekom ag and deutsche post ag to a state bank .
chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government is under pressure from the european union to cut the deficit , which is expected to breach eu rules meant to protect the euro both this year and next .

some berliners will be disappointed after having come up with such flattering names for the tree as " plucked duck , " " scrawny fishbone " and " hunger rake . "

the mandate , which will expire in mid-december 2004 , was reduced by 800 soldiers .
a maximum of 3,100 troops will take part in the u.s.-led mission .
the numbers were pared down , since it is no longer expected that troops equipped to detect chemical and biological attacks - some of which had been stationed in kuwait - will be needed .
so far the bundeswehr 's mandate has not been used to its fullest extent . only 300 german soldiers are currently stationed abroad under the aegis of the operation in kenya and in the waters around the horn of africa .

in an explanation to the parliamentary group , he said he had apologized several times , and was prepared to do anything he could to heal the wounds he had caused .
in the explanation , published by a newspaper in hohmann 's central german hometown of fulda , he said he had not described jews as " a race of perpetrators , " but that the media had taken his words out of context .

the mandate , which will expire in mid-december 2004 , was reduced by 800 soldiers .
a maximum of 3,100 troops will take part in the u.s.-led mission .
the numbers were pared down , since it is no longer expected that troops equipped to detect chemical and biological attacks - some of which had been stationed in kuwait - will be needed .
so far the bundeswehr 's mandate has not been used to its fullest extent . only 300 german soldiers are currently stationed abroad under the aegis of the operation in kenya and in the waters around the horn of africa .

mr falconio , 28 , is believed to have been shot dead .
mr murdoch was arrested after being acquitted of unrelated sex offences .

she later flagged down a passing motorist .

for the three months to september , gdp was up 0.6 % from the previous quarter , making an annual rate of 2.2 % .
economists said that domestic spending was also climbing , albeit at a slower rate than the impact of overseas trade .
the data will be good news for prime minister junichiro koizumi , re-elected last week with a shrunken majority .
" it 's stronger than we thought it would be , " mr koizumi told reporters .
his party 's disappointing performance in sunday 's poll has widely been seen as a response to dissatisfaction with the slow pace of economic reform and of japan 's recovery from four recessions in little more than a decade .
help from abroad the spurt , the government 's data showed , was largely a response to continued expansion in the us and china , both of whom are major buyers of japanese goods .
exports contributed a third of the growth , and economists said they believed the trend was set to stay for the next few months at least .
" with the us economy seen growing strongly , japan 's exports are likely to grow at a stable pace , " said ryota sakagami , economist at nomura research institute in tokyo .
domestic demand was less impressive , but business investment - which recent surveys have indicated is picking up - was doing better than some had feared , with spending on electronics , communications and automobiles showing healthy gains .
lacklustre the growth news failed to produce much of a market reaction , with the benchmark nikkei 225 falling 1.65 % by the close .
apart from anything else , the pickup in japan - while reassuring - still leaves the country reliant on foreign countries whose own growth is far outstripping its own .
china , for example , could grow as much as 9 % this year , and its currency is pegged at a low level against the dollar , making its own exports more competitive .
as for the us , the third quarter produced expansion that - if continued for a year - would amount to 7.2 % , and the dollar itself is continuing to lose ground to a resurgent yen .
that has already hit the results and share prices of some japanese exporters , including games company nintendo .

they say the vulnerable witnesses -lrb- scotland -rrb- bill , which is making its way through the scottish parliament , does not offer enough protection .
children 1st , childline scotland , and nch scotland believe child witnesses under the age of 16 should not be obliged to appear in court to give evidence .
the charities argue that child witnesses should be allowed to use an intermediary like a social worker or teacher .
margaret mckay , chief executive of children 1st , said no child witness under 16 should be obliged to appear in court to give evidence .
" we want to see a situation where no child as a witness ever goes into an adult court at all , " she said .
" children 's evidence should be taken in a child-friendly environment , outwith a court room and relayed into the court . "
" it makes sense that there is one dedicated person with all the expertise on issues relevant to vulnerable witnesses " cathy jamieson justice minister children 1st is holding a conference in edinburgh on friday to discuss its concerns .
meanwhile , justice minister cathy jamieson announced that a network of " vulnerable witness officers " will be established as part of an £ 850,000 project .
the officers ' role will be to co-ordinate the work of all the organisations involved in working with children .
ms jamieson said the new unit would be involved in planning the implementation of the vulnerable witnesses bill .
she said : " it will take forward the executive 's commitment to appoint vulnerable witness officers , providing ongoing support to all the agencies who work within our justice system and who are committed to doing a better job for child witnesses and vulnerable witnesses .
" it makes sense that there is one dedicated person with all the expertise on issues relevant to vulnerable witnesses .
" it would only cause confusion if one officer had to be consulted about the issues of the child being a witness , then another about the issue of learning difficulties . "
' better evidence ' victim support scotland deals with more than 6,000 child witnesses a year .
director of operations neil paterson said passing new laws may not be enough .
" we need to move to a culture whereby people giving evidence by special measures is actually more the norm than it is at present , " said mr paterson .
" that will be better quality evidence and it will actually improve the quality of justice because people will feel more able to tell the truth about what has happened to them . "

it is hoped homeless people in jersey will benefit from more frequent visits by outreach workers .
the charity homeless outreach is planning to increase visits this winter .
homeless outreach workers tend to go out during the evening or at night , especially during the winter .
but the charity 's new co-ordinator , laura strickland , wants to extend the charity 's work and visit homeless people during the day as well .
she says it is easier for staff and volunteers to give homeless people advice during the day by helping them get in touch with various agencies that offer financial support .
it is hoped the scheme will be operating early next year on a weekly basis , but the charity says it needs more volunteers .

the controversial plans have been stalled by confusion over planning fees .
the company , spencer farm produce , had applied to east lindsey district council to erect the turbines at land on high lane in croft .
the application was due to be discussed by the council on thursday but was withdrawn from the planning agenda at the last minute .
the council says following advice from the district auditor , they have decided to get further legal advice over the calculation of planning fees .
meanwhile , campaigners who have been protesting against the wind farm , say they will continue to put pressure on the council to refuse planning permission .

there are also plans for a pub , shops , medical facilities and a crèche .
awm , and the property developers st modwen properties , also hope to create a riverside walkway by opening up the river rea which flows through the site , but is currently covered .
technology ' corridor ' the land is bounded by bristol road south and longbridge lane and includes mg rover 's disused north works , the adjoining car park and part of the south works .
john edwards , chief executive of awm , said : " this is a highly significant project , not only for birmingham , but for the whole of the west midlands .
" the site sits within the central technology belt - a high technology corridor which stretches from birmingham into worcestershire - which aims to capitalise on innovation and expertise from nearby universities and centres of research .
" the business park at longbridge will be home to companies who benefit from the work of these institutions , which in turn will bring new high-value jobs to the area and generate a more prosperous economy . "
awm said a planning application would shortly be submitted to birmingham city council .
it is hoped work to develop the land can start in the spring .

the battle to stop the ring rot spreading on middlewood farm in bwlch means the destruction of 1,500 tons of seed potatoes .
the discovery of the disease was confirmed during an annual survey for ring rot by defra and it is thought the disease was brought into wales on infected dutch seed .
government restrictions now ban any movement of potatoes on john morgan 's farm , and three other farms - one in wales and two in the scilly isles - which had all taken delivery of seed potatoes from the middlewood farm over the last few weeks .
scientists will return to the farm on monday to test more than 80,000 samples of the potatoes .
only a small proportion is expected to show any sign of infection .
the whole crop will then be destroyed at a cost to farmer john morgan and his family of £ 400,000 .
it will then be buried or sent to a landfill site .
defra officials believe the outbreak is under control , and that it will be contained and eradicated .
experts are also talking to spanish authorities about two consignments exported to the canary islands although ring rot poses no risk to human health , farmers leaders in wales had said the news is a " massive blow " to the industry .
wales ' potato industry 95 registered growers produces 86,000 tonnes worth £ 6.5m to economy total area farmed 2,000 hectares annual losses to us potato farmers caused by ring rot have been as high as 50 % .
farmers are also worried about the effect on the seed market if the uk loses its disease-free status .
lisa francis , welsh conservative am for mid and west wales , is asking the environment minister , carwyn jones , to make an emergency statement to the assembly on the outbreak .
she said the testing period to determine whether this disease has spread " can take up to eight weeks , it is vital that work on this starts now so that the authorities do their best to contain the disease . "
she added : " defra can not afford to be complacent in any way on this issue .
they also need to establish an investigation to determine how this disease got into the country in the first place " .

richard and graham thomas , from aberkenfig near bridgend , are eligible to play for the balkan side because their mother sonja was born there .
they have already played three matches and helped win a game against rivals croatia .
but bad weather conditions in the former yugoslav republic means that they will have to hang up their international boots until the season restarts in april .
richard , 31 , who plays in the back row for tondu rugby club , explained how they were called up .
" we knew there was a rugby team in slovenia , but did n't really know how to get in touch with them , " he said .
" but some of our friends from llanelli were going over to play and told them we were interested in playing for them .
rugby in wales is massive and it is part of our culture richard thomas " then five weeks ago , we had an offer to go and spend a week training . "
his younger brother graham , 29 , a prop at bridgend added : " we spent the week there and , on the saturday , we played with the team against croatia .
" it was a hard game but we won 22-20 .
" the team is really up and coming - the game is n't widely supported out there at the moment and there are only four teams playing .
" but things are changing and they are doing really well - they have only just got promoted , " he added .
the slovenian side is currently listed as 49th in the international rugby board 's world rankings .
the brothers , who have always played rugby , said that even making the long journey from south wales to slovenia could not dampen their pride .
richard thomas said it was an honour to be selected for the slovenian side " it is a long way to travel , " explained graham .
" we have got to travel to stansted for the flight and then have another long journey when we get there .
" but it is worth it . "
his brother agreed : " our family is so proud of us .
" they have been over with us when we have played , and our family who live out there have been supporting us too .
" it is a big thing - rugby in wales is massive and it is part of our culture . "

hacker infiltrators spend a year lurking online a simple search reveals a plethora of resources , tools , and personal homepages , most claiming to " hack " for legitimate reasons , within the law .
but there is also an entire underground network of hackers honing their tools and skills with malicious damage in mind .
" ten years ago , ' hackers ' used to mean people who tinker with computers .
" nowadays hacking means malicious hacking .
the definition has changed , so get over it , " peter tippett , founder and chief technical officer at trusecure told bbc news online .
being ' k3wl ' the underground network is vast , with thousands of individuals and groups , ranging from lurkers who are intrigued by hacker chat to " script kiddies " who try out hacker tools for a laugh .
newsgroups , internet relay chat and increasingly , peer-to-peer chat and instant messaging , are buzzing with constant hacker chatter .
net security companies like trusecure in the us , have the job of keeping an eye on these groups to work out which weak net spot they are planning to attack next .
it currently tracks more than 11,000 individuals in about 900 different hacking groups and gangs .
" there are 5,500 net vulnerabilities that could be used theoretically to launch an attack , but only 80 or 90 are being used , " says mr tippett .
" only 16 of 4,200 of vulnerabilities actually turned into attacks last year . "
they spend a year listening and watching - lurking - before they ever say a word in the group peter tippett , trusecure a team of human and computer bots - artificial intelligence programs - count the vulnerabilities that pop up all over the web daily and measure the risk of security attacks for trusecure 's 700 or so customers .
but that is not enough for 21st century net security , says mr tippett .
a separate team at trusecure has a more mysterious job .
it is the elite group of hacker infiltrators , codename is / recon -lrb- information security reconnaissance -rrb- .
their daily job is to " see what the bad guys say to each other and what they claim to have done " by gaining respect and building online relationships with groups with names like hackweiser and g-force pakistan , mr tippett explains .
" these are the groups of people who attack websites , write viruses , attack code , steal credit cards , and generally do nasty things , " he says .
is / recon is like the net 's a-team , with the only difference being the team members are not renegades gone good .
" we refuse to hire hackers , that would be crazy , " says mr tippett .
" we do n't do anything illegal , but we impersonate hackers . "
they are all good with technology , according to mr tippett , but some of them have a valuable background in psychology .
this helps in understanding group behaviour and how minds work , as well as helping them to act like hackers .
" the team has an average of five or six people on them , each with 20 to 30 personalities , " explains mr tippett .
" they usually stay on the team for a year or two then move on to something else . "
in that time , they use their net personae to get to know the hackers so they can build up detailed profiles of them .
" they spend a year listening and watching - lurking - before they ever say a word in the group . "
which , says mr tippett , gives is / recon the time to develop different hacker personae around the lingo , rituals and behaviour that is expected in the underground .
using " k3wl " instead of " cool " and making sure the " a " is always replaced by " 4 " may seem insignificant habits any teenager living in an sms world might do .
but by talking the talk and virtually walking the walk , is / recon has gained the trust of nearly 100 different groups .
the trick is to gain enough trust to get certain individuals in the groups to " blab " and answer questions about who is who and what they are doing .
" they tell us a lot about what 's going on and what that person is about in order to demonstrate how cool they are to us . "
the holy grail for the team is to get hold of a copy of a tool a hacker is developing .
once tested and taken apart in the lab , preventative measures can be put in place before it is used .
jigsaw puzzle the hours spent gathering 200 gigabytes of information a day , are invaluable in helping to catch the small proportion of hackers who do the net severe damage .
pieces of information about groups and individuals are put together like a giant jigsaw in trusecure 's mammoth database , nicknamed the " brain " .
the networks in the hacker underground are complex it graphically shows the big players , where they live , who they know , who they hate , what tools they have developed , and even whether they have a cat .
this has enabled the team to help out with 54 investigations by law enforcement agencies .
is / recon gave the fbi over 200 documents about the melissa virus author after they were asked to get closer to suspects .
although they did not know his real name , they knew his three aliases and had built a detailed profile of the author .
the team 's work also helped identify the author of the high-profile lovesan virus .
" we could say what dorm and what floor the author of the lovesan virus was on , " mr tippett says .
" unfortunately , there are very few countries that have laws good enough to follow through if someone turns out to be coming from there . "

hacker infiltrators spend a year lurking online a simple search reveals a plethora of resources , tools , and personal homepages , most claiming to " hack " for legitimate reasons , within the law .
but there is also an entire underground network of hackers honing their tools and skills with malicious damage in mind .
" ten years ago , ' hackers ' used to mean people who tinker with computers .
" nowadays hacking means malicious hacking .
the definition has changed , so get over it , " peter tippett , founder and chief technical officer at trusecure told bbc news online .
being ' k3wl ' the underground network is vast , with thousands of individuals and groups , ranging from lurkers who are intrigued by hacker chat to " script kiddies " who try out hacker tools for a laugh .
newsgroups , internet relay chat and increasingly , peer-to-peer chat and instant messaging , are buzzing with constant hacker chatter .
net security companies like trusecure in the us , have the job of keeping an eye on these groups to work out which weak net spot they are planning to attack next .
it currently tracks more than 11,000 individuals in about 900 different hacking groups and gangs .
" there are 5,500 net vulnerabilities that could be used theoretically to launch an attack , but only 80 or 90 are being used , " says mr tippett .
" only 16 of 4,200 of vulnerabilities actually turned into attacks last year . "
they spend a year listening and watching - lurking - before they ever say a word in the group peter tippett , trusecure a team of human and computer bots - artificial intelligence programs - count the vulnerabilities that pop up all over the web daily and measure the risk of security attacks for trusecure 's 700 or so customers .
but that is not enough for 21st century net security , says mr tippett .
a separate team at trusecure has a more mysterious job .
it is the elite group of hacker infiltrators , codename is / recon -lrb- information security reconnaissance -rrb- .
their daily job is to " see what the bad guys say to each other and what they claim to have done " by gaining respect and building online relationships with groups with names like hackweiser and g-force pakistan , mr tippett explains .
" these are the groups of people who attack websites , write viruses , attack code , steal credit cards , and generally do nasty things , " he says .
is / recon is like the net 's a-team , with the only difference being the team members are not renegades gone good .
" we refuse to hire hackers , that would be crazy , " says mr tippett .
" we do n't do anything illegal , but we impersonate hackers . "
they are all good with technology , according to mr tippett , but some of them have a valuable background in psychology .
this helps in understanding group behaviour and how minds work , as well as helping them to act like hackers .
" the team has an average of five or six people on them , each with 20 to 30 personalities , " explains mr tippett .
" they usually stay on the team for a year or two then move on to something else . "
in that time , they use their net personae to get to know the hackers so they can build up detailed profiles of them .
" they spend a year listening and watching - lurking - before they ever say a word in the group . "
which , says mr tippett , gives is / recon the time to develop different hacker personae around the lingo , rituals and behaviour that is expected in the underground .
using " k3wl " instead of " cool " and making sure the " a " is always replaced by " 4 " may seem insignificant habits any teenager living in an sms world might do .
but by talking the talk and virtually walking the walk , is / recon has gained the trust of nearly 100 different groups .
the trick is to gain enough trust to get certain individuals in the groups to " blab " and answer questions about who is who and what they are doing .
" they tell us a lot about what 's going on and what that person is about in order to demonstrate how cool they are to us . "
the holy grail for the team is to get hold of a copy of a tool a hacker is developing .
once tested and taken apart in the lab , preventative measures can be put in place before it is used .
jigsaw puzzle the hours spent gathering 200 gigabytes of information a day , are invaluable in helping to catch the small proportion of hackers who do the net severe damage .
pieces of information about groups and individuals are put together like a giant jigsaw in trusecure 's mammoth database , nicknamed the " brain " .
the networks in the hacker underground are complex it graphically shows the big players , where they live , who they know , who they hate , what tools they have developed , and even whether they have a cat .

their daily job is to " see what the bad guys say to each other and what they claim to have done " by gaining respect and building online relationships with groups with names like hackweiser and g-force pakistan , mr tippett explains .
" these are the groups of people who attack websites , write viruses , attack code , steal credit cards , and generally do nasty things , " he says .
is / recon is like the net 's a-team , with the only difference being the team members are not renegades gone good .
" we refuse to hire hackers , that would be crazy , " says mr tippett .
" we do n't do anything illegal , but we impersonate hackers . "
they are all good with technology , according to mr tippett , but some of them have a valuable background in psychology .
this helps in understanding group behaviour and how minds work , as well as helping them to act like hackers .
" the team has an average of five or six people on them , each with 20 to 30 personalities , " explains mr tippett .
" they usually stay on the team for a year or two then move on to something else . "
in that time , they use their net personae to get to know the hackers so they can build up detailed profiles of them .
" they spend a year listening and watching - lurking - before they ever say a word in the group . "
which , says mr tippett , gives is / recon the time to develop different hacker personae around the lingo , rituals and behaviour that is expected in the underground .
using " k3wl " instead of " cool " and making sure the " a " is always replaced by " 4 " may seem insignificant habits any teenager living in an sms world might do .
but by talking the talk and virtually walking the walk , is / recon has gained the trust of nearly 100 different groups .
the trick is to gain enough trust to get certain individuals in the groups to " blab " and answer questions about who is who and what they are doing .
" they tell us a lot about what 's going on and what that person is about in order to demonstrate how cool they are to us . "
the holy grail for the team is to get hold of a copy of a tool a hacker is developing .
once tested and taken apart in the lab , preventative measures can be put in place before it is used .
jigsaw puzzle the hours spent gathering 200 gigabytes of information a day , are invaluable in helping to catch the small proportion of hackers who do the net severe damage .
pieces of information about groups and individuals are put together like a giant jigsaw in trusecure 's mammoth database , nicknamed the " brain " .
the networks in the hacker underground are complex it graphically shows the big players , where they live , who they know , who they hate , what tools they have developed , and even whether they have a cat .
this has enabled the team to help out with 54 investigations by law enforcement agencies .
is / recon gave the fbi over 200 documents about the melissa virus author after they were asked to get closer to suspects .
although they did not know his real name , they knew his three aliases and had built a detailed profile of the author .
the team 's work also helped identify the author of the high-profile lovesan virus .
" we could say what dorm and what floor the author of the lovesan virus was on , " mr tippett says .
" unfortunately , there are very few countries that have laws good enough to follow through if someone turns out to be coming from there . "

hacker infiltrators spend a year lurking online a simple search reveals a plethora of resources , tools , and personal homepages , most claiming to " hack " for legitimate reasons , within the law .
but there is also an entire underground network of hackers honing their tools and skills with malicious damage in mind .
" ten years ago , ' hackers ' used to mean people who tinker with computers .
" nowadays hacking means malicious hacking .
the definition has changed , so get over it , " peter tippett , founder and chief technical officer at trusecure told bbc news online .
being ' k3wl ' the underground network is vast , with thousands of individuals and groups , ranging from lurkers who are intrigued by hacker chat to " script kiddies " who try out hacker tools for a laugh .
newsgroups , internet relay chat and increasingly , peer-to-peer chat and instant messaging , are buzzing with constant hacker chatter .
net security companies like trusecure in the us , have the job of keeping an eye on these groups to work out which weak net spot they are planning to attack next .
it currently tracks more than 11,000 individuals in about 900 different hacking groups and gangs .
" there are 5,500 net vulnerabilities that could be used theoretically to launch an attack , but only 80 or 90 are being used , " says mr tippett .
" only 16 of 4,200 of vulnerabilities actually turned into attacks last year . "
they spend a year listening and watching - lurking - before they ever say a word in the group peter tippett , trusecure a team of human and computer bots - artificial intelligence programs - count the vulnerabilities that pop up all over the web daily and measure the risk of security attacks for trusecure 's 700 or so customers .
