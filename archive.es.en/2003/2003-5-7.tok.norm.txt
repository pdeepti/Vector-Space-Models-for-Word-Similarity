out of the merger of germany 's daimler-benz and the u.s. carmaker chrysler came daimlerchrysler in 1998 .
but after a honeymoon in hell , the world 's third largest car manufacturer is looking forward to better days . it was dubbed " a wedding made in heaven " by the marriage brokers five years ago . in a series of secret meetings in early 1998 , the chief executives of germany 's daimler-benz and america 's chrysler met and sealed a deal to merge the carmakers .
when the news finally leaked to the wall street journal in may , negotiations had nearly been completed .
on may 7 , daimler ceo jürgen schrempp and chrysler ceo bob eaton confirmed the merger and proclaimed the creation of the daimlerchrysler . five years on , investors are not exactly in a celebratory mood about the so-called “ merger of equals . ”
instead of the two companies combining forces and synergies as was promised at the time , the merger was , in effect , a takeover .
daimler-benz acquired chrysler , improving its position in its most-important auto market , the united states . at the same time , however , daimler-benz inadvertently burdened itself with numerous problems that , like those associated with the purchase of a used car , only came to the surface in time . chrysler in the doldrums in january 2000 , four months after the merger became official , chrysler reported first-quarter losses and eaton tendered his resignation as joint chief executive .
daimler ’ s jürgen schrempp became the sole ceo and , once the extent of chrysler ’ s problems came to light , brought in german dieter zetzsche to reorganize its ailing u.s. partner . zetzsche slashed 26,000 jobs and closed six factories , but he got chrysler back on its feet in 2002 and he ’ s now seen as the company ’ s savior in detroit .
operative profits reached € 152 million in the first quarter of this year . still , the company is not out of danger .
competition in the u.s. remains fierce , particularly in light of the prices wars spurred on by general motors and ford . daimlerchrysler moved further into the asian market in 2000 , buying 37.1 percent of mitsubishi motors , another carmaker in the red .
schrempp sent in another german manager , rolf eckrodt , to take the reins and lead the japanese firm back into the realm of profit-making . share prices catapult times have been especially rough for the german-american firm since its initial public offering in 1998 .
shares that sold for € 100 at the time are now trading at around € 30 .
at the time of the merger , daimler was valued at € 53 billion and chrysler at around € 32 billion .
five years later , the combined companies have a market capitalization of about € 30 billion , less than half their combined original values . but at the time of the merger , daimlerchrysler executives had the companies ' long-term perspectives in mind .

out of the merger of germany 's daimler-benz and the u.s. carmaker chrysler came daimlerchrysler in 1998 .
but after a honeymoon in hell , the world 's third largest car manufacturer is looking forward to better days . it was dubbed " a wedding made in heaven " by the marriage brokers five years ago . in a series of secret meetings in early 1998 , the chief executives of germany 's daimler-benz and america 's chrysler met and sealed a deal to merge the carmakers .
when the news finally leaked to the wall street journal in may , negotiations had nearly been completed .
on may 7 , daimler ceo jürgen schrempp and chrysler ceo bob eaton confirmed the merger and proclaimed the creation of the daimlerchrysler . five years on , investors are not exactly in a celebratory mood about the so-called “ merger of equals . ”
instead of the two companies combining forces and synergies as was promised at the time , the merger was , in effect , a takeover .
daimler-benz acquired chrysler , improving its position in its most-important auto market , the united states . at the same time , however , daimler-benz inadvertently burdened itself with numerous problems that , like those associated with the purchase of a used car , only came to the surface in time . chrysler in the doldrums in january 2000 , four months after the merger became official , chrysler reported first-quarter losses and eaton tendered his resignation as joint chief executive .
daimler ’ s jürgen schrempp became the sole ceo and , once the extent of chrysler ’ s problems came to light , brought in german dieter zetzsche to reorganize its ailing u.s. partner . zetzsche slashed 26,000 jobs and closed six factories , but he got chrysler back on its feet in 2002 and he ’ s now seen as the company ’ s savior in detroit .
operative profits reached € 152 million in the first quarter of this year . still , the company is not out of danger .
competition in the u.s. remains fierce , particularly in light of the prices wars spurred on by general motors and ford . daimlerchrysler moved further into the asian market in 2000 , buying 37.1 percent of mitsubishi motors , another carmaker in the red .
schrempp sent in another german manager , rolf eckrodt , to take the reins and lead the japanese firm back into the realm of profit-making . share prices catapult times have been especially rough for the german-american firm since its initial public offering in 1998 .
shares that sold for € 100 at the time are now trading at around € 30 .
at the time of the merger , daimler was valued at € 53 billion and chrysler at around € 32 billion .
five years later , the combined companies have a market capitalization of about € 30 billion , less than half their combined original values . but at the time of the merger , daimlerchrysler executives had the companies ' long-term perspectives in mind .

how a successful last-minute lobbying campaign by european governments and business leaders kept a huge contract to build engines for a new airbus military transport plane in europe . european aerospace consortium eads chose europrop international to supply engines for its new a400m military transport planes , after the firm cut its price to come closer to a previous bid from canadian competitor pratt & whitney .

but eads gave europrop time to revise its offer , noting the strong " political dimension " of the contract award .
it is currently unclear whether europrop lowered its bid the full 20 percent or just 10 percent , but apparently it was enough to satisfy eads chairman manfred bischoff .

eads and airbus are reported to have come under strong pressure from european governments led by france - which owns snecma as well as a 0.06 percent share in eads - to choose europrop over its north american rival .
the contract to supply the a400m engines is seen as strategically important to the european aerospace industry .

a new exhibition in berlin explores the career of iconic italian fashion designer giorgio armani .
more than 500 of his sleek creations spanning three decades of his career are on display . berlin ’ s fashion mavens might soon head to a museum instead of the city ’ s many chic boutiques .
starting may 8 , an exhibition celebrating the career of italian fashion designer giorgio armani goes on show at berlin ’ s new national gallery . recognized as one of the most influential designers of the 20th century along with chanel , yves saint laurent and christian dior , the exhibition focuses on armani ’ s development and contribution to the world of fashion over the past 30 years . synonymous for good taste designed by acclaimed american theater director and visual artist robert wilson , the show has more than 500 sleek armani creations – long synonymous for good taste – ranging from tailored jackets for women , smoking , vests , close-fitting suits , blazers and evening gowns . draped on mannequins that parade in seemingly never ending lines in a massive shaded exhibition hall , wilson ’ s installation veers away from the chronology of the creations to focus instead on armani ’ s groundbreaking work with style and color . though armani first made his name with elegant and sensual men ’ s suits , it was his women ’ s wear that attracted later attention with its unconventional emphasis on unstructured ease and masculine shapes . the italian designer is universally credited with creating a timeless vision of modern casual attire with his philosophy that garments should be comfortable and simply designed , with a focus on clean lines and elegant functionality . this mantra has translated into elegant suits and blazers for the business woman , cool sporty clothes for a day out and richly embroidered robes for the evening .
for men , armani crafts equally sophisticated and perfectly tailored suits from rich fabrics . armani ’ s trademark " non-color " palette of black , gray and beige is evident throughout the berlin exhibition , though daring designs in pink , blue and green have also been thrown in .
the collection also chronicles armani ’ s successful drop dead glamour stint in the 1990s when he dressed hollywood stars such as george clooney , leonardo dicaprio , martin scorsese and jodie foster for the academy awards . " a moment of my work " the exhibition , which enjoyed successful runs at the guggenheim museum in new york in 2000 and a year later in bilbao , spain , has now been expanded to include video presentations and photographs that showcase armani ’ s latest creations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giorgio armani speaking in berlin on the eve of the exhibition , the well-tanned 68 year-old said that the show was a personal project for him : " each garment represents a moment of my work . " armani admitted that he never thought he ’ d ever land in a museum with his collection , but said that he was more than happy that the venue was berlin ’ s new national gallery designed by bauhaus master mies van der rohe .
" the garments are brought to the fore very well through the clean lines of the architecture and the discreet background , " he said .
the exhibition " giorgio armani " will be showing at the national gallery in berlin from may 8 to july 13 , 2003 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin pulls off arts coup the german capital may be bankrupt , but its arts scene can still pack a punch .

how a successful last-minute lobbying campaign by european governments and business leaders kept a huge contract to build engines for a new airbus military transport plane in europe . european aerospace consortium eads chose europrop international to supply engines for its new a400m military transport planes , after the firm cut its price to come closer to a previous bid from canadian competitor pratt & whitney .
eads directors said tuesday they awarded the contract - valued at about us $ 3.4 billion -lrb- € 2.98 billion -rrb- - to europrop on tuesday " in light of -lrb- europrop 's -rrb- substantial effort " to make the price more attractive .
eads owns 80 percent of airbus .
' bizarre ' decision the decision was hailed as " unfair " and " bizarre " by a canadian aerospace lobbyist .
initially , pratt & whitney appeared to be the clear bid winner , coming in a full 20 percent lower than epi .
but eads gave europrop time to revise its offer , noting the strong " political dimension " of the contract award .
it is currently unclear whether europrop lowered its bid the full 20 percent or just 10 percent , but apparently it was enough to satisfy eads chairman manfred bischoff .
" we have decided to opt in favor of the engine supplied by the european consortium as presenting overall the best solution , and in light of a substantial effort on the agreed-upon price . "
pressure from france europrop groups the french state-owned engine-maker snecma , rolls royce of britain , mtu of germany and itp of spain .
eads and airbus are reported to have come under strong pressure from european governments led by france - which owns snecma as well as a 0.06 percent share in eads - to choose europrop over its north american rival .
the contract to supply the a400m engines is seen as strategically important to the european aerospace industry .

how a successful last-minute lobbying campaign by european governments and business leaders kept a huge contract to build engines for a new airbus military transport plane in europe . european aerospace consortium eads chose europrop international to supply engines for its new a400m military transport planes , after the firm cut its price to come closer to a previous bid from canadian competitor pratt & whitney .
eads directors said tuesday they awarded the contract - valued at about us $ 3.4 billion -lrb- € 2.98 billion -rrb- - to europrop on tuesday " in light of -lrb- europrop 's -rrb- substantial effort " to make the price more attractive .
eads owns 80 percent of airbus .
' bizarre ' decision the decision was hailed as " unfair " and " bizarre " by a canadian aerospace lobbyist .
initially , pratt & whitney appeared to be the clear bid winner , coming in a full 20 percent lower than epi .
but eads gave europrop time to revise its offer , noting the strong " political dimension " of the contract award .
it is currently unclear whether europrop lowered its bid the full 20 percent or just 10 percent , but apparently it was enough to satisfy eads chairman manfred bischoff .
" we have decided to opt in favor of the engine supplied by the european consortium as presenting overall the best solution , and in light of a substantial effort on the agreed-upon price . "
pressure from france europrop groups the french state-owned engine-maker snecma , rolls royce of britain , mtu of germany and itp of spain .
eads and airbus are reported to have come under strong pressure from european governments led by france - which owns snecma as well as a 0.06 percent share in eads - to choose europrop over its north american rival .
the contract to supply the a400m engines is seen as strategically important to the european aerospace industry .

starting may 8 , an exhibition celebrating the career of italian fashion designer giorgio armani goes on show at berlin ’ s new national gallery . recognized as one of the most influential designers of the 20th century along with chanel , yves saint laurent and christian dior , the exhibition focuses on armani ’ s development and contribution to the world of fashion over the past 30 years . synonymous for good taste designed by acclaimed american theater director and visual artist robert wilson , the show has more than 500 sleek armani creations – long synonymous for good taste – ranging from tailored jackets for women , smoking , vests , close-fitting suits , blazers and evening gowns . draped on mannequins that parade in seemingly never ending lines in a massive shaded exhibition hall , wilson ’ s installation veers away from the chronology of the creations to focus instead on armani ’ s groundbreaking work with style and color . though armani first made his name with elegant and sensual men ’ s suits , it was his women ’ s wear that attracted later attention with its unconventional emphasis on unstructured ease and masculine shapes . the italian designer is universally credited with creating a timeless vision of modern casual attire with his philosophy that garments should be comfortable and simply designed , with a focus on clean lines and elegant functionality . this mantra has translated into elegant suits and blazers for the business woman , cool sporty clothes for a day out and richly embroidered robes for the evening .
for men , armani crafts equally sophisticated and perfectly tailored suits from rich fabrics . armani ’ s trademark " non-color " palette of black , gray and beige is evident throughout the berlin exhibition , though daring designs in pink , blue and green have also been thrown in .
the collection also chronicles armani ’ s successful drop dead glamour stint in the 1990s when he dressed hollywood stars such as george clooney , leonardo dicaprio , martin scorsese and jodie foster for the academy awards . " a moment of my work " the exhibition , which enjoyed successful runs at the guggenheim museum in new york in 2000 and a year later in bilbao , spain , has now been expanded to include video presentations and photographs that showcase armani ’ s latest creations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giorgio armani speaking in berlin on the eve of the exhibition , the well-tanned 68 year-old said that the show was a personal project for him : " each garment represents a moment of my work . " armani admitted that he never thought he ’ d ever land in a museum with his collection , but said that he was more than happy that the venue was berlin ’ s new national gallery designed by bauhaus master mies van der rohe .
" the garments are brought to the fore very well through the clean lines of the architecture and the discreet background , " he said .

military service in germany may be shortened , trabis could soon be on the roads of africa and the price of a german pint is set to rise again . german military service to be shortened germans may soon only have to undergo six months of mandatory military service instead of nine , the german federal armed forces association said on wednesday .
the head of association , berhard gertz , said he hoped for a decision to be reached this year .

holsten said they were only raising the prices for canned and bottled beer ; prices for draught beer will remain the same .
the price changes come into effect on june 10 .
germany 's second and third largest breweries , warsteiner and radeberger , have also raised their prices this year .
prices for one of germany 's favorite drinks rose by 7 percent in 2002 .
the increases were put down to rising production and raw material costs . trabis for africa the once ubiquitous trabant might be a rare sight on east german streets nowadays , but if all goes according to plan for a trabi manufacturer from the german state of saxony , the cars may soon be on the roads of africa .

military service in germany may be shortened , trabis could soon be on the roads of africa and the price of a german pint is set to rise again . german military service to be shortened germans may soon only have to undergo six months of mandatory military service instead of nine , the german federal armed forces association said on wednesday .
the head of association , berhard gertz , said he hoped for a decision to be reached this year .
the new rules could become law by 2004 , he added .
under german law , all german males over the age of 18 must do military service .
conscientious objectors may do community service instead , working for organizations such as the international red cross and in german hospitals . price of beer to go up germany 's largest brewery announced today it would be hiking the price of a german pint by 5 cents a liter .
holsten said they were only raising the prices for canned and bottled beer ; prices for draught beer will remain the same .
the price changes come into effect on june 10 .
germany 's second and third largest breweries , warsteiner and radeberger , have also raised their prices this year .
prices for one of germany 's favorite drinks rose by 7 percent in 2002 .
the increases were put down to rising production and raw material costs . trabis for africa the once ubiquitous trabant might be a rare sight on east german streets nowadays , but if all goes according to plan for a trabi manufacturer from the german state of saxony , the cars may soon be on the roads of africa .
developers of the specially constructed trabi , renamed the " africar , " say it is perfect for africa , since it needs little gasoline and is easily repaired .
costing € 3,000 -lrb- $ 3,400 -rrb- , the africar could be on the streets of africa within two years , if enough investors can be found .

but to companies across europe , the falling euro made their exports cheaper in key markets around the world . but that was after the euro slumped from $ 1.18 at its introduction in january 1999 to its all-time low of $ 0.82 in october 2000 .
in recent months , as the united states has slashed interest rates to spur growth and amid global uncertainty due to the war in iraq , the euro has surged to hit its highest level against the dollar since february 1999 . exporters worried in this year alone , the currency has jumped over seven percent against the greenback and is now worth more than $ 1.12 .
germany ’ s top exporters are starting to worry an even stronger euro could hurt business .
europe ’ s largest carmaker volkswagen ag said last month that earnings in 2003 would decline for the second year in a row as the euro ’ s strength hurt sales overseas . " if you 're from a high cost country and your currency is strengthening and your competitors are effectively lowering prices , then you 're squeezing profits , " paul taylor , chief economist at the u.s. national automobile dealers association , told the dow jones news agency .
" exchange rates have to be part of this tapestry .

the weak dollar is already weighing on us , ” siemens chairman heinrich von pierer told wirtschaftswoche magazine in an interview .
euro hits manufacturing in a further sign of trouble , european manufacturing contracted for the seventh time in eight months in april , as the euro curbed export orders .
an index based on reuters ’ survey of purchasing managers at about 2,500 euro zone companies fell to 47.8 from 48.4 in march , even as most economists had predicted the index to rise . the rising euro is particularly dangerous for germany , since its economy is one of the world ’ s most export-driven .
on april 28 , the german government cut its official growth forecast for 2003 .
instead of its previous forecast of 1 percent , the economic ministry now expects europe ’ s largest economy to expand only 0.75 percent this year . but bundesbank vice president jürgen stark said on thursday the euro ’ s rise was not entirely a bad thing for the region .
he pointed out that as the euro climbs , dollar-denominated goods such as oil become less expensive , which decreases the risk of importing inflation from abroad . that in turn could enable the european central bank to cut interest rates to help spark growth in the coming weeks . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de still mourning the mark nearly one year after the euro went into circulation , two-thirds of germans surveyed say they aren ’ t happy with it .

how a successful last-minute lobbying campaign by european governments and business leaders kept a huge contract to build engines for a new airbus military transport plane in europe . european aerospace consortium eads chose europrop international to supply engines for its new a400m military transport planes , after the firm cut its price to come closer to a previous bid from canadian competitor pratt & whitney .
eads directors said tuesday they awarded the contract - valued at about us $ 3.4 billion -lrb- € 2.98 billion -rrb- - to europrop on tuesday " in light of -lrb- europrop 's -rrb- substantial effort " to make the price more attractive .
eads owns 80 percent of airbus .

initially , pratt & whitney appeared to be the clear bid winner , coming in a full 20 percent lower than epi .
but eads gave europrop time to revise its offer , noting the strong " political dimension " of the contract award .
it is currently unclear whether europrop lowered its bid the full 20 percent or just 10 percent , but apparently it was enough to satisfy eads chairman manfred bischoff .
" we have decided to opt in favor of the engine supplied by the european consortium as presenting overall the best solution , and in light of a substantial effort on the agreed-upon price . "

eads and airbus are reported to have come under strong pressure from european governments led by france - which owns snecma as well as a 0.06 percent share in eads - to choose europrop over its north american rival .
the contract to supply the a400m engines is seen as strategically important to the european aerospace industry .

how a successful last-minute lobbying campaign by european governments and business leaders kept a huge contract to build engines for a new airbus military transport plane in europe . european aerospace consortium eads chose europrop international to supply engines for its new a400m military transport planes , after the firm cut its price to come closer to a previous bid from canadian competitor pratt & whitney .
eads directors said tuesday they awarded the contract - valued at about us $ 3.4 billion -lrb- € 2.98 billion -rrb- - to europrop on tuesday " in light of -lrb- europrop 's -rrb- substantial effort " to make the price more attractive .
eads owns 80 percent of airbus .
' bizarre ' decision the decision was hailed as " unfair " and " bizarre " by a canadian aerospace lobbyist .
initially , pratt & whitney appeared to be the clear bid winner , coming in a full 20 percent lower than epi .
but eads gave europrop time to revise its offer , noting the strong " political dimension " of the contract award .
it is currently unclear whether europrop lowered its bid the full 20 percent or just 10 percent , but apparently it was enough to satisfy eads chairman manfred bischoff .
" we have decided to opt in favor of the engine supplied by the european consortium as presenting overall the best solution , and in light of a substantial effort on the agreed-upon price . "
pressure from france europrop groups the french state-owned engine-maker snecma , rolls royce of britain , mtu of germany and itp of spain .
eads and airbus are reported to have come under strong pressure from european governments led by france - which owns snecma as well as a 0.06 percent share in eads - to choose europrop over its north american rival .
the contract to supply the a400m engines is seen as strategically important to the european aerospace industry .
the a400m is the answer to several european countries ' pressing need for their own military-airlift vehicle .
its launch is scheduled for 2009 , and 180 orders are already on the books . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in brief airbus is under pressure to favor european engine makers in a deal to build its new military cargo plane .

a new exhibition in berlin explores the career of iconic italian fashion designer giorgio armani .
more than 500 of his sleek creations spanning three decades of his career are on display . berlin ’ s fashion mavens might soon head to a museum instead of the city ’ s many chic boutiques .
starting may 8 , an exhibition celebrating the career of italian fashion designer giorgio armani goes on show at berlin ’ s new national gallery . recognized as one of the most influential designers of the 20th century along with chanel , yves saint laurent and christian dior , the exhibition focuses on armani ’ s development and contribution to the world of fashion over the past 30 years . synonymous for good taste designed by acclaimed american theater director and visual artist robert wilson , the show has more than 500 sleek armani creations – long synonymous for good taste – ranging from tailored jackets for women , smoking , vests , close-fitting suits , blazers and evening gowns . draped on mannequins that parade in seemingly never ending lines in a massive shaded exhibition hall , wilson ’ s installation veers away from the chronology of the creations to focus instead on armani ’ s groundbreaking work with style and color . though armani first made his name with elegant and sensual men ’ s suits , it was his women ’ s wear that attracted later attention with its unconventional emphasis on unstructured ease and masculine shapes . the italian designer is universally credited with creating a timeless vision of modern casual attire with his philosophy that garments should be comfortable and simply designed , with a focus on clean lines and elegant functionality . this mantra has translated into elegant suits and blazers for the business woman , cool sporty clothes for a day out and richly embroidered robes for the evening .
for men , armani crafts equally sophisticated and perfectly tailored suits from rich fabrics . armani ’ s trademark " non-color " palette of black , gray and beige is evident throughout the berlin exhibition , though daring designs in pink , blue and green have also been thrown in .
the collection also chronicles armani ’ s successful drop dead glamour stint in the 1990s when he dressed hollywood stars such as george clooney , leonardo dicaprio , martin scorsese and jodie foster for the academy awards . " a moment of my work " the exhibition , which enjoyed successful runs at the guggenheim museum in new york in 2000 and a year later in bilbao , spain , has now been expanded to include video presentations and photographs that showcase armani ’ s latest creations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giorgio armani speaking in berlin on the eve of the exhibition , the well-tanned 68 year-old said that the show was a personal project for him : " each garment represents a moment of my work . " armani admitted that he never thought he ’ d ever land in a museum with his collection , but said that he was more than happy that the venue was berlin ’ s new national gallery designed by bauhaus master mies van der rohe .
" the garments are brought to the fore very well through the clean lines of the architecture and the discreet background , " he said .
the exhibition " giorgio armani " will be showing at the national gallery in berlin from may 8 to july 13 , 2003 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin pulls off arts coup the german capital may be bankrupt , but its arts scene can still pack a punch .

how a successful last-minute lobbying campaign by european governments and business leaders kept a huge contract to build engines for a new airbus military transport plane in europe . european aerospace consortium eads chose europrop international to supply engines for its new a400m military transport planes , after the firm cut its price to come closer to a previous bid from canadian competitor pratt & whitney .
eads directors said tuesday they awarded the contract - valued at about us $ 3.4 billion -lrb- € 2.98 billion -rrb- - to europrop on tuesday " in light of -lrb- europrop 's -rrb- substantial effort " to make the price more attractive .
eads owns 80 percent of airbus .
' bizarre ' decision the decision was hailed as " unfair " and " bizarre " by a canadian aerospace lobbyist .
initially , pratt & whitney appeared to be the clear bid winner , coming in a full 20 percent lower than epi .
but eads gave europrop time to revise its offer , noting the strong " political dimension " of the contract award .
it is currently unclear whether europrop lowered its bid the full 20 percent or just 10 percent , but apparently it was enough to satisfy eads chairman manfred bischoff .
" we have decided to opt in favor of the engine supplied by the european consortium as presenting overall the best solution , and in light of a substantial effort on the agreed-upon price . "
pressure from france europrop groups the french state-owned engine-maker snecma , rolls royce of britain , mtu of germany and itp of spain .
eads and airbus are reported to have come under strong pressure from european governments led by france - which owns snecma as well as a 0.06 percent share in eads - to choose europrop over its north american rival .
the contract to supply the a400m engines is seen as strategically important to the european aerospace industry .
the a400m is the answer to several european countries ' pressing need for their own military-airlift vehicle .
its launch is scheduled for 2009 , and 180 orders are already on the books . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in brief airbus is under pressure to favor european engine makers in a deal to build its new military cargo plane .

but to companies across europe , the falling euro made their exports cheaper in key markets around the world . but that was after the euro slumped from $ 1.18 at its introduction in january 1999 to its all-time low of $ 0.82 in october 2000 .
in recent months , as the united states has slashed interest rates to spur growth and amid global uncertainty due to the war in iraq , the euro has surged to hit its highest level against the dollar since february 1999 . exporters worried in this year alone , the currency has jumped over seven percent against the greenback and is now worth more than $ 1.12 .
germany ’ s top exporters are starting to worry an even stronger euro could hurt business .
europe ’ s largest carmaker volkswagen ag said last month that earnings in 2003 would decline for the second year in a row as the euro ’ s strength hurt sales overseas . " if you 're from a high cost country and your currency is strengthening and your competitors are effectively lowering prices , then you 're squeezing profits , " paul taylor , chief economist at the u.s. national automobile dealers association , told the dow jones news agency .
" exchange rates have to be part of this tapestry . " german industrial giant siemens also recently warned that it may have to cut more jobs since the falling dollar is increasing price competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ price hikes just can ’ t be forced through at the moment .
the weak dollar is already weighing on us , ” siemens chairman heinrich von pierer told wirtschaftswoche magazine in an interview .
euro hits manufacturing in a further sign of trouble , european manufacturing contracted for the seventh time in eight months in april , as the euro curbed export orders .
an index based on reuters ’ survey of purchasing managers at about 2,500 euro zone companies fell to 47.8 from 48.4 in march , even as most economists had predicted the index to rise . the rising euro is particularly dangerous for germany , since its economy is one of the world ’ s most export-driven .
on april 28 , the german government cut its official growth forecast for 2003 .
instead of its previous forecast of 1 percent , the economic ministry now expects europe ’ s largest economy to expand only 0.75 percent this year . but bundesbank vice president jürgen stark said on thursday the euro ’ s rise was not entirely a bad thing for the region .
he pointed out that as the euro climbs , dollar-denominated goods such as oil become less expensive , which decreases the risk of importing inflation from abroad . that in turn could enable the european central bank to cut interest rates to help spark growth in the coming weeks . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de still mourning the mark nearly one year after the euro went into circulation , two-thirds of germans surveyed say they aren ’ t happy with it .
their european neighbors on the other hand have developed a better relationship with the new money .

how a successful last-minute lobbying campaign by european governments and business leaders kept a huge contract to build engines for a new airbus military transport plane in europe . european aerospace consortium eads chose europrop international to supply engines for its new a400m military transport planes , after the firm cut its price to come closer to a previous bid from canadian competitor pratt & whitney .
eads directors said tuesday they awarded the contract - valued at about us $ 3.4 billion -lrb- € 2.98 billion -rrb- - to europrop on tuesday " in light of -lrb- europrop 's -rrb- substantial effort " to make the price more attractive .
eads owns 80 percent of airbus .
' bizarre ' decision the decision was hailed as " unfair " and " bizarre " by a canadian aerospace lobbyist .
initially , pratt & whitney appeared to be the clear bid winner , coming in a full 20 percent lower than epi .
but eads gave europrop time to revise its offer , noting the strong " political dimension " of the contract award .
it is currently unclear whether europrop lowered its bid the full 20 percent or just 10 percent , but apparently it was enough to satisfy eads chairman manfred bischoff .
" we have decided to opt in favor of the engine supplied by the european consortium as presenting overall the best solution , and in light of a substantial effort on the agreed-upon price . "
pressure from france europrop groups the french state-owned engine-maker snecma , rolls royce of britain , mtu of germany and itp of spain .
eads and airbus are reported to have come under strong pressure from european governments led by france - which owns snecma as well as a 0.06 percent share in eads - to choose europrop over its north american rival .
the contract to supply the a400m engines is seen as strategically important to the european aerospace industry .
the a400m is the answer to several european countries ' pressing need for their own military-airlift vehicle .
its launch is scheduled for 2009 , and 180 orders are already on the books . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in brief airbus is under pressure to favor european engine makers in a deal to build its new military cargo plane .

how a successful last-minute lobbying campaign by european governments and business leaders kept a huge contract to build engines for a new airbus military transport plane in europe . european aerospace consortium eads chose europrop international to supply engines for its new a400m military transport planes , after the firm cut its price to come closer to a previous bid from canadian competitor pratt & whitney .
eads directors said tuesday they awarded the contract - valued at about us $ 3.4 billion -lrb- € 2.98 billion -rrb- - to europrop on tuesday " in light of -lrb- europrop 's -rrb- substantial effort " to make the price more attractive .
eads owns 80 percent of airbus .
' bizarre ' decision the decision was hailed as " unfair " and " bizarre " by a canadian aerospace lobbyist .
initially , pratt & whitney appeared to be the clear bid winner , coming in a full 20 percent lower than epi .
but eads gave europrop time to revise its offer , noting the strong " political dimension " of the contract award .
it is currently unclear whether europrop lowered its bid the full 20 percent or just 10 percent , but apparently it was enough to satisfy eads chairman manfred bischoff .

eads and airbus are reported to have come under strong pressure from european governments led by france - which owns snecma as well as a 0.06 percent share in eads - to choose europrop over its north american rival .
the contract to supply the a400m engines is seen as strategically important to the european aerospace industry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.05.2003 daimlerchrysler turns five großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things can only get better for daimlerchrysler , industry analysts say .
out of the merger of germany 's daimler-benz and the u.s. carmaker chrysler came daimlerchrysler in 1998 .
but after a honeymoon in hell , the world 's third largest car manufacturer is looking forward to better days . it was dubbed " a wedding made in heaven " by the marriage brokers five years ago . in a series of secret meetings in early 1998 , the chief executives of germany 's daimler-benz and america 's chrysler met and sealed a deal to merge the carmakers .
when the news finally leaked to the wall street journal in may , negotiations had nearly been completed .
on may 7 , daimler ceo jürgen schrempp and chrysler ceo bob eaton confirmed the merger and proclaimed the creation of the daimlerchrysler . five years on , investors are not exactly in a celebratory mood about the so-called “ merger of equals . ”
instead of the two companies combining forces and synergies as was promised at the time , the merger was , in effect , a takeover .
daimler-benz acquired chrysler , improving its position in its most-important auto market , the united states . at the same time , however , daimler-benz inadvertently burdened itself with numerous problems that , like those associated with the purchase of a used car , only came to the surface in time . chrysler in the doldrums in january 2000 , four months after the merger became official , chrysler reported first-quarter losses and eaton tendered his resignation as joint chief executive .
daimler ’ s jürgen schrempp became the sole ceo and , once the extent of chrysler ’ s problems came to light , brought in german dieter zetzsche to reorganize its ailing u.s. partner . zetzsche slashed 26,000 jobs and closed six factories , but he got chrysler back on its feet in 2002 and he ’ s now seen as the company ’ s savior in detroit .
operative profits reached € 152 million in the first quarter of this year . still , the company is not out of danger .
competition in the u.s. remains fierce , particularly in light of the prices wars spurred on by general motors and ford . daimlerchrysler moved further into the asian market in 2000 , buying 37.1 percent of mitsubishi motors , another carmaker in the red .
schrempp sent in another german manager , rolf eckrodt , to take the reins and lead the japanese firm back into the realm of profit-making . share prices catapult times have been especially rough for the german-american firm since its initial public offering in 1998 .
shares that sold for € 100 at the time are now trading at around € 30 .
at the time of the merger , daimler was valued at € 53 billion and chrysler at around € 32 billion .
five years later , the combined companies have a market capitalization of about € 30 billion , less than half their combined original values . but at the time of the merger , daimlerchrysler executives had the companies ' long-term perspectives in mind .
now it can boast that it is not only the world ’ s third-largest carmaker but also the number one commercial vehicle manufacturer .
and industry analysts agree that its best times still lie ahead . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carmakers unveil suvs and beetles in detroit in motor city detroit , german automakers from volkswagen to porsche are demonstrating their plans to conquer the sport utility sector .

out of the merger of germany 's daimler-benz and the u.s. carmaker chrysler came daimlerchrysler in 1998 .
but after a honeymoon in hell , the world 's third largest car manufacturer is looking forward to better days . it was dubbed " a wedding made in heaven " by the marriage brokers five years ago . in a series of secret meetings in early 1998 , the chief executives of germany 's daimler-benz and america 's chrysler met and sealed a deal to merge the carmakers .
when the news finally leaked to the wall street journal in may , negotiations had nearly been completed .
on may 7 , daimler ceo jürgen schrempp and chrysler ceo bob eaton confirmed the merger and proclaimed the creation of the daimlerchrysler . five years on , investors are not exactly in a celebratory mood about the so-called “ merger of equals . ”
instead of the two companies combining forces and synergies as was promised at the time , the merger was , in effect , a takeover .

daimler ’ s jürgen schrempp became the sole ceo and , once the extent of chrysler ’ s problems came to light , brought in german dieter zetzsche to reorganize its ailing u.s. partner . zetzsche slashed 26,000 jobs and closed six factories , but he got chrysler back on its feet in 2002 and he ’ s now seen as the company ’ s savior in detroit .
operative profits reached € 152 million in the first quarter of this year . still , the company is not out of danger .
competition in the u.s. remains fierce , particularly in light of the prices wars spurred on by general motors and ford . daimlerchrysler moved further into the asian market in 2000 , buying 37.1 percent of mitsubishi motors , another carmaker in the red .

military service in germany may be shortened , trabis could soon be on the roads of africa and the price of a german pint is set to rise again . german military service to be shortened germans may soon only have to undergo six months of mandatory military service instead of nine , the german federal armed forces association said on wednesday .
the head of association , berhard gertz , said he hoped for a decision to be reached this year .
the new rules could become law by 2004 , he added .
under german law , all german males over the age of 18 must do military service .
conscientious objectors may do community service instead , working for organizations such as the international red cross and in german hospitals . price of beer to go up germany 's largest brewery announced today it would be hiking the price of a german pint by 5 cents a liter .
holsten said they were only raising the prices for canned and bottled beer ; prices for draught beer will remain the same .
the price changes come into effect on june 10 .
germany 's second and third largest breweries , warsteiner and radeberger , have also raised their prices this year .
prices for one of germany 's favorite drinks rose by 7 percent in 2002 .
the increases were put down to rising production and raw material costs . trabis for africa the once ubiquitous trabant might be a rare sight on east german streets nowadays , but if all goes according to plan for a trabi manufacturer from the german state of saxony , the cars may soon be on the roads of africa .

conscientious objectors may do community service instead , working for organizations such as the international red cross and in german hospitals . price of beer to go up germany 's largest brewery announced today it would be hiking the price of a german pint by 5 cents a liter .
holsten said they were only raising the prices for canned and bottled beer ; prices for draught beer will remain the same .

in recent months , as the united states has slashed interest rates to spur growth and amid global uncertainty due to the war in iraq , the euro has surged to hit its highest level against the dollar since february 1999 . exporters worried in this year alone , the currency has jumped over seven percent against the greenback and is now worth more than $ 1.12 .
germany ’ s top exporters are starting to worry an even stronger euro could hurt business .

on april 28 , the german government cut its official growth forecast for 2003 .
instead of its previous forecast of 1 percent , the economic ministry now expects europe ’ s largest economy to expand only 0.75 percent this year . but bundesbank vice president jürgen stark said on thursday the euro ’ s rise was not entirely a bad thing for the region .

how a successful last-minute lobbying campaign by european governments and business leaders kept a huge contract to build engines for a new airbus military transport plane in europe . european aerospace consortium eads chose europrop international to supply engines for its new a400m military transport planes , after the firm cut its price to come closer to a previous bid from canadian competitor pratt & whitney .
eads directors said tuesday they awarded the contract - valued at about us $ 3.4 billion -lrb- € 2.98 billion -rrb- - to europrop on tuesday " in light of -lrb- europrop 's -rrb- substantial effort " to make the price more attractive .
eads owns 80 percent of airbus .
' bizarre ' decision the decision was hailed as " unfair " and " bizarre " by a canadian aerospace lobbyist .
initially , pratt & whitney appeared to be the clear bid winner , coming in a full 20 percent lower than epi .
but eads gave europrop time to revise its offer , noting the strong " political dimension " of the contract award .
it is currently unclear whether europrop lowered its bid the full 20 percent or just 10 percent , but apparently it was enough to satisfy eads chairman manfred bischoff .
" we have decided to opt in favor of the engine supplied by the european consortium as presenting overall the best solution , and in light of a substantial effort on the agreed-upon price . "
pressure from france europrop groups the french state-owned engine-maker snecma , rolls royce of britain , mtu of germany and itp of spain .
eads and airbus are reported to have come under strong pressure from european governments led by france - which owns snecma as well as a 0.06 percent share in eads - to choose europrop over its north american rival .
the contract to supply the a400m engines is seen as strategically important to the european aerospace industry .
the a400m is the answer to several european countries ' pressing need for their own military-airlift vehicle .
its launch is scheduled for 2009 , and 180 orders are already on the books . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in brief airbus is under pressure to favor european engine makers in a deal to build its new military cargo plane .

military service in germany may be shortened , trabis could soon be on the roads of africa and the price of a german pint is set to rise again . german military service to be shortened germans may soon only have to undergo six months of mandatory military service instead of nine , the german federal armed forces association said on wednesday .
the head of association , berhard gertz , said he hoped for a decision to be reached this year .
the new rules could become law by 2004 , he added .
under german law , all german males over the age of 18 must do military service .
conscientious objectors may do community service instead , working for organizations such as the international red cross and in german hospitals . price of beer to go up germany 's largest brewery announced today it would be hiking the price of a german pint by 5 cents a liter .
holsten said they were only raising the prices for canned and bottled beer ; prices for draught beer will remain the same .
the price changes come into effect on june 10 .
germany 's second and third largest breweries , warsteiner and radeberger , have also raised their prices this year .
prices for one of germany 's favorite drinks rose by 7 percent in 2002 .
the increases were put down to rising production and raw material costs . trabis for africa the once ubiquitous trabant might be a rare sight on east german streets nowadays , but if all goes according to plan for a trabi manufacturer from the german state of saxony , the cars may soon be on the roads of africa .
developers of the specially constructed trabi , renamed the " africar , " say it is perfect for africa , since it needs little gasoline and is easily repaired .
costing € 3,000 -lrb- $ 3,400 -rrb- , the africar could be on the streets of africa within two years , if enough investors can be found .

out of the merger of germany 's daimler-benz and the u.s. carmaker chrysler came daimlerchrysler in 1998 .
but after a honeymoon in hell , the world 's third largest car manufacturer is looking forward to better days . it was dubbed " a wedding made in heaven " by the marriage brokers five years ago . in a series of secret meetings in early 1998 , the chief executives of germany 's daimler-benz and america 's chrysler met and sealed a deal to merge the carmakers .
when the news finally leaked to the wall street journal in may , negotiations had nearly been completed .
on may 7 , daimler ceo jürgen schrempp and chrysler ceo bob eaton confirmed the merger and proclaimed the creation of the daimlerchrysler . five years on , investors are not exactly in a celebratory mood about the so-called “ merger of equals . ”
instead of the two companies combining forces and synergies as was promised at the time , the merger was , in effect , a takeover .
daimler-benz acquired chrysler , improving its position in its most-important auto market , the united states . at the same time , however , daimler-benz inadvertently burdened itself with numerous problems that , like those associated with the purchase of a used car , only came to the surface in time . chrysler in the doldrums in january 2000 , four months after the merger became official , chrysler reported first-quarter losses and eaton tendered his resignation as joint chief executive .
daimler ’ s jürgen schrempp became the sole ceo and , once the extent of chrysler ’ s problems came to light , brought in german dieter zetzsche to reorganize its ailing u.s. partner . zetzsche slashed 26,000 jobs and closed six factories , but he got chrysler back on its feet in 2002 and he ’ s now seen as the company ’ s savior in detroit .
operative profits reached € 152 million in the first quarter of this year . still , the company is not out of danger .
competition in the u.s. remains fierce , particularly in light of the prices wars spurred on by general motors and ford . daimlerchrysler moved further into the asian market in 2000 , buying 37.1 percent of mitsubishi motors , another carmaker in the red .
schrempp sent in another german manager , rolf eckrodt , to take the reins and lead the japanese firm back into the realm of profit-making . share prices catapult times have been especially rough for the german-american firm since its initial public offering in 1998 .
shares that sold for € 100 at the time are now trading at around € 30 .
at the time of the merger , daimler was valued at € 53 billion and chrysler at around € 32 billion .
five years later , the combined companies have a market capitalization of about € 30 billion , less than half their combined original values . but at the time of the merger , daimlerchrysler executives had the companies ' long-term perspectives in mind .
now it can boast that it is not only the world ’ s third-largest carmaker but also the number one commercial vehicle manufacturer .

germany ’ s cabinet on wednesday approved a wide-ranging plan that calls for greater transparency and information for the country 's consumers . up to now , germany ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens focused mostly on food safety when discussing consumer protection .
but the heart of a new consumer affairs proposal from german consumer protection minister renate künast focuses on better information for consumers . " we basically want to strengthen consumers as equal partners in market participation , so that they can act on their own behalf .
information is the basic building block for making independent decisions .

germany ’ s cabinet on wednesday approved a wide-ranging plan that calls for greater transparency and information for the country 's consumers . up to now , germany ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens focused mostly on food safety when discussing consumer protection .
but the heart of a new consumer affairs proposal from german consumer protection minister renate künast focuses on better information for consumers . " we basically want to strengthen consumers as equal partners in market participation , so that they can act on their own behalf .
information is the basic building block for making independent decisions .
freedom of choice and information belong together , " said künast , specifically , the plan says authorities should be able to warn consumers as soon as they have a well founded suspicion of a health threat from foods , cosmetics or other consumer goods .

how a successful last-minute lobbying campaign by european governments and business leaders kept a huge contract to build engines for a new airbus military transport plane in europe . european aerospace consortium eads chose europrop international to supply engines for its new a400m military transport planes , after the firm cut its price to come closer to a previous bid from canadian competitor pratt & whitney .
eads directors said tuesday they awarded the contract - valued at about us $ 3.4 billion -lrb- € 2.98 billion -rrb- - to europrop on tuesday " in light of -lrb- europrop 's -rrb- substantial effort " to make the price more attractive .
eads owns 80 percent of airbus .
' bizarre ' decision the decision was hailed as " unfair " and " bizarre " by a canadian aerospace lobbyist .
initially , pratt & whitney appeared to be the clear bid winner , coming in a full 20 percent lower than epi .
but eads gave europrop time to revise its offer , noting the strong " political dimension " of the contract award .
it is currently unclear whether europrop lowered its bid the full 20 percent or just 10 percent , but apparently it was enough to satisfy eads chairman manfred bischoff .
" we have decided to opt in favor of the engine supplied by the european consortium as presenting overall the best solution , and in light of a substantial effort on the agreed-upon price . "
pressure from france europrop groups the french state-owned engine-maker snecma , rolls royce of britain , mtu of germany and itp of spain .
eads and airbus are reported to have come under strong pressure from european governments led by france - which owns snecma as well as a 0.06 percent share in eads - to choose europrop over its north american rival .
the contract to supply the a400m engines is seen as strategically important to the european aerospace industry .
the a400m is the answer to several european countries ' pressing need for their own military-airlift vehicle .
its launch is scheduled for 2009 , and 180 orders are already on the books . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in brief airbus is under pressure to favor european engine makers in a deal to build its new military cargo plane .

previously , the us army corps of engineers had described the contract given to halliburton - run by us vice president dick cheney between 1995 and 2000 - as putting out fires at oil wells during the conflict .
the emergency contract for firefighting and capping iraqi oil wells was awarded to halliburton without a bidding process in march .
responding to questions from a us congressman , the us army corps of engineers has revealed that the contract included " operation of facilities and distribution of products " .
in a letter to senior democrat henry waxman on friday , army corps lt. gen. robert flowers added the contract with halliburton 's subsidiary kbr was a " bridge " to one that is open to other bidders .
" we will limit orders under this contract to those services required prior to the availability of competitively awarded contracts , " he wrote ' helping out ' halliburton said the wider role for its subsidiary kbr was announced on 24 march , when the deal was made public .
" kbr 's initial task involves hazard and operational assessment , extinguishing oil well fires , capping oil well blowouts , as well as responding to any oil spills , " the original halliburton statement said .
" following this task , kbr will perform emergency repair , as directed , to provide for the continuity of operations of the iraqi oil infrastructure , " it continued .
the halliburton spokeswoman said kbr was currently assisting iraq 's oil ministry .
" only now , over five weeks after the contract was first disclosed , are members of congress and the public learning that halliburton may be asked to pump and distribute iraqi oil under the contract , " said senior democrat henry waxman , who received the confirmation from the us army .
new deal mr waxman sits on the house of representatives ' committee on government reform .
mr cheney 's office has repeatedly denied the vice president had a role in awarding the contract .
the us government has been criticised for its handling of the reconstruction of iraq because only a select group of us companies have been invited to bid for the contracts .
the us army corps of engineers said the halliburton deal was a temporary measure before a contract was put out to tender in the coming months .
it expects a replacement contract to be signed by the end of august .
the us army said in early april that halliburton had been paid $ 50.3m out of the contract that could be worth up to $ 7bn over two years .

previously , the us army corps of engineers had described the contract given to halliburton - run by us vice president dick cheney between 1995 and 2000 - as putting out fires at oil wells during the conflict .
the emergency contract for firefighting and capping iraqi oil wells was awarded to halliburton without a bidding process in march .
responding to questions from a us congressman , the us army corps of engineers has revealed that the contract included " operation of facilities and distribution of products " .
in a letter to senior democrat henry waxman on friday , army corps lt. gen. robert flowers added the contract with halliburton 's subsidiary kbr was a " bridge " to one that is open to other bidders .
" we will limit orders under this contract to those services required prior to the availability of competitively awarded contracts , " he wrote ' helping out ' halliburton said the wider role for its subsidiary kbr was announced on 24 march , when the deal was made public .
" kbr 's initial task involves hazard and operational assessment , extinguishing oil well fires , capping oil well blowouts , as well as responding to any oil spills , " the original halliburton statement said .
" following this task , kbr will perform emergency repair , as directed , to provide for the continuity of operations of the iraqi oil infrastructure , " it continued .
the halliburton spokeswoman said kbr was currently assisting iraq 's oil ministry .
" only now , over five weeks after the contract was first disclosed , are members of congress and the public learning that halliburton may be asked to pump and distribute iraqi oil under the contract , " said senior democrat henry waxman , who received the confirmation from the us army .
new deal mr waxman sits on the house of representatives ' committee on government reform .
mr cheney 's office has repeatedly denied the vice president had a role in awarding the contract .
the us government has been criticised for its handling of the reconstruction of iraq because only a select group of us companies have been invited to bid for the contracts .
the us army corps of engineers said the halliburton deal was a temporary measure before a contract was put out to tender in the coming months .
it expects a replacement contract to be signed by the end of august .
the us army said in early april that halliburton had been paid $ 50.3m out of the contract that could be worth up to $ 7bn over two years .

there was no lifeguard on the beach at the weekend because the service , which is funded by north devon district council , does not start until 17 may .
dangerous combination several surfers in difficulty were picked up by the appledore lifeboat during a dangerous combination of easterly winds and an ebbing tide .
some ended up on rocks as they made their own way in against the rip .
one surfer was taken to hospital by the raf 's search and rescue helicopter from chivenor .
the parkin estate then stationed someone on the beach to keep surfers away from the danger .
now safety measures are being examined , particularly when there is no lifeguard on duty .
