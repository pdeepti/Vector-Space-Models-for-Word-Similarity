the ongoing struggle to return artwork taken from germany during the last days of world war ii has caused a political conflict in russia as a disputed collection of drawings recently went on display in moscow . a collection of so-called " trophy art " from artists such as rembrandt , rubens and raphael has gone on display in moscow 's museum of architecture , causing a political squabble between two of russia 's most prominent culture ministry figures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artwork is seen as compensation for the destruction prior to the german defeat .
current minister for culture mikhail shvydkoi argues that the 362 drawings and two small paintings , among thousands of works of art that were taken from the defeated nations after the end of world war ii , should be returned .
his predecessor and communist member of parliament , nikolai gubenko , opposes returning trophy art , especially without compensation .
collection taken from german castle the collection in question was taken from a german castle , schloss karnzow , near the town of kyritz north of berlin at the end of world war ii by viktor baldin , a soviet army captain .
after dragging the masterworks back to the soviet union in a suitcase , baldin kept the collection under a bed in his office for three years before he gave it to the moscow museum in 1948 .
the collection was transferred to the hermitage museum in st. petersburg in 1991 and returned to moscow for the opening of the exhibition this weekend , along with copies of baldin 's letters and accounts of his quest to return the art .
baldin , also an art restorer and later director of the architecture museum in moscow , always maintained his desire to return the artworks to their owner , the bremen kunsthalle .
however , after many aborted attempts , thwarted by various communist leaders during the cold war , baldin 's wish was not fulfilled during his lifetime .
even after the collapse of the soviet union , calls for the art to be returned to germany fell on deaf ears .
many russians feel the trophy art is rightful compensation for the 20 million deaths , untold injuries and immense destruction the soviet union suffered from the nazi invasion .
resentment concerning the issue has simmered since the end of world war ii .
proposed return of collection deemed illegal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " displaced " art on show the current argument between the two culture ministers over the fate of the collection erupted publicly last week when the russian prosecutor general 's office stepped into the fight , warning shvydkoi that it would be illegal to send the collection to germany .
current russian law refuses to accept " displaced " artworks as stolen , instead deeming them spoils of war .
former culture minister gubenko claims the collection , which also includes examples of work by titian , albrecht dürer and eugène delacroix , is worth around € 1.37 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- although architecture museum director david sarkisian said at the opening of the exhibition that he estimated it to be worth less .
sarkisian was quoted in the moscow times as saying that a russian auction house , gelos , had appraised the collection at about € 21.6 million , with one work alone , a goya portrait , worth more than € 3.7 million .
war for culture sarkisian said it was " sad " that the works had caused a " political scandal and an atmosphere of controversy . "
" as museum guardians , we do n't want to start any fights , " he added .
" in all spheres , the war is over for us .
we 're already friendly with germans , we marry them , we dream of traveling there and they here .
but for some reason , there 's a terrible war going on for culture . "
baldin 's widow told of her late husband 's long campaign for the works to be returned to germany at saturday 's opening .
yulia baldin said the works should be handed back and that opponents to her husband 's wishes should " calm down . "
she added that she hoped that common sense would prevail .
russia denies " looted " claim the subject of " looted " art and its return continues to be a very sensitive one between germany and russia .
in 2001 , the russian ministry of culture established an interdepartmental council of experts , which announced that european cultural treasures taken to russia as war spoils by army brigades in the postwar period would no longer be regarded as " looted art . "
instead , they would be officially referred to as " compensation " for losses suffered .
the russian parliament then passed a law legalizing its claim to " works of art displaced by war " and negotiations between russia and germany ground to a halt .
concessions made bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an amber room masterpiece returned to russia however , progress and concessions have been made .
germany has since returned two mosaics from the famous amber room from catherine the great 's palace near st. petersburg to their russian owners .
russia responded by granting an export license for 101 drawings and engravings from the bremen kunsthalle , which had been handed over to the german embassy in moscow several years previously by a red army war veteran .

the ongoing struggle to return artwork taken from germany during the last days of world war ii has caused a political conflict in russia as a disputed collection of drawings recently went on display in moscow . a collection of so-called " trophy art " from artists such as rembrandt , rubens and raphael has gone on display in moscow 's museum of architecture , causing a political squabble between two of russia 's most prominent culture ministry figures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artwork is seen as compensation for the destruction prior to the german defeat .
current minister for culture mikhail shvydkoi argues that the 362 drawings and two small paintings , among thousands of works of art that were taken from the defeated nations after the end of world war ii , should be returned .
his predecessor and communist member of parliament , nikolai gubenko , opposes returning trophy art , especially without compensation .
collection taken from german castle the collection in question was taken from a german castle , schloss karnzow , near the town of kyritz north of berlin at the end of world war ii by viktor baldin , a soviet army captain .
after dragging the masterworks back to the soviet union in a suitcase , baldin kept the collection under a bed in his office for three years before he gave it to the moscow museum in 1948 .
the collection was transferred to the hermitage museum in st. petersburg in 1991 and returned to moscow for the opening of the exhibition this weekend , along with copies of baldin 's letters and accounts of his quest to return the art .
baldin , also an art restorer and later director of the architecture museum in moscow , always maintained his desire to return the artworks to their owner , the bremen kunsthalle .
however , after many aborted attempts , thwarted by various communist leaders during the cold war , baldin 's wish was not fulfilled during his lifetime .
even after the collapse of the soviet union , calls for the art to be returned to germany fell on deaf ears .
many russians feel the trophy art is rightful compensation for the 20 million deaths , untold injuries and immense destruction the soviet union suffered from the nazi invasion .
resentment concerning the issue has simmered since the end of world war ii .
proposed return of collection deemed illegal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " displaced " art on show the current argument between the two culture ministers over the fate of the collection erupted publicly last week when the russian prosecutor general 's office stepped into the fight , warning shvydkoi that it would be illegal to send the collection to germany .
current russian law refuses to accept " displaced " artworks as stolen , instead deeming them spoils of war .
former culture minister gubenko claims the collection , which also includes examples of work by titian , albrecht dürer and eugène delacroix , is worth around € 1.37 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- although architecture museum director david sarkisian said at the opening of the exhibition that he estimated it to be worth less .
sarkisian was quoted in the moscow times as saying that a russian auction house , gelos , had appraised the collection at about € 21.6 million , with one work alone , a goya portrait , worth more than € 3.7 million .
war for culture sarkisian said it was " sad " that the works had caused a " political scandal and an atmosphere of controversy . "
" as museum guardians , we do n't want to start any fights , " he added .
" in all spheres , the war is over for us .
we 're already friendly with germans , we marry them , we dream of traveling there and they here .
but for some reason , there 's a terrible war going on for culture . "
baldin 's widow told of her late husband 's long campaign for the works to be returned to germany at saturday 's opening .
yulia baldin said the works should be handed back and that opponents to her husband 's wishes should " calm down . "
she added that she hoped that common sense would prevail .
russia denies " looted " claim the subject of " looted " art and its return continues to be a very sensitive one between germany and russia .
in 2001 , the russian ministry of culture established an interdepartmental council of experts , which announced that european cultural treasures taken to russia as war spoils by army brigades in the postwar period would no longer be regarded as " looted art . "
instead , they would be officially referred to as " compensation " for losses suffered .
the russian parliament then passed a law legalizing its claim to " works of art displaced by war " and negotiations between russia and germany ground to a halt .
concessions made bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an amber room masterpiece returned to russia however , progress and concessions have been made .
germany has since returned two mosaics from the famous amber room from catherine the great 's palace near st. petersburg to their russian owners .
russia responded by granting an export license for 101 drawings and engravings from the bremen kunsthalle , which had been handed over to the german embassy in moscow several years previously by a red army war veteran .
in april last year , the russian parliament rushed through a bill allowing the return to germany of medieval stained-glass windows that were looted by the red army at the end of world war ii .
it was seen as a gesture of goodwill timed to coincide with a trip to germany by president vladimir putin . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , moscow tighten ties through culture russian president putin and german president rau kicked off an ambitious russian-german cultural project in berlin and vowed to intensify cultural exchange .

the european union has assumed control of the peacekeeping operation in macedonia from nato .
despite their deep disagreements over the war in iraq , eu members continue to push plans for a joint military policy . it was a simple task .
the flag of the north atlantic treaty organization was removed on monday from the peacekeeping force in the small southeastern european country of macedonia and was replaced with the flag of the european union .
but though the move may have been simple , it is filled with symbolic meaning for the eu , the 15-member organization that has seen its effort to form a collective security policy torn apart by the u.s.-led war against iraq .
" it is a test , above all a political one , " andre dumoulin of the belgian royal military school said of the macedonia mission .
the eu force of about 350 soldiers , dubbed operation concordia , is taking over from nato troops which remained in the battle-scarred former yugoslav republic after helping end a seven-month ethnic insurrection in 2001 .
all eu countries except denmark and finland will contribute to the force , which has a six-month renewable mandate , along with 14 other nations including canada , poland and turkey .
germany plans to deploy up to 70 soldiers .
nato works in the background even though the mission is officially in eu hands , nato will still provide planning support and the overall commander , german admiral rainer feist is also the alliance 's deputy supreme allied commander in europe .
" it is notable that both organizations - nato and in the future the european union - have begun a very successful mission and will continue to operate it , " feist told dw-world .
" you really have to say that even though this mission is small , it stopped a civil war from breaking out in macedonia . "
macedonia appeared to be on the brink of civil war in the winter of 2001 , when ethnic albanian gunmen launched an insurgency to seek more rights for members of their community .
albanians make up around a quarter of the country 's two million people .
they live mostly in the west , along macedonia 's border with albania and kosovo .
eventually , about 150 people were killed in the fighting .
a peace accord signed in august 2001 formalized many of those rights and opened the way for 4,500 nato troops to collect weapons laid down by rebels .
the size and nature of the mission changed afterward .
the force was cut to about 350 soldiers who were assigned to protect international observers .
the mission of the new force , known as eufor , will be to monitor the situation and show a visible international presence .
eu plans bigger role in balkans the force is the first concrete manifestation of the eu 's security ambitions .
it is also an indication of europe 's aim to assume a bigger role in the balkans , where it has been running a police mission in bosnia-hercegovina since january .
the eu is also considering the possibility of taking over responsibility for the 12,000-member stabilization force in bosnia from nato .
eu leaders raised the prospect of taking over sfor in december .
france and britain have suggested a possible handover at the start of next year .
the launch of the operation comes as the 15-member union works to build a functioning defense arm as part of efforts to fill the gulf between its military capabilities and those of the united states .
the spearhead of the eu 's military might is to be a rapid reaction force of 60,000 troops ready to be deployed on short notice to peacekeeping operations across the region .
this reaction force is to be up and running from may .
members divided over iraq but the launch in macedonia comes at a bad time for the eu , which is struggling to heal unprecedented rifts caused by the war on iraq .

the european union has assumed control of the peacekeeping operation in macedonia from nato .
despite their deep disagreements over the war in iraq , eu members continue to push plans for a joint military policy . it was a simple task .
the flag of the north atlantic treaty organization was removed on monday from the peacekeeping force in the small southeastern european country of macedonia and was replaced with the flag of the european union .
but though the move may have been simple , it is filled with symbolic meaning for the eu , the 15-member organization that has seen its effort to form a collective security policy torn apart by the u.s.-led war against iraq .
" it is a test , above all a political one , " andre dumoulin of the belgian royal military school said of the macedonia mission .
the eu force of about 350 soldiers , dubbed operation concordia , is taking over from nato troops which remained in the battle-scarred former yugoslav republic after helping end a seven-month ethnic insurrection in 2001 .
all eu countries except denmark and finland will contribute to the force , which has a six-month renewable mandate , along with 14 other nations including canada , poland and turkey .
germany plans to deploy up to 70 soldiers .
nato works in the background even though the mission is officially in eu hands , nato will still provide planning support and the overall commander , german admiral rainer feist is also the alliance 's deputy supreme allied commander in europe .
" it is notable that both organizations - nato and in the future the european union - have begun a very successful mission and will continue to operate it , " feist told dw-world .
" you really have to say that even though this mission is small , it stopped a civil war from breaking out in macedonia . "
macedonia appeared to be on the brink of civil war in the winter of 2001 , when ethnic albanian gunmen launched an insurgency to seek more rights for members of their community .
albanians make up around a quarter of the country 's two million people .
they live mostly in the west , along macedonia 's border with albania and kosovo .
eventually , about 150 people were killed in the fighting .
a peace accord signed in august 2001 formalized many of those rights and opened the way for 4,500 nato troops to collect weapons laid down by rebels .
the size and nature of the mission changed afterward .
the force was cut to about 350 soldiers who were assigned to protect international observers .
the mission of the new force , known as eufor , will be to monitor the situation and show a visible international presence .

it is also an indication of europe 's aim to assume a bigger role in the balkans , where it has been running a police mission in bosnia-hercegovina since january .

calder hall in cumbria was opened in 1956 using magnox technology .
it was cutting edge technology at the time , but by today 's standards its 196 megawatt capacity is considered small .
british nuclear fuels limited -lrb- bnfl -rrb- , which operates the plant on the sellafield site , blames the closure on the depressed price for electricity , along with the relatively high overheads of such a small plant .
about 150 workers will take part in a ceremony marking the closure , while environmental protesters are expected to gather at the gates .
the site , which is closing three years early , was named last year along with chaplecross power station in scotland , as being obsolete .
' pioneering workhouse ' bnfl chief executive norman askew said : " this is a tough but necessary commercial decision .
" i have always said that we would continue to run these pioneering workhouses of the nuclear industry while they remain safe and economic .
" they are still safe but the electricity prices have fallen significantly and to a level that makes them uneconomic .
" we do not see this fall in price recovering in the next few years and thus we can no longer justify running the plants . "
calder hall has four giant magnox reactors , which were scheduled to operate until at least 2006 .
a friends of the earth spokesman said : " nuclear power has proved itself time and time again as uneconomic , unsafe , unpopular and unnecessary . "

better pay for nurses and extra help for rural communities were identified as the next most important issues for the scottish parliament .
the study , conducted by nfo system three , asked people what they wanted politicians to do rather than how they planned to vote .
bbc scotland political editor brian taylor said the survey produced " an intriguing set of results " .
pollsters asked 1,033 people to pass their verdict on 21 key policies which could be addressed at holyrood after the may election .
putting more police officers on the streets came top of the list , followed by paying nurses " a lot more " than at present .
support for scotland 's farming and fishing communities was third , followed by ensuring that schools and hospitals are built and run by public bodies rather then private companies .
allowing 14-year-olds to study a trade in school was fifth , with moves to tackle troublesome neighbours in sixth position .
further down the list , many scottish national party voters gave top billing to a referendum on independence .
however , others strongly disliked the idea , which pushed it down the overall league .
at the bottom of the list there was opposition to introducing charges for motorists in city centres and little support for increased arts spending .
however , the least popular policy was the introduction of top-up fees for university students .
the list of 21 priorities , which was drawn up by bbc scotland with expert academic input , was based on the existing powers of the scottish parliament .
' hugely popular ' our correspondent said he hoped that the survey may help voters regain their authentic position at the centre of attention during the election campaign .
turning to the results , mr taylor said : " some surprised me , some met my expectations .
i found the underlying detail to be simply fascinating . "
he said that putting more bobbies on the beat was " hugely popular " with everyone - particularly the elderly , labour voters and the lower social groups .
however , he admitted to surprise that support for farming and fishing communities took the third slot .
" it would appear that voters do n't see these sectors as competitors lobbying for limited cash - but as core elements of scottish society , deserving sympathy , " said mr taylor .

voters ' priorities click here to open the document -lrb- 96kb -rrb- most computers will open this document automatically .
you may need to download adobe acrobat reader to open this pdf document .
download and install the reader here this survey is different .
most polls ask your voting intention .
they put the political parties centre stage .
alternatively , voters might be asked to offer their opinion on a particular issue : the war , monarchy , tax , independence .
there is no attempt made to balance these issues with competing demands , to confront the voters with the sort of choices which face governing parties .
again , this survey is different .
we commissioned nfo system three to find out what the voters want - regardless of party preference .
more to the point , the respondents were urged to name their priorities .
we listed 21 policies which might be introduced by the new scottish parliament .
the list , of course , is not remotely exhaustive .
it was drawn up by us with expert academic input and was based firmly upon the existing powers of the devolved parliament .
the list contained a selection of policies advanced by the various parties - but without sourcing those policies to the parties .
your priorities 1 .
more police on the streets 2 .
pay nurses more 3 .
more money for farming and fishing communities 4 .
ensure all state schools and hospitals are built and run publicly , not privately 5 .
let some 14-year-olds stop studying academic subjects and study a trade in school 6 .
take tougher action against nuisance neighbours 7 .
cut class sizes in primary and secondary schools 8 .
phase out nuclear power stations and replace with wind and wave power 9 .
change electoral system for councils to reflect better the number of seats compared to the number of votes 10 .
give private firms more money to start businesses 11 .
give free school meals to all schoolchildren 12 .
reduce taxes on business 13 .

hold a referendum on independence for scotland 16 .
spend more on helping heroin addicts come off drugs 17 .

charge drivers for bringing vehicles into city centres 20 .
substantially increase spending on the arts 21 .
allow universities to charge students higher fees those who took part in the survey were reminded that parliament would not be able to do everything at once .
it would not have the money - and might not , in any case , have the will .
the challenge to voters was to name their priorities - by giving them marks out of 10 - rather than tick every single box on a wish list .
we do not pretend that this is a perfect picture of voters ' desires - nor an utterly accurate guide to which party they might eventually favour .
when confronted with the downside of certain policies , they might change their allegiance .
they might vote for other reasons .
but then election campaigns are not themselves perfect prisms .
voters will get incomplete views of the options on offer .
very few will read and absorb the detail of all the manifestos .
their choice will be based upon subjective , composite impression .
quite simply , this survey indicates the policies you , the voter , might fancy .
it 's your election .
it does n't belong to the political parties - or the pursuing media pack .
hopefully , this survey may help the voters to regain their authentic position at the centre of attention .
that 's a pretty extensive set of caveats , i know .
but then i 'm intuitively cautious .
i believe , however , that this survey presents an intriguing set of results .
some surprised me , some met my expectations .
i found the underlying detail to be simply fascinating .
in terms of response , think traffic lights .
some policies got a pretty clear green light from the voters .
they want more bobbies on the beat - and they want them now .
nurses ' pay is a big issue that policy is hugely popular with everyone - but particularly with the elderly , with labour voters and among the lower social groups .
they want to pay nurses a lot more .
that snp policy took second top place although , arguably , alternative wordings - such as promising to enhance nurse recruitment - might have proved equally popular .
the third spot went to support for farming and fishing communities .
that may surprise many people - me included .
it would appear that voters do n't see these sectors as competitors lobbying for limited cash - but as core elements of scottish society , deserving sympathy .
some policies got an amber .
council voting reform , cutting taxes on business and free school meals each had advocates - but detractors too .
survey facts conducted by nfo worldgroup 1,033 people aged 18 + interviewed at home in 52 places interviews conducted 26 feb-5 march 2003 there 's another " amber light " policy : an independence referendum .
but that falls into a somewhat different category .
rather than attracting middling support , it tended to polarise opinion .
some 22 % gave it top billing - but at the other end of the scale 20 % thought it should never happen .
then the red lights - the policies voters really dislike .
scrapping public funding for catholic schools comes well down the league on average - although there are those who give it top billing .
further , our survey respondents , it seems , do n't want to see charges for car drivers in city centres .
they do n't fancy spending more on the arts .
and - the all-time stinker - they are utterly opposed to top-up fees for students .
they do n't want to see scottish universities obliged to follow the english example .
ups and downs for the snp at first glance , this survey would seem like unalloyed good news for the scottish national party .
they promise more police on the streets and an 11 % pay hike for scottish nurses .
they favour rural aid and they 're opposed to the private financing of schools and hospitals .
those are the top four policies in the mean ranking .
but there 's a potential downside for the snp too .
the party 's underlying core policy of boosting enterprise by cutting business tax is middling to low in voter favour .
there 's also that polarising of opinion about independence .
yes , it gets top billing from 22 % .
that includes 15 % of labour voters .
but , against that , seven per cent of snp voters apparently thought such a referendum should never take place .
these are your views .
this is your election .
let 's see how the politicians react more significantly , as well as support , the policy also attracts considerable hostility .
that would appear to open the door to an aggressive labour campaign spotlighting this issue in particular , a campaign which has already begun .
for labour , this survey may strengthen their existing plans to promise more bobbies on the beat .
there 's voter interest in jack mcconnell 's crusade against disruptive neighbours : that 's ranked sixth .
however , labour 's use of private finance for public projects could cause problems , but then they already knew that .
the two leading parties look set for a battle over cuts in school class sizes .
the issue is reasonably popular with voters - middle ranking with little overt hostility .
class sizes are important to voters but the parties see things differently .
labour would cut class sizes in maths and english in s1 and s2 .
the nationalists favour cutting class sizes in primaries one to three .
that policy on police could be a vote winner for the tories too .
the tories are n't promising a special pay rise for scottish nurses - but they insist they have plans to recruit and retain nursing staff which would meet popular concerns .
as to other distinctive tory policies , there does n't appear to be much response to the notion of " cutting government down to size " .
the idea of cutting the number of msps is in the lower half of the mean ranking .
however , the tories will take comfort from two hits where voters do n't want a policy .
the tories have gone hard on opposing car congestion charging .
that 's universally unpopular according to our survey .
the tories oppose congestion charges in addition , university top-up fees are hated .
the tories say they back that - and would scrap the graduate endowment too .
from the libdems ?
bobbies on the beat -lrb- do you think it just possible the parties may have been conducting policy surveys too ? -rrb- .
they punt recruitment and retention of nurses .
they say they back rural aid .
their support for wave and wind power - instead of nuclear - finds some favour , eighth in the league .
but their distinctive message of promoting positive health - rather than simply curing the sick - does n't seem to be finding favour .
perhaps it 's too early in the campaign for that to get through .
however , they 'll take comfort from the findings on council voting reform .
that 's their price for a further coalition with labour .
wind power came eighth in the survey , it 's in the upper half of the mean ranking - with reasonably well spread support - and there 's very little outright hostility to the idea .
voters , it seems , would n't grieve over change .
for the scottish socialists , opposition to private finance will be encouraging .
their eye-catching policy of free school meals gets reasonable support - but is in the lower half of the mean table .
it will be intriguing to see whether tommy sheridan responds to the survey 's suggestion that 47 % of his voters would give top billing to more police on the streets .
for the greens , that wind and wave power policy .
but back to the main point .
these are your views .
this is your election .
let 's see how the politicians react .

most polls ask your voting intention .
they put the political parties centre stage .
alternatively , voters might be asked to offer their opinion on a particular issue : the war , monarchy , tax , independence .
there is no attempt made to balance these issues with competing demands , to confront the voters with the sort of choices which face governing parties .
again , this survey is different .
we commissioned nfo system three to find out what the voters want - regardless of party preference .
more to the point , the respondents were urged to name their priorities .
we listed 21 policies which might be introduced by the new scottish parliament .
the list , of course , is not remotely exhaustive .
it was drawn up by us with expert academic input and was based firmly upon the existing powers of the devolved parliament .
the list contained a selection of policies advanced by the various parties - but without sourcing those policies to the parties .

spend more on health promotion rather than hospital treatment 15 .
hold a referendum on independence for scotland 16 .
spend more on helping heroin addicts come off drugs 17 .
encourage more people to live in scotland to stop population falling 18 .
phase out public funding of catholic schools 19 .
charge drivers for bringing vehicles into city centres 20 .
substantially increase spending on the arts 21 .
allow universities to charge students higher fees those who took part in the survey were reminded that parliament would not be able to do everything at once .
it would not have the money - and might not , in any case , have the will .
the challenge to voters was to name their priorities - by giving them marks out of 10 - rather than tick every single box on a wish list .
we do not pretend that this is a perfect picture of voters ' desires - nor an utterly accurate guide to which party they might eventually favour .
when confronted with the downside of certain policies , they might change their allegiance .
they might vote for other reasons .
but then election campaigns are not themselves perfect prisms .
voters will get incomplete views of the options on offer .
very few will read and absorb the detail of all the manifestos .
their choice will be based upon subjective , composite impression .
quite simply , this survey indicates the policies you , the voter , might fancy .
it 's your election .
it does n't belong to the political parties - or the pursuing media pack .
hopefully , this survey may help the voters to regain their authentic position at the centre of attention .
that 's a pretty extensive set of caveats , i know .
but then i 'm intuitively cautious .
i believe , however , that this survey presents an intriguing set of results .
some surprised me , some met my expectations .
i found the underlying detail to be simply fascinating .
in terms of response , think traffic lights .
some policies got a pretty clear green light from the voters .
they want more bobbies on the beat - and they want them now .
nurses ' pay is a big issue that policy is hugely popular with everyone - but particularly with the elderly , with labour voters and among the lower social groups .
they want to pay nurses a lot more .
that snp policy took second top place although , arguably , alternative wordings - such as promising to enhance nurse recruitment - might have proved equally popular .
the third spot went to support for farming and fishing communities .
that may surprise many people - me included .
it would appear that voters do n't see these sectors as competitors lobbying for limited cash - but as core elements of scottish society , deserving sympathy .
some policies got an amber .
council voting reform , cutting taxes on business and free school meals each had advocates - but detractors too .
survey facts conducted by nfo worldgroup 1,033 people aged 18 + interviewed at home in 52 places interviews conducted 26 feb-5 march 2003 there 's another " amber light " policy : an independence referendum .
but that falls into a somewhat different category .
rather than attracting middling support , it tended to polarise opinion .
some 22 % gave it top billing - but at the other end of the scale 20 % thought it should never happen .
then the red lights - the policies voters really dislike .
scrapping public funding for catholic schools comes well down the league on average - although there are those who give it top billing .
further , our survey respondents , it seems , do n't want to see charges for car drivers in city centres .
they do n't fancy spending more on the arts .
and - the all-time stinker - they are utterly opposed to top-up fees for students .
they do n't want to see scottish universities obliged to follow the english example .
ups and downs for the snp at first glance , this survey would seem like unalloyed good news for the scottish national party .
they promise more police on the streets and an 11 % pay hike for scottish nurses .
they favour rural aid and they 're opposed to the private financing of schools and hospitals .
those are the top four policies in the mean ranking .
but there 's a potential downside for the snp too .
the party 's underlying core policy of boosting enterprise by cutting business tax is middling to low in voter favour .
there 's also that polarising of opinion about independence .
yes , it gets top billing from 22 % .
that includes 15 % of labour voters .
but , against that , seven per cent of snp voters apparently thought such a referendum should never take place .
these are your views .
this is your election .
let 's see how the politicians react more significantly , as well as support , the policy also attracts considerable hostility .
that would appear to open the door to an aggressive labour campaign spotlighting this issue in particular , a campaign which has already begun .
for labour , this survey may strengthen their existing plans to promise more bobbies on the beat .
there 's voter interest in jack mcconnell 's crusade against disruptive neighbours : that 's ranked sixth .
however , labour 's use of private finance for public projects could cause problems , but then they already knew that .
the two leading parties look set for a battle over cuts in school class sizes .
the issue is reasonably popular with voters - middle ranking with little overt hostility .
class sizes are important to voters but the parties see things differently .
labour would cut class sizes in maths and english in s1 and s2 .
the nationalists favour cutting class sizes in primaries one to three .
that policy on police could be a vote winner for the tories too .
the tories are n't promising a special pay rise for scottish nurses - but they insist they have plans to recruit and retain nursing staff which would meet popular concerns .
as to other distinctive tory policies , there does n't appear to be much response to the notion of " cutting government down to size " .
the idea of cutting the number of msps is in the lower half of the mean ranking .
however , the tories will take comfort from two hits where voters do n't want a policy .
the tories have gone hard on opposing car congestion charging .
that 's universally unpopular according to our survey .
the tories oppose congestion charges in addition , university top-up fees are hated .
the tories say they back that - and would scrap the graduate endowment too .
from the libdems ?
bobbies on the beat -lrb- do you think it just possible the parties may have been conducting policy surveys too ? -rrb- .
they punt recruitment and retention of nurses .
they say they back rural aid .
their support for wave and wind power - instead of nuclear - finds some favour , eighth in the league .
but their distinctive message of promoting positive health - rather than simply curing the sick - does n't seem to be finding favour .
perhaps it 's too early in the campaign for that to get through .
however , they 'll take comfort from the findings on council voting reform .
that 's their price for a further coalition with labour .
wind power came eighth in the survey , it 's in the upper half of the mean ranking - with reasonably well spread support - and there 's very little outright hostility to the idea .
voters , it seems , would n't grieve over change .
for the scottish socialists , opposition to private finance will be encouraging .
their eye-catching policy of free school meals gets reasonable support - but is in the lower half of the mean table .
it will be intriguing to see whether tommy sheridan responds to the survey 's suggestion that 47 % of his voters would give top billing to more police on the streets .
for the greens , that wind and wave power policy .
but back to the main point .
these are your views .
this is your election .
let 's see how the politicians react .

quite simply , this survey indicates the policies you , the voter , might fancy .
it 's your election .
it does n't belong to the political parties - or the pursuing media pack .

that 's a pretty extensive set of caveats , i know .
but then i 'm intuitively cautious .
i believe , however , that this survey presents an intriguing set of results .
some surprised me , some met my expectations .
i found the underlying detail to be simply fascinating .
in terms of response , think traffic lights .

nurses ' pay is a big issue that policy is hugely popular with everyone - but particularly with the elderly , with labour voters and among the lower social groups .
they want to pay nurses a lot more .
that snp policy took second top place although , arguably , alternative wordings - such as promising to enhance nurse recruitment - might have proved equally popular .
the third spot went to support for farming and fishing communities .
that may surprise many people - me included .
it would appear that voters do n't see these sectors as competitors lobbying for limited cash - but as core elements of scottish society , deserving sympathy .
some policies got an amber .
council voting reform , cutting taxes on business and free school meals each had advocates - but detractors too .
survey facts conducted by nfo worldgroup 1,033 people aged 18 + interviewed at home in 52 places interviews conducted 26 feb-5 march 2003 there 's another " amber light " policy : an independence referendum .
but that falls into a somewhat different category .
rather than attracting middling support , it tended to polarise opinion .
some 22 % gave it top billing - but at the other end of the scale 20 % thought it should never happen .
then the red lights - the policies voters really dislike .
scrapping public funding for catholic schools comes well down the league on average - although there are those who give it top billing .
further , our survey respondents , it seems , do n't want to see charges for car drivers in city centres .
they do n't fancy spending more on the arts .
and - the all-time stinker - they are utterly opposed to top-up fees for students .
they do n't want to see scottish universities obliged to follow the english example .
ups and downs for the snp at first glance , this survey would seem like unalloyed good news for the scottish national party .
they promise more police on the streets and an 11 % pay hike for scottish nurses .
they favour rural aid and they 're opposed to the private financing of schools and hospitals .
those are the top four policies in the mean ranking .
but there 's a potential downside for the snp too .
the party 's underlying core policy of boosting enterprise by cutting business tax is middling to low in voter favour .
there 's also that polarising of opinion about independence .
yes , it gets top billing from 22 % .
that includes 15 % of labour voters .
but , against that , seven per cent of snp voters apparently thought such a referendum should never take place .
these are your views .
this is your election .
let 's see how the politicians react more significantly , as well as support , the policy also attracts considerable hostility .
that would appear to open the door to an aggressive labour campaign spotlighting this issue in particular , a campaign which has already begun .
for labour , this survey may strengthen their existing plans to promise more bobbies on the beat .
there 's voter interest in jack mcconnell 's crusade against disruptive neighbours : that 's ranked sixth .
however , labour 's use of private finance for public projects could cause problems , but then they already knew that .
the two leading parties look set for a battle over cuts in school class sizes .
the issue is reasonably popular with voters - middle ranking with little overt hostility .
class sizes are important to voters but the parties see things differently .
labour would cut class sizes in maths and english in s1 and s2 .
the nationalists favour cutting class sizes in primaries one to three .
that policy on police could be a vote winner for the tories too .
the tories are n't promising a special pay rise for scottish nurses - but they insist they have plans to recruit and retain nursing staff which would meet popular concerns .
as to other distinctive tory policies , there does n't appear to be much response to the notion of " cutting government down to size " .
the idea of cutting the number of msps is in the lower half of the mean ranking .
however , the tories will take comfort from two hits where voters do n't want a policy .
the tories have gone hard on opposing car congestion charging .
that 's universally unpopular according to our survey .
the tories oppose congestion charges in addition , university top-up fees are hated .
the tories say they back that - and would scrap the graduate endowment too .
from the libdems ?
bobbies on the beat -lrb- do you think it just possible the parties may have been conducting policy surveys too ? -rrb- .
they punt recruitment and retention of nurses .
they say they back rural aid .
their support for wave and wind power - instead of nuclear - finds some favour , eighth in the league .
but their distinctive message of promoting positive health - rather than simply curing the sick - does n't seem to be finding favour .
perhaps it 's too early in the campaign for that to get through .
however , they 'll take comfort from the findings on council voting reform .
that 's their price for a further coalition with labour .
wind power came eighth in the survey , it 's in the upper half of the mean ranking - with reasonably well spread support - and there 's very little outright hostility to the idea .
voters , it seems , would n't grieve over change .
for the scottish socialists , opposition to private finance will be encouraging .
their eye-catching policy of free school meals gets reasonable support - but is in the lower half of the mean table .
it will be intriguing to see whether tommy sheridan responds to the survey 's suggestion that 47 % of his voters would give top billing to more police on the streets .
for the greens , that wind and wave power policy .
but back to the main point .
these are your views .
this is your election .

most polls ask your voting intention .
they put the political parties centre stage .
alternatively , voters might be asked to offer their opinion on a particular issue : the war , monarchy , tax , independence .
there is no attempt made to balance these issues with competing demands , to confront the voters with the sort of choices which face governing parties .
again , this survey is different .
we commissioned nfo system three to find out what the voters want - regardless of party preference .
more to the point , the respondents were urged to name their priorities .
we listed 21 policies which might be introduced by the new scottish parliament .
the list , of course , is not remotely exhaustive .
it was drawn up by us with expert academic input and was based firmly upon the existing powers of the devolved parliament .
the list contained a selection of policies advanced by the various parties - but without sourcing those policies to the parties .

the korea stock exchange said it stop trading in shares of sk global after an independent audit showed irregular book keeping and bad assets had wiped out its capital .
sk global announced its chief financial officer moon duk-kyu would resign and take responsibility for the company 's difficulties .
it also revealed another 500bn won -lrb- $ 400m -rrb- of previously undisclosed debt .
the trial of 10 leading executives of the parent company , including chairman son kil-seung , over accounting fraud and illegal stock transactions starts on monday .
irregular accounts sk global was put into receivership on 19 march after it was accused of falsifying earnings by more than $ 1.25bn in 2001 to cover losses .
sk global reported a net loss of 297bn won in 2002 after writing down 477bn won in uncollectible debt repayment guarantees as losses in its balance sheet , the independent audit report said .
the korea stock exchange did not say when the suspension of sk global , which last traded at 4,000 won on friday , would be lifted .
south korea 's new president roh moo-hyun has promised to clean up big business , known as chaebols , which dominate the country 's economy and are blamed for the financial crisis of 1997 .
but on friday , south korea 's minister of justice suggested the government might ease its crackdown , of which sk group has been on the receiving end , because of the negative impact on the economy .
