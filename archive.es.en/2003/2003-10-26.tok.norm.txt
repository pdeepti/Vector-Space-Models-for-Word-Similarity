the brothers have accused him of a " cold and overt betrayal " .
mr burrell has been at the centre of a war of words with the royal family over his forthcoming book on princess diana .
he told the sunday times newspaper royal courtiers had poisoned the princes ' " little minds " and " dark forces " were monitoring him .
earlier this week the daily mirror newspaper published an extract from mr burrell 's book saying diana believed there was a plot to kill her in a car crash .
in a letter allegedly written by the princess 10 months before her death in a paris car crash , she apparently told him : " this phase in my life is the most dangerous . "
mr burrell , who said diana had called him her " rock " , also says the duke of edinburgh wrote to her to say he and the queen " disapproved " of the prince charles ' affair with camilla parker bowles .
my family went to hell and back and almost lost everything because of these people maria burrell profile : paul burrell mr burrell also says earl spencer expressed concern for his sister diana 's mental health .
but he told the sunday times these revelations were just the " tip of the iceberg " .
and more would come out if diana 's name continued to be besmirched .
calling himself " the keeper of these secrets " , mr burrell told the paper : " i know where the boundary is and i do not cross that line .
" anything i reveal is to illustrate a fact .
" other books have been rather sad betrayals . "

mrs burrell told the sunday mirror her family had suffered at the hands of senior royal advisers .
" my family went to hell and back and almost lost everything because of these people , " she told the newspaper .
describing her husband as the " princess 's greatest protector , she said : " what about my boys ?
" what about my family ?
" no-one gave them any consideration when their dad was dragged to court and threatened with prison when all he did was protect princess diana 's world . "
mr burrell was cleared last year of stealing hundreds of items from the late princess 's estate when his trial collapsed following an intervention by the queen .
harrods boss mohammed al fayed told the sunday post newspaper he had always been suspicious about the crash , which also claimed the life of his son , dodi , because diana had told him she feared her life was in danger .
my only intention in writing this book was to defend the princess and stand in her corner paul burrell in a statement on friday the princes made a plea to mr burrell to bring these revelations to an end .

the brothers have accused him of a " cold and overt betrayal " .
mr burrell has been at the centre of a war of words with the royal family over his forthcoming book on princess diana .
he told the sunday times newspaper royal courtiers had poisoned the princes ' " little minds " and " dark forces " were monitoring him .
earlier this week the daily mirror newspaper published an extract from mr burrell 's book saying diana believed there was a plot to kill her in a car crash .
in a letter allegedly written by the princess 10 months before her death in a paris car crash , she apparently told him : " this phase in my life is the most dangerous . "

and more would come out if diana 's name continued to be besmirched .
calling himself " the keeper of these secrets " , mr burrell told the paper : " i know where the boundary is and i do not cross that line .
" anything i reveal is to illustrate a fact .
" other books have been rather sad betrayals . "

mr burrell and his wife , maria , returned home to farndon , cheshire , on saturday , after staying at a nearby hotel with sons , alex 18 , and nicholas , 16 .
mrs burrell told the sunday mirror her family had suffered at the hands of senior royal advisers .
" my family went to hell and back and almost lost everything because of these people , " she told the newspaper .
describing her husband as the " princess 's greatest protector , she said : " what about my boys ?
" what about my family ?
" no-one gave them any consideration when their dad was dragged to court and threatened with prison when all he did was protect princess diana 's world . "
