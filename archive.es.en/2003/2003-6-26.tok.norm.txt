in an interview with deutsche welle , he said security was still the country 's biggest problem . " afghanistan is a very violent place .
we ’ ve got to be careful and take as many precautions as possible .
there are still spoilers out there who do not want this peace process to succeed , " brahimi said in an interview with deutsche welle .
the united nations special envoy to afghanistan is in germany to receive a special peace prize from the federal state of hessen on thursday .
ahead of the award ceremony , he met with german foreign minister joschka fischer and defense minister peter struck .
during the meeting with the two german ministers , brahimi stressed how important the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- was to maintaining the peace in conflict-ridden afghanistan .
after nearly 25 years of war and civil strife , the country needs the international peacekeepers and the provincial reconstruction teams to restore security , rebuild the infrastructure and help the central government establish its authority outside kabul , brahimi said .
" the international troops , isaf , are needed now and they will be needed for some time .
how long is difficult to say .
my personal calculation is a couple of years before the afghan army and national police can provide security for the people of afghanistan , especially in kabul .
i think it will take one or two years . "
limited influence one of the main problems facing reconstruction efforts in afghanistan is the limited reach of the central government under president hamid karsai , whose position , although recognized and respected in the provinces , has hardly any influence over the warlords and militias who still control considerable areas of the country .
brahimi said this was understandable in a state that has been completely destroyed .
" we are in a process of rebuilding the state machinery .
there are no roads , no telephones , no lines of communication .
that is why it is so difficult to project the influence of the central government in the country , " brahimi explained .
" the government is limited in its resources , but it is recognized in the provinces , " he said , " and therefore what is required is to help the government rebuild the state , not only in kabul , but in the provinces . "
" the best way of doing this , " brahimi stressed , " is to extend isaf outside the capital . "
extending the isaf mandate but the issue of extending the commitment of international peacekeepers in afghanistan is still a matter of discussion .
the isaf , which will be operated under dutch-german command until august , is currently restricted to the afghan capital kabul , but the united states and u.n. secretary general kofi annan have requested that troops also be sent to the provinces to protect civilian workers who are helping rebuild the country .
in berlin , the question of extending the isaf mandate beyond kabul has been met with a good deal of opposition following a june 7 bombing in the capital city that killed four german soldiers .
germany , which supplies the largest troop contingent in the international force , has been hesitant to commit more soldiers and extend their area of operation until the security situation in the provinces improves .
the german parliament in not scheduled to vote on an extension of the mandate until september .
brahimi said he respects the german government ’ s deliberations in light of the recent terrorist attack , but at the same time he expressed hope that germany would not rule against extending the security forces outside kabul .
" i think we would be sorry if that was the decision of the federal republic of germany , " he told deutsche welle .
the isaf is still developing , brahimi explained , " but it promises to be helpful for the progress of the peace process , for the training of the afghan police and the army . "
he added that not expanding isaf ’ s mandate beyond kabul would hinder the security and reconstruction efforts in the provinces and prolong the instability in the country .
" afghanistan is certainly in some parts still a dangerous place , " brahimi conceded , " but i think in the places -lsb- the german government -rsb- is contemplating , we don ’ t see many problems for the german soldiers if they were there . "
" of course we must be careful , " he continued while pointing out that the united nations itself has been sending unarmed civilians into the provinces for quite some time .
brahimi admitted , though , that security was a serious problem for u.n. reconstruction workers who are not able to access certain regions in the south and east and can only enter other regions with bodyguards .
the road to democracy according to brahimi , it will take some time before afghanistan is in a position to provide its own effective security .
he estimated that by september the national police and army are expected to have trained about 6,000 people , but it will be at least another year before the central government will have built up enough of a security force to make a substantial difference .
building a democratic state takes time , brahimi emphasized .
it is a slow and difficult process .
nonetheless , he expects that afghanistan will have a constitution in the near future .
" the constitution work has started and it is going reasonably well .
barring any unforeseen difficulties , we hope the country will have a new constitution by october , " he stated .
elections , on the other hand , are more difficult .
the u.n. envoy described them as a logistical nightmare .
" we have to register people all over the country , in every village .
and we have to go there ourselves , because they will not come to us , especially the women .
that means we have to recruit thousands of people , and it will cost a lot of money . "
but he believes elections can take place as early as october 2004 , if the security situation in the countryside allows for it , brahimi added .
waning interest in afghanistan ?
when asked if international interest in afghanistan was fading and whether or not money from western donor countries was drying up , brahimi responded that there is always the fear of donor fatigue and competition with the attraction of other international crisis situations .
" probably the attention has diminished a little bit , " he said , " but i think there ’ s still a reasonable amount of interest and support for what is happening in afghanistan . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de memorial service held for german soldiers killed in kabul a memorial service was held in kabul on tuesday for the four german soldiers killed in saturday ’ s bomb attack .

in an interview with deutsche welle , he said security was still the country 's biggest problem . " afghanistan is a very violent place .
we ’ ve got to be careful and take as many precautions as possible .
there are still spoilers out there who do not want this peace process to succeed , " brahimi said in an interview with deutsche welle .
the united nations special envoy to afghanistan is in germany to receive a special peace prize from the federal state of hessen on thursday .
ahead of the award ceremony , he met with german foreign minister joschka fischer and defense minister peter struck .
during the meeting with the two german ministers , brahimi stressed how important the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- was to maintaining the peace in conflict-ridden afghanistan .
after nearly 25 years of war and civil strife , the country needs the international peacekeepers and the provincial reconstruction teams to restore security , rebuild the infrastructure and help the central government establish its authority outside kabul , brahimi said .
" the international troops , isaf , are needed now and they will be needed for some time .
how long is difficult to say .
my personal calculation is a couple of years before the afghan army and national police can provide security for the people of afghanistan , especially in kabul .
i think it will take one or two years . "
limited influence one of the main problems facing reconstruction efforts in afghanistan is the limited reach of the central government under president hamid karsai , whose position , although recognized and respected in the provinces , has hardly any influence over the warlords and militias who still control considerable areas of the country .
brahimi said this was understandable in a state that has been completely destroyed .
" we are in a process of rebuilding the state machinery .
there are no roads , no telephones , no lines of communication .
that is why it is so difficult to project the influence of the central government in the country , " brahimi explained .
" the government is limited in its resources , but it is recognized in the provinces , " he said , " and therefore what is required is to help the government rebuild the state , not only in kabul , but in the provinces . "
" the best way of doing this , " brahimi stressed , " is to extend isaf outside the capital . "
extending the isaf mandate but the issue of extending the commitment of international peacekeepers in afghanistan is still a matter of discussion .
the isaf , which will be operated under dutch-german command until august , is currently restricted to the afghan capital kabul , but the united states and u.n. secretary general kofi annan have requested that troops also be sent to the provinces to protect civilian workers who are helping rebuild the country .
in berlin , the question of extending the isaf mandate beyond kabul has been met with a good deal of opposition following a june 7 bombing in the capital city that killed four german soldiers .
germany , which supplies the largest troop contingent in the international force , has been hesitant to commit more soldiers and extend their area of operation until the security situation in the provinces improves .
the german parliament in not scheduled to vote on an extension of the mandate until september .
brahimi said he respects the german government ’ s deliberations in light of the recent terrorist attack , but at the same time he expressed hope that germany would not rule against extending the security forces outside kabul .
" i think we would be sorry if that was the decision of the federal republic of germany , " he told deutsche welle .
the isaf is still developing , brahimi explained , " but it promises to be helpful for the progress of the peace process , for the training of the afghan police and the army . "
he added that not expanding isaf ’ s mandate beyond kabul would hinder the security and reconstruction efforts in the provinces and prolong the instability in the country .
" afghanistan is certainly in some parts still a dangerous place , " brahimi conceded , " but i think in the places -lsb- the german government -rsb- is contemplating , we don ’ t see many problems for the german soldiers if they were there . "
" of course we must be careful , " he continued while pointing out that the united nations itself has been sending unarmed civilians into the provinces for quite some time .
brahimi admitted , though , that security was a serious problem for u.n. reconstruction workers who are not able to access certain regions in the south and east and can only enter other regions with bodyguards .
the road to democracy according to brahimi , it will take some time before afghanistan is in a position to provide its own effective security .
he estimated that by september the national police and army are expected to have trained about 6,000 people , but it will be at least another year before the central government will have built up enough of a security force to make a substantial difference .
building a democratic state takes time , brahimi emphasized .
it is a slow and difficult process .
nonetheless , he expects that afghanistan will have a constitution in the near future .
" the constitution work has started and it is going reasonably well .
barring any unforeseen difficulties , we hope the country will have a new constitution by october , " he stated .
elections , on the other hand , are more difficult .
the u.n. envoy described them as a logistical nightmare .
" we have to register people all over the country , in every village .
and we have to go there ourselves , because they will not come to us , especially the women .
that means we have to recruit thousands of people , and it will cost a lot of money . "
but he believes elections can take place as early as october 2004 , if the security situation in the countryside allows for it , brahimi added .
waning interest in afghanistan ?
when asked if international interest in afghanistan was fading and whether or not money from western donor countries was drying up , brahimi responded that there is always the fear of donor fatigue and competition with the attraction of other international crisis situations .
" probably the attention has diminished a little bit , " he said , " but i think there ’ s still a reasonable amount of interest and support for what is happening in afghanistan .

his words still resound today in berlin , even 12 years after reunification . " two thousand years ago the proudest boast was " civis romanus sum . "
today , in the world of freedom , the proudest boast is " ich bin ein berliner . "
when united states president john f. kennedy made the famous statement " ich bin ein berliner " – -lrb- i am a berliner -rrb- - in front of the city hall of west berlin on june 26 , 1963 , he uttered words that went straight to the hearts of the citizens of berlin .
he insinuated that they were - just like the citizens of rome in earlier times - free people , with an unalienable right to freedom and the right to be protected by the rest of the free world .
it was a rousing speech that quite possibly turned the tide in favor of holding on to berlin as an isolated outpost in communist east germany at a time when it was in very real danger of falling to the communist german democratic republic .
" this was a very intense feeling of closeness , " recalls alexander longolius , a member of west germany 's city council in 1963 and later director of the checkpoint charlie foundation .
" if the americans had turned away from us , if that speech had told us we were leaving the city , then it would have been dramatic .
i remember that i went home and told my wife -lrb- ... -rrb- that our worries are over and everything would be good . "
a divided city from the end of world war ii in 1945 until the beginning of german reunification in 1989 , germany as a whole , and berlin as a city , was divided by the cold war a state of open confrontation between the communist bloc and the nato alliance .
in august 1961 , the soviets erected the berlin wall to stop the mass exodus of people fleeing soviet east berlin for west berlin and the non-communist world , thus sealing west berlin behind a 12-foot wall for some 28 years .
two years after this , kennedy gave his historic speech , which still finds incredible resonance here 40 years later .
in 1963 , west berlin was militarily protected by and partly governed by american , french and british forces .
the largest military contingent was american , and faced off a sizeable soviet contingent on the other side of the wall .
many people - and companies - had left the divided city for greener and safer pastures .
in his speech , kennedy expressed admiration for those who stayed on despite the city 's isolation .
" i want to say , on behalf of my countrymen , who live many miles away on the other side of the atlantic , who are far distant from you , that they take the greatest pride that they have been able to share with you , even from a distance , the story of the last 18 years .
i know of no town , no city , that has been besieged for 18 years that still lives with the vitality and the force and the hope and the determination of the city of west berlin . "
these words , uttered by the american president , had a soothing effect not only on the souls of beleaguered west berliners , but on the german post-war psyche as a whole .
many germans still felt a deep sense of guilt for the crimes they or their parents had committed - or at least had not prevented - during world war ii and the holocaust .
berliners were particularly receptive of the support kennedy expressed .
after all , when the wall went up in 1961 , many west germans were convinced the city was entirely lost to the communists .
" i was on vacation in west germany in the bavarian forest to the south of berlin , " longolius says .
" we were on a farm , and did n't have a radio .
so i did n't hear about the wall on that sunday .
i heard about it on tuesday , two days later , when our landlady - a farmer 's woman - asked me where i would go when my vacation was over .
and i said i would go home .
and she said to me : you ca n't do that any more because they 've cut west berlin off . "
when he toured west berlin , kennedy was accompanied by the then-mayor of berlin , willy brandt , and german chancellor konrad adenauer .
many berliners felt the chancellor and other west germans did not fully understand the importance of their city as a bulwark against communism , protecting the entire country against a soviet invasion .
" i said to myself : once the russians are berlin , they will be sitting on the rhine four weeks later , " says a woman , who has been a longtime resident of berlin .
" and i think that would have been the case .
the russians would simply have marched through .
once they had reached west berlin , they would have bulldozed the country - maybe not in four weeks , maybe a little later .
and they would not only have gone as far as the rhine , but even further .
that was the opinion of many people at the time . "
in the early 1960s , the cold war was at it 's peak .
not only was james bond fighting fictitious communist villains in the cinemas of the west .
the delivery of soviet nuclear medium-range missiles to cuba in 1962 had only just brought the world to the brink of a nuclear war .
communism as an ideology seemed like a viable and attractive alternative to capitalism for many intellectuals , even in the west .
john f. kennedy therefore used his speech in west berlin not only to boost the morale of the inhabitants there , but also to condemn communism as a politically , economically and morally inferior system everywhere in the world , with the berlin wall the most obvious and vivid demonstration of communism 's failures .
" there are many people in the world who really do n't understand , or say they do n't , what is the great issue between the free world and the communist world .
let them come to berlin .
there are some who say that communism is the wave of the future .
let them come to berlin .
and there are some who say in europe and elsewhere we can work with the communists .
let them come to berlin . "
an american legend according to alexander longolius , john f. kennedy became a mythical figure in germany and elsewhere because he was highly credible .
" he was not only an american president .
he was the leader of the west , " he says .
" the man who gave all of us hope , a perspective and a dream .
the united states at that time combined military , economic , cultural and moral leadership .
and there was no doubt in our mind that kennedy stood for all that . "
kennedy 's premature death at the hands of a gunman in dallas only a few months after holding his berlin speech temporarily plunged the city into depression and despair .
today , 40 years later , kennedy 's legacy lives on in germany 's collective memory - for example in school books , documentaries about the cold war and in an exhibition at the german national museum of contemporary history in bonn .
there , the most famous excerpt of kennedy 's speech is displayed on a television monitor , and there is a copy of the piece of paper john f. kennedy held in his hand when delivering his speech , complete with the lines " ich bin ein berliner " and " let them come to berlin " scrawled on it in his own hand-writing .
herman schäfer , a custodian at the museum , says the document still elicits a deep response today .
" the reaction of our visitors is very enthusiastic , still enthusiastic , even though this 40 years ago .
everybody - be it young or old people - have in mind that this is a quotation from john f. kennedy .
so they hear this quotation and then the look into the glass case and see with even more surprise that there is this little document with the phonetic transcription of john f. kennedy .
so there is still this enthusiasm about this quotation that -lrb- puts -rrb- so much emphasis on the german-american friendship during the 1960s . "
kennedy 's speech has been cited and used as a model by other politicians since 1963 .

today , in the world of freedom , the proudest boast is " ich bin ein berliner . "
when united states president john f. kennedy made the famous statement " ich bin ein berliner " – -lrb- i am a berliner -rrb- - in front of the city hall of west berlin on june 26 , 1963 , he uttered words that went straight to the hearts of the citizens of berlin .
he insinuated that they were - just like the citizens of rome in earlier times - free people , with an unalienable right to freedom and the right to be protected by the rest of the free world .
it was a rousing speech that quite possibly turned the tide in favor of holding on to berlin as an isolated outpost in communist east germany at a time when it was in very real danger of falling to the communist german democratic republic .
" this was a very intense feeling of closeness , " recalls alexander longolius , a member of west germany 's city council in 1963 and later director of the checkpoint charlie foundation .
" if the americans had turned away from us , if that speech had told us we were leaving the city , then it would have been dramatic .
i remember that i went home and told my wife -lrb- ... -rrb- that our worries are over and everything would be good . "
a divided city from the end of world war ii in 1945 until the beginning of german reunification in 1989 , germany as a whole , and berlin as a city , was divided by the cold war a state of open confrontation between the communist bloc and the nato alliance .
in august 1961 , the soviets erected the berlin wall to stop the mass exodus of people fleeing soviet east berlin for west berlin and the non-communist world , thus sealing west berlin behind a 12-foot wall for some 28 years .
two years after this , kennedy gave his historic speech , which still finds incredible resonance here 40 years later .
in 1963 , west berlin was militarily protected by and partly governed by american , french and british forces .
the largest military contingent was american , and faced off a sizeable soviet contingent on the other side of the wall .
many people - and companies - had left the divided city for greener and safer pastures .
in his speech , kennedy expressed admiration for those who stayed on despite the city 's isolation .
" i want to say , on behalf of my countrymen , who live many miles away on the other side of the atlantic , who are far distant from you , that they take the greatest pride that they have been able to share with you , even from a distance , the story of the last 18 years .
i know of no town , no city , that has been besieged for 18 years that still lives with the vitality and the force and the hope and the determination of the city of west berlin . "
these words , uttered by the american president , had a soothing effect not only on the souls of beleaguered west berliners , but on the german post-war psyche as a whole .
many germans still felt a deep sense of guilt for the crimes they or their parents had committed - or at least had not prevented - during world war ii and the holocaust .
berliners were particularly receptive of the support kennedy expressed .
after all , when the wall went up in 1961 , many west germans were convinced the city was entirely lost to the communists .
" i was on vacation in west germany in the bavarian forest to the south of berlin , " longolius says .
" we were on a farm , and did n't have a radio .
so i did n't hear about the wall on that sunday .
i heard about it on tuesday , two days later , when our landlady - a farmer 's woman - asked me where i would go when my vacation was over .
and i said i would go home .
and she said to me : you ca n't do that any more because they 've cut west berlin off . "
when he toured west berlin , kennedy was accompanied by the then-mayor of berlin , willy brandt , and german chancellor konrad adenauer .
many berliners felt the chancellor and other west germans did not fully understand the importance of their city as a bulwark against communism , protecting the entire country against a soviet invasion .
" i said to myself : once the russians are berlin , they will be sitting on the rhine four weeks later , " says a woman , who has been a longtime resident of berlin .
" and i think that would have been the case .
the russians would simply have marched through .
once they had reached west berlin , they would have bulldozed the country - maybe not in four weeks , maybe a little later .
and they would not only have gone as far as the rhine , but even further .
that was the opinion of many people at the time . "
in the early 1960s , the cold war was at it 's peak .
not only was james bond fighting fictitious communist villains in the cinemas of the west .
the delivery of soviet nuclear medium-range missiles to cuba in 1962 had only just brought the world to the brink of a nuclear war .
communism as an ideology seemed like a viable and attractive alternative to capitalism for many intellectuals , even in the west .
john f. kennedy therefore used his speech in west berlin not only to boost the morale of the inhabitants there , but also to condemn communism as a politically , economically and morally inferior system everywhere in the world , with the berlin wall the most obvious and vivid demonstration of communism 's failures .
" there are many people in the world who really do n't understand , or say they do n't , what is the great issue between the free world and the communist world .
let them come to berlin .
there are some who say that communism is the wave of the future .
let them come to berlin .
and there are some who say in europe and elsewhere we can work with the communists .
let them come to berlin . "
an american legend according to alexander longolius , john f. kennedy became a mythical figure in germany and elsewhere because he was highly credible .
" he was not only an american president .
he was the leader of the west , " he says .
" the man who gave all of us hope , a perspective and a dream .
the united states at that time combined military , economic , cultural and moral leadership .
and there was no doubt in our mind that kennedy stood for all that . "
kennedy 's premature death at the hands of a gunman in dallas only a few months after holding his berlin speech temporarily plunged the city into depression and despair .
today , 40 years later , kennedy 's legacy lives on in germany 's collective memory - for example in school books , documentaries about the cold war and in an exhibition at the german national museum of contemporary history in bonn .
there , the most famous excerpt of kennedy 's speech is displayed on a television monitor , and there is a copy of the piece of paper john f. kennedy held in his hand when delivering his speech , complete with the lines " ich bin ein berliner " and " let them come to berlin " scrawled on it in his own hand-writing .
herman schäfer , a custodian at the museum , says the document still elicits a deep response today .
" the reaction of our visitors is very enthusiastic , still enthusiastic , even though this 40 years ago .
everybody - be it young or old people - have in mind that this is a quotation from john f. kennedy .
so they hear this quotation and then the look into the glass case and see with even more surprise that there is this little document with the phonetic transcription of john f. kennedy .
so there is still this enthusiasm about this quotation that -lrb- puts -rrb- so much emphasis on the german-american friendship during the 1960s . "
kennedy 's speech has been cited and used as a model by other politicians since 1963 .
shortly before the berlin wall came down in 1989 , u.s. president ronald reagan addressed soviet leader mikhail gorbachev from the same location , telling him the time was ripe for german reunification .
and when after the sept .

" when the defense of berlin was at stake , john f. kennedy said - and you all know this famous sentence - ' i am a berliner ' , " schröder said .
" that was the expression of incredible solidarity .
today i believe that we have every reason - especially we germans - to return this solidarity by expressing our solidarity with the american people . "
strained relations however , following germany 's refusal to back the u.s.-led war on iraq , relations between the two countries reached a historic low .
many germans refused to believe that the ideals kennedy had upheld in berlin were being appropriately defended by bush .
because of the widespread rejection of the war , germans have been accused of anti-americanism .
but according to schäfer of the national museum in bonn , the us-german relationship has not been fundamentally impaired .
" it is still as strong as in former times and if we look to the development of our civilization , i personally think that the united states is something like the leading civilized nation of the world , " he says .
" and there are a lot of different developments which are already there - if we like them or not - and many of them i do not like , i would not agree with all developments which are under way in the u.s. they will come to our state , to our country , to europe soon or later .
but we have to decide individually if we want to adopt them . "

his words still resound today in berlin , even 12 years after reunification . " two thousand years ago the proudest boast was " civis romanus sum . "
today , in the world of freedom , the proudest boast is " ich bin ein berliner . "
when united states president john f. kennedy made the famous statement " ich bin ein berliner " – -lrb- i am a berliner -rrb- - in front of the city hall of west berlin on june 26 , 1963 , he uttered words that went straight to the hearts of the citizens of berlin .
he insinuated that they were - just like the citizens of rome in earlier times - free people , with an unalienable right to freedom and the right to be protected by the rest of the free world .
it was a rousing speech that quite possibly turned the tide in favor of holding on to berlin as an isolated outpost in communist east germany at a time when it was in very real danger of falling to the communist german democratic republic .
" this was a very intense feeling of closeness , " recalls alexander longolius , a member of west germany 's city council in 1963 and later director of the checkpoint charlie foundation .
" if the americans had turned away from us , if that speech had told us we were leaving the city , then it would have been dramatic .
i remember that i went home and told my wife -lrb- ... -rrb- that our worries are over and everything would be good . "
a divided city from the end of world war ii in 1945 until the beginning of german reunification in 1989 , germany as a whole , and berlin as a city , was divided by the cold war a state of open confrontation between the communist bloc and the nato alliance .
in august 1961 , the soviets erected the berlin wall to stop the mass exodus of people fleeing soviet east berlin for west berlin and the non-communist world , thus sealing west berlin behind a 12-foot wall for some 28 years .
two years after this , kennedy gave his historic speech , which still finds incredible resonance here 40 years later .
in 1963 , west berlin was militarily protected by and partly governed by american , french and british forces .
the largest military contingent was american , and faced off a sizeable soviet contingent on the other side of the wall .
many people - and companies - had left the divided city for greener and safer pastures .
in his speech , kennedy expressed admiration for those who stayed on despite the city 's isolation .
" i want to say , on behalf of my countrymen , who live many miles away on the other side of the atlantic , who are far distant from you , that they take the greatest pride that they have been able to share with you , even from a distance , the story of the last 18 years .
i know of no town , no city , that has been besieged for 18 years that still lives with the vitality and the force and the hope and the determination of the city of west berlin . "
these words , uttered by the american president , had a soothing effect not only on the souls of beleaguered west berliners , but on the german post-war psyche as a whole .
many germans still felt a deep sense of guilt for the crimes they or their parents had committed - or at least had not prevented - during world war ii and the holocaust .
berliners were particularly receptive of the support kennedy expressed .
after all , when the wall went up in 1961 , many west germans were convinced the city was entirely lost to the communists .
" i was on vacation in west germany in the bavarian forest to the south of berlin , " longolius says .
" we were on a farm , and did n't have a radio .
so i did n't hear about the wall on that sunday .
i heard about it on tuesday , two days later , when our landlady - a farmer 's woman - asked me where i would go when my vacation was over .
and i said i would go home .
and she said to me : you ca n't do that any more because they 've cut west berlin off . "
when he toured west berlin , kennedy was accompanied by the then-mayor of berlin , willy brandt , and german chancellor konrad adenauer .
many berliners felt the chancellor and other west germans did not fully understand the importance of their city as a bulwark against communism , protecting the entire country against a soviet invasion .
" i said to myself : once the russians are berlin , they will be sitting on the rhine four weeks later , " says a woman , who has been a longtime resident of berlin .
" and i think that would have been the case .
the russians would simply have marched through .
once they had reached west berlin , they would have bulldozed the country - maybe not in four weeks , maybe a little later .
and they would not only have gone as far as the rhine , but even further .
that was the opinion of many people at the time . "
in the early 1960s , the cold war was at it 's peak .
not only was james bond fighting fictitious communist villains in the cinemas of the west .
the delivery of soviet nuclear medium-range missiles to cuba in 1962 had only just brought the world to the brink of a nuclear war .
communism as an ideology seemed like a viable and attractive alternative to capitalism for many intellectuals , even in the west .
john f. kennedy therefore used his speech in west berlin not only to boost the morale of the inhabitants there , but also to condemn communism as a politically , economically and morally inferior system everywhere in the world , with the berlin wall the most obvious and vivid demonstration of communism 's failures .
" there are many people in the world who really do n't understand , or say they do n't , what is the great issue between the free world and the communist world .
let them come to berlin .
there are some who say that communism is the wave of the future .
let them come to berlin .
and there are some who say in europe and elsewhere we can work with the communists .
let them come to berlin . "
an american legend according to alexander longolius , john f. kennedy became a mythical figure in germany and elsewhere because he was highly credible .
" he was not only an american president .
he was the leader of the west , " he says .
" the man who gave all of us hope , a perspective and a dream .
the united states at that time combined military , economic , cultural and moral leadership .
and there was no doubt in our mind that kennedy stood for all that . "
kennedy 's premature death at the hands of a gunman in dallas only a few months after holding his berlin speech temporarily plunged the city into depression and despair .
today , 40 years later , kennedy 's legacy lives on in germany 's collective memory - for example in school books , documentaries about the cold war and in an exhibition at the german national museum of contemporary history in bonn .
there , the most famous excerpt of kennedy 's speech is displayed on a television monitor , and there is a copy of the piece of paper john f. kennedy held in his hand when delivering his speech , complete with the lines " ich bin ein berliner " and " let them come to berlin " scrawled on it in his own hand-writing .
herman schäfer , a custodian at the museum , says the document still elicits a deep response today .
" the reaction of our visitors is very enthusiastic , still enthusiastic , even though this 40 years ago .
everybody - be it young or old people - have in mind that this is a quotation from john f. kennedy .
so they hear this quotation and then the look into the glass case and see with even more surprise that there is this little document with the phonetic transcription of john f. kennedy .
so there is still this enthusiasm about this quotation that -lrb- puts -rrb- so much emphasis on the german-american friendship during the 1960s . "
kennedy 's speech has been cited and used as a model by other politicians since 1963 .
shortly before the berlin wall came down in 1989 , u.s. president ronald reagan addressed soviet leader mikhail gorbachev from the same location , telling him the time was ripe for german reunification .
and when after the sept .
11. attacks on new york and washington , chancellor schröder pledged " unlimited " support to the us in its war on terrorism , he alluded to george w. bush ' famous predecessor .
" when the defense of berlin was at stake , john f. kennedy said - and you all know this famous sentence - ' i am a berliner ' , " schröder said .
" that was the expression of incredible solidarity .
today i believe that we have every reason - especially we germans - to return this solidarity by expressing our solidarity with the american people . "
strained relations however , following germany 's refusal to back the u.s.-led war on iraq , relations between the two countries reached a historic low .
many germans refused to believe that the ideals kennedy had upheld in berlin were being appropriately defended by bush .
because of the widespread rejection of the war , germans have been accused of anti-americanism .
but according to schäfer of the national museum in bonn , the us-german relationship has not been fundamentally impaired .
" it is still as strong as in former times and if we look to the development of our civilization , i personally think that the united states is something like the leading civilized nation of the world , " he says .
" and there are a lot of different developments which are already there - if we like them or not - and many of them i do not like , i would not agree with all developments which are under way in the u.s. they will come to our state , to our country , to europe soon or later .
but we have to decide individually if we want to adopt them . "

mannheimer woes seen troubling insurance industry ; deutsche bahn forced to offer competitor 's timetables ; economists see light at the end of the tunnel . mannheimer insolvency signals trouble for industry one of germany ’ s oldest insurance companies was left looking for a bailout plan on thursday after the german insurance industry association -lrb- gdv -rrb- announced that a last-minute rescue initiative to raise € 370 million -lrb- $ 426 million -rrb- from fellow insurers had failed .
the mannheimer lebensversicherung ag , which has been struggling to stay afloat following significant losses on the capital markets last year , turned to the gdv – a cooperation of 110 insurance companies - in the hopes of drumming up enough fresh cash to prevent it from being the first german insurer to go under in 50 years .
the gdv , however , could not convince the necessary 90 percent of its members to back the rescue plan .
it now looks as if mannheimer will become the first german insurer to seek help from protektor , the industry-backed safety net set up last year to protect policyholder ’ s investments in the event of an insurer ’ s insolvency .
but protektor so far only exists on paper , and with a start-up capital of just € 3.2 million put forth by 10 insurers , its rescue funds remain rather limited .
that ’ s not good news for the german government , which has been encouraging citizens to invest in equity-based life insurance plans rather than rely on state support for their retirement .
a perceived weakness in the insurance industry could cause the public to lose confidence in the whole concept .
deutsche bahn to provide timetables for connex the deutsche bahn , germany ’ s largest rail company , must include information from its competitor connex in its long-distance timetables , according to a new ruling by the berlin regional court on thursday .

the ruling came after months of failed negotiations and connex , a subsidiary of the french vivendi corporation , took the bahn to court claiming its monopoly over long-distance timetables reflected an unfair competition advantage .
the bahn rejected such arguments as unfounded .
but the german cartel office , which had warned the bahn of a possible investigation back in february , said the bahn ’ s refusal to provide information on prices and timetables for connex blocked efforts to open up the country ’ s rail system to more competitors .

mannheimer woes seen troubling insurance industry ; deutsche bahn forced to offer competitor 's timetables ; economists see light at the end of the tunnel . mannheimer insolvency signals trouble for industry one of germany ’ s oldest insurance companies was left looking for a bailout plan on thursday after the german insurance industry association -lrb- gdv -rrb- announced that a last-minute rescue initiative to raise € 370 million -lrb- $ 426 million -rrb- from fellow insurers had failed .
the mannheimer lebensversicherung ag , which has been struggling to stay afloat following significant losses on the capital markets last year , turned to the gdv – a cooperation of 110 insurance companies - in the hopes of drumming up enough fresh cash to prevent it from being the first german insurer to go under in 50 years .
the gdv , however , could not convince the necessary 90 percent of its members to back the rescue plan .
it now looks as if mannheimer will become the first german insurer to seek help from protektor , the industry-backed safety net set up last year to protect policyholder ’ s investments in the event of an insurer ’ s insolvency .
but protektor so far only exists on paper , and with a start-up capital of just € 3.2 million put forth by 10 insurers , its rescue funds remain rather limited .
that ’ s not good news for the german government , which has been encouraging citizens to invest in equity-based life insurance plans rather than rely on state support for their retirement .
a perceived weakness in the insurance industry could cause the public to lose confidence in the whole concept .
deutsche bahn to provide timetables for connex the deutsche bahn , germany ’ s largest rail company , must include information from its competitor connex in its long-distance timetables , according to a new ruling by the berlin regional court on thursday .
from now on , the formerly state-owned bahn is required to provide route plans and times for connex via its internet and telephone services .
the ruling came after months of failed negotiations and connex , a subsidiary of the french vivendi corporation , took the bahn to court claiming its monopoly over long-distance timetables reflected an unfair competition advantage .
the bahn rejected such arguments as unfounded .
but the german cartel office , which had warned the bahn of a possible investigation back in february , said the bahn ’ s refusal to provide information on prices and timetables for connex blocked efforts to open up the country ’ s rail system to more competitors .
connex , with its three routes , including the newly-opened cologne-rostock stretch , is the deutsche bahn ’ s only competitor in long-distance train travel .
economy seen rebounding after all the bad news about germany ’ s economy , from rumors of deflation to signs of a recession , it now looks as if there might be light at the end of the tunnel .
six of the leading german economic research institutes said there are signs that the economy will improve by the end of the year .
according to a survey of the institutes ’ directors published in the berliner zeitung newspaper on thursday , the majority of the experts are convinced the country will experience considerable economic growth in the coming year .
they cited the government ’ s plans to reform health care and the pension plan as well as its steps to bring forward a tax cut as the source of the renewed optimism .
the director of the institute for economic research -lrb- iwh -rrb- in halle , rüdiger pohl , was quoted as saying , " the reform agenda is being pushed through with momentum .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.06.2003 eu farming policy set for major revamp großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's reformed agricultural policy is likely to mean change for many farms in europe .
european union agricultural ministers reached a deal thursday to overhaul the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- after years of deadlock , ending brussels ’ controversial policy of generous farm hand-outs . eu farming ministers meeting in luxembourg agreed on a comprehensive reform package for the 15-nation bloc ’ s agriculture policy on thursday after a marathon round of negotiations to thrash out the last details .
portugal was the only country to vote against the reform .
the move amounts to the most radical shake-up of the eu ’ s expensive 45-year-old cap , which critics have long argued undermines world trade and puts poor countries at a disadvantage .
the main thrust of the reforms is to cut back the eu ’ s program of huge direct subsidies to farmers , which account to about € 43 billion -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- a year - almost half the entire eu budget .
crop subsidies eliminated the chief architect of the reform plan , eu agricultural commissioner franz fischler , managed to largely salvage the cornerstone of his reform plan - namely breaking down the traditional link between subsidy and agricultural output , which has been blamed for offering an incentive to farmers to overproduce merely to get more cash from brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commissioner for agriculture , rural development and fisheries franz fischler fischler -lrb- photo -rrb- said the reforms would shape the future of european farming and end the practice of automatic farm handouts . " this decision marks the beginning of a new era .
our farm policy will fundamentally change.today , europe has given itself a new and effective farm policy , " he said .
the accord was hailed by leaders from several member countries .
" the agreement today delivers what we wanted - real change , " said britain 's agriculture minister , margaret beckett .
" it will give stability and security to farmers in the next decade , " said irish farm minister joe walsh .
german agricultural minister renate künast described the reform as a big success .
" with it we can finally break out of the old agricultural system , " she said .
in the future , subsidies from brussels will be distributed more evenly , rewarding farmers who switch to environmentally-friendly farming methods that promote increased food quality and improved rural management .
the european commission is also eager to end subsidies prior to 2004 when the agriculturally dependant economies of eastern europe join the eu .
critics feared that extending handouts to the new eu countries would only worsen the problem of over-production in europe .
agreement expected to revive trade talks the agreement on eu farm reforms is also seen as essential to kickstart the stalled doha round of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks .
fischler said the deal would boost the eu ’ s negotiating position in upcoming trade talks in mexico in september and appease the united states and japan , who had criticized the current system of eu farm hand-outs saying it violates wto rules .
" we ’ re also sending out a message to the world that we have a more trade-friendly policy .
we are saying goodbye to a policy that used to distort trade , " fischler told a news conference on thursday .
" we can go with our heads held high to cancun , " fischler said .
wto chief supachai panitchpakdi welcomed the deal .
" i see that this would have a positive effect on movement in areas , if not all areas of agriculture , " supachai said in geneva .
angry farmers despite the breakthrough on the reform package , fischler was forced to compromised on several elements of his original plan under heavy pressure from big farming nations such as france .
france , the largest beneficiary of eu farm aid , had strongly resisted decoupling farm aid from production subsidies .
in the latest deal , fischler compromised by abandoning his plan to cut minimum prices on key grains - including wheat , barley and maize and by allowing countries a high degree of flexibility over how it may apply decoupling rules for livestock .
but some french farmers were still dissatisfied .
" france has badly defended the interests of the cap and of french farmers , " jerome despey , head of france ’ s young farmers organization told radio france international .
likewise , farming unions in germany , one of the eu ’ s largest contributors to cap , were also dismayed by the deal .
the german farmers association -lrb- dbv -rrb- said farmers in that country would lose between € 1.2 and € 2 billion as a result of the cuts and warned that the decision would discourage further investment .
" this decision is a major burden for german and european farmers , " german farmers association president gerd sonnleitner told german public radio .
" it ’ s a typical eu compromise which gives and takes a little from everyone and creates terrible difficulties for those who have to implement it , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu farm reform proposals weakened in political power play german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would help france water down a radical reform of the european union ’ s common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .

european union agricultural ministers reached a deal thursday to overhaul the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- after years of deadlock , ending brussels ’ controversial policy of generous farm hand-outs . eu farming ministers meeting in luxembourg agreed on a comprehensive reform package for the 15-nation bloc ’ s agriculture policy on thursday after a marathon round of negotiations to thrash out the last details .
portugal was the only country to vote against the reform .
the move amounts to the most radical shake-up of the eu ’ s expensive 45-year-old cap , which critics have long argued undermines world trade and puts poor countries at a disadvantage .
the main thrust of the reforms is to cut back the eu ’ s program of huge direct subsidies to farmers , which account to about € 43 billion -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- a year - almost half the entire eu budget .
crop subsidies eliminated the chief architect of the reform plan , eu agricultural commissioner franz fischler , managed to largely salvage the cornerstone of his reform plan - namely breaking down the traditional link between subsidy and agricultural output , which has been blamed for offering an incentive to farmers to overproduce merely to get more cash from brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commissioner for agriculture , rural development and fisheries franz fischler fischler -lrb- photo -rrb- said the reforms would shape the future of european farming and end the practice of automatic farm handouts . " this decision marks the beginning of a new era .
our farm policy will fundamentally change.today , europe has given itself a new and effective farm policy , " he said .
the accord was hailed by leaders from several member countries .
" the agreement today delivers what we wanted - real change , " said britain 's agriculture minister , margaret beckett .
" it will give stability and security to farmers in the next decade , " said irish farm minister joe walsh .
german agricultural minister renate künast described the reform as a big success .
" with it we can finally break out of the old agricultural system , " she said .
in the future , subsidies from brussels will be distributed more evenly , rewarding farmers who switch to environmentally-friendly farming methods that promote increased food quality and improved rural management .
the european commission is also eager to end subsidies prior to 2004 when the agriculturally dependant economies of eastern europe join the eu .
critics feared that extending handouts to the new eu countries would only worsen the problem of over-production in europe .
agreement expected to revive trade talks the agreement on eu farm reforms is also seen as essential to kickstart the stalled doha round of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks .
fischler said the deal would boost the eu ’ s negotiating position in upcoming trade talks in mexico in september and appease the united states and japan , who had criticized the current system of eu farm hand-outs saying it violates wto rules .
" we ’ re also sending out a message to the world that we have a more trade-friendly policy .
we are saying goodbye to a policy that used to distort trade , " fischler told a news conference on thursday .
" we can go with our heads held high to cancun , " fischler said .
wto chief supachai panitchpakdi welcomed the deal .
" i see that this would have a positive effect on movement in areas , if not all areas of agriculture , " supachai said in geneva .
angry farmers despite the breakthrough on the reform package , fischler was forced to compromised on several elements of his original plan under heavy pressure from big farming nations such as france .
france , the largest beneficiary of eu farm aid , had strongly resisted decoupling farm aid from production subsidies .
in the latest deal , fischler compromised by abandoning his plan to cut minimum prices on key grains - including wheat , barley and maize and by allowing countries a high degree of flexibility over how it may apply decoupling rules for livestock .
but some french farmers were still dissatisfied .
" france has badly defended the interests of the cap and of french farmers , " jerome despey , head of france ’ s young farmers organization told radio france international .
likewise , farming unions in germany , one of the eu ’ s largest contributors to cap , were also dismayed by the deal .
the german farmers association -lrb- dbv -rrb- said farmers in that country would lose between € 1.2 and € 2 billion as a result of the cuts and warned that the decision would discourage further investment .
" this decision is a major burden for german and european farmers , " german farmers association president gerd sonnleitner told german public radio .
" it ’ s a typical eu compromise which gives and takes a little from everyone and creates terrible difficulties for those who have to implement it , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu farm reform proposals weakened in political power play german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would help france water down a radical reform of the european union ’ s common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
eu ministers will attempt to hammer out a deal next week . -lrb- june 13 , 2003 -rrb- a summer of discontent for eastern german farmers the eu 's plan to cut direct subsidies to large farms will hit eastern german farmers harder than those in any other region in europe .
thousands of jobs are at stake in a region grappling with staggering unemployment .

europe and the united states are slowly smoothing out their troubled relations originating from the iraq conflict .

the shattered transatlantic bond between the united states and the european union appears to be on its way out of its crisis .
the two sides may not be moving towards a hot love affair .
but a partnership of convenience is certain to result .
the first eu-u.s. summit after the iraq war brought europeans and americans together once again and proved their ability to face up to common problems with combined powers .
good cooperation in the fight against terrorism plays a significant role here . new agreements in this sector not only stipulate joint investigative teams to uncover terrorist criminals , but also clarify the extradition of suspected terrorists to the united states .
in the case of the latter , the europeans do not need to fear that the suspects will be sentenced to death or tried before a military tribunal once they are on american soil . this agreement shows that both sides are capable of cooperating while respectfully recognizing the legal tradition of the other , together with its ethical-moral implications . working together for peace the common efforts to secure peace in the middle east follow a similar path .
though progression in this conflict is moving more slowly than in the fight against terrorism , new rays of hope have appeared on the horizon .
these involve efforts within the group know as the middle east quartet - made up of the united states , the eu , the united nations and russia - as well as the personal commitment by u.s. president george w. bush .
now , it is essential to withdraw the financial basis for the hamas movement 's activities , to press israel to reduce its settlements in the west bank and to use the signalized ceasefire by palestinian groups for a consequential implementation of the u.s. and eu-backed " road map " to peace . surprisingly , the transatlantic views on iran have conformed to each other relatively quickly .
the nuclear program of a nation blessed with rich energy sources is , in fact , cause for worry on all sides .
but a military intervention by the u.s. similar to that in iraq is currently not under discussion .
and the eu can use its good economic relations to iran to increase pressure on the country 's ayatollahs . moving forward despite differences despite political synergies , the problems of transatlantic cooperation remain on the agenda even after this summit .
europe 's ban on importing genetically-modified food continues to be a thorn in washington 's side .
and europe views the u.s. 's continuous refusal to work with the international criminal court as somewhat paranoid .
here , the devil lies in the detail .

in the case of the latter , the europeans do not need to fear that the suspects will be sentenced to death or tried before a military tribunal once they are on american soil . this agreement shows that both sides are capable of cooperating while respectfully recognizing the legal tradition of the other , together with its ethical-moral implications . working together for peace the common efforts to secure peace in the middle east follow a similar path .
though progression in this conflict is moving more slowly than in the fight against terrorism , new rays of hope have appeared on the horizon .
these involve efforts within the group know as the middle east quartet - made up of the united states , the eu , the united nations and russia - as well as the personal commitment by u.s. president george w. bush .
now , it is essential to withdraw the financial basis for the hamas movement 's activities , to press israel to reduce its settlements in the west bank and to use the signalized ceasefire by palestinian groups for a consequential implementation of the u.s. and eu-backed " road map " to peace . surprisingly , the transatlantic views on iran have conformed to each other relatively quickly .
the nuclear program of a nation blessed with rich energy sources is , in fact , cause for worry on all sides .
but a military intervention by the u.s. similar to that in iraq is currently not under discussion .
and the eu can use its good economic relations to iran to increase pressure on the country 's ayatollahs . moving forward despite differences despite political synergies , the problems of transatlantic cooperation remain on the agenda even after this summit .
europe 's ban on importing genetically-modified food continues to be a thorn in washington 's side .
and europe views the u.s. 's continuous refusal to work with the international criminal court as somewhat paranoid .
here , the devil lies in the detail .
but even if this transatlantic bond represents a partnership of convenience , the willingness to solve problems is growing to such a degree that it can reinstate lost trust .

his words still resound today in berlin , even 12 years after reunification . " two thousand years ago the proudest boast was " civis romanus sum . "
today , in the world of freedom , the proudest boast is " ich bin ein berliner . "
when united states president john f. kennedy made the famous statement " ich bin ein berliner " – -lrb- i am a berliner -rrb- - in front of the city hall of west berlin on june 26 , 1963 , he uttered words that went straight to the hearts of the citizens of berlin .
he insinuated that they were - just like the citizens of rome in earlier times - free people , with an unalienable right to freedom and the right to be protected by the rest of the free world .
it was a rousing speech that quite possibly turned the tide in favor of holding on to berlin as an isolated outpost in communist east germany at a time when it was in very real danger of falling to the communist german democratic republic .
" this was a very intense feeling of closeness , " recalls alexander longolius , a member of west germany 's city council in 1963 and later director of the checkpoint charlie foundation .
" if the americans had turned away from us , if that speech had told us we were leaving the city , then it would have been dramatic .
i remember that i went home and told my wife -lrb- ... -rrb- that our worries are over and everything would be good . "
a divided city from the end of world war ii in 1945 until the beginning of german reunification in 1989 , germany as a whole , and berlin as a city , was divided by the cold war a state of open confrontation between the communist bloc and the nato alliance .
in august 1961 , the soviets erected the berlin wall to stop the mass exodus of people fleeing soviet east berlin for west berlin and the non-communist world , thus sealing west berlin behind a 12-foot wall for some 28 years .
two years after this , kennedy gave his historic speech , which still finds incredible resonance here 40 years later .
in 1963 , west berlin was militarily protected by and partly governed by american , french and british forces .
the largest military contingent was american , and faced off a sizeable soviet contingent on the other side of the wall .
many people - and companies - had left the divided city for greener and safer pastures .
in his speech , kennedy expressed admiration for those who stayed on despite the city 's isolation .
" i want to say , on behalf of my countrymen , who live many miles away on the other side of the atlantic , who are far distant from you , that they take the greatest pride that they have been able to share with you , even from a distance , the story of the last 18 years .
i know of no town , no city , that has been besieged for 18 years that still lives with the vitality and the force and the hope and the determination of the city of west berlin . "
these words , uttered by the american president , had a soothing effect not only on the souls of beleaguered west berliners , but on the german post-war psyche as a whole .
many germans still felt a deep sense of guilt for the crimes they or their parents had committed - or at least had not prevented - during world war ii and the holocaust .
berliners were particularly receptive of the support kennedy expressed .
after all , when the wall went up in 1961 , many west germans were convinced the city was entirely lost to the communists .
" i was on vacation in west germany in the bavarian forest to the south of berlin , " longolius says .
" we were on a farm , and did n't have a radio .
so i did n't hear about the wall on that sunday .
i heard about it on tuesday , two days later , when our landlady - a farmer 's woman - asked me where i would go when my vacation was over .
and i said i would go home .
and she said to me : you ca n't do that any more because they 've cut west berlin off . "
when he toured west berlin , kennedy was accompanied by the then-mayor of berlin , willy brandt , and german chancellor konrad adenauer .
many berliners felt the chancellor and other west germans did not fully understand the importance of their city as a bulwark against communism , protecting the entire country against a soviet invasion .
" i said to myself : once the russians are berlin , they will be sitting on the rhine four weeks later , " says a woman , who has been a longtime resident of berlin .
" and i think that would have been the case .
the russians would simply have marched through .
once they had reached west berlin , they would have bulldozed the country - maybe not in four weeks , maybe a little later .
and they would not only have gone as far as the rhine , but even further .
that was the opinion of many people at the time . "
in the early 1960s , the cold war was at it 's peak .
not only was james bond fighting fictitious communist villains in the cinemas of the west .
the delivery of soviet nuclear medium-range missiles to cuba in 1962 had only just brought the world to the brink of a nuclear war .
communism as an ideology seemed like a viable and attractive alternative to capitalism for many intellectuals , even in the west .
john f. kennedy therefore used his speech in west berlin not only to boost the morale of the inhabitants there , but also to condemn communism as a politically , economically and morally inferior system everywhere in the world , with the berlin wall the most obvious and vivid demonstration of communism 's failures .
" there are many people in the world who really do n't understand , or say they do n't , what is the great issue between the free world and the communist world .
let them come to berlin .
there are some who say that communism is the wave of the future .
let them come to berlin .
and there are some who say in europe and elsewhere we can work with the communists .
let them come to berlin . "
an american legend according to alexander longolius , john f. kennedy became a mythical figure in germany and elsewhere because he was highly credible .
" he was not only an american president .
he was the leader of the west , " he says .
" the man who gave all of us hope , a perspective and a dream .
the united states at that time combined military , economic , cultural and moral leadership .
and there was no doubt in our mind that kennedy stood for all that . "
kennedy 's premature death at the hands of a gunman in dallas only a few months after holding his berlin speech temporarily plunged the city into depression and despair .
today , 40 years later , kennedy 's legacy lives on in germany 's collective memory - for example in school books , documentaries about the cold war and in an exhibition at the german national museum of contemporary history in bonn .
there , the most famous excerpt of kennedy 's speech is displayed on a television monitor , and there is a copy of the piece of paper john f. kennedy held in his hand when delivering his speech , complete with the lines " ich bin ein berliner " and " let them come to berlin " scrawled on it in his own hand-writing .
herman schäfer , a custodian at the museum , says the document still elicits a deep response today .
" the reaction of our visitors is very enthusiastic , still enthusiastic , even though this 40 years ago .
everybody - be it young or old people - have in mind that this is a quotation from john f. kennedy .
so they hear this quotation and then the look into the glass case and see with even more surprise that there is this little document with the phonetic transcription of john f. kennedy .
so there is still this enthusiasm about this quotation that -lrb- puts -rrb- so much emphasis on the german-american friendship during the 1960s . "
kennedy 's speech has been cited and used as a model by other politicians since 1963 .
shortly before the berlin wall came down in 1989 , u.s. president ronald reagan addressed soviet leader mikhail gorbachev from the same location , telling him the time was ripe for german reunification .
and when after the sept .
11. attacks on new york and washington , chancellor schröder pledged " unlimited " support to the us in its war on terrorism , he alluded to george w. bush ' famous predecessor .
" when the defense of berlin was at stake , john f. kennedy said - and you all know this famous sentence - ' i am a berliner ' , " schröder said .
" that was the expression of incredible solidarity .
today i believe that we have every reason - especially we germans - to return this solidarity by expressing our solidarity with the american people . "
strained relations however , following germany 's refusal to back the u.s.-led war on iraq , relations between the two countries reached a historic low .
many germans refused to believe that the ideals kennedy had upheld in berlin were being appropriately defended by bush .
because of the widespread rejection of the war , germans have been accused of anti-americanism .
but according to schäfer of the national museum in bonn , the us-german relationship has not been fundamentally impaired .
" it is still as strong as in former times and if we look to the development of our civilization , i personally think that the united states is something like the leading civilized nation of the world , " he says .
" and there are a lot of different developments which are already there - if we like them or not - and many of them i do not like , i would not agree with all developments which are under way in the u.s. they will come to our state , to our country , to europe soon or later .
but we have to decide individually if we want to adopt them . "

mannheimer woes seen troubling insurance industry ; deutsche bahn forced to offer competitor 's timetables ; economists see light at the end of the tunnel . mannheimer insolvency signals trouble for industry one of germany ’ s oldest insurance companies was left looking for a bailout plan on thursday after the german insurance industry association -lrb- gdv -rrb- announced that a last-minute rescue initiative to raise € 370 million -lrb- $ 426 million -rrb- from fellow insurers had failed .
the mannheimer lebensversicherung ag , which has been struggling to stay afloat following significant losses on the capital markets last year , turned to the gdv – a cooperation of 110 insurance companies - in the hopes of drumming up enough fresh cash to prevent it from being the first german insurer to go under in 50 years .
the gdv , however , could not convince the necessary 90 percent of its members to back the rescue plan .
it now looks as if mannheimer will become the first german insurer to seek help from protektor , the industry-backed safety net set up last year to protect policyholder ’ s investments in the event of an insurer ’ s insolvency .
but protektor so far only exists on paper , and with a start-up capital of just € 3.2 million put forth by 10 insurers , its rescue funds remain rather limited .
that ’ s not good news for the german government , which has been encouraging citizens to invest in equity-based life insurance plans rather than rely on state support for their retirement .
a perceived weakness in the insurance industry could cause the public to lose confidence in the whole concept .
deutsche bahn to provide timetables for connex the deutsche bahn , germany ’ s largest rail company , must include information from its competitor connex in its long-distance timetables , according to a new ruling by the berlin regional court on thursday .
from now on , the formerly state-owned bahn is required to provide route plans and times for connex via its internet and telephone services .
the ruling came after months of failed negotiations and connex , a subsidiary of the french vivendi corporation , took the bahn to court claiming its monopoly over long-distance timetables reflected an unfair competition advantage .
the bahn rejected such arguments as unfounded .
but the german cartel office , which had warned the bahn of a possible investigation back in february , said the bahn ’ s refusal to provide information on prices and timetables for connex blocked efforts to open up the country ’ s rail system to more competitors .
connex , with its three routes , including the newly-opened cologne-rostock stretch , is the deutsche bahn ’ s only competitor in long-distance train travel .
economy seen rebounding after all the bad news about germany ’ s economy , from rumors of deflation to signs of a recession , it now looks as if there might be light at the end of the tunnel .
six of the leading german economic research institutes said there are signs that the economy will improve by the end of the year .
according to a survey of the institutes ’ directors published in the berliner zeitung newspaper on thursday , the majority of the experts are convinced the country will experience considerable economic growth in the coming year .
they cited the government ’ s plans to reform health care and the pension plan as well as its steps to bring forward a tax cut as the source of the renewed optimism .
the director of the institute for economic research -lrb- iwh -rrb- in halle , rüdiger pohl , was quoted as saying , " the reform agenda is being pushed through with momentum .
everyone is noticing that germany is serious about its efforts to revitalize the economy .

mannheimer woes seen troubling insurance industry ; deutsche bahn forced to offer competitor 's timetables ; economists see light at the end of the tunnel . mannheimer insolvency signals trouble for industry one of germany ’ s oldest insurance companies was left looking for a bailout plan on thursday after the german insurance industry association -lrb- gdv -rrb- announced that a last-minute rescue initiative to raise € 370 million -lrb- $ 426 million -rrb- from fellow insurers had failed .
the mannheimer lebensversicherung ag , which has been struggling to stay afloat following significant losses on the capital markets last year , turned to the gdv – a cooperation of 110 insurance companies - in the hopes of drumming up enough fresh cash to prevent it from being the first german insurer to go under in 50 years .
the gdv , however , could not convince the necessary 90 percent of its members to back the rescue plan .
it now looks as if mannheimer will become the first german insurer to seek help from protektor , the industry-backed safety net set up last year to protect policyholder ’ s investments in the event of an insurer ’ s insolvency .
but protektor so far only exists on paper , and with a start-up capital of just € 3.2 million put forth by 10 insurers , its rescue funds remain rather limited .
that ’ s not good news for the german government , which has been encouraging citizens to invest in equity-based life insurance plans rather than rely on state support for their retirement .

the ruling came after months of failed negotiations and connex , a subsidiary of the french vivendi corporation , took the bahn to court claiming its monopoly over long-distance timetables reflected an unfair competition advantage .
the bahn rejected such arguments as unfounded .
but the german cartel office , which had warned the bahn of a possible investigation back in february , said the bahn ’ s refusal to provide information on prices and timetables for connex blocked efforts to open up the country ’ s rail system to more competitors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.06.2003 eu farming policy set for major revamp großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's reformed agricultural policy is likely to mean change for many farms in europe .
european union agricultural ministers reached a deal thursday to overhaul the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- after years of deadlock , ending brussels ’ controversial policy of generous farm hand-outs . eu farming ministers meeting in luxembourg agreed on a comprehensive reform package for the 15-nation bloc ’ s agriculture policy on thursday after a marathon round of negotiations to thrash out the last details .
portugal was the only country to vote against the reform .
the move amounts to the most radical shake-up of the eu ’ s expensive 45-year-old cap , which critics have long argued undermines world trade and puts poor countries at a disadvantage .
the main thrust of the reforms is to cut back the eu ’ s program of huge direct subsidies to farmers , which account to about € 43 billion -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- a year - almost half the entire eu budget .
crop subsidies eliminated the chief architect of the reform plan , eu agricultural commissioner franz fischler , managed to largely salvage the cornerstone of his reform plan - namely breaking down the traditional link between subsidy and agricultural output , which has been blamed for offering an incentive to farmers to overproduce merely to get more cash from brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commissioner for agriculture , rural development and fisheries franz fischler fischler -lrb- photo -rrb- said the reforms would shape the future of european farming and end the practice of automatic farm handouts . " this decision marks the beginning of a new era .
our farm policy will fundamentally change.today , europe has given itself a new and effective farm policy , " he said .
the accord was hailed by leaders from several member countries .
" the agreement today delivers what we wanted - real change , " said britain 's agriculture minister , margaret beckett .
" it will give stability and security to farmers in the next decade , " said irish farm minister joe walsh .
german agricultural minister renate künast described the reform as a big success .
" with it we can finally break out of the old agricultural system , " she said .
in the future , subsidies from brussels will be distributed more evenly , rewarding farmers who switch to environmentally-friendly farming methods that promote increased food quality and improved rural management .
the european commission is also eager to end subsidies prior to 2004 when the agriculturally dependant economies of eastern europe join the eu .
critics feared that extending handouts to the new eu countries would only worsen the problem of over-production in europe .
agreement expected to revive trade talks the agreement on eu farm reforms is also seen as essential to kickstart the stalled doha round of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks .
fischler said the deal would boost the eu ’ s negotiating position in upcoming trade talks in mexico in september and appease the united states and japan , who had criticized the current system of eu farm hand-outs saying it violates wto rules .
" we ’ re also sending out a message to the world that we have a more trade-friendly policy .
we are saying goodbye to a policy that used to distort trade , " fischler told a news conference on thursday .
" we can go with our heads held high to cancun , " fischler said .
wto chief supachai panitchpakdi welcomed the deal .
" i see that this would have a positive effect on movement in areas , if not all areas of agriculture , " supachai said in geneva .
angry farmers despite the breakthrough on the reform package , fischler was forced to compromised on several elements of his original plan under heavy pressure from big farming nations such as france .
france , the largest beneficiary of eu farm aid , had strongly resisted decoupling farm aid from production subsidies .
in the latest deal , fischler compromised by abandoning his plan to cut minimum prices on key grains - including wheat , barley and maize and by allowing countries a high degree of flexibility over how it may apply decoupling rules for livestock .
but some french farmers were still dissatisfied .
" france has badly defended the interests of the cap and of french farmers , " jerome despey , head of france ’ s young farmers organization told radio france international .
likewise , farming unions in germany , one of the eu ’ s largest contributors to cap , were also dismayed by the deal .
the german farmers association -lrb- dbv -rrb- said farmers in that country would lose between € 1.2 and € 2 billion as a result of the cuts and warned that the decision would discourage further investment .
" this decision is a major burden for german and european farmers , " german farmers association president gerd sonnleitner told german public radio .
" it ’ s a typical eu compromise which gives and takes a little from everyone and creates terrible difficulties for those who have to implement it , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu farm reform proposals weakened in political power play german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would help france water down a radical reform of the european union ’ s common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .

european union agricultural ministers reached a deal thursday to overhaul the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- after years of deadlock , ending brussels ’ controversial policy of generous farm hand-outs . eu farming ministers meeting in luxembourg agreed on a comprehensive reform package for the 15-nation bloc ’ s agriculture policy on thursday after a marathon round of negotiations to thrash out the last details .
portugal was the only country to vote against the reform .
the move amounts to the most radical shake-up of the eu ’ s expensive 45-year-old cap , which critics have long argued undermines world trade and puts poor countries at a disadvantage .
the main thrust of the reforms is to cut back the eu ’ s program of huge direct subsidies to farmers , which account to about € 43 billion -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- a year - almost half the entire eu budget .
crop subsidies eliminated the chief architect of the reform plan , eu agricultural commissioner franz fischler , managed to largely salvage the cornerstone of his reform plan - namely breaking down the traditional link between subsidy and agricultural output , which has been blamed for offering an incentive to farmers to overproduce merely to get more cash from brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commissioner for agriculture , rural development and fisheries franz fischler fischler -lrb- photo -rrb- said the reforms would shape the future of european farming and end the practice of automatic farm handouts . " this decision marks the beginning of a new era .
our farm policy will fundamentally change.today , europe has given itself a new and effective farm policy , " he said .
the accord was hailed by leaders from several member countries .
" the agreement today delivers what we wanted - real change , " said britain 's agriculture minister , margaret beckett .
" it will give stability and security to farmers in the next decade , " said irish farm minister joe walsh .
german agricultural minister renate künast described the reform as a big success .
" with it we can finally break out of the old agricultural system , " she said .
in the future , subsidies from brussels will be distributed more evenly , rewarding farmers who switch to environmentally-friendly farming methods that promote increased food quality and improved rural management .
the european commission is also eager to end subsidies prior to 2004 when the agriculturally dependant economies of eastern europe join the eu .
critics feared that extending handouts to the new eu countries would only worsen the problem of over-production in europe .
agreement expected to revive trade talks the agreement on eu farm reforms is also seen as essential to kickstart the stalled doha round of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks .
fischler said the deal would boost the eu ’ s negotiating position in upcoming trade talks in mexico in september and appease the united states and japan , who had criticized the current system of eu farm hand-outs saying it violates wto rules .
" we ’ re also sending out a message to the world that we have a more trade-friendly policy .
we are saying goodbye to a policy that used to distort trade , " fischler told a news conference on thursday .
" we can go with our heads held high to cancun , " fischler said .
wto chief supachai panitchpakdi welcomed the deal .
" i see that this would have a positive effect on movement in areas , if not all areas of agriculture , " supachai said in geneva .
angry farmers despite the breakthrough on the reform package , fischler was forced to compromised on several elements of his original plan under heavy pressure from big farming nations such as france .
france , the largest beneficiary of eu farm aid , had strongly resisted decoupling farm aid from production subsidies .
in the latest deal , fischler compromised by abandoning his plan to cut minimum prices on key grains - including wheat , barley and maize and by allowing countries a high degree of flexibility over how it may apply decoupling rules for livestock .
but some french farmers were still dissatisfied .
" france has badly defended the interests of the cap and of french farmers , " jerome despey , head of france ’ s young farmers organization told radio france international .
likewise , farming unions in germany , one of the eu ’ s largest contributors to cap , were also dismayed by the deal .
the german farmers association -lrb- dbv -rrb- said farmers in that country would lose between € 1.2 and € 2 billion as a result of the cuts and warned that the decision would discourage further investment .
" this decision is a major burden for german and european farmers , " german farmers association president gerd sonnleitner told german public radio .

mannheimer woes seen troubling insurance industry ; deutsche bahn forced to offer competitor 's timetables ; economists see light at the end of the tunnel . mannheimer insolvency signals trouble for industry one of germany ’ s oldest insurance companies was left looking for a bailout plan on thursday after the german insurance industry association -lrb- gdv -rrb- announced that a last-minute rescue initiative to raise € 370 million -lrb- $ 426 million -rrb- from fellow insurers had failed .
the mannheimer lebensversicherung ag , which has been struggling to stay afloat following significant losses on the capital markets last year , turned to the gdv – a cooperation of 110 insurance companies - in the hopes of drumming up enough fresh cash to prevent it from being the first german insurer to go under in 50 years .
the gdv , however , could not convince the necessary 90 percent of its members to back the rescue plan .
it now looks as if mannheimer will become the first german insurer to seek help from protektor , the industry-backed safety net set up last year to protect policyholder ’ s investments in the event of an insurer ’ s insolvency .
but protektor so far only exists on paper , and with a start-up capital of just € 3.2 million put forth by 10 insurers , its rescue funds remain rather limited .
that ’ s not good news for the german government , which has been encouraging citizens to invest in equity-based life insurance plans rather than rely on state support for their retirement .
a perceived weakness in the insurance industry could cause the public to lose confidence in the whole concept .
deutsche bahn to provide timetables for connex the deutsche bahn , germany ’ s largest rail company , must include information from its competitor connex in its long-distance timetables , according to a new ruling by the berlin regional court on thursday .
from now on , the formerly state-owned bahn is required to provide route plans and times for connex via its internet and telephone services .
the ruling came after months of failed negotiations and connex , a subsidiary of the french vivendi corporation , took the bahn to court claiming its monopoly over long-distance timetables reflected an unfair competition advantage .
the bahn rejected such arguments as unfounded .
but the german cartel office , which had warned the bahn of a possible investigation back in february , said the bahn ’ s refusal to provide information on prices and timetables for connex blocked efforts to open up the country ’ s rail system to more competitors .
connex , with its three routes , including the newly-opened cologne-rostock stretch , is the deutsche bahn ’ s only competitor in long-distance train travel .
economy seen rebounding after all the bad news about germany ’ s economy , from rumors of deflation to signs of a recession , it now looks as if there might be light at the end of the tunnel .
six of the leading german economic research institutes said there are signs that the economy will improve by the end of the year .
according to a survey of the institutes ’ directors published in the berliner zeitung newspaper on thursday , the majority of the experts are convinced the country will experience considerable economic growth in the coming year .
they cited the government ’ s plans to reform health care and the pension plan as well as its steps to bring forward a tax cut as the source of the renewed optimism .
the director of the institute for economic research -lrb- iwh -rrb- in halle , rüdiger pohl , was quoted as saying , " the reform agenda is being pushed through with momentum .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.06.2003 kennedy still a ' berliner ' after all these years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john f. kennedy : " ich bin ein berliner " thursday marks the 40th anniversary of u.s. president john f. kennedy 's famous " ich bin ein berliner " speech .
his words still resound today in berlin , even 12 years after reunification . " two thousand years ago the proudest boast was " civis romanus sum . "
today , in the world of freedom , the proudest boast is " ich bin ein berliner . "
when united states president john f. kennedy made the famous statement " ich bin ein berliner " – -lrb- i am a berliner -rrb- - in front of the city hall of west berlin on june 26 , 1963 , he uttered words that went straight to the hearts of the citizens of berlin .
he insinuated that they were - just like the citizens of rome in earlier times - free people , with an unalienable right to freedom and the right to be protected by the rest of the free world .
it was a rousing speech that quite possibly turned the tide in favor of holding on to berlin as an isolated outpost in communist east germany at a time when it was in very real danger of falling to the communist german democratic republic .
" this was a very intense feeling of closeness , " recalls alexander longolius , a member of west germany 's city council in 1963 and later director of the checkpoint charlie foundation .
" if the americans had turned away from us , if that speech had told us we were leaving the city , then it would have been dramatic .
i remember that i went home and told my wife -lrb- ... -rrb- that our worries are over and everything would be good . "
a divided city from the end of world war ii in 1945 until the beginning of german reunification in 1989 , germany as a whole , and berlin as a city , was divided by the cold war a state of open confrontation between the communist bloc and the nato alliance .
in august 1961 , the soviets erected the berlin wall to stop the mass exodus of people fleeing soviet east berlin for west berlin and the non-communist world , thus sealing west berlin behind a 12-foot wall for some 28 years .
two years after this , kennedy gave his historic speech , which still finds incredible resonance here 40 years later .
in 1963 , west berlin was militarily protected by and partly governed by american , french and british forces .
the largest military contingent was american , and faced off a sizeable soviet contingent on the other side of the wall .
many people - and companies - had left the divided city for greener and safer pastures .
in his speech , kennedy expressed admiration for those who stayed on despite the city 's isolation .
" i want to say , on behalf of my countrymen , who live many miles away on the other side of the atlantic , who are far distant from you , that they take the greatest pride that they have been able to share with you , even from a distance , the story of the last 18 years .
i know of no town , no city , that has been besieged for 18 years that still lives with the vitality and the force and the hope and the determination of the city of west berlin . "
these words , uttered by the american president , had a soothing effect not only on the souls of beleaguered west berliners , but on the german post-war psyche as a whole .
many germans still felt a deep sense of guilt for the crimes they or their parents had committed - or at least had not prevented - during world war ii and the holocaust .
berliners were particularly receptive of the support kennedy expressed .
after all , when the wall went up in 1961 , many west germans were convinced the city was entirely lost to the communists .
" i was on vacation in west germany in the bavarian forest to the south of berlin , " longolius says .
" we were on a farm , and did n't have a radio .
so i did n't hear about the wall on that sunday .
i heard about it on tuesday , two days later , when our landlady - a farmer 's woman - asked me where i would go when my vacation was over .
and i said i would go home .
and she said to me : you ca n't do that any more because they 've cut west berlin off . "
when he toured west berlin , kennedy was accompanied by the then-mayor of berlin , willy brandt , and german chancellor konrad adenauer .
many berliners felt the chancellor and other west germans did not fully understand the importance of their city as a bulwark against communism , protecting the entire country against a soviet invasion .
" i said to myself : once the russians are berlin , they will be sitting on the rhine four weeks later , " says a woman , who has been a longtime resident of berlin .
" and i think that would have been the case .
the russians would simply have marched through .
once they had reached west berlin , they would have bulldozed the country - maybe not in four weeks , maybe a little later .
and they would not only have gone as far as the rhine , but even further .
that was the opinion of many people at the time . "
in the early 1960s , the cold war was at it 's peak .
not only was james bond fighting fictitious communist villains in the cinemas of the west .
the delivery of soviet nuclear medium-range missiles to cuba in 1962 had only just brought the world to the brink of a nuclear war .
communism as an ideology seemed like a viable and attractive alternative to capitalism for many intellectuals , even in the west .
john f. kennedy therefore used his speech in west berlin not only to boost the morale of the inhabitants there , but also to condemn communism as a politically , economically and morally inferior system everywhere in the world , with the berlin wall the most obvious and vivid demonstration of communism 's failures .
" there are many people in the world who really do n't understand , or say they do n't , what is the great issue between the free world and the communist world .
let them come to berlin .
there are some who say that communism is the wave of the future .
let them come to berlin .
and there are some who say in europe and elsewhere we can work with the communists .
let them come to berlin . "
an american legend according to alexander longolius , john f. kennedy became a mythical figure in germany and elsewhere because he was highly credible .
" he was not only an american president .
he was the leader of the west , " he says .
" the man who gave all of us hope , a perspective and a dream .
the united states at that time combined military , economic , cultural and moral leadership .
and there was no doubt in our mind that kennedy stood for all that . "
kennedy 's premature death at the hands of a gunman in dallas only a few months after holding his berlin speech temporarily plunged the city into depression and despair .
today , 40 years later , kennedy 's legacy lives on in germany 's collective memory - for example in school books , documentaries about the cold war and in an exhibition at the german national museum of contemporary history in bonn .
there , the most famous excerpt of kennedy 's speech is displayed on a television monitor , and there is a copy of the piece of paper john f. kennedy held in his hand when delivering his speech , complete with the lines " ich bin ein berliner " and " let them come to berlin " scrawled on it in his own hand-writing .
herman schäfer , a custodian at the museum , says the document still elicits a deep response today .
" the reaction of our visitors is very enthusiastic , still enthusiastic , even though this 40 years ago .
everybody - be it young or old people - have in mind that this is a quotation from john f. kennedy .
so they hear this quotation and then the look into the glass case and see with even more surprise that there is this little document with the phonetic transcription of john f. kennedy .
so there is still this enthusiasm about this quotation that -lrb- puts -rrb- so much emphasis on the german-american friendship during the 1960s . "
kennedy 's speech has been cited and used as a model by other politicians since 1963 .
shortly before the berlin wall came down in 1989 , u.s. president ronald reagan addressed soviet leader mikhail gorbachev from the same location , telling him the time was ripe for german reunification .
and when after the sept .
11. attacks on new york and washington , chancellor schröder pledged " unlimited " support to the us in its war on terrorism , he alluded to george w. bush ' famous predecessor .
" when the defense of berlin was at stake , john f. kennedy said - and you all know this famous sentence - ' i am a berliner ' , " schröder said .
" that was the expression of incredible solidarity .
today i believe that we have every reason - especially we germans - to return this solidarity by expressing our solidarity with the american people . "
strained relations however , following germany 's refusal to back the u.s.-led war on iraq , relations between the two countries reached a historic low .
many germans refused to believe that the ideals kennedy had upheld in berlin were being appropriately defended by bush .
because of the widespread rejection of the war , germans have been accused of anti-americanism .
but according to schäfer of the national museum in bonn , the us-german relationship has not been fundamentally impaired .
" it is still as strong as in former times and if we look to the development of our civilization , i personally think that the united states is something like the leading civilized nation of the world , " he says .
" and there are a lot of different developments which are already there - if we like them or not - and many of them i do not like , i would not agree with all developments which are under way in the u.s. they will come to our state , to our country , to europe soon or later .
but we have to decide individually if we want to adopt them . "
editor 's note : john f. kennedy 's historic visit to berlin in 1963 is also the subject of a new exhibit at the german historical museum in berlin , which will be displaying 400 artifacts from the life of the former president through oct .

in an interview with deutsche welle , he said security was still the country 's biggest problem . " afghanistan is a very violent place .
we ’ ve got to be careful and take as many precautions as possible .
there are still spoilers out there who do not want this peace process to succeed , " brahimi said in an interview with deutsche welle .
the united nations special envoy to afghanistan is in germany to receive a special peace prize from the federal state of hessen on thursday .
ahead of the award ceremony , he met with german foreign minister joschka fischer and defense minister peter struck .
during the meeting with the two german ministers , brahimi stressed how important the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- was to maintaining the peace in conflict-ridden afghanistan .
after nearly 25 years of war and civil strife , the country needs the international peacekeepers and the provincial reconstruction teams to restore security , rebuild the infrastructure and help the central government establish its authority outside kabul , brahimi said .
" the international troops , isaf , are needed now and they will be needed for some time .
how long is difficult to say .
my personal calculation is a couple of years before the afghan army and national police can provide security for the people of afghanistan , especially in kabul .
i think it will take one or two years . "
limited influence one of the main problems facing reconstruction efforts in afghanistan is the limited reach of the central government under president hamid karsai , whose position , although recognized and respected in the provinces , has hardly any influence over the warlords and militias who still control considerable areas of the country .
brahimi said this was understandable in a state that has been completely destroyed .
" we are in a process of rebuilding the state machinery .
there are no roads , no telephones , no lines of communication .
that is why it is so difficult to project the influence of the central government in the country , " brahimi explained .
" the government is limited in its resources , but it is recognized in the provinces , " he said , " and therefore what is required is to help the government rebuild the state , not only in kabul , but in the provinces . "
" the best way of doing this , " brahimi stressed , " is to extend isaf outside the capital . "
extending the isaf mandate but the issue of extending the commitment of international peacekeepers in afghanistan is still a matter of discussion .
the isaf , which will be operated under dutch-german command until august , is currently restricted to the afghan capital kabul , but the united states and u.n. secretary general kofi annan have requested that troops also be sent to the provinces to protect civilian workers who are helping rebuild the country .
in berlin , the question of extending the isaf mandate beyond kabul has been met with a good deal of opposition following a june 7 bombing in the capital city that killed four german soldiers .
germany , which supplies the largest troop contingent in the international force , has been hesitant to commit more soldiers and extend their area of operation until the security situation in the provinces improves .
the german parliament in not scheduled to vote on an extension of the mandate until september .
brahimi said he respects the german government ’ s deliberations in light of the recent terrorist attack , but at the same time he expressed hope that germany would not rule against extending the security forces outside kabul .
" i think we would be sorry if that was the decision of the federal republic of germany , " he told deutsche welle .
the isaf is still developing , brahimi explained , " but it promises to be helpful for the progress of the peace process , for the training of the afghan police and the army . "
he added that not expanding isaf ’ s mandate beyond kabul would hinder the security and reconstruction efforts in the provinces and prolong the instability in the country .
" afghanistan is certainly in some parts still a dangerous place , " brahimi conceded , " but i think in the places -lsb- the german government -rsb- is contemplating , we don ’ t see many problems for the german soldiers if they were there . "
" of course we must be careful , " he continued while pointing out that the united nations itself has been sending unarmed civilians into the provinces for quite some time .
brahimi admitted , though , that security was a serious problem for u.n. reconstruction workers who are not able to access certain regions in the south and east and can only enter other regions with bodyguards .
the road to democracy according to brahimi , it will take some time before afghanistan is in a position to provide its own effective security .
he estimated that by september the national police and army are expected to have trained about 6,000 people , but it will be at least another year before the central government will have built up enough of a security force to make a substantial difference .
building a democratic state takes time , brahimi emphasized .
it is a slow and difficult process .
nonetheless , he expects that afghanistan will have a constitution in the near future .
" the constitution work has started and it is going reasonably well .
barring any unforeseen difficulties , we hope the country will have a new constitution by october , " he stated .
elections , on the other hand , are more difficult .
the u.n. envoy described them as a logistical nightmare .
" we have to register people all over the country , in every village .
and we have to go there ourselves , because they will not come to us , especially the women .
that means we have to recruit thousands of people , and it will cost a lot of money . "
but he believes elections can take place as early as october 2004 , if the security situation in the countryside allows for it , brahimi added .
waning interest in afghanistan ?
when asked if international interest in afghanistan was fading and whether or not money from western donor countries was drying up , brahimi responded that there is always the fear of donor fatigue and competition with the attraction of other international crisis situations .
" probably the attention has diminished a little bit , " he said , " but i think there ’ s still a reasonable amount of interest and support for what is happening in afghanistan .

in an interview with deutsche welle , he said security was still the country 's biggest problem . " afghanistan is a very violent place .
we ’ ve got to be careful and take as many precautions as possible .
there are still spoilers out there who do not want this peace process to succeed , " brahimi said in an interview with deutsche welle .
the united nations special envoy to afghanistan is in germany to receive a special peace prize from the federal state of hessen on thursday .
ahead of the award ceremony , he met with german foreign minister joschka fischer and defense minister peter struck .
during the meeting with the two german ministers , brahimi stressed how important the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- was to maintaining the peace in conflict-ridden afghanistan .
after nearly 25 years of war and civil strife , the country needs the international peacekeepers and the provincial reconstruction teams to restore security , rebuild the infrastructure and help the central government establish its authority outside kabul , brahimi said .
" the international troops , isaf , are needed now and they will be needed for some time .
how long is difficult to say .
my personal calculation is a couple of years before the afghan army and national police can provide security for the people of afghanistan , especially in kabul .
i think it will take one or two years . "
limited influence one of the main problems facing reconstruction efforts in afghanistan is the limited reach of the central government under president hamid karsai , whose position , although recognized and respected in the provinces , has hardly any influence over the warlords and militias who still control considerable areas of the country .
brahimi said this was understandable in a state that has been completely destroyed .
" we are in a process of rebuilding the state machinery .
there are no roads , no telephones , no lines of communication .
that is why it is so difficult to project the influence of the central government in the country , " brahimi explained .
" the government is limited in its resources , but it is recognized in the provinces , " he said , " and therefore what is required is to help the government rebuild the state , not only in kabul , but in the provinces . "
" the best way of doing this , " brahimi stressed , " is to extend isaf outside the capital . "
extending the isaf mandate but the issue of extending the commitment of international peacekeepers in afghanistan is still a matter of discussion .
the isaf , which will be operated under dutch-german command until august , is currently restricted to the afghan capital kabul , but the united states and u.n. secretary general kofi annan have requested that troops also be sent to the provinces to protect civilian workers who are helping rebuild the country .
in berlin , the question of extending the isaf mandate beyond kabul has been met with a good deal of opposition following a june 7 bombing in the capital city that killed four german soldiers .
germany , which supplies the largest troop contingent in the international force , has been hesitant to commit more soldiers and extend their area of operation until the security situation in the provinces improves .
the german parliament in not scheduled to vote on an extension of the mandate until september .
brahimi said he respects the german government ’ s deliberations in light of the recent terrorist attack , but at the same time he expressed hope that germany would not rule against extending the security forces outside kabul .
" i think we would be sorry if that was the decision of the federal republic of germany , " he told deutsche welle .
the isaf is still developing , brahimi explained , " but it promises to be helpful for the progress of the peace process , for the training of the afghan police and the army . "
he added that not expanding isaf ’ s mandate beyond kabul would hinder the security and reconstruction efforts in the provinces and prolong the instability in the country .
" afghanistan is certainly in some parts still a dangerous place , " brahimi conceded , " but i think in the places -lsb- the german government -rsb- is contemplating , we don ’ t see many problems for the german soldiers if they were there . "
" of course we must be careful , " he continued while pointing out that the united nations itself has been sending unarmed civilians into the provinces for quite some time .
brahimi admitted , though , that security was a serious problem for u.n. reconstruction workers who are not able to access certain regions in the south and east and can only enter other regions with bodyguards .
the road to democracy according to brahimi , it will take some time before afghanistan is in a position to provide its own effective security .
he estimated that by september the national police and army are expected to have trained about 6,000 people , but it will be at least another year before the central government will have built up enough of a security force to make a substantial difference .
building a democratic state takes time , brahimi emphasized .
it is a slow and difficult process .
nonetheless , he expects that afghanistan will have a constitution in the near future .
" the constitution work has started and it is going reasonably well .
barring any unforeseen difficulties , we hope the country will have a new constitution by october , " he stated .
elections , on the other hand , are more difficult .
the u.n. envoy described them as a logistical nightmare .
" we have to register people all over the country , in every village .
and we have to go there ourselves , because they will not come to us , especially the women .
that means we have to recruit thousands of people , and it will cost a lot of money . "
but he believes elections can take place as early as october 2004 , if the security situation in the countryside allows for it , brahimi added .
waning interest in afghanistan ?
when asked if international interest in afghanistan was fading and whether or not money from western donor countries was drying up , brahimi responded that there is always the fear of donor fatigue and competition with the attraction of other international crisis situations .
" probably the attention has diminished a little bit , " he said , " but i think there ’ s still a reasonable amount of interest and support for what is happening in afghanistan . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de memorial service held for german soldiers killed in kabul a memorial service was held in kabul on tuesday for the four german soldiers killed in saturday ’ s bomb attack .

european union agricultural ministers reached a deal thursday to overhaul the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- after years of deadlock , ending brussels ’ controversial policy of generous farm hand-outs . eu farming ministers meeting in luxembourg agreed on a comprehensive reform package for the 15-nation bloc ’ s agriculture policy on thursday after a marathon round of negotiations to thrash out the last details .
portugal was the only country to vote against the reform .
the move amounts to the most radical shake-up of the eu ’ s expensive 45-year-old cap , which critics have long argued undermines world trade and puts poor countries at a disadvantage .
the main thrust of the reforms is to cut back the eu ’ s program of huge direct subsidies to farmers , which account to about € 43 billion -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- a year - almost half the entire eu budget .
crop subsidies eliminated the chief architect of the reform plan , eu agricultural commissioner franz fischler , managed to largely salvage the cornerstone of his reform plan - namely breaking down the traditional link between subsidy and agricultural output , which has been blamed for offering an incentive to farmers to overproduce merely to get more cash from brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commissioner for agriculture , rural development and fisheries franz fischler fischler -lrb- photo -rrb- said the reforms would shape the future of european farming and end the practice of automatic farm handouts . " this decision marks the beginning of a new era .
our farm policy will fundamentally change.today , europe has given itself a new and effective farm policy , " he said .
the accord was hailed by leaders from several member countries .
" the agreement today delivers what we wanted - real change , " said britain 's agriculture minister , margaret beckett .
" it will give stability and security to farmers in the next decade , " said irish farm minister joe walsh .
german agricultural minister renate künast described the reform as a big success .
" with it we can finally break out of the old agricultural system , " she said .
in the future , subsidies from brussels will be distributed more evenly , rewarding farmers who switch to environmentally-friendly farming methods that promote increased food quality and improved rural management .
the european commission is also eager to end subsidies prior to 2004 when the agriculturally dependant economies of eastern europe join the eu .
critics feared that extending handouts to the new eu countries would only worsen the problem of over-production in europe .
agreement expected to revive trade talks the agreement on eu farm reforms is also seen as essential to kickstart the stalled doha round of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks .
fischler said the deal would boost the eu ’ s negotiating position in upcoming trade talks in mexico in september and appease the united states and japan , who had criticized the current system of eu farm hand-outs saying it violates wto rules .
" we ’ re also sending out a message to the world that we have a more trade-friendly policy .
we are saying goodbye to a policy that used to distort trade , " fischler told a news conference on thursday .
" we can go with our heads held high to cancun , " fischler said .
wto chief supachai panitchpakdi welcomed the deal .
" i see that this would have a positive effect on movement in areas , if not all areas of agriculture , " supachai said in geneva .
angry farmers despite the breakthrough on the reform package , fischler was forced to compromised on several elements of his original plan under heavy pressure from big farming nations such as france .
france , the largest beneficiary of eu farm aid , had strongly resisted decoupling farm aid from production subsidies .
in the latest deal , fischler compromised by abandoning his plan to cut minimum prices on key grains - including wheat , barley and maize and by allowing countries a high degree of flexibility over how it may apply decoupling rules for livestock .
but some french farmers were still dissatisfied .
" france has badly defended the interests of the cap and of french farmers , " jerome despey , head of france ’ s young farmers organization told radio france international .
likewise , farming unions in germany , one of the eu ’ s largest contributors to cap , were also dismayed by the deal .
the german farmers association -lrb- dbv -rrb- said farmers in that country would lose between € 1.2 and € 2 billion as a result of the cuts and warned that the decision would discourage further investment .
" this decision is a major burden for german and european farmers , " german farmers association president gerd sonnleitner told german public radio .
" it ’ s a typical eu compromise which gives and takes a little from everyone and creates terrible difficulties for those who have to implement it , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu farm reform proposals weakened in political power play german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would help france water down a radical reform of the european union ’ s common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.06.2003 kennedy still a ' berliner ' after all these years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john f. kennedy : " ich bin ein berliner " thursday marks the 40th anniversary of u.s. president john f. kennedy 's famous " ich bin ein berliner " speech .
his words still resound today in berlin , even 12 years after reunification . " two thousand years ago the proudest boast was " civis romanus sum . "
today , in the world of freedom , the proudest boast is " ich bin ein berliner . "
when united states president john f. kennedy made the famous statement " ich bin ein berliner " – -lrb- i am a berliner -rrb- - in front of the city hall of west berlin on june 26 , 1963 , he uttered words that went straight to the hearts of the citizens of berlin .
he insinuated that they were - just like the citizens of rome in earlier times - free people , with an unalienable right to freedom and the right to be protected by the rest of the free world .
it was a rousing speech that quite possibly turned the tide in favor of holding on to berlin as an isolated outpost in communist east germany at a time when it was in very real danger of falling to the communist german democratic republic .
" this was a very intense feeling of closeness , " recalls alexander longolius , a member of west germany 's city council in 1963 and later director of the checkpoint charlie foundation .
" if the americans had turned away from us , if that speech had told us we were leaving the city , then it would have been dramatic .
i remember that i went home and told my wife -lrb- ... -rrb- that our worries are over and everything would be good . "
a divided city from the end of world war ii in 1945 until the beginning of german reunification in 1989 , germany as a whole , and berlin as a city , was divided by the cold war a state of open confrontation between the communist bloc and the nato alliance .
in august 1961 , the soviets erected the berlin wall to stop the mass exodus of people fleeing soviet east berlin for west berlin and the non-communist world , thus sealing west berlin behind a 12-foot wall for some 28 years .
two years after this , kennedy gave his historic speech , which still finds incredible resonance here 40 years later .
in 1963 , west berlin was militarily protected by and partly governed by american , french and british forces .
the largest military contingent was american , and faced off a sizeable soviet contingent on the other side of the wall .
many people - and companies - had left the divided city for greener and safer pastures .
in his speech , kennedy expressed admiration for those who stayed on despite the city 's isolation .
" i want to say , on behalf of my countrymen , who live many miles away on the other side of the atlantic , who are far distant from you , that they take the greatest pride that they have been able to share with you , even from a distance , the story of the last 18 years .
i know of no town , no city , that has been besieged for 18 years that still lives with the vitality and the force and the hope and the determination of the city of west berlin . "
these words , uttered by the american president , had a soothing effect not only on the souls of beleaguered west berliners , but on the german post-war psyche as a whole .
many germans still felt a deep sense of guilt for the crimes they or their parents had committed - or at least had not prevented - during world war ii and the holocaust .
berliners were particularly receptive of the support kennedy expressed .
after all , when the wall went up in 1961 , many west germans were convinced the city was entirely lost to the communists .
" i was on vacation in west germany in the bavarian forest to the south of berlin , " longolius says .
" we were on a farm , and did n't have a radio .
so i did n't hear about the wall on that sunday .
i heard about it on tuesday , two days later , when our landlady - a farmer 's woman - asked me where i would go when my vacation was over .
and i said i would go home .
and she said to me : you ca n't do that any more because they 've cut west berlin off . "
when he toured west berlin , kennedy was accompanied by the then-mayor of berlin , willy brandt , and german chancellor konrad adenauer .
many berliners felt the chancellor and other west germans did not fully understand the importance of their city as a bulwark against communism , protecting the entire country against a soviet invasion .
" i said to myself : once the russians are berlin , they will be sitting on the rhine four weeks later , " says a woman , who has been a longtime resident of berlin .
" and i think that would have been the case .
the russians would simply have marched through .
once they had reached west berlin , they would have bulldozed the country - maybe not in four weeks , maybe a little later .
and they would not only have gone as far as the rhine , but even further .
that was the opinion of many people at the time . "
in the early 1960s , the cold war was at it 's peak .
not only was james bond fighting fictitious communist villains in the cinemas of the west .
the delivery of soviet nuclear medium-range missiles to cuba in 1962 had only just brought the world to the brink of a nuclear war .
communism as an ideology seemed like a viable and attractive alternative to capitalism for many intellectuals , even in the west .
john f. kennedy therefore used his speech in west berlin not only to boost the morale of the inhabitants there , but also to condemn communism as a politically , economically and morally inferior system everywhere in the world , with the berlin wall the most obvious and vivid demonstration of communism 's failures .
" there are many people in the world who really do n't understand , or say they do n't , what is the great issue between the free world and the communist world .
let them come to berlin .
there are some who say that communism is the wave of the future .
let them come to berlin .
and there are some who say in europe and elsewhere we can work with the communists .
let them come to berlin . "
an american legend according to alexander longolius , john f. kennedy became a mythical figure in germany and elsewhere because he was highly credible .
" he was not only an american president .
he was the leader of the west , " he says .
" the man who gave all of us hope , a perspective and a dream .
the united states at that time combined military , economic , cultural and moral leadership .
and there was no doubt in our mind that kennedy stood for all that . "
kennedy 's premature death at the hands of a gunman in dallas only a few months after holding his berlin speech temporarily plunged the city into depression and despair .
today , 40 years later , kennedy 's legacy lives on in germany 's collective memory - for example in school books , documentaries about the cold war and in an exhibition at the german national museum of contemporary history in bonn .
there , the most famous excerpt of kennedy 's speech is displayed on a television monitor , and there is a copy of the piece of paper john f. kennedy held in his hand when delivering his speech , complete with the lines " ich bin ein berliner " and " let them come to berlin " scrawled on it in his own hand-writing .
herman schäfer , a custodian at the museum , says the document still elicits a deep response today .
" the reaction of our visitors is very enthusiastic , still enthusiastic , even though this 40 years ago .
everybody - be it young or old people - have in mind that this is a quotation from john f. kennedy .
so they hear this quotation and then the look into the glass case and see with even more surprise that there is this little document with the phonetic transcription of john f. kennedy .
so there is still this enthusiasm about this quotation that -lrb- puts -rrb- so much emphasis on the german-american friendship during the 1960s . "
kennedy 's speech has been cited and used as a model by other politicians since 1963 .
shortly before the berlin wall came down in 1989 , u.s. president ronald reagan addressed soviet leader mikhail gorbachev from the same location , telling him the time was ripe for german reunification .
and when after the sept .
11. attacks on new york and washington , chancellor schröder pledged " unlimited " support to the us in its war on terrorism , he alluded to george w. bush ' famous predecessor .
" when the defense of berlin was at stake , john f. kennedy said - and you all know this famous sentence - ' i am a berliner ' , " schröder said .
" that was the expression of incredible solidarity .
today i believe that we have every reason - especially we germans - to return this solidarity by expressing our solidarity with the american people . "
strained relations however , following germany 's refusal to back the u.s.-led war on iraq , relations between the two countries reached a historic low .
many germans refused to believe that the ideals kennedy had upheld in berlin were being appropriately defended by bush .
because of the widespread rejection of the war , germans have been accused of anti-americanism .
but according to schäfer of the national museum in bonn , the us-german relationship has not been fundamentally impaired .
" it is still as strong as in former times and if we look to the development of our civilization , i personally think that the united states is something like the leading civilized nation of the world , " he says .
" and there are a lot of different developments which are already there - if we like them or not - and many of them i do not like , i would not agree with all developments which are under way in the u.s. they will come to our state , to our country , to europe soon or later .
but we have to decide individually if we want to adopt them . "

his words still resound today in berlin , even 12 years after reunification . " two thousand years ago the proudest boast was " civis romanus sum . "
today , in the world of freedom , the proudest boast is " ich bin ein berliner . "
when united states president john f. kennedy made the famous statement " ich bin ein berliner " – -lrb- i am a berliner -rrb- - in front of the city hall of west berlin on june 26 , 1963 , he uttered words that went straight to the hearts of the citizens of berlin .
he insinuated that they were - just like the citizens of rome in earlier times - free people , with an unalienable right to freedom and the right to be protected by the rest of the free world .
it was a rousing speech that quite possibly turned the tide in favor of holding on to berlin as an isolated outpost in communist east germany at a time when it was in very real danger of falling to the communist german democratic republic .
" this was a very intense feeling of closeness , " recalls alexander longolius , a member of west germany 's city council in 1963 and later director of the checkpoint charlie foundation .
" if the americans had turned away from us , if that speech had told us we were leaving the city , then it would have been dramatic .
i remember that i went home and told my wife -lrb- ... -rrb- that our worries are over and everything would be good . "
a divided city from the end of world war ii in 1945 until the beginning of german reunification in 1989 , germany as a whole , and berlin as a city , was divided by the cold war a state of open confrontation between the communist bloc and the nato alliance .
in august 1961 , the soviets erected the berlin wall to stop the mass exodus of people fleeing soviet east berlin for west berlin and the non-communist world , thus sealing west berlin behind a 12-foot wall for some 28 years .
two years after this , kennedy gave his historic speech , which still finds incredible resonance here 40 years later .
in 1963 , west berlin was militarily protected by and partly governed by american , french and british forces .
the largest military contingent was american , and faced off a sizeable soviet contingent on the other side of the wall .
many people - and companies - had left the divided city for greener and safer pastures .
in his speech , kennedy expressed admiration for those who stayed on despite the city 's isolation .
" i want to say , on behalf of my countrymen , who live many miles away on the other side of the atlantic , who are far distant from you , that they take the greatest pride that they have been able to share with you , even from a distance , the story of the last 18 years .
i know of no town , no city , that has been besieged for 18 years that still lives with the vitality and the force and the hope and the determination of the city of west berlin . "
these words , uttered by the american president , had a soothing effect not only on the souls of beleaguered west berliners , but on the german post-war psyche as a whole .
many germans still felt a deep sense of guilt for the crimes they or their parents had committed - or at least had not prevented - during world war ii and the holocaust .
berliners were particularly receptive of the support kennedy expressed .
after all , when the wall went up in 1961 , many west germans were convinced the city was entirely lost to the communists .
" i was on vacation in west germany in the bavarian forest to the south of berlin , " longolius says .
" we were on a farm , and did n't have a radio .
so i did n't hear about the wall on that sunday .
i heard about it on tuesday , two days later , when our landlady - a farmer 's woman - asked me where i would go when my vacation was over .
and i said i would go home .
and she said to me : you ca n't do that any more because they 've cut west berlin off . "
when he toured west berlin , kennedy was accompanied by the then-mayor of berlin , willy brandt , and german chancellor konrad adenauer .
many berliners felt the chancellor and other west germans did not fully understand the importance of their city as a bulwark against communism , protecting the entire country against a soviet invasion .
" i said to myself : once the russians are berlin , they will be sitting on the rhine four weeks later , " says a woman , who has been a longtime resident of berlin .

it was a rousing speech that quite possibly turned the tide in favor of holding on to berlin as an isolated outpost in communist east germany at a time when it was in very real danger of falling to the communist german democratic republic .
" this was a very intense feeling of closeness , " recalls alexander longolius , a member of west germany 's city council in 1963 and later director of the checkpoint charlie foundation .
" if the americans had turned away from us , if that speech had told us we were leaving the city , then it would have been dramatic .
i remember that i went home and told my wife -lrb- ... -rrb- that our worries are over and everything would be good . "
a divided city from the end of world war ii in 1945 until the beginning of german reunification in 1989 , germany as a whole , and berlin as a city , was divided by the cold war a state of open confrontation between the communist bloc and the nato alliance .
in august 1961 , the soviets erected the berlin wall to stop the mass exodus of people fleeing soviet east berlin for west berlin and the non-communist world , thus sealing west berlin behind a 12-foot wall for some 28 years .
two years after this , kennedy gave his historic speech , which still finds incredible resonance here 40 years later .
in 1963 , west berlin was militarily protected by and partly governed by american , french and british forces .
the largest military contingent was american , and faced off a sizeable soviet contingent on the other side of the wall .
many people - and companies - had left the divided city for greener and safer pastures .
in his speech , kennedy expressed admiration for those who stayed on despite the city 's isolation .
" i want to say , on behalf of my countrymen , who live many miles away on the other side of the atlantic , who are far distant from you , that they take the greatest pride that they have been able to share with you , even from a distance , the story of the last 18 years .
i know of no town , no city , that has been besieged for 18 years that still lives with the vitality and the force and the hope and the determination of the city of west berlin . "
these words , uttered by the american president , had a soothing effect not only on the souls of beleaguered west berliners , but on the german post-war psyche as a whole .
many germans still felt a deep sense of guilt for the crimes they or their parents had committed - or at least had not prevented - during world war ii and the holocaust .
berliners were particularly receptive of the support kennedy expressed .
after all , when the wall went up in 1961 , many west germans were convinced the city was entirely lost to the communists .
" i was on vacation in west germany in the bavarian forest to the south of berlin , " longolius says .
" we were on a farm , and did n't have a radio .
so i did n't hear about the wall on that sunday .
i heard about it on tuesday , two days later , when our landlady - a farmer 's woman - asked me where i would go when my vacation was over .
and i said i would go home .
and she said to me : you ca n't do that any more because they 've cut west berlin off . "
when he toured west berlin , kennedy was accompanied by the then-mayor of berlin , willy brandt , and german chancellor konrad adenauer .
many berliners felt the chancellor and other west germans did not fully understand the importance of their city as a bulwark against communism , protecting the entire country against a soviet invasion .
" i said to myself : once the russians are berlin , they will be sitting on the rhine four weeks later , " says a woman , who has been a longtime resident of berlin .
" and i think that would have been the case .
the russians would simply have marched through .
once they had reached west berlin , they would have bulldozed the country - maybe not in four weeks , maybe a little later .
and they would not only have gone as far as the rhine , but even further .
that was the opinion of many people at the time . "
in the early 1960s , the cold war was at it 's peak .
not only was james bond fighting fictitious communist villains in the cinemas of the west .
the delivery of soviet nuclear medium-range missiles to cuba in 1962 had only just brought the world to the brink of a nuclear war .
communism as an ideology seemed like a viable and attractive alternative to capitalism for many intellectuals , even in the west .
john f. kennedy therefore used his speech in west berlin not only to boost the morale of the inhabitants there , but also to condemn communism as a politically , economically and morally inferior system everywhere in the world , with the berlin wall the most obvious and vivid demonstration of communism 's failures .
" there are many people in the world who really do n't understand , or say they do n't , what is the great issue between the free world and the communist world .
let them come to berlin .
there are some who say that communism is the wave of the future .
let them come to berlin .
and there are some who say in europe and elsewhere we can work with the communists .
let them come to berlin . "
an american legend according to alexander longolius , john f. kennedy became a mythical figure in germany and elsewhere because he was highly credible .
" he was not only an american president .
he was the leader of the west , " he says .
" the man who gave all of us hope , a perspective and a dream .
the united states at that time combined military , economic , cultural and moral leadership .
and there was no doubt in our mind that kennedy stood for all that . "
kennedy 's premature death at the hands of a gunman in dallas only a few months after holding his berlin speech temporarily plunged the city into depression and despair .
today , 40 years later , kennedy 's legacy lives on in germany 's collective memory - for example in school books , documentaries about the cold war and in an exhibition at the german national museum of contemporary history in bonn .
there , the most famous excerpt of kennedy 's speech is displayed on a television monitor , and there is a copy of the piece of paper john f. kennedy held in his hand when delivering his speech , complete with the lines " ich bin ein berliner " and " let them come to berlin " scrawled on it in his own hand-writing .
herman schäfer , a custodian at the museum , says the document still elicits a deep response today .
" the reaction of our visitors is very enthusiastic , still enthusiastic , even though this 40 years ago .
everybody - be it young or old people - have in mind that this is a quotation from john f. kennedy .
so they hear this quotation and then the look into the glass case and see with even more surprise that there is this little document with the phonetic transcription of john f. kennedy .
so there is still this enthusiasm about this quotation that -lrb- puts -rrb- so much emphasis on the german-american friendship during the 1960s . "
kennedy 's speech has been cited and used as a model by other politicians since 1963 .
shortly before the berlin wall came down in 1989 , u.s. president ronald reagan addressed soviet leader mikhail gorbachev from the same location , telling him the time was ripe for german reunification .
and when after the sept .
11. attacks on new york and washington , chancellor schröder pledged " unlimited " support to the us in its war on terrorism , he alluded to george w. bush ' famous predecessor .
" when the defense of berlin was at stake , john f. kennedy said - and you all know this famous sentence - ' i am a berliner ' , " schröder said .
" that was the expression of incredible solidarity .
today i believe that we have every reason - especially we germans - to return this solidarity by expressing our solidarity with the american people . "
strained relations however , following germany 's refusal to back the u.s.-led war on iraq , relations between the two countries reached a historic low .
many germans refused to believe that the ideals kennedy had upheld in berlin were being appropriately defended by bush .
because of the widespread rejection of the war , germans have been accused of anti-americanism .
but according to schäfer of the national museum in bonn , the us-german relationship has not been fundamentally impaired .
" it is still as strong as in former times and if we look to the development of our civilization , i personally think that the united states is something like the leading civilized nation of the world , " he says .
" and there are a lot of different developments which are already there - if we like them or not - and many of them i do not like , i would not agree with all developments which are under way in the u.s. they will come to our state , to our country , to europe soon or later .
but we have to decide individually if we want to adopt them . "
editor 's note : john f. kennedy 's historic visit to berlin in 1963 is also the subject of a new exhibit at the german historical museum in berlin , which will be displaying 400 artifacts from the life of the former president through oct .

europe and the united states are slowly smoothing out their troubled relations originating from the iraq conflict .

though progression in this conflict is moving more slowly than in the fight against terrorism , new rays of hope have appeared on the horizon .
these involve efforts within the group know as the middle east quartet - made up of the united states , the eu , the united nations and russia - as well as the personal commitment by u.s. president george w. bush .

the nuclear program of a nation blessed with rich energy sources is , in fact , cause for worry on all sides .
but a military intervention by the u.s. similar to that in iraq is currently not under discussion .

in an interview with deutsche welle , he said security was still the country 's biggest problem . " afghanistan is a very violent place .
we ’ ve got to be careful and take as many precautions as possible .
there are still spoilers out there who do not want this peace process to succeed , " brahimi said in an interview with deutsche welle .
the united nations special envoy to afghanistan is in germany to receive a special peace prize from the federal state of hessen on thursday .
ahead of the award ceremony , he met with german foreign minister joschka fischer and defense minister peter struck .
during the meeting with the two german ministers , brahimi stressed how important the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- was to maintaining the peace in conflict-ridden afghanistan .
after nearly 25 years of war and civil strife , the country needs the international peacekeepers and the provincial reconstruction teams to restore security , rebuild the infrastructure and help the central government establish its authority outside kabul , brahimi said .
" the international troops , isaf , are needed now and they will be needed for some time .
how long is difficult to say .
my personal calculation is a couple of years before the afghan army and national police can provide security for the people of afghanistan , especially in kabul .
i think it will take one or two years . "
limited influence one of the main problems facing reconstruction efforts in afghanistan is the limited reach of the central government under president hamid karsai , whose position , although recognized and respected in the provinces , has hardly any influence over the warlords and militias who still control considerable areas of the country .
brahimi said this was understandable in a state that has been completely destroyed .
" we are in a process of rebuilding the state machinery .
there are no roads , no telephones , no lines of communication .
that is why it is so difficult to project the influence of the central government in the country , " brahimi explained .
" the government is limited in its resources , but it is recognized in the provinces , " he said , " and therefore what is required is to help the government rebuild the state , not only in kabul , but in the provinces . "
" the best way of doing this , " brahimi stressed , " is to extend isaf outside the capital . "
extending the isaf mandate but the issue of extending the commitment of international peacekeepers in afghanistan is still a matter of discussion .
the isaf , which will be operated under dutch-german command until august , is currently restricted to the afghan capital kabul , but the united states and u.n. secretary general kofi annan have requested that troops also be sent to the provinces to protect civilian workers who are helping rebuild the country .
in berlin , the question of extending the isaf mandate beyond kabul has been met with a good deal of opposition following a june 7 bombing in the capital city that killed four german soldiers .
germany , which supplies the largest troop contingent in the international force , has been hesitant to commit more soldiers and extend their area of operation until the security situation in the provinces improves .
the german parliament in not scheduled to vote on an extension of the mandate until september .
brahimi said he respects the german government ’ s deliberations in light of the recent terrorist attack , but at the same time he expressed hope that germany would not rule against extending the security forces outside kabul .
" i think we would be sorry if that was the decision of the federal republic of germany , " he told deutsche welle .
the isaf is still developing , brahimi explained , " but it promises to be helpful for the progress of the peace process , for the training of the afghan police and the army . "
he added that not expanding isaf ’ s mandate beyond kabul would hinder the security and reconstruction efforts in the provinces and prolong the instability in the country .
" afghanistan is certainly in some parts still a dangerous place , " brahimi conceded , " but i think in the places -lsb- the german government -rsb- is contemplating , we don ’ t see many problems for the german soldiers if they were there . "
" of course we must be careful , " he continued while pointing out that the united nations itself has been sending unarmed civilians into the provinces for quite some time .
brahimi admitted , though , that security was a serious problem for u.n. reconstruction workers who are not able to access certain regions in the south and east and can only enter other regions with bodyguards .
the road to democracy according to brahimi , it will take some time before afghanistan is in a position to provide its own effective security .
he estimated that by september the national police and army are expected to have trained about 6,000 people , but it will be at least another year before the central government will have built up enough of a security force to make a substantial difference .
building a democratic state takes time , brahimi emphasized .
it is a slow and difficult process .
nonetheless , he expects that afghanistan will have a constitution in the near future .
" the constitution work has started and it is going reasonably well .
barring any unforeseen difficulties , we hope the country will have a new constitution by october , " he stated .
elections , on the other hand , are more difficult .
the u.n. envoy described them as a logistical nightmare .
" we have to register people all over the country , in every village .
and we have to go there ourselves , because they will not come to us , especially the women .
that means we have to recruit thousands of people , and it will cost a lot of money . "
but he believes elections can take place as early as october 2004 , if the security situation in the countryside allows for it , brahimi added .
waning interest in afghanistan ?
when asked if international interest in afghanistan was fading and whether or not money from western donor countries was drying up , brahimi responded that there is always the fear of donor fatigue and competition with the attraction of other international crisis situations .
" probably the attention has diminished a little bit , " he said , " but i think there ’ s still a reasonable amount of interest and support for what is happening in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.06.2003 eu farming policy set for major revamp großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's reformed agricultural policy is likely to mean change for many farms in europe .
european union agricultural ministers reached a deal thursday to overhaul the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- after years of deadlock , ending brussels ’ controversial policy of generous farm hand-outs . eu farming ministers meeting in luxembourg agreed on a comprehensive reform package for the 15-nation bloc ’ s agriculture policy on thursday after a marathon round of negotiations to thrash out the last details .
portugal was the only country to vote against the reform .
the move amounts to the most radical shake-up of the eu ’ s expensive 45-year-old cap , which critics have long argued undermines world trade and puts poor countries at a disadvantage .
the main thrust of the reforms is to cut back the eu ’ s program of huge direct subsidies to farmers , which account to about € 43 billion -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- a year - almost half the entire eu budget .
crop subsidies eliminated the chief architect of the reform plan , eu agricultural commissioner franz fischler , managed to largely salvage the cornerstone of his reform plan - namely breaking down the traditional link between subsidy and agricultural output , which has been blamed for offering an incentive to farmers to overproduce merely to get more cash from brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commissioner for agriculture , rural development and fisheries franz fischler fischler -lrb- photo -rrb- said the reforms would shape the future of european farming and end the practice of automatic farm handouts . " this decision marks the beginning of a new era .
our farm policy will fundamentally change.today , europe has given itself a new and effective farm policy , " he said .
the accord was hailed by leaders from several member countries .
" the agreement today delivers what we wanted - real change , " said britain 's agriculture minister , margaret beckett .

european union agricultural ministers reached a deal thursday to overhaul the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- after years of deadlock , ending brussels ’ controversial policy of generous farm hand-outs . eu farming ministers meeting in luxembourg agreed on a comprehensive reform package for the 15-nation bloc ’ s agriculture policy on thursday after a marathon round of negotiations to thrash out the last details .
portugal was the only country to vote against the reform .
the move amounts to the most radical shake-up of the eu ’ s expensive 45-year-old cap , which critics have long argued undermines world trade and puts poor countries at a disadvantage .
the main thrust of the reforms is to cut back the eu ’ s program of huge direct subsidies to farmers , which account to about € 43 billion -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- a year - almost half the entire eu budget .
crop subsidies eliminated the chief architect of the reform plan , eu agricultural commissioner franz fischler , managed to largely salvage the cornerstone of his reform plan - namely breaking down the traditional link between subsidy and agricultural output , which has been blamed for offering an incentive to farmers to overproduce merely to get more cash from brussels .

in an interview with deutsche welle , he said security was still the country 's biggest problem . " afghanistan is a very violent place .
we ’ ve got to be careful and take as many precautions as possible .
there are still spoilers out there who do not want this peace process to succeed , " brahimi said in an interview with deutsche welle .
the united nations special envoy to afghanistan is in germany to receive a special peace prize from the federal state of hessen on thursday .
ahead of the award ceremony , he met with german foreign minister joschka fischer and defense minister peter struck .
during the meeting with the two german ministers , brahimi stressed how important the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- was to maintaining the peace in conflict-ridden afghanistan .
after nearly 25 years of war and civil strife , the country needs the international peacekeepers and the provincial reconstruction teams to restore security , rebuild the infrastructure and help the central government establish its authority outside kabul , brahimi said .
" the international troops , isaf , are needed now and they will be needed for some time .
how long is difficult to say .
my personal calculation is a couple of years before the afghan army and national police can provide security for the people of afghanistan , especially in kabul .
i think it will take one or two years . "
limited influence one of the main problems facing reconstruction efforts in afghanistan is the limited reach of the central government under president hamid karsai , whose position , although recognized and respected in the provinces , has hardly any influence over the warlords and militias who still control considerable areas of the country .
brahimi said this was understandable in a state that has been completely destroyed .
" we are in a process of rebuilding the state machinery .
there are no roads , no telephones , no lines of communication .
that is why it is so difficult to project the influence of the central government in the country , " brahimi explained .
" the government is limited in its resources , but it is recognized in the provinces , " he said , " and therefore what is required is to help the government rebuild the state , not only in kabul , but in the provinces . "
" the best way of doing this , " brahimi stressed , " is to extend isaf outside the capital . "
extending the isaf mandate but the issue of extending the commitment of international peacekeepers in afghanistan is still a matter of discussion .
the isaf , which will be operated under dutch-german command until august , is currently restricted to the afghan capital kabul , but the united states and u.n. secretary general kofi annan have requested that troops also be sent to the provinces to protect civilian workers who are helping rebuild the country .
in berlin , the question of extending the isaf mandate beyond kabul has been met with a good deal of opposition following a june 7 bombing in the capital city that killed four german soldiers .
germany , which supplies the largest troop contingent in the international force , has been hesitant to commit more soldiers and extend their area of operation until the security situation in the provinces improves .
the german parliament in not scheduled to vote on an extension of the mandate until september .
brahimi said he respects the german government ’ s deliberations in light of the recent terrorist attack , but at the same time he expressed hope that germany would not rule against extending the security forces outside kabul .
" i think we would be sorry if that was the decision of the federal republic of germany , " he told deutsche welle .
the isaf is still developing , brahimi explained , " but it promises to be helpful for the progress of the peace process , for the training of the afghan police and the army . "
he added that not expanding isaf ’ s mandate beyond kabul would hinder the security and reconstruction efforts in the provinces and prolong the instability in the country .
" afghanistan is certainly in some parts still a dangerous place , " brahimi conceded , " but i think in the places -lsb- the german government -rsb- is contemplating , we don ’ t see many problems for the german soldiers if they were there . "
" of course we must be careful , " he continued while pointing out that the united nations itself has been sending unarmed civilians into the provinces for quite some time .
brahimi admitted , though , that security was a serious problem for u.n. reconstruction workers who are not able to access certain regions in the south and east and can only enter other regions with bodyguards .
the road to democracy according to brahimi , it will take some time before afghanistan is in a position to provide its own effective security .
he estimated that by september the national police and army are expected to have trained about 6,000 people , but it will be at least another year before the central government will have built up enough of a security force to make a substantial difference .
building a democratic state takes time , brahimi emphasized .
it is a slow and difficult process .
nonetheless , he expects that afghanistan will have a constitution in the near future .
" the constitution work has started and it is going reasonably well .
barring any unforeseen difficulties , we hope the country will have a new constitution by october , " he stated .
elections , on the other hand , are more difficult .
the u.n. envoy described them as a logistical nightmare .
" we have to register people all over the country , in every village .
and we have to go there ourselves , because they will not come to us , especially the women .
that means we have to recruit thousands of people , and it will cost a lot of money . "
but he believes elections can take place as early as october 2004 , if the security situation in the countryside allows for it , brahimi added .
waning interest in afghanistan ?
when asked if international interest in afghanistan was fading and whether or not money from western donor countries was drying up , brahimi responded that there is always the fear of donor fatigue and competition with the attraction of other international crisis situations .
" probably the attention has diminished a little bit , " he said , " but i think there ’ s still a reasonable amount of interest and support for what is happening in afghanistan .

mannheimer woes seen troubling insurance industry ; deutsche bahn forced to offer competitor 's timetables ; economists see light at the end of the tunnel . mannheimer insolvency signals trouble for industry one of germany ’ s oldest insurance companies was left looking for a bailout plan on thursday after the german insurance industry association -lrb- gdv -rrb- announced that a last-minute rescue initiative to raise € 370 million -lrb- $ 426 million -rrb- from fellow insurers had failed .
the mannheimer lebensversicherung ag , which has been struggling to stay afloat following significant losses on the capital markets last year , turned to the gdv – a cooperation of 110 insurance companies - in the hopes of drumming up enough fresh cash to prevent it from being the first german insurer to go under in 50 years .
the gdv , however , could not convince the necessary 90 percent of its members to back the rescue plan .
it now looks as if mannheimer will become the first german insurer to seek help from protektor , the industry-backed safety net set up last year to protect policyholder ’ s investments in the event of an insurer ’ s insolvency .
but protektor so far only exists on paper , and with a start-up capital of just € 3.2 million put forth by 10 insurers , its rescue funds remain rather limited .
that ’ s not good news for the german government , which has been encouraging citizens to invest in equity-based life insurance plans rather than rely on state support for their retirement .
a perceived weakness in the insurance industry could cause the public to lose confidence in the whole concept .
deutsche bahn to provide timetables for connex the deutsche bahn , germany ’ s largest rail company , must include information from its competitor connex in its long-distance timetables , according to a new ruling by the berlin regional court on thursday .
from now on , the formerly state-owned bahn is required to provide route plans and times for connex via its internet and telephone services .
the ruling came after months of failed negotiations and connex , a subsidiary of the french vivendi corporation , took the bahn to court claiming its monopoly over long-distance timetables reflected an unfair competition advantage .
the bahn rejected such arguments as unfounded .
but the german cartel office , which had warned the bahn of a possible investigation back in february , said the bahn ’ s refusal to provide information on prices and timetables for connex blocked efforts to open up the country ’ s rail system to more competitors .
connex , with its three routes , including the newly-opened cologne-rostock stretch , is the deutsche bahn ’ s only competitor in long-distance train travel .
economy seen rebounding after all the bad news about germany ’ s economy , from rumors of deflation to signs of a recession , it now looks as if there might be light at the end of the tunnel .
six of the leading german economic research institutes said there are signs that the economy will improve by the end of the year .
according to a survey of the institutes ’ directors published in the berliner zeitung newspaper on thursday , the majority of the experts are convinced the country will experience considerable economic growth in the coming year .
they cited the government ’ s plans to reform health care and the pension plan as well as its steps to bring forward a tax cut as the source of the renewed optimism .
the director of the institute for economic research -lrb- iwh -rrb- in halle , rüdiger pohl , was quoted as saying , " the reform agenda is being pushed through with momentum .
everyone is noticing that germany is serious about its efforts to revitalize the economy .

mannheimer woes seen troubling insurance industry ; deutsche bahn forced to offer competitor 's timetables ; economists see light at the end of the tunnel . mannheimer insolvency signals trouble for industry one of germany ’ s oldest insurance companies was left looking for a bailout plan on thursday after the german insurance industry association -lrb- gdv -rrb- announced that a last-minute rescue initiative to raise € 370 million -lrb- $ 426 million -rrb- from fellow insurers had failed .
the mannheimer lebensversicherung ag , which has been struggling to stay afloat following significant losses on the capital markets last year , turned to the gdv – a cooperation of 110 insurance companies - in the hopes of drumming up enough fresh cash to prevent it from being the first german insurer to go under in 50 years .
the gdv , however , could not convince the necessary 90 percent of its members to back the rescue plan .
it now looks as if mannheimer will become the first german insurer to seek help from protektor , the industry-backed safety net set up last year to protect policyholder ’ s investments in the event of an insurer ’ s insolvency .
but protektor so far only exists on paper , and with a start-up capital of just € 3.2 million put forth by 10 insurers , its rescue funds remain rather limited .
that ’ s not good news for the german government , which has been encouraging citizens to invest in equity-based life insurance plans rather than rely on state support for their retirement .
a perceived weakness in the insurance industry could cause the public to lose confidence in the whole concept .
deutsche bahn to provide timetables for connex the deutsche bahn , germany ’ s largest rail company , must include information from its competitor connex in its long-distance timetables , according to a new ruling by the berlin regional court on thursday .
from now on , the formerly state-owned bahn is required to provide route plans and times for connex via its internet and telephone services .
the ruling came after months of failed negotiations and connex , a subsidiary of the french vivendi corporation , took the bahn to court claiming its monopoly over long-distance timetables reflected an unfair competition advantage .
the bahn rejected such arguments as unfounded .
but the german cartel office , which had warned the bahn of a possible investigation back in february , said the bahn ’ s refusal to provide information on prices and timetables for connex blocked efforts to open up the country ’ s rail system to more competitors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.06.2003 kennedy still a ' berliner ' after all these years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john f. kennedy : " ich bin ein berliner " thursday marks the 40th anniversary of u.s. president john f. kennedy 's famous " ich bin ein berliner " speech .
his words still resound today in berlin , even 12 years after reunification . " two thousand years ago the proudest boast was " civis romanus sum . "
today , in the world of freedom , the proudest boast is " ich bin ein berliner . "
when united states president john f. kennedy made the famous statement " ich bin ein berliner " – -lrb- i am a berliner -rrb- - in front of the city hall of west berlin on june 26 , 1963 , he uttered words that went straight to the hearts of the citizens of berlin .
he insinuated that they were - just like the citizens of rome in earlier times - free people , with an unalienable right to freedom and the right to be protected by the rest of the free world .
it was a rousing speech that quite possibly turned the tide in favor of holding on to berlin as an isolated outpost in communist east germany at a time when it was in very real danger of falling to the communist german democratic republic .
" this was a very intense feeling of closeness , " recalls alexander longolius , a member of west germany 's city council in 1963 and later director of the checkpoint charlie foundation .
" if the americans had turned away from us , if that speech had told us we were leaving the city , then it would have been dramatic .
i remember that i went home and told my wife -lrb- ... -rrb- that our worries are over and everything would be good . "
a divided city from the end of world war ii in 1945 until the beginning of german reunification in 1989 , germany as a whole , and berlin as a city , was divided by the cold war a state of open confrontation between the communist bloc and the nato alliance .
in august 1961 , the soviets erected the berlin wall to stop the mass exodus of people fleeing soviet east berlin for west berlin and the non-communist world , thus sealing west berlin behind a 12-foot wall for some 28 years .
two years after this , kennedy gave his historic speech , which still finds incredible resonance here 40 years later .
in 1963 , west berlin was militarily protected by and partly governed by american , french and british forces .
the largest military contingent was american , and faced off a sizeable soviet contingent on the other side of the wall .
many people - and companies - had left the divided city for greener and safer pastures .
in his speech , kennedy expressed admiration for those who stayed on despite the city 's isolation .
" i want to say , on behalf of my countrymen , who live many miles away on the other side of the atlantic , who are far distant from you , that they take the greatest pride that they have been able to share with you , even from a distance , the story of the last 18 years .
i know of no town , no city , that has been besieged for 18 years that still lives with the vitality and the force and the hope and the determination of the city of west berlin . "
these words , uttered by the american president , had a soothing effect not only on the souls of beleaguered west berliners , but on the german post-war psyche as a whole .
many germans still felt a deep sense of guilt for the crimes they or their parents had committed - or at least had not prevented - during world war ii and the holocaust .
berliners were particularly receptive of the support kennedy expressed .
after all , when the wall went up in 1961 , many west germans were convinced the city was entirely lost to the communists .
" i was on vacation in west germany in the bavarian forest to the south of berlin , " longolius says .
" we were on a farm , and did n't have a radio .
so i did n't hear about the wall on that sunday .
i heard about it on tuesday , two days later , when our landlady - a farmer 's woman - asked me where i would go when my vacation was over .
and i said i would go home .
and she said to me : you ca n't do that any more because they 've cut west berlin off . "
when he toured west berlin , kennedy was accompanied by the then-mayor of berlin , willy brandt , and german chancellor konrad adenauer .
many berliners felt the chancellor and other west germans did not fully understand the importance of their city as a bulwark against communism , protecting the entire country against a soviet invasion .
" i said to myself : once the russians are berlin , they will be sitting on the rhine four weeks later , " says a woman , who has been a longtime resident of berlin .
" and i think that would have been the case .
the russians would simply have marched through .
once they had reached west berlin , they would have bulldozed the country - maybe not in four weeks , maybe a little later .
and they would not only have gone as far as the rhine , but even further .
that was the opinion of many people at the time . "
in the early 1960s , the cold war was at it 's peak .
not only was james bond fighting fictitious communist villains in the cinemas of the west .
the delivery of soviet nuclear medium-range missiles to cuba in 1962 had only just brought the world to the brink of a nuclear war .
communism as an ideology seemed like a viable and attractive alternative to capitalism for many intellectuals , even in the west .
john f. kennedy therefore used his speech in west berlin not only to boost the morale of the inhabitants there , but also to condemn communism as a politically , economically and morally inferior system everywhere in the world , with the berlin wall the most obvious and vivid demonstration of communism 's failures .
" there are many people in the world who really do n't understand , or say they do n't , what is the great issue between the free world and the communist world .
let them come to berlin .
there are some who say that communism is the wave of the future .
let them come to berlin .
and there are some who say in europe and elsewhere we can work with the communists .
let them come to berlin . "
an american legend according to alexander longolius , john f. kennedy became a mythical figure in germany and elsewhere because he was highly credible .
" he was not only an american president .
he was the leader of the west , " he says .
" the man who gave all of us hope , a perspective and a dream .
the united states at that time combined military , economic , cultural and moral leadership .
and there was no doubt in our mind that kennedy stood for all that . "
kennedy 's premature death at the hands of a gunman in dallas only a few months after holding his berlin speech temporarily plunged the city into depression and despair .
today , 40 years later , kennedy 's legacy lives on in germany 's collective memory - for example in school books , documentaries about the cold war and in an exhibition at the german national museum of contemporary history in bonn .
there , the most famous excerpt of kennedy 's speech is displayed on a television monitor , and there is a copy of the piece of paper john f. kennedy held in his hand when delivering his speech , complete with the lines " ich bin ein berliner " and " let them come to berlin " scrawled on it in his own hand-writing .
herman schäfer , a custodian at the museum , says the document still elicits a deep response today .
" the reaction of our visitors is very enthusiastic , still enthusiastic , even though this 40 years ago .
everybody - be it young or old people - have in mind that this is a quotation from john f. kennedy .
so they hear this quotation and then the look into the glass case and see with even more surprise that there is this little document with the phonetic transcription of john f. kennedy .
so there is still this enthusiasm about this quotation that -lrb- puts -rrb- so much emphasis on the german-american friendship during the 1960s . "
kennedy 's speech has been cited and used as a model by other politicians since 1963 .
shortly before the berlin wall came down in 1989 , u.s. president ronald reagan addressed soviet leader mikhail gorbachev from the same location , telling him the time was ripe for german reunification .
and when after the sept .
11. attacks on new york and washington , chancellor schröder pledged " unlimited " support to the us in its war on terrorism , he alluded to george w. bush ' famous predecessor .
" when the defense of berlin was at stake , john f. kennedy said - and you all know this famous sentence - ' i am a berliner ' , " schröder said .
" that was the expression of incredible solidarity .
today i believe that we have every reason - especially we germans - to return this solidarity by expressing our solidarity with the american people . "
strained relations however , following germany 's refusal to back the u.s.-led war on iraq , relations between the two countries reached a historic low .
many germans refused to believe that the ideals kennedy had upheld in berlin were being appropriately defended by bush .
because of the widespread rejection of the war , germans have been accused of anti-americanism .
but according to schäfer of the national museum in bonn , the us-german relationship has not been fundamentally impaired .
" it is still as strong as in former times and if we look to the development of our civilization , i personally think that the united states is something like the leading civilized nation of the world , " he says .
" and there are a lot of different developments which are already there - if we like them or not - and many of them i do not like , i would not agree with all developments which are under way in the u.s. they will come to our state , to our country , to europe soon or later .
but we have to decide individually if we want to adopt them . "
editor 's note : john f. kennedy 's historic visit to berlin in 1963 is also the subject of a new exhibit at the german historical museum in berlin , which will be displaying 400 artifacts from the life of the former president through oct .

his words still resound today in berlin , even 12 years after reunification . " two thousand years ago the proudest boast was " civis romanus sum . "
today , in the world of freedom , the proudest boast is " ich bin ein berliner . "
when united states president john f. kennedy made the famous statement " ich bin ein berliner " – -lrb- i am a berliner -rrb- - in front of the city hall of west berlin on june 26 , 1963 , he uttered words that went straight to the hearts of the citizens of berlin .
he insinuated that they were - just like the citizens of rome in earlier times - free people , with an unalienable right to freedom and the right to be protected by the rest of the free world .
it was a rousing speech that quite possibly turned the tide in favor of holding on to berlin as an isolated outpost in communist east germany at a time when it was in very real danger of falling to the communist german democratic republic .
" this was a very intense feeling of closeness , " recalls alexander longolius , a member of west germany 's city council in 1963 and later director of the checkpoint charlie foundation .
" if the americans had turned away from us , if that speech had told us we were leaving the city , then it would have been dramatic .
i remember that i went home and told my wife -lrb- ... -rrb- that our worries are over and everything would be good . "
a divided city from the end of world war ii in 1945 until the beginning of german reunification in 1989 , germany as a whole , and berlin as a city , was divided by the cold war a state of open confrontation between the communist bloc and the nato alliance .
in august 1961 , the soviets erected the berlin wall to stop the mass exodus of people fleeing soviet east berlin for west berlin and the non-communist world , thus sealing west berlin behind a 12-foot wall for some 28 years .
two years after this , kennedy gave his historic speech , which still finds incredible resonance here 40 years later .
in 1963 , west berlin was militarily protected by and partly governed by american , french and british forces .
the largest military contingent was american , and faced off a sizeable soviet contingent on the other side of the wall .
many people - and companies - had left the divided city for greener and safer pastures .
in his speech , kennedy expressed admiration for those who stayed on despite the city 's isolation .
" i want to say , on behalf of my countrymen , who live many miles away on the other side of the atlantic , who are far distant from you , that they take the greatest pride that they have been able to share with you , even from a distance , the story of the last 18 years .
i know of no town , no city , that has been besieged for 18 years that still lives with the vitality and the force and the hope and the determination of the city of west berlin . "
these words , uttered by the american president , had a soothing effect not only on the souls of beleaguered west berliners , but on the german post-war psyche as a whole .
many germans still felt a deep sense of guilt for the crimes they or their parents had committed - or at least had not prevented - during world war ii and the holocaust .
berliners were particularly receptive of the support kennedy expressed .
after all , when the wall went up in 1961 , many west germans were convinced the city was entirely lost to the communists .
" i was on vacation in west germany in the bavarian forest to the south of berlin , " longolius says .
" we were on a farm , and did n't have a radio .
so i did n't hear about the wall on that sunday .
i heard about it on tuesday , two days later , when our landlady - a farmer 's woman - asked me where i would go when my vacation was over .
and i said i would go home .
and she said to me : you ca n't do that any more because they 've cut west berlin off . "
when he toured west berlin , kennedy was accompanied by the then-mayor of berlin , willy brandt , and german chancellor konrad adenauer .
many berliners felt the chancellor and other west germans did not fully understand the importance of their city as a bulwark against communism , protecting the entire country against a soviet invasion .
" i said to myself : once the russians are berlin , they will be sitting on the rhine four weeks later , " says a woman , who has been a longtime resident of berlin .
" and i think that would have been the case .
the russians would simply have marched through .
once they had reached west berlin , they would have bulldozed the country - maybe not in four weeks , maybe a little later .
and they would not only have gone as far as the rhine , but even further .
that was the opinion of many people at the time . "
in the early 1960s , the cold war was at it 's peak .
not only was james bond fighting fictitious communist villains in the cinemas of the west .
the delivery of soviet nuclear medium-range missiles to cuba in 1962 had only just brought the world to the brink of a nuclear war .
communism as an ideology seemed like a viable and attractive alternative to capitalism for many intellectuals , even in the west .
john f. kennedy therefore used his speech in west berlin not only to boost the morale of the inhabitants there , but also to condemn communism as a politically , economically and morally inferior system everywhere in the world , with the berlin wall the most obvious and vivid demonstration of communism 's failures .
" there are many people in the world who really do n't understand , or say they do n't , what is the great issue between the free world and the communist world .
let them come to berlin .
there are some who say that communism is the wave of the future .
let them come to berlin .
and there are some who say in europe and elsewhere we can work with the communists .
let them come to berlin . "
an american legend according to alexander longolius , john f. kennedy became a mythical figure in germany and elsewhere because he was highly credible .
" he was not only an american president .
he was the leader of the west , " he says .
" the man who gave all of us hope , a perspective and a dream .
the united states at that time combined military , economic , cultural and moral leadership .
and there was no doubt in our mind that kennedy stood for all that . "
kennedy 's premature death at the hands of a gunman in dallas only a few months after holding his berlin speech temporarily plunged the city into depression and despair .
today , 40 years later , kennedy 's legacy lives on in germany 's collective memory - for example in school books , documentaries about the cold war and in an exhibition at the german national museum of contemporary history in bonn .
there , the most famous excerpt of kennedy 's speech is displayed on a television monitor , and there is a copy of the piece of paper john f. kennedy held in his hand when delivering his speech , complete with the lines " ich bin ein berliner " and " let them come to berlin " scrawled on it in his own hand-writing .
herman schäfer , a custodian at the museum , says the document still elicits a deep response today .
" the reaction of our visitors is very enthusiastic , still enthusiastic , even though this 40 years ago .
everybody - be it young or old people - have in mind that this is a quotation from john f. kennedy .
so they hear this quotation and then the look into the glass case and see with even more surprise that there is this little document with the phonetic transcription of john f. kennedy .
so there is still this enthusiasm about this quotation that -lrb- puts -rrb- so much emphasis on the german-american friendship during the 1960s . "
kennedy 's speech has been cited and used as a model by other politicians since 1963 .
shortly before the berlin wall came down in 1989 , u.s. president ronald reagan addressed soviet leader mikhail gorbachev from the same location , telling him the time was ripe for german reunification .
and when after the sept .
11. attacks on new york and washington , chancellor schröder pledged " unlimited " support to the us in its war on terrorism , he alluded to george w. bush ' famous predecessor .
" when the defense of berlin was at stake , john f. kennedy said - and you all know this famous sentence - ' i am a berliner ' , " schröder said .
" that was the expression of incredible solidarity .
today i believe that we have every reason - especially we germans - to return this solidarity by expressing our solidarity with the american people . "
strained relations however , following germany 's refusal to back the u.s.-led war on iraq , relations between the two countries reached a historic low .
many germans refused to believe that the ideals kennedy had upheld in berlin were being appropriately defended by bush .
because of the widespread rejection of the war , germans have been accused of anti-americanism .
but according to schäfer of the national museum in bonn , the us-german relationship has not been fundamentally impaired .
" it is still as strong as in former times and if we look to the development of our civilization , i personally think that the united states is something like the leading civilized nation of the world , " he says .

europe and the united states are slowly smoothing out their troubled relations originating from the iraq conflict .
but there are still enough problems between the two to spark future political disagreements . who would have imagined ?
the shattered transatlantic bond between the united states and the european union appears to be on its way out of its crisis .
the two sides may not be moving towards a hot love affair .
but a partnership of convenience is certain to result .
the first eu-u.s. summit after the iraq war brought europeans and americans together once again and proved their ability to face up to common problems with combined powers .
good cooperation in the fight against terrorism plays a significant role here . new agreements in this sector not only stipulate joint investigative teams to uncover terrorist criminals , but also clarify the extradition of suspected terrorists to the united states .
in the case of the latter , the europeans do not need to fear that the suspects will be sentenced to death or tried before a military tribunal once they are on american soil . this agreement shows that both sides are capable of cooperating while respectfully recognizing the legal tradition of the other , together with its ethical-moral implications . working together for peace the common efforts to secure peace in the middle east follow a similar path .
though progression in this conflict is moving more slowly than in the fight against terrorism , new rays of hope have appeared on the horizon .
these involve efforts within the group know as the middle east quartet - made up of the united states , the eu , the united nations and russia - as well as the personal commitment by u.s. president george w. bush .
now , it is essential to withdraw the financial basis for the hamas movement 's activities , to press israel to reduce its settlements in the west bank and to use the signalized ceasefire by palestinian groups for a consequential implementation of the u.s. and eu-backed " road map " to peace . surprisingly , the transatlantic views on iran have conformed to each other relatively quickly .
the nuclear program of a nation blessed with rich energy sources is , in fact , cause for worry on all sides .
but a military intervention by the u.s. similar to that in iraq is currently not under discussion .
and the eu can use its good economic relations to iran to increase pressure on the country 's ayatollahs . moving forward despite differences despite political synergies , the problems of transatlantic cooperation remain on the agenda even after this summit .
europe 's ban on importing genetically-modified food continues to be a thorn in washington 's side .
and europe views the u.s. 's continuous refusal to work with the international criminal court as somewhat paranoid .
here , the devil lies in the detail .
but even if this transatlantic bond represents a partnership of convenience , the willingness to solve problems is growing to such a degree that it can reinstate lost trust .
in this sense , the summit in washington has taken europe and the united states a good step forward . daniel scheschkewitz is deutsche welle 's washington correspondent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de transatlantic summit dominated by anti-terror talks the one-day transatlantic summit in washington meant to smooth over iraq-war tensions saw leaders making progress on anti-terror cooperation , even as the united states urged europe to cut off funding to hamas -lrb- june 25 , 2003 -rrb- .

in an interview with deutsche welle , he said security was still the country 's biggest problem . " afghanistan is a very violent place .
we ’ ve got to be careful and take as many precautions as possible .
there are still spoilers out there who do not want this peace process to succeed , " brahimi said in an interview with deutsche welle .
the united nations special envoy to afghanistan is in germany to receive a special peace prize from the federal state of hessen on thursday .
ahead of the award ceremony , he met with german foreign minister joschka fischer and defense minister peter struck .
during the meeting with the two german ministers , brahimi stressed how important the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- was to maintaining the peace in conflict-ridden afghanistan .
after nearly 25 years of war and civil strife , the country needs the international peacekeepers and the provincial reconstruction teams to restore security , rebuild the infrastructure and help the central government establish its authority outside kabul , brahimi said .
" the international troops , isaf , are needed now and they will be needed for some time .
how long is difficult to say .
my personal calculation is a couple of years before the afghan army and national police can provide security for the people of afghanistan , especially in kabul .
i think it will take one or two years . "
limited influence one of the main problems facing reconstruction efforts in afghanistan is the limited reach of the central government under president hamid karsai , whose position , although recognized and respected in the provinces , has hardly any influence over the warlords and militias who still control considerable areas of the country .
brahimi said this was understandable in a state that has been completely destroyed .
" we are in a process of rebuilding the state machinery .
there are no roads , no telephones , no lines of communication .
that is why it is so difficult to project the influence of the central government in the country , " brahimi explained .
" the government is limited in its resources , but it is recognized in the provinces , " he said , " and therefore what is required is to help the government rebuild the state , not only in kabul , but in the provinces . "
" the best way of doing this , " brahimi stressed , " is to extend isaf outside the capital . "
extending the isaf mandate but the issue of extending the commitment of international peacekeepers in afghanistan is still a matter of discussion .
the isaf , which will be operated under dutch-german command until august , is currently restricted to the afghan capital kabul , but the united states and u.n. secretary general kofi annan have requested that troops also be sent to the provinces to protect civilian workers who are helping rebuild the country .
in berlin , the question of extending the isaf mandate beyond kabul has been met with a good deal of opposition following a june 7 bombing in the capital city that killed four german soldiers .
germany , which supplies the largest troop contingent in the international force , has been hesitant to commit more soldiers and extend their area of operation until the security situation in the provinces improves .
the german parliament in not scheduled to vote on an extension of the mandate until september .
brahimi said he respects the german government ’ s deliberations in light of the recent terrorist attack , but at the same time he expressed hope that germany would not rule against extending the security forces outside kabul .
" i think we would be sorry if that was the decision of the federal republic of germany , " he told deutsche welle .
the isaf is still developing , brahimi explained , " but it promises to be helpful for the progress of the peace process , for the training of the afghan police and the army . "
he added that not expanding isaf ’ s mandate beyond kabul would hinder the security and reconstruction efforts in the provinces and prolong the instability in the country .
" afghanistan is certainly in some parts still a dangerous place , " brahimi conceded , " but i think in the places -lsb- the german government -rsb- is contemplating , we don ’ t see many problems for the german soldiers if they were there . "
" of course we must be careful , " he continued while pointing out that the united nations itself has been sending unarmed civilians into the provinces for quite some time .
brahimi admitted , though , that security was a serious problem for u.n. reconstruction workers who are not able to access certain regions in the south and east and can only enter other regions with bodyguards .
the road to democracy according to brahimi , it will take some time before afghanistan is in a position to provide its own effective security .
he estimated that by september the national police and army are expected to have trained about 6,000 people , but it will be at least another year before the central government will have built up enough of a security force to make a substantial difference .
building a democratic state takes time , brahimi emphasized .
it is a slow and difficult process .
nonetheless , he expects that afghanistan will have a constitution in the near future .
" the constitution work has started and it is going reasonably well .
barring any unforeseen difficulties , we hope the country will have a new constitution by october , " he stated .
elections , on the other hand , are more difficult .
the u.n. envoy described them as a logistical nightmare .
" we have to register people all over the country , in every village .
and we have to go there ourselves , because they will not come to us , especially the women .
that means we have to recruit thousands of people , and it will cost a lot of money . "
but he believes elections can take place as early as october 2004 , if the security situation in the countryside allows for it , brahimi added .
waning interest in afghanistan ?
when asked if international interest in afghanistan was fading and whether or not money from western donor countries was drying up , brahimi responded that there is always the fear of donor fatigue and competition with the attraction of other international crisis situations .
" probably the attention has diminished a little bit , " he said , " but i think there ’ s still a reasonable amount of interest and support for what is happening in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.06.2003 kennedy still a ' berliner ' after all these years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john f. kennedy : " ich bin ein berliner " thursday marks the 40th anniversary of u.s. president john f. kennedy 's famous " ich bin ein berliner " speech .
his words still resound today in berlin , even 12 years after reunification . " two thousand years ago the proudest boast was " civis romanus sum . "
today , in the world of freedom , the proudest boast is " ich bin ein berliner . "
when united states president john f. kennedy made the famous statement " ich bin ein berliner " – -lrb- i am a berliner -rrb- - in front of the city hall of west berlin on june 26 , 1963 , he uttered words that went straight to the hearts of the citizens of berlin .
he insinuated that they were - just like the citizens of rome in earlier times - free people , with an unalienable right to freedom and the right to be protected by the rest of the free world .
it was a rousing speech that quite possibly turned the tide in favor of holding on to berlin as an isolated outpost in communist east germany at a time when it was in very real danger of falling to the communist german democratic republic .
" this was a very intense feeling of closeness , " recalls alexander longolius , a member of west germany 's city council in 1963 and later director of the checkpoint charlie foundation .
" if the americans had turned away from us , if that speech had told us we were leaving the city , then it would have been dramatic .
i remember that i went home and told my wife -lrb- ... -rrb- that our worries are over and everything would be good . "
a divided city from the end of world war ii in 1945 until the beginning of german reunification in 1989 , germany as a whole , and berlin as a city , was divided by the cold war a state of open confrontation between the communist bloc and the nato alliance .
in august 1961 , the soviets erected the berlin wall to stop the mass exodus of people fleeing soviet east berlin for west berlin and the non-communist world , thus sealing west berlin behind a 12-foot wall for some 28 years .
two years after this , kennedy gave his historic speech , which still finds incredible resonance here 40 years later .
in 1963 , west berlin was militarily protected by and partly governed by american , french and british forces .
the largest military contingent was american , and faced off a sizeable soviet contingent on the other side of the wall .
many people - and companies - had left the divided city for greener and safer pastures .
in his speech , kennedy expressed admiration for those who stayed on despite the city 's isolation .
" i want to say , on behalf of my countrymen , who live many miles away on the other side of the atlantic , who are far distant from you , that they take the greatest pride that they have been able to share with you , even from a distance , the story of the last 18 years .
i know of no town , no city , that has been besieged for 18 years that still lives with the vitality and the force and the hope and the determination of the city of west berlin . "
these words , uttered by the american president , had a soothing effect not only on the souls of beleaguered west berliners , but on the german post-war psyche as a whole .
many germans still felt a deep sense of guilt for the crimes they or their parents had committed - or at least had not prevented - during world war ii and the holocaust .
berliners were particularly receptive of the support kennedy expressed .
after all , when the wall went up in 1961 , many west germans were convinced the city was entirely lost to the communists .
" i was on vacation in west germany in the bavarian forest to the south of berlin , " longolius says .
" we were on a farm , and did n't have a radio .
so i did n't hear about the wall on that sunday .
i heard about it on tuesday , two days later , when our landlady - a farmer 's woman - asked me where i would go when my vacation was over .
and i said i would go home .
and she said to me : you ca n't do that any more because they 've cut west berlin off . "
when he toured west berlin , kennedy was accompanied by the then-mayor of berlin , willy brandt , and german chancellor konrad adenauer .
many berliners felt the chancellor and other west germans did not fully understand the importance of their city as a bulwark against communism , protecting the entire country against a soviet invasion .
" i said to myself : once the russians are berlin , they will be sitting on the rhine four weeks later , " says a woman , who has been a longtime resident of berlin .
" and i think that would have been the case .
the russians would simply have marched through .
once they had reached west berlin , they would have bulldozed the country - maybe not in four weeks , maybe a little later .
and they would not only have gone as far as the rhine , but even further .
that was the opinion of many people at the time . "
in the early 1960s , the cold war was at it 's peak .
not only was james bond fighting fictitious communist villains in the cinemas of the west .
the delivery of soviet nuclear medium-range missiles to cuba in 1962 had only just brought the world to the brink of a nuclear war .
communism as an ideology seemed like a viable and attractive alternative to capitalism for many intellectuals , even in the west .
john f. kennedy therefore used his speech in west berlin not only to boost the morale of the inhabitants there , but also to condemn communism as a politically , economically and morally inferior system everywhere in the world , with the berlin wall the most obvious and vivid demonstration of communism 's failures .
" there are many people in the world who really do n't understand , or say they do n't , what is the great issue between the free world and the communist world .
let them come to berlin .
there are some who say that communism is the wave of the future .
let them come to berlin .
and there are some who say in europe and elsewhere we can work with the communists .
let them come to berlin . "
an american legend according to alexander longolius , john f. kennedy became a mythical figure in germany and elsewhere because he was highly credible .
" he was not only an american president .
he was the leader of the west , " he says .
" the man who gave all of us hope , a perspective and a dream .
the united states at that time combined military , economic , cultural and moral leadership .
and there was no doubt in our mind that kennedy stood for all that . "
kennedy 's premature death at the hands of a gunman in dallas only a few months after holding his berlin speech temporarily plunged the city into depression and despair .
today , 40 years later , kennedy 's legacy lives on in germany 's collective memory - for example in school books , documentaries about the cold war and in an exhibition at the german national museum of contemporary history in bonn .
there , the most famous excerpt of kennedy 's speech is displayed on a television monitor , and there is a copy of the piece of paper john f. kennedy held in his hand when delivering his speech , complete with the lines " ich bin ein berliner " and " let them come to berlin " scrawled on it in his own hand-writing .
herman schäfer , a custodian at the museum , says the document still elicits a deep response today .
" the reaction of our visitors is very enthusiastic , still enthusiastic , even though this 40 years ago .

kennedy 's speech has been cited and used as a model by other politicians since 1963 .

many germans refused to believe that the ideals kennedy had upheld in berlin were being appropriately defended by bush .

his words still resound today in berlin , even 12 years after reunification . " two thousand years ago the proudest boast was " civis romanus sum . "
today , in the world of freedom , the proudest boast is " ich bin ein berliner . "
when united states president john f. kennedy made the famous statement " ich bin ein berliner " – -lrb- i am a berliner -rrb- - in front of the city hall of west berlin on june 26 , 1963 , he uttered words that went straight to the hearts of the citizens of berlin .
he insinuated that they were - just like the citizens of rome in earlier times - free people , with an unalienable right to freedom and the right to be protected by the rest of the free world .
it was a rousing speech that quite possibly turned the tide in favor of holding on to berlin as an isolated outpost in communist east germany at a time when it was in very real danger of falling to the communist german democratic republic .
" this was a very intense feeling of closeness , " recalls alexander longolius , a member of west germany 's city council in 1963 and later director of the checkpoint charlie foundation .
" if the americans had turned away from us , if that speech had told us we were leaving the city , then it would have been dramatic .
i remember that i went home and told my wife -lrb- ... -rrb- that our worries are over and everything would be good . "
a divided city from the end of world war ii in 1945 until the beginning of german reunification in 1989 , germany as a whole , and berlin as a city , was divided by the cold war a state of open confrontation between the communist bloc and the nato alliance .
in august 1961 , the soviets erected the berlin wall to stop the mass exodus of people fleeing soviet east berlin for west berlin and the non-communist world , thus sealing west berlin behind a 12-foot wall for some 28 years .
two years after this , kennedy gave his historic speech , which still finds incredible resonance here 40 years later .
in 1963 , west berlin was militarily protected by and partly governed by american , french and british forces .
the largest military contingent was american , and faced off a sizeable soviet contingent on the other side of the wall .
many people - and companies - had left the divided city for greener and safer pastures .
in his speech , kennedy expressed admiration for those who stayed on despite the city 's isolation .
" i want to say , on behalf of my countrymen , who live many miles away on the other side of the atlantic , who are far distant from you , that they take the greatest pride that they have been able to share with you , even from a distance , the story of the last 18 years .
i know of no town , no city , that has been besieged for 18 years that still lives with the vitality and the force and the hope and the determination of the city of west berlin . "
these words , uttered by the american president , had a soothing effect not only on the souls of beleaguered west berliners , but on the german post-war psyche as a whole .
many germans still felt a deep sense of guilt for the crimes they or their parents had committed - or at least had not prevented - during world war ii and the holocaust .
berliners were particularly receptive of the support kennedy expressed .
after all , when the wall went up in 1961 , many west germans were convinced the city was entirely lost to the communists .
" i was on vacation in west germany in the bavarian forest to the south of berlin , " longolius says .
" we were on a farm , and did n't have a radio .
so i did n't hear about the wall on that sunday .
i heard about it on tuesday , two days later , when our landlady - a farmer 's woman - asked me where i would go when my vacation was over .
and i said i would go home .
and she said to me : you ca n't do that any more because they 've cut west berlin off . "
when he toured west berlin , kennedy was accompanied by the then-mayor of berlin , willy brandt , and german chancellor konrad adenauer .
many berliners felt the chancellor and other west germans did not fully understand the importance of their city as a bulwark against communism , protecting the entire country against a soviet invasion .
" i said to myself : once the russians are berlin , they will be sitting on the rhine four weeks later , " says a woman , who has been a longtime resident of berlin .
" and i think that would have been the case .
the russians would simply have marched through .
once they had reached west berlin , they would have bulldozed the country - maybe not in four weeks , maybe a little later .
and they would not only have gone as far as the rhine , but even further .
that was the opinion of many people at the time . "
in the early 1960s , the cold war was at it 's peak .
not only was james bond fighting fictitious communist villains in the cinemas of the west .
the delivery of soviet nuclear medium-range missiles to cuba in 1962 had only just brought the world to the brink of a nuclear war .
communism as an ideology seemed like a viable and attractive alternative to capitalism for many intellectuals , even in the west .
john f. kennedy therefore used his speech in west berlin not only to boost the morale of the inhabitants there , but also to condemn communism as a politically , economically and morally inferior system everywhere in the world , with the berlin wall the most obvious and vivid demonstration of communism 's failures .
" there are many people in the world who really do n't understand , or say they do n't , what is the great issue between the free world and the communist world .
let them come to berlin .
there are some who say that communism is the wave of the future .
let them come to berlin .
and there are some who say in europe and elsewhere we can work with the communists .
let them come to berlin . "
an american legend according to alexander longolius , john f. kennedy became a mythical figure in germany and elsewhere because he was highly credible .
" he was not only an american president .
he was the leader of the west , " he says .
" the man who gave all of us hope , a perspective and a dream .
the united states at that time combined military , economic , cultural and moral leadership .
and there was no doubt in our mind that kennedy stood for all that . "
kennedy 's premature death at the hands of a gunman in dallas only a few months after holding his berlin speech temporarily plunged the city into depression and despair .
today , 40 years later , kennedy 's legacy lives on in germany 's collective memory - for example in school books , documentaries about the cold war and in an exhibition at the german national museum of contemporary history in bonn .
there , the most famous excerpt of kennedy 's speech is displayed on a television monitor , and there is a copy of the piece of paper john f. kennedy held in his hand when delivering his speech , complete with the lines " ich bin ein berliner " and " let them come to berlin " scrawled on it in his own hand-writing .
herman schäfer , a custodian at the museum , says the document still elicits a deep response today .
" the reaction of our visitors is very enthusiastic , still enthusiastic , even though this 40 years ago .
everybody - be it young or old people - have in mind that this is a quotation from john f. kennedy .
so they hear this quotation and then the look into the glass case and see with even more surprise that there is this little document with the phonetic transcription of john f. kennedy .

in an interview with deutsche welle , he said security was still the country 's biggest problem . " afghanistan is a very violent place .
we ’ ve got to be careful and take as many precautions as possible .
there are still spoilers out there who do not want this peace process to succeed , " brahimi said in an interview with deutsche welle .
the united nations special envoy to afghanistan is in germany to receive a special peace prize from the federal state of hessen on thursday .
ahead of the award ceremony , he met with german foreign minister joschka fischer and defense minister peter struck .
during the meeting with the two german ministers , brahimi stressed how important the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- was to maintaining the peace in conflict-ridden afghanistan .
after nearly 25 years of war and civil strife , the country needs the international peacekeepers and the provincial reconstruction teams to restore security , rebuild the infrastructure and help the central government establish its authority outside kabul , brahimi said .
" the international troops , isaf , are needed now and they will be needed for some time .
how long is difficult to say .
my personal calculation is a couple of years before the afghan army and national police can provide security for the people of afghanistan , especially in kabul .
i think it will take one or two years . "
limited influence one of the main problems facing reconstruction efforts in afghanistan is the limited reach of the central government under president hamid karsai , whose position , although recognized and respected in the provinces , has hardly any influence over the warlords and militias who still control considerable areas of the country .
brahimi said this was understandable in a state that has been completely destroyed .
" we are in a process of rebuilding the state machinery .
there are no roads , no telephones , no lines of communication .
that is why it is so difficult to project the influence of the central government in the country , " brahimi explained .
" the government is limited in its resources , but it is recognized in the provinces , " he said , " and therefore what is required is to help the government rebuild the state , not only in kabul , but in the provinces . "
" the best way of doing this , " brahimi stressed , " is to extend isaf outside the capital . "
extending the isaf mandate but the issue of extending the commitment of international peacekeepers in afghanistan is still a matter of discussion .
the isaf , which will be operated under dutch-german command until august , is currently restricted to the afghan capital kabul , but the united states and u.n. secretary general kofi annan have requested that troops also be sent to the provinces to protect civilian workers who are helping rebuild the country .
in berlin , the question of extending the isaf mandate beyond kabul has been met with a good deal of opposition following a june 7 bombing in the capital city that killed four german soldiers .
germany , which supplies the largest troop contingent in the international force , has been hesitant to commit more soldiers and extend their area of operation until the security situation in the provinces improves .
the german parliament in not scheduled to vote on an extension of the mandate until september .
brahimi said he respects the german government ’ s deliberations in light of the recent terrorist attack , but at the same time he expressed hope that germany would not rule against extending the security forces outside kabul .
" i think we would be sorry if that was the decision of the federal republic of germany , " he told deutsche welle .
the isaf is still developing , brahimi explained , " but it promises to be helpful for the progress of the peace process , for the training of the afghan police and the army . "
he added that not expanding isaf ’ s mandate beyond kabul would hinder the security and reconstruction efforts in the provinces and prolong the instability in the country .
" afghanistan is certainly in some parts still a dangerous place , " brahimi conceded , " but i think in the places -lsb- the german government -rsb- is contemplating , we don ’ t see many problems for the german soldiers if they were there . "
" of course we must be careful , " he continued while pointing out that the united nations itself has been sending unarmed civilians into the provinces for quite some time .
brahimi admitted , though , that security was a serious problem for u.n. reconstruction workers who are not able to access certain regions in the south and east and can only enter other regions with bodyguards .
the road to democracy according to brahimi , it will take some time before afghanistan is in a position to provide its own effective security .
he estimated that by september the national police and army are expected to have trained about 6,000 people , but it will be at least another year before the central government will have built up enough of a security force to make a substantial difference .
building a democratic state takes time , brahimi emphasized .
it is a slow and difficult process .
nonetheless , he expects that afghanistan will have a constitution in the near future .
" the constitution work has started and it is going reasonably well .
barring any unforeseen difficulties , we hope the country will have a new constitution by october , " he stated .
elections , on the other hand , are more difficult .
the u.n. envoy described them as a logistical nightmare .
" we have to register people all over the country , in every village .
and we have to go there ourselves , because they will not come to us , especially the women .
that means we have to recruit thousands of people , and it will cost a lot of money . "
but he believes elections can take place as early as october 2004 , if the security situation in the countryside allows for it , brahimi added .
waning interest in afghanistan ?
when asked if international interest in afghanistan was fading and whether or not money from western donor countries was drying up , brahimi responded that there is always the fear of donor fatigue and competition with the attraction of other international crisis situations .
" probably the attention has diminished a little bit , " he said , " but i think there ’ s still a reasonable amount of interest and support for what is happening in afghanistan .

mannheimer woes seen troubling insurance industry ; deutsche bahn forced to offer competitor 's timetables ; economists see light at the end of the tunnel . mannheimer insolvency signals trouble for industry one of germany ’ s oldest insurance companies was left looking for a bailout plan on thursday after the german insurance industry association -lrb- gdv -rrb- announced that a last-minute rescue initiative to raise € 370 million -lrb- $ 426 million -rrb- from fellow insurers had failed .
the mannheimer lebensversicherung ag , which has been struggling to stay afloat following significant losses on the capital markets last year , turned to the gdv – a cooperation of 110 insurance companies - in the hopes of drumming up enough fresh cash to prevent it from being the first german insurer to go under in 50 years .
the gdv , however , could not convince the necessary 90 percent of its members to back the rescue plan .
it now looks as if mannheimer will become the first german insurer to seek help from protektor , the industry-backed safety net set up last year to protect policyholder ’ s investments in the event of an insurer ’ s insolvency .
but protektor so far only exists on paper , and with a start-up capital of just € 3.2 million put forth by 10 insurers , its rescue funds remain rather limited .
that ’ s not good news for the german government , which has been encouraging citizens to invest in equity-based life insurance plans rather than rely on state support for their retirement .
a perceived weakness in the insurance industry could cause the public to lose confidence in the whole concept .
deutsche bahn to provide timetables for connex the deutsche bahn , germany ’ s largest rail company , must include information from its competitor connex in its long-distance timetables , according to a new ruling by the berlin regional court on thursday .
from now on , the formerly state-owned bahn is required to provide route plans and times for connex via its internet and telephone services .
the ruling came after months of failed negotiations and connex , a subsidiary of the french vivendi corporation , took the bahn to court claiming its monopoly over long-distance timetables reflected an unfair competition advantage .
the bahn rejected such arguments as unfounded .
but the german cartel office , which had warned the bahn of a possible investigation back in february , said the bahn ’ s refusal to provide information on prices and timetables for connex blocked efforts to open up the country ’ s rail system to more competitors .
connex , with its three routes , including the newly-opened cologne-rostock stretch , is the deutsche bahn ’ s only competitor in long-distance train travel .
economy seen rebounding after all the bad news about germany ’ s economy , from rumors of deflation to signs of a recession , it now looks as if there might be light at the end of the tunnel .
six of the leading german economic research institutes said there are signs that the economy will improve by the end of the year .
according to a survey of the institutes ’ directors published in the berliner zeitung newspaper on thursday , the majority of the experts are convinced the country will experience considerable economic growth in the coming year .
they cited the government ’ s plans to reform health care and the pension plan as well as its steps to bring forward a tax cut as the source of the renewed optimism .
the director of the institute for economic research -lrb- iwh -rrb- in halle , rüdiger pohl , was quoted as saying , " the reform agenda is being pushed through with momentum .

the ruling came after months of failed negotiations and connex , a subsidiary of the french vivendi corporation , took the bahn to court claiming its monopoly over long-distance timetables reflected an unfair competition advantage .
the bahn rejected such arguments as unfounded .
but the german cartel office , which had warned the bahn of a possible investigation back in february , said the bahn ’ s refusal to provide information on prices and timetables for connex blocked efforts to open up the country ’ s rail system to more competitors .

his words still resound today in berlin , even 12 years after reunification . " two thousand years ago the proudest boast was " civis romanus sum . "
today , in the world of freedom , the proudest boast is " ich bin ein berliner . "
when united states president john f. kennedy made the famous statement " ich bin ein berliner " – -lrb- i am a berliner -rrb- - in front of the city hall of west berlin on june 26 , 1963 , he uttered words that went straight to the hearts of the citizens of berlin .
he insinuated that they were - just like the citizens of rome in earlier times - free people , with an unalienable right to freedom and the right to be protected by the rest of the free world .
it was a rousing speech that quite possibly turned the tide in favor of holding on to berlin as an isolated outpost in communist east germany at a time when it was in very real danger of falling to the communist german democratic republic .
" this was a very intense feeling of closeness , " recalls alexander longolius , a member of west germany 's city council in 1963 and later director of the checkpoint charlie foundation .
" if the americans had turned away from us , if that speech had told us we were leaving the city , then it would have been dramatic .
i remember that i went home and told my wife -lrb- ... -rrb- that our worries are over and everything would be good . "
a divided city from the end of world war ii in 1945 until the beginning of german reunification in 1989 , germany as a whole , and berlin as a city , was divided by the cold war a state of open confrontation between the communist bloc and the nato alliance .
in august 1961 , the soviets erected the berlin wall to stop the mass exodus of people fleeing soviet east berlin for west berlin and the non-communist world , thus sealing west berlin behind a 12-foot wall for some 28 years .
two years after this , kennedy gave his historic speech , which still finds incredible resonance here 40 years later .
in 1963 , west berlin was militarily protected by and partly governed by american , french and british forces .
the largest military contingent was american , and faced off a sizeable soviet contingent on the other side of the wall .
many people - and companies - had left the divided city for greener and safer pastures .
in his speech , kennedy expressed admiration for those who stayed on despite the city 's isolation .
" i want to say , on behalf of my countrymen , who live many miles away on the other side of the atlantic , who are far distant from you , that they take the greatest pride that they have been able to share with you , even from a distance , the story of the last 18 years .
i know of no town , no city , that has been besieged for 18 years that still lives with the vitality and the force and the hope and the determination of the city of west berlin . "
these words , uttered by the american president , had a soothing effect not only on the souls of beleaguered west berliners , but on the german post-war psyche as a whole .
many germans still felt a deep sense of guilt for the crimes they or their parents had committed - or at least had not prevented - during world war ii and the holocaust .
berliners were particularly receptive of the support kennedy expressed .
after all , when the wall went up in 1961 , many west germans were convinced the city was entirely lost to the communists .
" i was on vacation in west germany in the bavarian forest to the south of berlin , " longolius says .
" we were on a farm , and did n't have a radio .
so i did n't hear about the wall on that sunday .
i heard about it on tuesday , two days later , when our landlady - a farmer 's woman - asked me where i would go when my vacation was over .
and i said i would go home .
and she said to me : you ca n't do that any more because they 've cut west berlin off . "
when he toured west berlin , kennedy was accompanied by the then-mayor of berlin , willy brandt , and german chancellor konrad adenauer .
many berliners felt the chancellor and other west germans did not fully understand the importance of their city as a bulwark against communism , protecting the entire country against a soviet invasion .
" i said to myself : once the russians are berlin , they will be sitting on the rhine four weeks later , " says a woman , who has been a longtime resident of berlin .
" and i think that would have been the case .
the russians would simply have marched through .
once they had reached west berlin , they would have bulldozed the country - maybe not in four weeks , maybe a little later .
and they would not only have gone as far as the rhine , but even further .
that was the opinion of many people at the time . "
in the early 1960s , the cold war was at it 's peak .
not only was james bond fighting fictitious communist villains in the cinemas of the west .
the delivery of soviet nuclear medium-range missiles to cuba in 1962 had only just brought the world to the brink of a nuclear war .
communism as an ideology seemed like a viable and attractive alternative to capitalism for many intellectuals , even in the west .
john f. kennedy therefore used his speech in west berlin not only to boost the morale of the inhabitants there , but also to condemn communism as a politically , economically and morally inferior system everywhere in the world , with the berlin wall the most obvious and vivid demonstration of communism 's failures .
" there are many people in the world who really do n't understand , or say they do n't , what is the great issue between the free world and the communist world .
let them come to berlin .
there are some who say that communism is the wave of the future .
let them come to berlin .
and there are some who say in europe and elsewhere we can work with the communists .
let them come to berlin . "
an american legend according to alexander longolius , john f. kennedy became a mythical figure in germany and elsewhere because he was highly credible .
" he was not only an american president .
he was the leader of the west , " he says .
" the man who gave all of us hope , a perspective and a dream .
the united states at that time combined military , economic , cultural and moral leadership .
and there was no doubt in our mind that kennedy stood for all that . "
kennedy 's premature death at the hands of a gunman in dallas only a few months after holding his berlin speech temporarily plunged the city into depression and despair .
today , 40 years later , kennedy 's legacy lives on in germany 's collective memory - for example in school books , documentaries about the cold war and in an exhibition at the german national museum of contemporary history in bonn .
there , the most famous excerpt of kennedy 's speech is displayed on a television monitor , and there is a copy of the piece of paper john f. kennedy held in his hand when delivering his speech , complete with the lines " ich bin ein berliner " and " let them come to berlin " scrawled on it in his own hand-writing .
herman schäfer , a custodian at the museum , says the document still elicits a deep response today .
" the reaction of our visitors is very enthusiastic , still enthusiastic , even though this 40 years ago .
everybody - be it young or old people - have in mind that this is a quotation from john f. kennedy .
so they hear this quotation and then the look into the glass case and see with even more surprise that there is this little document with the phonetic transcription of john f. kennedy .
so there is still this enthusiasm about this quotation that -lrb- puts -rrb- so much emphasis on the german-american friendship during the 1960s . "
kennedy 's speech has been cited and used as a model by other politicians since 1963 .
shortly before the berlin wall came down in 1989 , u.s. president ronald reagan addressed soviet leader mikhail gorbachev from the same location , telling him the time was ripe for german reunification .
and when after the sept .
11. attacks on new york and washington , chancellor schröder pledged " unlimited " support to the us in its war on terrorism , he alluded to george w. bush ' famous predecessor .
" when the defense of berlin was at stake , john f. kennedy said - and you all know this famous sentence - ' i am a berliner ' , " schröder said .
" that was the expression of incredible solidarity .
today i believe that we have every reason - especially we germans - to return this solidarity by expressing our solidarity with the american people . "
strained relations however , following germany 's refusal to back the u.s.-led war on iraq , relations between the two countries reached a historic low .
many germans refused to believe that the ideals kennedy had upheld in berlin were being appropriately defended by bush .
because of the widespread rejection of the war , germans have been accused of anti-americanism .
but according to schäfer of the national museum in bonn , the us-german relationship has not been fundamentally impaired .
" it is still as strong as in former times and if we look to the development of our civilization , i personally think that the united states is something like the leading civilized nation of the world , " he says .
" and there are a lot of different developments which are already there - if we like them or not - and many of them i do not like , i would not agree with all developments which are under way in the u.s. they will come to our state , to our country , to europe soon or later .
but we have to decide individually if we want to adopt them . "
editor 's note : john f. kennedy 's historic visit to berlin in 1963 is also the subject of a new exhibit at the german historical museum in berlin , which will be displaying 400 artifacts from the life of the former president through oct .

mannheimer woes seen troubling insurance industry ; deutsche bahn forced to offer competitor 's timetables ; economists see light at the end of the tunnel . mannheimer insolvency signals trouble for industry one of germany ’ s oldest insurance companies was left looking for a bailout plan on thursday after the german insurance industry association -lrb- gdv -rrb- announced that a last-minute rescue initiative to raise € 370 million -lrb- $ 426 million -rrb- from fellow insurers had failed .
the mannheimer lebensversicherung ag , which has been struggling to stay afloat following significant losses on the capital markets last year , turned to the gdv – a cooperation of 110 insurance companies - in the hopes of drumming up enough fresh cash to prevent it from being the first german insurer to go under in 50 years .
the gdv , however , could not convince the necessary 90 percent of its members to back the rescue plan .
it now looks as if mannheimer will become the first german insurer to seek help from protektor , the industry-backed safety net set up last year to protect policyholder ’ s investments in the event of an insurer ’ s insolvency .
but protektor so far only exists on paper , and with a start-up capital of just € 3.2 million put forth by 10 insurers , its rescue funds remain rather limited .

his words still resound today in berlin , even 12 years after reunification . " two thousand years ago the proudest boast was " civis romanus sum . "
today , in the world of freedom , the proudest boast is " ich bin ein berliner . "
when united states president john f. kennedy made the famous statement " ich bin ein berliner " – -lrb- i am a berliner -rrb- - in front of the city hall of west berlin on june 26 , 1963 , he uttered words that went straight to the hearts of the citizens of berlin .
he insinuated that they were - just like the citizens of rome in earlier times - free people , with an unalienable right to freedom and the right to be protected by the rest of the free world .
it was a rousing speech that quite possibly turned the tide in favor of holding on to berlin as an isolated outpost in communist east germany at a time when it was in very real danger of falling to the communist german democratic republic .
" this was a very intense feeling of closeness , " recalls alexander longolius , a member of west germany 's city council in 1963 and later director of the checkpoint charlie foundation .
" if the americans had turned away from us , if that speech had told us we were leaving the city , then it would have been dramatic .
i remember that i went home and told my wife -lrb- ... -rrb- that our worries are over and everything would be good . "
a divided city from the end of world war ii in 1945 until the beginning of german reunification in 1989 , germany as a whole , and berlin as a city , was divided by the cold war a state of open confrontation between the communist bloc and the nato alliance .
in august 1961 , the soviets erected the berlin wall to stop the mass exodus of people fleeing soviet east berlin for west berlin and the non-communist world , thus sealing west berlin behind a 12-foot wall for some 28 years .
two years after this , kennedy gave his historic speech , which still finds incredible resonance here 40 years later .
in 1963 , west berlin was militarily protected by and partly governed by american , french and british forces .
the largest military contingent was american , and faced off a sizeable soviet contingent on the other side of the wall .
many people - and companies - had left the divided city for greener and safer pastures .
in his speech , kennedy expressed admiration for those who stayed on despite the city 's isolation .
" i want to say , on behalf of my countrymen , who live many miles away on the other side of the atlantic , who are far distant from you , that they take the greatest pride that they have been able to share with you , even from a distance , the story of the last 18 years .
i know of no town , no city , that has been besieged for 18 years that still lives with the vitality and the force and the hope and the determination of the city of west berlin . "
these words , uttered by the american president , had a soothing effect not only on the souls of beleaguered west berliners , but on the german post-war psyche as a whole .
many germans still felt a deep sense of guilt for the crimes they or their parents had committed - or at least had not prevented - during world war ii and the holocaust .
berliners were particularly receptive of the support kennedy expressed .
after all , when the wall went up in 1961 , many west germans were convinced the city was entirely lost to the communists .
" i was on vacation in west germany in the bavarian forest to the south of berlin , " longolius says .
" we were on a farm , and did n't have a radio .
so i did n't hear about the wall on that sunday .
i heard about it on tuesday , two days later , when our landlady - a farmer 's woman - asked me where i would go when my vacation was over .
and i said i would go home .
and she said to me : you ca n't do that any more because they 've cut west berlin off . "
when he toured west berlin , kennedy was accompanied by the then-mayor of berlin , willy brandt , and german chancellor konrad adenauer .
many berliners felt the chancellor and other west germans did not fully understand the importance of their city as a bulwark against communism , protecting the entire country against a soviet invasion .
" i said to myself : once the russians are berlin , they will be sitting on the rhine four weeks later , " says a woman , who has been a longtime resident of berlin .
" and i think that would have been the case .
the russians would simply have marched through .
once they had reached west berlin , they would have bulldozed the country - maybe not in four weeks , maybe a little later .
and they would not only have gone as far as the rhine , but even further .
that was the opinion of many people at the time . "
in the early 1960s , the cold war was at it 's peak .
not only was james bond fighting fictitious communist villains in the cinemas of the west .
the delivery of soviet nuclear medium-range missiles to cuba in 1962 had only just brought the world to the brink of a nuclear war .
communism as an ideology seemed like a viable and attractive alternative to capitalism for many intellectuals , even in the west .
john f. kennedy therefore used his speech in west berlin not only to boost the morale of the inhabitants there , but also to condemn communism as a politically , economically and morally inferior system everywhere in the world , with the berlin wall the most obvious and vivid demonstration of communism 's failures .
" there are many people in the world who really do n't understand , or say they do n't , what is the great issue between the free world and the communist world .
let them come to berlin .
there are some who say that communism is the wave of the future .
let them come to berlin .
and there are some who say in europe and elsewhere we can work with the communists .
let them come to berlin . "
an american legend according to alexander longolius , john f. kennedy became a mythical figure in germany and elsewhere because he was highly credible .
" he was not only an american president .
he was the leader of the west , " he says .
" the man who gave all of us hope , a perspective and a dream .
the united states at that time combined military , economic , cultural and moral leadership .
and there was no doubt in our mind that kennedy stood for all that . "
kennedy 's premature death at the hands of a gunman in dallas only a few months after holding his berlin speech temporarily plunged the city into depression and despair .
today , 40 years later , kennedy 's legacy lives on in germany 's collective memory - for example in school books , documentaries about the cold war and in an exhibition at the german national museum of contemporary history in bonn .
there , the most famous excerpt of kennedy 's speech is displayed on a television monitor , and there is a copy of the piece of paper john f. kennedy held in his hand when delivering his speech , complete with the lines " ich bin ein berliner " and " let them come to berlin " scrawled on it in his own hand-writing .
herman schäfer , a custodian at the museum , says the document still elicits a deep response today .
" the reaction of our visitors is very enthusiastic , still enthusiastic , even though this 40 years ago .
everybody - be it young or old people - have in mind that this is a quotation from john f. kennedy .
so they hear this quotation and then the look into the glass case and see with even more surprise that there is this little document with the phonetic transcription of john f. kennedy .
so there is still this enthusiasm about this quotation that -lrb- puts -rrb- so much emphasis on the german-american friendship during the 1960s . "
kennedy 's speech has been cited and used as a model by other politicians since 1963 .
shortly before the berlin wall came down in 1989 , u.s. president ronald reagan addressed soviet leader mikhail gorbachev from the same location , telling him the time was ripe for german reunification .
and when after the sept .
11. attacks on new york and washington , chancellor schröder pledged " unlimited " support to the us in its war on terrorism , he alluded to george w. bush ' famous predecessor .
" when the defense of berlin was at stake , john f. kennedy said - and you all know this famous sentence - ' i am a berliner ' , " schröder said .
" that was the expression of incredible solidarity .
today i believe that we have every reason - especially we germans - to return this solidarity by expressing our solidarity with the american people . "
strained relations however , following germany 's refusal to back the u.s.-led war on iraq , relations between the two countries reached a historic low .
many germans refused to believe that the ideals kennedy had upheld in berlin were being appropriately defended by bush .
because of the widespread rejection of the war , germans have been accused of anti-americanism .
but according to schäfer of the national museum in bonn , the us-german relationship has not been fundamentally impaired .
" it is still as strong as in former times and if we look to the development of our civilization , i personally think that the united states is something like the leading civilized nation of the world , " he says .
" and there are a lot of different developments which are already there - if we like them or not - and many of them i do not like , i would not agree with all developments which are under way in the u.s. they will come to our state , to our country , to europe soon or later .
but we have to decide individually if we want to adopt them . "
editor 's note : john f. kennedy 's historic visit to berlin in 1963 is also the subject of a new exhibit at the german historical museum in berlin , which will be displaying 400 artifacts from the life of the former president through oct .

european union agricultural ministers reached a deal thursday to overhaul the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- after years of deadlock , ending brussels ’ controversial policy of generous farm hand-outs . eu farming ministers meeting in luxembourg agreed on a comprehensive reform package for the 15-nation bloc ’ s agriculture policy on thursday after a marathon round of negotiations to thrash out the last details .
portugal was the only country to vote against the reform .
the move amounts to the most radical shake-up of the eu ’ s expensive 45-year-old cap , which critics have long argued undermines world trade and puts poor countries at a disadvantage .
the main thrust of the reforms is to cut back the eu ’ s program of huge direct subsidies to farmers , which account to about € 43 billion -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- a year - almost half the entire eu budget .
crop subsidies eliminated the chief architect of the reform plan , eu agricultural commissioner franz fischler , managed to largely salvage the cornerstone of his reform plan - namely breaking down the traditional link between subsidy and agricultural output , which has been blamed for offering an incentive to farmers to overproduce merely to get more cash from brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commissioner for agriculture , rural development and fisheries franz fischler fischler -lrb- photo -rrb- said the reforms would shape the future of european farming and end the practice of automatic farm handouts . " this decision marks the beginning of a new era .
our farm policy will fundamentally change.today , europe has given itself a new and effective farm policy , " he said .
the accord was hailed by leaders from several member countries .
" the agreement today delivers what we wanted - real change , " said britain 's agriculture minister , margaret beckett .
" it will give stability and security to farmers in the next decade , " said irish farm minister joe walsh .
german agricultural minister renate künast described the reform as a big success .
" with it we can finally break out of the old agricultural system , " she said .
in the future , subsidies from brussels will be distributed more evenly , rewarding farmers who switch to environmentally-friendly farming methods that promote increased food quality and improved rural management .
the european commission is also eager to end subsidies prior to 2004 when the agriculturally dependant economies of eastern europe join the eu .
critics feared that extending handouts to the new eu countries would only worsen the problem of over-production in europe .
agreement expected to revive trade talks the agreement on eu farm reforms is also seen as essential to kickstart the stalled doha round of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks .
fischler said the deal would boost the eu ’ s negotiating position in upcoming trade talks in mexico in september and appease the united states and japan , who had criticized the current system of eu farm hand-outs saying it violates wto rules .
" we ’ re also sending out a message to the world that we have a more trade-friendly policy .
we are saying goodbye to a policy that used to distort trade , " fischler told a news conference on thursday .
" we can go with our heads held high to cancun , " fischler said .
wto chief supachai panitchpakdi welcomed the deal .
" i see that this would have a positive effect on movement in areas , if not all areas of agriculture , " supachai said in geneva .
angry farmers despite the breakthrough on the reform package , fischler was forced to compromised on several elements of his original plan under heavy pressure from big farming nations such as france .
france , the largest beneficiary of eu farm aid , had strongly resisted decoupling farm aid from production subsidies .
in the latest deal , fischler compromised by abandoning his plan to cut minimum prices on key grains - including wheat , barley and maize and by allowing countries a high degree of flexibility over how it may apply decoupling rules for livestock .
but some french farmers were still dissatisfied .
" france has badly defended the interests of the cap and of french farmers , " jerome despey , head of france ’ s young farmers organization told radio france international .
likewise , farming unions in germany , one of the eu ’ s largest contributors to cap , were also dismayed by the deal .
the german farmers association -lrb- dbv -rrb- said farmers in that country would lose between € 1.2 and € 2 billion as a result of the cuts and warned that the decision would discourage further investment .
" this decision is a major burden for german and european farmers , " german farmers association president gerd sonnleitner told german public radio .

european union agricultural ministers reached a deal thursday to overhaul the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- after years of deadlock , ending brussels ’ controversial policy of generous farm hand-outs . eu farming ministers meeting in luxembourg agreed on a comprehensive reform package for the 15-nation bloc ’ s agriculture policy on thursday after a marathon round of negotiations to thrash out the last details .
portugal was the only country to vote against the reform .
the move amounts to the most radical shake-up of the eu ’ s expensive 45-year-old cap , which critics have long argued undermines world trade and puts poor countries at a disadvantage .
the main thrust of the reforms is to cut back the eu ’ s program of huge direct subsidies to farmers , which account to about € 43 billion -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- a year - almost half the entire eu budget .
crop subsidies eliminated the chief architect of the reform plan , eu agricultural commissioner franz fischler , managed to largely salvage the cornerstone of his reform plan - namely breaking down the traditional link between subsidy and agricultural output , which has been blamed for offering an incentive to farmers to overproduce merely to get more cash from brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commissioner for agriculture , rural development and fisheries franz fischler fischler -lrb- photo -rrb- said the reforms would shape the future of european farming and end the practice of automatic farm handouts . " this decision marks the beginning of a new era .
our farm policy will fundamentally change.today , europe has given itself a new and effective farm policy , " he said .
the accord was hailed by leaders from several member countries .
" the agreement today delivers what we wanted - real change , " said britain 's agriculture minister , margaret beckett .
" it will give stability and security to farmers in the next decade , " said irish farm minister joe walsh .
german agricultural minister renate künast described the reform as a big success .
" with it we can finally break out of the old agricultural system , " she said .
in the future , subsidies from brussels will be distributed more evenly , rewarding farmers who switch to environmentally-friendly farming methods that promote increased food quality and improved rural management .
the european commission is also eager to end subsidies prior to 2004 when the agriculturally dependant economies of eastern europe join the eu .
critics feared that extending handouts to the new eu countries would only worsen the problem of over-production in europe .
agreement expected to revive trade talks the agreement on eu farm reforms is also seen as essential to kickstart the stalled doha round of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks .
fischler said the deal would boost the eu ’ s negotiating position in upcoming trade talks in mexico in september and appease the united states and japan , who had criticized the current system of eu farm hand-outs saying it violates wto rules .
" we ’ re also sending out a message to the world that we have a more trade-friendly policy .
we are saying goodbye to a policy that used to distort trade , " fischler told a news conference on thursday .
" we can go with our heads held high to cancun , " fischler said .
wto chief supachai panitchpakdi welcomed the deal .
" i see that this would have a positive effect on movement in areas , if not all areas of agriculture , " supachai said in geneva .
angry farmers despite the breakthrough on the reform package , fischler was forced to compromised on several elements of his original plan under heavy pressure from big farming nations such as france .
france , the largest beneficiary of eu farm aid , had strongly resisted decoupling farm aid from production subsidies .
in the latest deal , fischler compromised by abandoning his plan to cut minimum prices on key grains - including wheat , barley and maize and by allowing countries a high degree of flexibility over how it may apply decoupling rules for livestock .
but some french farmers were still dissatisfied .
" france has badly defended the interests of the cap and of french farmers , " jerome despey , head of france ’ s young farmers organization told radio france international .
likewise , farming unions in germany , one of the eu ’ s largest contributors to cap , were also dismayed by the deal .
the german farmers association -lrb- dbv -rrb- said farmers in that country would lose between € 1.2 and € 2 billion as a result of the cuts and warned that the decision would discourage further investment .
" this decision is a major burden for german and european farmers , " german farmers association president gerd sonnleitner told german public radio .

in an interview with deutsche welle , he said security was still the country 's biggest problem . " afghanistan is a very violent place .
we ’ ve got to be careful and take as many precautions as possible .
there are still spoilers out there who do not want this peace process to succeed , " brahimi said in an interview with deutsche welle .
the united nations special envoy to afghanistan is in germany to receive a special peace prize from the federal state of hessen on thursday .
ahead of the award ceremony , he met with german foreign minister joschka fischer and defense minister peter struck .
during the meeting with the two german ministers , brahimi stressed how important the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- was to maintaining the peace in conflict-ridden afghanistan .
after nearly 25 years of war and civil strife , the country needs the international peacekeepers and the provincial reconstruction teams to restore security , rebuild the infrastructure and help the central government establish its authority outside kabul , brahimi said .
" the international troops , isaf , are needed now and they will be needed for some time .
how long is difficult to say .
my personal calculation is a couple of years before the afghan army and national police can provide security for the people of afghanistan , especially in kabul .
i think it will take one or two years . "
limited influence one of the main problems facing reconstruction efforts in afghanistan is the limited reach of the central government under president hamid karsai , whose position , although recognized and respected in the provinces , has hardly any influence over the warlords and militias who still control considerable areas of the country .
brahimi said this was understandable in a state that has been completely destroyed .
" we are in a process of rebuilding the state machinery .
there are no roads , no telephones , no lines of communication .
that is why it is so difficult to project the influence of the central government in the country , " brahimi explained .
" the government is limited in its resources , but it is recognized in the provinces , " he said , " and therefore what is required is to help the government rebuild the state , not only in kabul , but in the provinces . "
" the best way of doing this , " brahimi stressed , " is to extend isaf outside the capital . "
extending the isaf mandate but the issue of extending the commitment of international peacekeepers in afghanistan is still a matter of discussion .
the isaf , which will be operated under dutch-german command until august , is currently restricted to the afghan capital kabul , but the united states and u.n. secretary general kofi annan have requested that troops also be sent to the provinces to protect civilian workers who are helping rebuild the country .
in berlin , the question of extending the isaf mandate beyond kabul has been met with a good deal of opposition following a june 7 bombing in the capital city that killed four german soldiers .
germany , which supplies the largest troop contingent in the international force , has been hesitant to commit more soldiers and extend their area of operation until the security situation in the provinces improves .
the german parliament in not scheduled to vote on an extension of the mandate until september .
brahimi said he respects the german government ’ s deliberations in light of the recent terrorist attack , but at the same time he expressed hope that germany would not rule against extending the security forces outside kabul .
" i think we would be sorry if that was the decision of the federal republic of germany , " he told deutsche welle .
the isaf is still developing , brahimi explained , " but it promises to be helpful for the progress of the peace process , for the training of the afghan police and the army . "
he added that not expanding isaf ’ s mandate beyond kabul would hinder the security and reconstruction efforts in the provinces and prolong the instability in the country .
" afghanistan is certainly in some parts still a dangerous place , " brahimi conceded , " but i think in the places -lsb- the german government -rsb- is contemplating , we don ’ t see many problems for the german soldiers if they were there . "
" of course we must be careful , " he continued while pointing out that the united nations itself has been sending unarmed civilians into the provinces for quite some time .
brahimi admitted , though , that security was a serious problem for u.n. reconstruction workers who are not able to access certain regions in the south and east and can only enter other regions with bodyguards .
the road to democracy according to brahimi , it will take some time before afghanistan is in a position to provide its own effective security .
he estimated that by september the national police and army are expected to have trained about 6,000 people , but it will be at least another year before the central government will have built up enough of a security force to make a substantial difference .
building a democratic state takes time , brahimi emphasized .
it is a slow and difficult process .
nonetheless , he expects that afghanistan will have a constitution in the near future .
" the constitution work has started and it is going reasonably well .
barring any unforeseen difficulties , we hope the country will have a new constitution by october , " he stated .
elections , on the other hand , are more difficult .
the u.n. envoy described them as a logistical nightmare .
" we have to register people all over the country , in every village .
and we have to go there ourselves , because they will not come to us , especially the women .
that means we have to recruit thousands of people , and it will cost a lot of money . "
but he believes elections can take place as early as october 2004 , if the security situation in the countryside allows for it , brahimi added .
waning interest in afghanistan ?
when asked if international interest in afghanistan was fading and whether or not money from western donor countries was drying up , brahimi responded that there is always the fear of donor fatigue and competition with the attraction of other international crisis situations .
" probably the attention has diminished a little bit , " he said , " but i think there ’ s still a reasonable amount of interest and support for what is happening in afghanistan .

" the government is limited in its resources , but it is recognized in the provinces , " he said , " and therefore what is required is to help the government rebuild the state , not only in kabul , but in the provinces . "
" the best way of doing this , " brahimi stressed , " is to extend isaf outside the capital . "
extending the isaf mandate but the issue of extending the commitment of international peacekeepers in afghanistan is still a matter of discussion .
the isaf , which will be operated under dutch-german command until august , is currently restricted to the afghan capital kabul , but the united states and u.n. secretary general kofi annan have requested that troops also be sent to the provinces to protect civilian workers who are helping rebuild the country .
in berlin , the question of extending the isaf mandate beyond kabul has been met with a good deal of opposition following a june 7 bombing in the capital city that killed four german soldiers .
germany , which supplies the largest troop contingent in the international force , has been hesitant to commit more soldiers and extend their area of operation until the security situation in the provinces improves .
the german parliament in not scheduled to vote on an extension of the mandate until september .
brahimi said he respects the german government ’ s deliberations in light of the recent terrorist attack , but at the same time he expressed hope that germany would not rule against extending the security forces outside kabul .
" i think we would be sorry if that was the decision of the federal republic of germany , " he told deutsche welle .
the isaf is still developing , brahimi explained , " but it promises to be helpful for the progress of the peace process , for the training of the afghan police and the army . "
he added that not expanding isaf ’ s mandate beyond kabul would hinder the security and reconstruction efforts in the provinces and prolong the instability in the country .
" afghanistan is certainly in some parts still a dangerous place , " brahimi conceded , " but i think in the places -lsb- the german government -rsb- is contemplating , we don ’ t see many problems for the german soldiers if they were there . "
" of course we must be careful , " he continued while pointing out that the united nations itself has been sending unarmed civilians into the provinces for quite some time .
brahimi admitted , though , that security was a serious problem for u.n. reconstruction workers who are not able to access certain regions in the south and east and can only enter other regions with bodyguards .
the road to democracy according to brahimi , it will take some time before afghanistan is in a position to provide its own effective security .
he estimated that by september the national police and army are expected to have trained about 6,000 people , but it will be at least another year before the central government will have built up enough of a security force to make a substantial difference .
building a democratic state takes time , brahimi emphasized .
it is a slow and difficult process .
nonetheless , he expects that afghanistan will have a constitution in the near future .
" the constitution work has started and it is going reasonably well .
barring any unforeseen difficulties , we hope the country will have a new constitution by october , " he stated .
elections , on the other hand , are more difficult .
the u.n. envoy described them as a logistical nightmare .
" we have to register people all over the country , in every village .
and we have to go there ourselves , because they will not come to us , especially the women .
that means we have to recruit thousands of people , and it will cost a lot of money . "
but he believes elections can take place as early as october 2004 , if the security situation in the countryside allows for it , brahimi added .
waning interest in afghanistan ?
when asked if international interest in afghanistan was fading and whether or not money from western donor countries was drying up , brahimi responded that there is always the fear of donor fatigue and competition with the attraction of other international crisis situations .
" probably the attention has diminished a little bit , " he said , " but i think there ’ s still a reasonable amount of interest and support for what is happening in afghanistan .

in an interview with deutsche welle , he said security was still the country 's biggest problem . " afghanistan is a very violent place .
we ’ ve got to be careful and take as many precautions as possible .
there are still spoilers out there who do not want this peace process to succeed , " brahimi said in an interview with deutsche welle .
the united nations special envoy to afghanistan is in germany to receive a special peace prize from the federal state of hessen on thursday .
ahead of the award ceremony , he met with german foreign minister joschka fischer and defense minister peter struck .
during the meeting with the two german ministers , brahimi stressed how important the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- was to maintaining the peace in conflict-ridden afghanistan .
after nearly 25 years of war and civil strife , the country needs the international peacekeepers and the provincial reconstruction teams to restore security , rebuild the infrastructure and help the central government establish its authority outside kabul , brahimi said .
" the international troops , isaf , are needed now and they will be needed for some time .
how long is difficult to say .
my personal calculation is a couple of years before the afghan army and national police can provide security for the people of afghanistan , especially in kabul .
i think it will take one or two years . "
limited influence one of the main problems facing reconstruction efforts in afghanistan is the limited reach of the central government under president hamid karsai , whose position , although recognized and respected in the provinces , has hardly any influence over the warlords and militias who still control considerable areas of the country .
brahimi said this was understandable in a state that has been completely destroyed .
" we are in a process of rebuilding the state machinery .
there are no roads , no telephones , no lines of communication .

" i think we would be sorry if that was the decision of the federal republic of germany , " he told deutsche welle .
the isaf is still developing , brahimi explained , " but it promises to be helpful for the progress of the peace process , for the training of the afghan police and the army . "
he added that not expanding isaf ’ s mandate beyond kabul would hinder the security and reconstruction efforts in the provinces and prolong the instability in the country .
" afghanistan is certainly in some parts still a dangerous place , " brahimi conceded , " but i think in the places -lsb- the german government -rsb- is contemplating , we don ’ t see many problems for the german soldiers if they were there . "
" of course we must be careful , " he continued while pointing out that the united nations itself has been sending unarmed civilians into the provinces for quite some time .
brahimi admitted , though , that security was a serious problem for u.n. reconstruction workers who are not able to access certain regions in the south and east and can only enter other regions with bodyguards .
the road to democracy according to brahimi , it will take some time before afghanistan is in a position to provide its own effective security .
he estimated that by september the national police and army are expected to have trained about 6,000 people , but it will be at least another year before the central government will have built up enough of a security force to make a substantial difference .
building a democratic state takes time , brahimi emphasized .
it is a slow and difficult process .
nonetheless , he expects that afghanistan will have a constitution in the near future .
" the constitution work has started and it is going reasonably well .
barring any unforeseen difficulties , we hope the country will have a new constitution by october , " he stated .
elections , on the other hand , are more difficult .
the u.n. envoy described them as a logistical nightmare .
" we have to register people all over the country , in every village .
and we have to go there ourselves , because they will not come to us , especially the women .
that means we have to recruit thousands of people , and it will cost a lot of money . "
but he believes elections can take place as early as october 2004 , if the security situation in the countryside allows for it , brahimi added .
waning interest in afghanistan ?
when asked if international interest in afghanistan was fading and whether or not money from western donor countries was drying up , brahimi responded that there is always the fear of donor fatigue and competition with the attraction of other international crisis situations .
" probably the attention has diminished a little bit , " he said , " but i think there ’ s still a reasonable amount of interest and support for what is happening in afghanistan .

his words still resound today in berlin , even 12 years after reunification . " two thousand years ago the proudest boast was " civis romanus sum . "
today , in the world of freedom , the proudest boast is " ich bin ein berliner . "
when united states president john f. kennedy made the famous statement " ich bin ein berliner " – -lrb- i am a berliner -rrb- - in front of the city hall of west berlin on june 26 , 1963 , he uttered words that went straight to the hearts of the citizens of berlin .
he insinuated that they were - just like the citizens of rome in earlier times - free people , with an unalienable right to freedom and the right to be protected by the rest of the free world .
it was a rousing speech that quite possibly turned the tide in favor of holding on to berlin as an isolated outpost in communist east germany at a time when it was in very real danger of falling to the communist german democratic republic .
" this was a very intense feeling of closeness , " recalls alexander longolius , a member of west germany 's city council in 1963 and later director of the checkpoint charlie foundation .
" if the americans had turned away from us , if that speech had told us we were leaving the city , then it would have been dramatic .
i remember that i went home and told my wife -lrb- ... -rrb- that our worries are over and everything would be good . "
a divided city from the end of world war ii in 1945 until the beginning of german reunification in 1989 , germany as a whole , and berlin as a city , was divided by the cold war a state of open confrontation between the communist bloc and the nato alliance .
in august 1961 , the soviets erected the berlin wall to stop the mass exodus of people fleeing soviet east berlin for west berlin and the non-communist world , thus sealing west berlin behind a 12-foot wall for some 28 years .
two years after this , kennedy gave his historic speech , which still finds incredible resonance here 40 years later .
in 1963 , west berlin was militarily protected by and partly governed by american , french and british forces .
the largest military contingent was american , and faced off a sizeable soviet contingent on the other side of the wall .
many people - and companies - had left the divided city for greener and safer pastures .
in his speech , kennedy expressed admiration for those who stayed on despite the city 's isolation .
" i want to say , on behalf of my countrymen , who live many miles away on the other side of the atlantic , who are far distant from you , that they take the greatest pride that they have been able to share with you , even from a distance , the story of the last 18 years .
i know of no town , no city , that has been besieged for 18 years that still lives with the vitality and the force and the hope and the determination of the city of west berlin . "
these words , uttered by the american president , had a soothing effect not only on the souls of beleaguered west berliners , but on the german post-war psyche as a whole .
many germans still felt a deep sense of guilt for the crimes they or their parents had committed - or at least had not prevented - during world war ii and the holocaust .
berliners were particularly receptive of the support kennedy expressed .
after all , when the wall went up in 1961 , many west germans were convinced the city was entirely lost to the communists .
" i was on vacation in west germany in the bavarian forest to the south of berlin , " longolius says .
" we were on a farm , and did n't have a radio .
so i did n't hear about the wall on that sunday .
i heard about it on tuesday , two days later , when our landlady - a farmer 's woman - asked me where i would go when my vacation was over .
and i said i would go home .
and she said to me : you ca n't do that any more because they 've cut west berlin off . "
when he toured west berlin , kennedy was accompanied by the then-mayor of berlin , willy brandt , and german chancellor konrad adenauer .
many berliners felt the chancellor and other west germans did not fully understand the importance of their city as a bulwark against communism , protecting the entire country against a soviet invasion .
" i said to myself : once the russians are berlin , they will be sitting on the rhine four weeks later , " says a woman , who has been a longtime resident of berlin .
" and i think that would have been the case .
the russians would simply have marched through .
once they had reached west berlin , they would have bulldozed the country - maybe not in four weeks , maybe a little later .
and they would not only have gone as far as the rhine , but even further .
that was the opinion of many people at the time . "
in the early 1960s , the cold war was at it 's peak .
not only was james bond fighting fictitious communist villains in the cinemas of the west .
the delivery of soviet nuclear medium-range missiles to cuba in 1962 had only just brought the world to the brink of a nuclear war .
communism as an ideology seemed like a viable and attractive alternative to capitalism for many intellectuals , even in the west .
john f. kennedy therefore used his speech in west berlin not only to boost the morale of the inhabitants there , but also to condemn communism as a politically , economically and morally inferior system everywhere in the world , with the berlin wall the most obvious and vivid demonstration of communism 's failures .
" there are many people in the world who really do n't understand , or say they do n't , what is the great issue between the free world and the communist world .
let them come to berlin .
there are some who say that communism is the wave of the future .
let them come to berlin .
and there are some who say in europe and elsewhere we can work with the communists .
let them come to berlin . "
an american legend according to alexander longolius , john f. kennedy became a mythical figure in germany and elsewhere because he was highly credible .
" he was not only an american president .
he was the leader of the west , " he says .
" the man who gave all of us hope , a perspective and a dream .
the united states at that time combined military , economic , cultural and moral leadership .
and there was no doubt in our mind that kennedy stood for all that . "
kennedy 's premature death at the hands of a gunman in dallas only a few months after holding his berlin speech temporarily plunged the city into depression and despair .
today , 40 years later , kennedy 's legacy lives on in germany 's collective memory - for example in school books , documentaries about the cold war and in an exhibition at the german national museum of contemporary history in bonn .
there , the most famous excerpt of kennedy 's speech is displayed on a television monitor , and there is a copy of the piece of paper john f. kennedy held in his hand when delivering his speech , complete with the lines " ich bin ein berliner " and " let them come to berlin " scrawled on it in his own hand-writing .
herman schäfer , a custodian at the museum , says the document still elicits a deep response today .
" the reaction of our visitors is very enthusiastic , still enthusiastic , even though this 40 years ago .
everybody - be it young or old people - have in mind that this is a quotation from john f. kennedy .
so they hear this quotation and then the look into the glass case and see with even more surprise that there is this little document with the phonetic transcription of john f. kennedy .
so there is still this enthusiasm about this quotation that -lrb- puts -rrb- so much emphasis on the german-american friendship during the 1960s . "
kennedy 's speech has been cited and used as a model by other politicians since 1963 .
shortly before the berlin wall came down in 1989 , u.s. president ronald reagan addressed soviet leader mikhail gorbachev from the same location , telling him the time was ripe for german reunification .
and when after the sept .
11. attacks on new york and washington , chancellor schröder pledged " unlimited " support to the us in its war on terrorism , he alluded to george w. bush ' famous predecessor .
" when the defense of berlin was at stake , john f. kennedy said - and you all know this famous sentence - ' i am a berliner ' , " schröder said .
" that was the expression of incredible solidarity .
today i believe that we have every reason - especially we germans - to return this solidarity by expressing our solidarity with the american people . "
strained relations however , following germany 's refusal to back the u.s.-led war on iraq , relations between the two countries reached a historic low .
many germans refused to believe that the ideals kennedy had upheld in berlin were being appropriately defended by bush .
because of the widespread rejection of the war , germans have been accused of anti-americanism .
but according to schäfer of the national museum in bonn , the us-german relationship has not been fundamentally impaired .
" it is still as strong as in former times and if we look to the development of our civilization , i personally think that the united states is something like the leading civilized nation of the world , " he says .
" and there are a lot of different developments which are already there - if we like them or not - and many of them i do not like , i would not agree with all developments which are under way in the u.s. they will come to our state , to our country , to europe soon or later .
but we have to decide individually if we want to adopt them . "

europe and the united states are slowly smoothing out their troubled relations originating from the iraq conflict .
but there are still enough problems between the two to spark future political disagreements . who would have imagined ?
the shattered transatlantic bond between the united states and the european union appears to be on its way out of its crisis .
the two sides may not be moving towards a hot love affair .
but a partnership of convenience is certain to result .
the first eu-u.s. summit after the iraq war brought europeans and americans together once again and proved their ability to face up to common problems with combined powers .
good cooperation in the fight against terrorism plays a significant role here . new agreements in this sector not only stipulate joint investigative teams to uncover terrorist criminals , but also clarify the extradition of suspected terrorists to the united states .
in the case of the latter , the europeans do not need to fear that the suspects will be sentenced to death or tried before a military tribunal once they are on american soil . this agreement shows that both sides are capable of cooperating while respectfully recognizing the legal tradition of the other , together with its ethical-moral implications . working together for peace the common efforts to secure peace in the middle east follow a similar path .
though progression in this conflict is moving more slowly than in the fight against terrorism , new rays of hope have appeared on the horizon .
these involve efforts within the group know as the middle east quartet - made up of the united states , the eu , the united nations and russia - as well as the personal commitment by u.s. president george w. bush .
now , it is essential to withdraw the financial basis for the hamas movement 's activities , to press israel to reduce its settlements in the west bank and to use the signalized ceasefire by palestinian groups for a consequential implementation of the u.s. and eu-backed " road map " to peace . surprisingly , the transatlantic views on iran have conformed to each other relatively quickly .
the nuclear program of a nation blessed with rich energy sources is , in fact , cause for worry on all sides .
but a military intervention by the u.s. similar to that in iraq is currently not under discussion .
and the eu can use its good economic relations to iran to increase pressure on the country 's ayatollahs . moving forward despite differences despite political synergies , the problems of transatlantic cooperation remain on the agenda even after this summit .
europe 's ban on importing genetically-modified food continues to be a thorn in washington 's side .
and europe views the u.s. 's continuous refusal to work with the international criminal court as somewhat paranoid .
here , the devil lies in the detail .
but even if this transatlantic bond represents a partnership of convenience , the willingness to solve problems is growing to such a degree that it can reinstate lost trust .
in this sense , the summit in washington has taken europe and the united states a good step forward . daniel scheschkewitz is deutsche welle 's washington correspondent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de transatlantic summit dominated by anti-terror talks the one-day transatlantic summit in washington meant to smooth over iraq-war tensions saw leaders making progress on anti-terror cooperation , even as the united states urged europe to cut off funding to hamas -lrb- june 25 , 2003 -rrb- .

europe and the united states are slowly smoothing out their troubled relations originating from the iraq conflict .

the shattered transatlantic bond between the united states and the european union appears to be on its way out of its crisis .
the two sides may not be moving towards a hot love affair .
but a partnership of convenience is certain to result .
the first eu-u.s. summit after the iraq war brought europeans and americans together once again and proved their ability to face up to common problems with combined powers .
good cooperation in the fight against terrorism plays a significant role here . new agreements in this sector not only stipulate joint investigative teams to uncover terrorist criminals , but also clarify the extradition of suspected terrorists to the united states .
in the case of the latter , the europeans do not need to fear that the suspects will be sentenced to death or tried before a military tribunal once they are on american soil . this agreement shows that both sides are capable of cooperating while respectfully recognizing the legal tradition of the other , together with its ethical-moral implications . working together for peace the common efforts to secure peace in the middle east follow a similar path .
though progression in this conflict is moving more slowly than in the fight against terrorism , new rays of hope have appeared on the horizon .
these involve efforts within the group know as the middle east quartet - made up of the united states , the eu , the united nations and russia - as well as the personal commitment by u.s. president george w. bush .
now , it is essential to withdraw the financial basis for the hamas movement 's activities , to press israel to reduce its settlements in the west bank and to use the signalized ceasefire by palestinian groups for a consequential implementation of the u.s. and eu-backed " road map " to peace . surprisingly , the transatlantic views on iran have conformed to each other relatively quickly .
the nuclear program of a nation blessed with rich energy sources is , in fact , cause for worry on all sides .
but a military intervention by the u.s. similar to that in iraq is currently not under discussion .
and the eu can use its good economic relations to iran to increase pressure on the country 's ayatollahs . moving forward despite differences despite political synergies , the problems of transatlantic cooperation remain on the agenda even after this summit .
europe 's ban on importing genetically-modified food continues to be a thorn in washington 's side .
and europe views the u.s. 's continuous refusal to work with the international criminal court as somewhat paranoid .

mannheimer woes seen troubling insurance industry ; deutsche bahn forced to offer competitor 's timetables ; economists see light at the end of the tunnel . mannheimer insolvency signals trouble for industry one of germany ’ s oldest insurance companies was left looking for a bailout plan on thursday after the german insurance industry association -lrb- gdv -rrb- announced that a last-minute rescue initiative to raise € 370 million -lrb- $ 426 million -rrb- from fellow insurers had failed .
the mannheimer lebensversicherung ag , which has been struggling to stay afloat following significant losses on the capital markets last year , turned to the gdv – a cooperation of 110 insurance companies - in the hopes of drumming up enough fresh cash to prevent it from being the first german insurer to go under in 50 years .
the gdv , however , could not convince the necessary 90 percent of its members to back the rescue plan .
it now looks as if mannheimer will become the first german insurer to seek help from protektor , the industry-backed safety net set up last year to protect policyholder ’ s investments in the event of an insurer ’ s insolvency .
but protektor so far only exists on paper , and with a start-up capital of just € 3.2 million put forth by 10 insurers , its rescue funds remain rather limited .
that ’ s not good news for the german government , which has been encouraging citizens to invest in equity-based life insurance plans rather than rely on state support for their retirement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.06.2003 kennedy still a ' berliner ' after all these years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john f. kennedy : " ich bin ein berliner " thursday marks the 40th anniversary of u.s. president john f. kennedy 's famous " ich bin ein berliner " speech .
his words still resound today in berlin , even 12 years after reunification . " two thousand years ago the proudest boast was " civis romanus sum . "
today , in the world of freedom , the proudest boast is " ich bin ein berliner . "
when united states president john f. kennedy made the famous statement " ich bin ein berliner " – -lrb- i am a berliner -rrb- - in front of the city hall of west berlin on june 26 , 1963 , he uttered words that went straight to the hearts of the citizens of berlin .
he insinuated that they were - just like the citizens of rome in earlier times - free people , with an unalienable right to freedom and the right to be protected by the rest of the free world .
it was a rousing speech that quite possibly turned the tide in favor of holding on to berlin as an isolated outpost in communist east germany at a time when it was in very real danger of falling to the communist german democratic republic .
" this was a very intense feeling of closeness , " recalls alexander longolius , a member of west germany 's city council in 1963 and later director of the checkpoint charlie foundation .
" if the americans had turned away from us , if that speech had told us we were leaving the city , then it would have been dramatic .
i remember that i went home and told my wife -lrb- ... -rrb- that our worries are over and everything would be good . "
a divided city from the end of world war ii in 1945 until the beginning of german reunification in 1989 , germany as a whole , and berlin as a city , was divided by the cold war a state of open confrontation between the communist bloc and the nato alliance .
in august 1961 , the soviets erected the berlin wall to stop the mass exodus of people fleeing soviet east berlin for west berlin and the non-communist world , thus sealing west berlin behind a 12-foot wall for some 28 years .
two years after this , kennedy gave his historic speech , which still finds incredible resonance here 40 years later .
in 1963 , west berlin was militarily protected by and partly governed by american , french and british forces .
the largest military contingent was american , and faced off a sizeable soviet contingent on the other side of the wall .
many people - and companies - had left the divided city for greener and safer pastures .
in his speech , kennedy expressed admiration for those who stayed on despite the city 's isolation .
" i want to say , on behalf of my countrymen , who live many miles away on the other side of the atlantic , who are far distant from you , that they take the greatest pride that they have been able to share with you , even from a distance , the story of the last 18 years .
i know of no town , no city , that has been besieged for 18 years that still lives with the vitality and the force and the hope and the determination of the city of west berlin . "
these words , uttered by the american president , had a soothing effect not only on the souls of beleaguered west berliners , but on the german post-war psyche as a whole .
many germans still felt a deep sense of guilt for the crimes they or their parents had committed - or at least had not prevented - during world war ii and the holocaust .
berliners were particularly receptive of the support kennedy expressed .
after all , when the wall went up in 1961 , many west germans were convinced the city was entirely lost to the communists .
" i was on vacation in west germany in the bavarian forest to the south of berlin , " longolius says .
" we were on a farm , and did n't have a radio .
so i did n't hear about the wall on that sunday .
i heard about it on tuesday , two days later , when our landlady - a farmer 's woman - asked me where i would go when my vacation was over .
and i said i would go home .
and she said to me : you ca n't do that any more because they 've cut west berlin off . "
when he toured west berlin , kennedy was accompanied by the then-mayor of berlin , willy brandt , and german chancellor konrad adenauer .
many berliners felt the chancellor and other west germans did not fully understand the importance of their city as a bulwark against communism , protecting the entire country against a soviet invasion .
" i said to myself : once the russians are berlin , they will be sitting on the rhine four weeks later , " says a woman , who has been a longtime resident of berlin .
" and i think that would have been the case .
the russians would simply have marched through .
once they had reached west berlin , they would have bulldozed the country - maybe not in four weeks , maybe a little later .
and they would not only have gone as far as the rhine , but even further .
that was the opinion of many people at the time . "
in the early 1960s , the cold war was at it 's peak .
not only was james bond fighting fictitious communist villains in the cinemas of the west .
the delivery of soviet nuclear medium-range missiles to cuba in 1962 had only just brought the world to the brink of a nuclear war .
communism as an ideology seemed like a viable and attractive alternative to capitalism for many intellectuals , even in the west .
john f. kennedy therefore used his speech in west berlin not only to boost the morale of the inhabitants there , but also to condemn communism as a politically , economically and morally inferior system everywhere in the world , with the berlin wall the most obvious and vivid demonstration of communism 's failures .
" there are many people in the world who really do n't understand , or say they do n't , what is the great issue between the free world and the communist world .
let them come to berlin .
there are some who say that communism is the wave of the future .
let them come to berlin .
and there are some who say in europe and elsewhere we can work with the communists .
let them come to berlin . "
an american legend according to alexander longolius , john f. kennedy became a mythical figure in germany and elsewhere because he was highly credible .
" he was not only an american president .
he was the leader of the west , " he says .
" the man who gave all of us hope , a perspective and a dream .
the united states at that time combined military , economic , cultural and moral leadership .
and there was no doubt in our mind that kennedy stood for all that . "
kennedy 's premature death at the hands of a gunman in dallas only a few months after holding his berlin speech temporarily plunged the city into depression and despair .
today , 40 years later , kennedy 's legacy lives on in germany 's collective memory - for example in school books , documentaries about the cold war and in an exhibition at the german national museum of contemporary history in bonn .
there , the most famous excerpt of kennedy 's speech is displayed on a television monitor , and there is a copy of the piece of paper john f. kennedy held in his hand when delivering his speech , complete with the lines " ich bin ein berliner " and " let them come to berlin " scrawled on it in his own hand-writing .
herman schäfer , a custodian at the museum , says the document still elicits a deep response today .
" the reaction of our visitors is very enthusiastic , still enthusiastic , even though this 40 years ago .
everybody - be it young or old people - have in mind that this is a quotation from john f. kennedy .
so they hear this quotation and then the look into the glass case and see with even more surprise that there is this little document with the phonetic transcription of john f. kennedy .
so there is still this enthusiasm about this quotation that -lrb- puts -rrb- so much emphasis on the german-american friendship during the 1960s . "
kennedy 's speech has been cited and used as a model by other politicians since 1963 .
shortly before the berlin wall came down in 1989 , u.s. president ronald reagan addressed soviet leader mikhail gorbachev from the same location , telling him the time was ripe for german reunification .
and when after the sept .
11. attacks on new york and washington , chancellor schröder pledged " unlimited " support to the us in its war on terrorism , he alluded to george w. bush ' famous predecessor .
" when the defense of berlin was at stake , john f. kennedy said - and you all know this famous sentence - ' i am a berliner ' , " schröder said .
" that was the expression of incredible solidarity .
today i believe that we have every reason - especially we germans - to return this solidarity by expressing our solidarity with the american people . "
strained relations however , following germany 's refusal to back the u.s.-led war on iraq , relations between the two countries reached a historic low .
many germans refused to believe that the ideals kennedy had upheld in berlin were being appropriately defended by bush .
because of the widespread rejection of the war , germans have been accused of anti-americanism .
but according to schäfer of the national museum in bonn , the us-german relationship has not been fundamentally impaired .
" it is still as strong as in former times and if we look to the development of our civilization , i personally think that the united states is something like the leading civilized nation of the world , " he says .
" and there are a lot of different developments which are already there - if we like them or not - and many of them i do not like , i would not agree with all developments which are under way in the u.s. they will come to our state , to our country , to europe soon or later .
but we have to decide individually if we want to adopt them . "
editor 's note : john f. kennedy 's historic visit to berlin in 1963 is also the subject of a new exhibit at the german historical museum in berlin , which will be displaying 400 artifacts from the life of the former president through oct .

in an interview with deutsche welle , he said security was still the country 's biggest problem . " afghanistan is a very violent place .
we ’ ve got to be careful and take as many precautions as possible .
there are still spoilers out there who do not want this peace process to succeed , " brahimi said in an interview with deutsche welle .
the united nations special envoy to afghanistan is in germany to receive a special peace prize from the federal state of hessen on thursday .
ahead of the award ceremony , he met with german foreign minister joschka fischer and defense minister peter struck .
during the meeting with the two german ministers , brahimi stressed how important the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- was to maintaining the peace in conflict-ridden afghanistan .
after nearly 25 years of war and civil strife , the country needs the international peacekeepers and the provincial reconstruction teams to restore security , rebuild the infrastructure and help the central government establish its authority outside kabul , brahimi said .
" the international troops , isaf , are needed now and they will be needed for some time .
how long is difficult to say .
my personal calculation is a couple of years before the afghan army and national police can provide security for the people of afghanistan , especially in kabul .
i think it will take one or two years . "
limited influence one of the main problems facing reconstruction efforts in afghanistan is the limited reach of the central government under president hamid karsai , whose position , although recognized and respected in the provinces , has hardly any influence over the warlords and militias who still control considerable areas of the country .
brahimi said this was understandable in a state that has been completely destroyed .
" we are in a process of rebuilding the state machinery .
there are no roads , no telephones , no lines of communication .
that is why it is so difficult to project the influence of the central government in the country , " brahimi explained .
" the government is limited in its resources , but it is recognized in the provinces , " he said , " and therefore what is required is to help the government rebuild the state , not only in kabul , but in the provinces . "
" the best way of doing this , " brahimi stressed , " is to extend isaf outside the capital . "
extending the isaf mandate but the issue of extending the commitment of international peacekeepers in afghanistan is still a matter of discussion .
the isaf , which will be operated under dutch-german command until august , is currently restricted to the afghan capital kabul , but the united states and u.n. secretary general kofi annan have requested that troops also be sent to the provinces to protect civilian workers who are helping rebuild the country .
in berlin , the question of extending the isaf mandate beyond kabul has been met with a good deal of opposition following a june 7 bombing in the capital city that killed four german soldiers .
germany , which supplies the largest troop contingent in the international force , has been hesitant to commit more soldiers and extend their area of operation until the security situation in the provinces improves .
the german parliament in not scheduled to vote on an extension of the mandate until september .
brahimi said he respects the german government ’ s deliberations in light of the recent terrorist attack , but at the same time he expressed hope that germany would not rule against extending the security forces outside kabul .
" i think we would be sorry if that was the decision of the federal republic of germany , " he told deutsche welle .
the isaf is still developing , brahimi explained , " but it promises to be helpful for the progress of the peace process , for the training of the afghan police and the army . "
he added that not expanding isaf ’ s mandate beyond kabul would hinder the security and reconstruction efforts in the provinces and prolong the instability in the country .
" afghanistan is certainly in some parts still a dangerous place , " brahimi conceded , " but i think in the places -lsb- the german government -rsb- is contemplating , we don ’ t see many problems for the german soldiers if they were there . "
" of course we must be careful , " he continued while pointing out that the united nations itself has been sending unarmed civilians into the provinces for quite some time .
brahimi admitted , though , that security was a serious problem for u.n. reconstruction workers who are not able to access certain regions in the south and east and can only enter other regions with bodyguards .
the road to democracy according to brahimi , it will take some time before afghanistan is in a position to provide its own effective security .
he estimated that by september the national police and army are expected to have trained about 6,000 people , but it will be at least another year before the central government will have built up enough of a security force to make a substantial difference .
building a democratic state takes time , brahimi emphasized .
it is a slow and difficult process .
nonetheless , he expects that afghanistan will have a constitution in the near future .
" the constitution work has started and it is going reasonably well .
barring any unforeseen difficulties , we hope the country will have a new constitution by october , " he stated .
elections , on the other hand , are more difficult .
the u.n. envoy described them as a logistical nightmare .
" we have to register people all over the country , in every village .
and we have to go there ourselves , because they will not come to us , especially the women .
that means we have to recruit thousands of people , and it will cost a lot of money . "
but he believes elections can take place as early as october 2004 , if the security situation in the countryside allows for it , brahimi added .
waning interest in afghanistan ?
when asked if international interest in afghanistan was fading and whether or not money from western donor countries was drying up , brahimi responded that there is always the fear of donor fatigue and competition with the attraction of other international crisis situations .

his words still resound today in berlin , even 12 years after reunification . " two thousand years ago the proudest boast was " civis romanus sum . "
today , in the world of freedom , the proudest boast is " ich bin ein berliner . "
when united states president john f. kennedy made the famous statement " ich bin ein berliner " – -lrb- i am a berliner -rrb- - in front of the city hall of west berlin on june 26 , 1963 , he uttered words that went straight to the hearts of the citizens of berlin .
he insinuated that they were - just like the citizens of rome in earlier times - free people , with an unalienable right to freedom and the right to be protected by the rest of the free world .
it was a rousing speech that quite possibly turned the tide in favor of holding on to berlin as an isolated outpost in communist east germany at a time when it was in very real danger of falling to the communist german democratic republic .
" this was a very intense feeling of closeness , " recalls alexander longolius , a member of west germany 's city council in 1963 and later director of the checkpoint charlie foundation .
" if the americans had turned away from us , if that speech had told us we were leaving the city , then it would have been dramatic .
i remember that i went home and told my wife -lrb- ... -rrb- that our worries are over and everything would be good . "
a divided city from the end of world war ii in 1945 until the beginning of german reunification in 1989 , germany as a whole , and berlin as a city , was divided by the cold war a state of open confrontation between the communist bloc and the nato alliance .
in august 1961 , the soviets erected the berlin wall to stop the mass exodus of people fleeing soviet east berlin for west berlin and the non-communist world , thus sealing west berlin behind a 12-foot wall for some 28 years .
two years after this , kennedy gave his historic speech , which still finds incredible resonance here 40 years later .
in 1963 , west berlin was militarily protected by and partly governed by american , french and british forces .
the largest military contingent was american , and faced off a sizeable soviet contingent on the other side of the wall .
many people - and companies - had left the divided city for greener and safer pastures .
in his speech , kennedy expressed admiration for those who stayed on despite the city 's isolation .
" i want to say , on behalf of my countrymen , who live many miles away on the other side of the atlantic , who are far distant from you , that they take the greatest pride that they have been able to share with you , even from a distance , the story of the last 18 years .
i know of no town , no city , that has been besieged for 18 years that still lives with the vitality and the force and the hope and the determination of the city of west berlin . "
these words , uttered by the american president , had a soothing effect not only on the souls of beleaguered west berliners , but on the german post-war psyche as a whole .
many germans still felt a deep sense of guilt for the crimes they or their parents had committed - or at least had not prevented - during world war ii and the holocaust .
berliners were particularly receptive of the support kennedy expressed .
after all , when the wall went up in 1961 , many west germans were convinced the city was entirely lost to the communists .
" i was on vacation in west germany in the bavarian forest to the south of berlin , " longolius says .
" we were on a farm , and did n't have a radio .
so i did n't hear about the wall on that sunday .
i heard about it on tuesday , two days later , when our landlady - a farmer 's woman - asked me where i would go when my vacation was over .
and i said i would go home .
and she said to me : you ca n't do that any more because they 've cut west berlin off . "
when he toured west berlin , kennedy was accompanied by the then-mayor of berlin , willy brandt , and german chancellor konrad adenauer .
many berliners felt the chancellor and other west germans did not fully understand the importance of their city as a bulwark against communism , protecting the entire country against a soviet invasion .
" i said to myself : once the russians are berlin , they will be sitting on the rhine four weeks later , " says a woman , who has been a longtime resident of berlin .
" and i think that would have been the case .
the russians would simply have marched through .
once they had reached west berlin , they would have bulldozed the country - maybe not in four weeks , maybe a little later .
and they would not only have gone as far as the rhine , but even further .
that was the opinion of many people at the time . "
in the early 1960s , the cold war was at it 's peak .
not only was james bond fighting fictitious communist villains in the cinemas of the west .
the delivery of soviet nuclear medium-range missiles to cuba in 1962 had only just brought the world to the brink of a nuclear war .
communism as an ideology seemed like a viable and attractive alternative to capitalism for many intellectuals , even in the west .
john f. kennedy therefore used his speech in west berlin not only to boost the morale of the inhabitants there , but also to condemn communism as a politically , economically and morally inferior system everywhere in the world , with the berlin wall the most obvious and vivid demonstration of communism 's failures .
" there are many people in the world who really do n't understand , or say they do n't , what is the great issue between the free world and the communist world .
let them come to berlin .
there are some who say that communism is the wave of the future .
let them come to berlin .
and there are some who say in europe and elsewhere we can work with the communists .
let them come to berlin . "
an american legend according to alexander longolius , john f. kennedy became a mythical figure in germany and elsewhere because he was highly credible .
" he was not only an american president .
he was the leader of the west , " he says .
" the man who gave all of us hope , a perspective and a dream .
the united states at that time combined military , economic , cultural and moral leadership .
and there was no doubt in our mind that kennedy stood for all that . "
kennedy 's premature death at the hands of a gunman in dallas only a few months after holding his berlin speech temporarily plunged the city into depression and despair .
today , 40 years later , kennedy 's legacy lives on in germany 's collective memory - for example in school books , documentaries about the cold war and in an exhibition at the german national museum of contemporary history in bonn .
there , the most famous excerpt of kennedy 's speech is displayed on a television monitor , and there is a copy of the piece of paper john f. kennedy held in his hand when delivering his speech , complete with the lines " ich bin ein berliner " and " let them come to berlin " scrawled on it in his own hand-writing .
herman schäfer , a custodian at the museum , says the document still elicits a deep response today .
" the reaction of our visitors is very enthusiastic , still enthusiastic , even though this 40 years ago .
everybody - be it young or old people - have in mind that this is a quotation from john f. kennedy .
so they hear this quotation and then the look into the glass case and see with even more surprise that there is this little document with the phonetic transcription of john f. kennedy .
so there is still this enthusiasm about this quotation that -lrb- puts -rrb- so much emphasis on the german-american friendship during the 1960s . "
kennedy 's speech has been cited and used as a model by other politicians since 1963 .
shortly before the berlin wall came down in 1989 , u.s. president ronald reagan addressed soviet leader mikhail gorbachev from the same location , telling him the time was ripe for german reunification .
and when after the sept .
11. attacks on new york and washington , chancellor schröder pledged " unlimited " support to the us in its war on terrorism , he alluded to george w. bush ' famous predecessor .
" when the defense of berlin was at stake , john f. kennedy said - and you all know this famous sentence - ' i am a berliner ' , " schröder said .
" that was the expression of incredible solidarity .
today i believe that we have every reason - especially we germans - to return this solidarity by expressing our solidarity with the american people . "
strained relations however , following germany 's refusal to back the u.s.-led war on iraq , relations between the two countries reached a historic low .
many germans refused to believe that the ideals kennedy had upheld in berlin were being appropriately defended by bush .
because of the widespread rejection of the war , germans have been accused of anti-americanism .
but according to schäfer of the national museum in bonn , the us-german relationship has not been fundamentally impaired .
" it is still as strong as in former times and if we look to the development of our civilization , i personally think that the united states is something like the leading civilized nation of the world , " he says .
" and there are a lot of different developments which are already there - if we like them or not - and many of them i do not like , i would not agree with all developments which are under way in the u.s. they will come to our state , to our country , to europe soon or later .
but we have to decide individually if we want to adopt them . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.06.2003 eu farming policy set for major revamp großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's reformed agricultural policy is likely to mean change for many farms in europe .
european union agricultural ministers reached a deal thursday to overhaul the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- after years of deadlock , ending brussels ’ controversial policy of generous farm hand-outs . eu farming ministers meeting in luxembourg agreed on a comprehensive reform package for the 15-nation bloc ’ s agriculture policy on thursday after a marathon round of negotiations to thrash out the last details .
portugal was the only country to vote against the reform .
the move amounts to the most radical shake-up of the eu ’ s expensive 45-year-old cap , which critics have long argued undermines world trade and puts poor countries at a disadvantage .
the main thrust of the reforms is to cut back the eu ’ s program of huge direct subsidies to farmers , which account to about € 43 billion -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- a year - almost half the entire eu budget .
crop subsidies eliminated the chief architect of the reform plan , eu agricultural commissioner franz fischler , managed to largely salvage the cornerstone of his reform plan - namely breaking down the traditional link between subsidy and agricultural output , which has been blamed for offering an incentive to farmers to overproduce merely to get more cash from brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commissioner for agriculture , rural development and fisheries franz fischler fischler -lrb- photo -rrb- said the reforms would shape the future of european farming and end the practice of automatic farm handouts . " this decision marks the beginning of a new era .
our farm policy will fundamentally change.today , europe has given itself a new and effective farm policy , " he said .
the accord was hailed by leaders from several member countries .
" the agreement today delivers what we wanted - real change , " said britain 's agriculture minister , margaret beckett .
" it will give stability and security to farmers in the next decade , " said irish farm minister joe walsh .
german agricultural minister renate künast described the reform as a big success .
" with it we can finally break out of the old agricultural system , " she said .
in the future , subsidies from brussels will be distributed more evenly , rewarding farmers who switch to environmentally-friendly farming methods that promote increased food quality and improved rural management .
the european commission is also eager to end subsidies prior to 2004 when the agriculturally dependant economies of eastern europe join the eu .
critics feared that extending handouts to the new eu countries would only worsen the problem of over-production in europe .
agreement expected to revive trade talks the agreement on eu farm reforms is also seen as essential to kickstart the stalled doha round of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks .
fischler said the deal would boost the eu ’ s negotiating position in upcoming trade talks in mexico in september and appease the united states and japan , who had criticized the current system of eu farm hand-outs saying it violates wto rules .
" we ’ re also sending out a message to the world that we have a more trade-friendly policy .
we are saying goodbye to a policy that used to distort trade , " fischler told a news conference on thursday .
" we can go with our heads held high to cancun , " fischler said .
wto chief supachai panitchpakdi welcomed the deal .
" i see that this would have a positive effect on movement in areas , if not all areas of agriculture , " supachai said in geneva .
angry farmers despite the breakthrough on the reform package , fischler was forced to compromised on several elements of his original plan under heavy pressure from big farming nations such as france .
france , the largest beneficiary of eu farm aid , had strongly resisted decoupling farm aid from production subsidies .
in the latest deal , fischler compromised by abandoning his plan to cut minimum prices on key grains - including wheat , barley and maize and by allowing countries a high degree of flexibility over how it may apply decoupling rules for livestock .
but some french farmers were still dissatisfied .
" france has badly defended the interests of the cap and of french farmers , " jerome despey , head of france ’ s young farmers organization told radio france international .
likewise , farming unions in germany , one of the eu ’ s largest contributors to cap , were also dismayed by the deal .
the german farmers association -lrb- dbv -rrb- said farmers in that country would lose between € 1.2 and € 2 billion as a result of the cuts and warned that the decision would discourage further investment .
" this decision is a major burden for german and european farmers , " german farmers association president gerd sonnleitner told german public radio .
" it ’ s a typical eu compromise which gives and takes a little from everyone and creates terrible difficulties for those who have to implement it , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu farm reform proposals weakened in political power play german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would help france water down a radical reform of the european union ’ s common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
eu ministers will attempt to hammer out a deal next week . -lrb- june 13 , 2003 -rrb- a summer of discontent for eastern german farmers the eu 's plan to cut direct subsidies to large farms will hit eastern german farmers harder than those in any other region in europe .

his words still resound today in berlin , even 12 years after reunification . " two thousand years ago the proudest boast was " civis romanus sum . "
today , in the world of freedom , the proudest boast is " ich bin ein berliner . "
when united states president john f. kennedy made the famous statement " ich bin ein berliner " – -lrb- i am a berliner -rrb- - in front of the city hall of west berlin on june 26 , 1963 , he uttered words that went straight to the hearts of the citizens of berlin .
he insinuated that they were - just like the citizens of rome in earlier times - free people , with an unalienable right to freedom and the right to be protected by the rest of the free world .
it was a rousing speech that quite possibly turned the tide in favor of holding on to berlin as an isolated outpost in communist east germany at a time when it was in very real danger of falling to the communist german democratic republic .
" this was a very intense feeling of closeness , " recalls alexander longolius , a member of west germany 's city council in 1963 and later director of the checkpoint charlie foundation .
" if the americans had turned away from us , if that speech had told us we were leaving the city , then it would have been dramatic .
i remember that i went home and told my wife -lrb- ... -rrb- that our worries are over and everything would be good . "
a divided city from the end of world war ii in 1945 until the beginning of german reunification in 1989 , germany as a whole , and berlin as a city , was divided by the cold war a state of open confrontation between the communist bloc and the nato alliance .
in august 1961 , the soviets erected the berlin wall to stop the mass exodus of people fleeing soviet east berlin for west berlin and the non-communist world , thus sealing west berlin behind a 12-foot wall for some 28 years .
two years after this , kennedy gave his historic speech , which still finds incredible resonance here 40 years later .
in 1963 , west berlin was militarily protected by and partly governed by american , french and british forces .
the largest military contingent was american , and faced off a sizeable soviet contingent on the other side of the wall .
many people - and companies - had left the divided city for greener and safer pastures .
in his speech , kennedy expressed admiration for those who stayed on despite the city 's isolation .
" i want to say , on behalf of my countrymen , who live many miles away on the other side of the atlantic , who are far distant from you , that they take the greatest pride that they have been able to share with you , even from a distance , the story of the last 18 years .
i know of no town , no city , that has been besieged for 18 years that still lives with the vitality and the force and the hope and the determination of the city of west berlin . "
these words , uttered by the american president , had a soothing effect not only on the souls of beleaguered west berliners , but on the german post-war psyche as a whole .
many germans still felt a deep sense of guilt for the crimes they or their parents had committed - or at least had not prevented - during world war ii and the holocaust .
berliners were particularly receptive of the support kennedy expressed .
after all , when the wall went up in 1961 , many west germans were convinced the city was entirely lost to the communists .
" i was on vacation in west germany in the bavarian forest to the south of berlin , " longolius says .
" we were on a farm , and did n't have a radio .
so i did n't hear about the wall on that sunday .
i heard about it on tuesday , two days later , when our landlady - a farmer 's woman - asked me where i would go when my vacation was over .
and i said i would go home .
and she said to me : you ca n't do that any more because they 've cut west berlin off . "
when he toured west berlin , kennedy was accompanied by the then-mayor of berlin , willy brandt , and german chancellor konrad adenauer .
many berliners felt the chancellor and other west germans did not fully understand the importance of their city as a bulwark against communism , protecting the entire country against a soviet invasion .
" i said to myself : once the russians are berlin , they will be sitting on the rhine four weeks later , " says a woman , who has been a longtime resident of berlin .
" and i think that would have been the case .
the russians would simply have marched through .
once they had reached west berlin , they would have bulldozed the country - maybe not in four weeks , maybe a little later .
and they would not only have gone as far as the rhine , but even further .
that was the opinion of many people at the time . "
in the early 1960s , the cold war was at it 's peak .
not only was james bond fighting fictitious communist villains in the cinemas of the west .
the delivery of soviet nuclear medium-range missiles to cuba in 1962 had only just brought the world to the brink of a nuclear war .
communism as an ideology seemed like a viable and attractive alternative to capitalism for many intellectuals , even in the west .
john f. kennedy therefore used his speech in west berlin not only to boost the morale of the inhabitants there , but also to condemn communism as a politically , economically and morally inferior system everywhere in the world , with the berlin wall the most obvious and vivid demonstration of communism 's failures .
" there are many people in the world who really do n't understand , or say they do n't , what is the great issue between the free world and the communist world .
let them come to berlin .
there are some who say that communism is the wave of the future .
let them come to berlin .
and there are some who say in europe and elsewhere we can work with the communists .
let them come to berlin . "
an american legend according to alexander longolius , john f. kennedy became a mythical figure in germany and elsewhere because he was highly credible .
" he was not only an american president .
he was the leader of the west , " he says .
" the man who gave all of us hope , a perspective and a dream .
the united states at that time combined military , economic , cultural and moral leadership .
and there was no doubt in our mind that kennedy stood for all that . "
kennedy 's premature death at the hands of a gunman in dallas only a few months after holding his berlin speech temporarily plunged the city into depression and despair .
today , 40 years later , kennedy 's legacy lives on in germany 's collective memory - for example in school books , documentaries about the cold war and in an exhibition at the german national museum of contemporary history in bonn .
there , the most famous excerpt of kennedy 's speech is displayed on a television monitor , and there is a copy of the piece of paper john f. kennedy held in his hand when delivering his speech , complete with the lines " ich bin ein berliner " and " let them come to berlin " scrawled on it in his own hand-writing .
herman schäfer , a custodian at the museum , says the document still elicits a deep response today .
" the reaction of our visitors is very enthusiastic , still enthusiastic , even though this 40 years ago .
everybody - be it young or old people - have in mind that this is a quotation from john f. kennedy .
so they hear this quotation and then the look into the glass case and see with even more surprise that there is this little document with the phonetic transcription of john f. kennedy .
so there is still this enthusiasm about this quotation that -lrb- puts -rrb- so much emphasis on the german-american friendship during the 1960s . "
kennedy 's speech has been cited and used as a model by other politicians since 1963 .
shortly before the berlin wall came down in 1989 , u.s. president ronald reagan addressed soviet leader mikhail gorbachev from the same location , telling him the time was ripe for german reunification .
and when after the sept .
11. attacks on new york and washington , chancellor schröder pledged " unlimited " support to the us in its war on terrorism , he alluded to george w. bush ' famous predecessor .
" when the defense of berlin was at stake , john f. kennedy said - and you all know this famous sentence - ' i am a berliner ' , " schröder said .
" that was the expression of incredible solidarity .
today i believe that we have every reason - especially we germans - to return this solidarity by expressing our solidarity with the american people . "
strained relations however , following germany 's refusal to back the u.s.-led war on iraq , relations between the two countries reached a historic low .
many germans refused to believe that the ideals kennedy had upheld in berlin were being appropriately defended by bush .
because of the widespread rejection of the war , germans have been accused of anti-americanism .
but according to schäfer of the national museum in bonn , the us-german relationship has not been fundamentally impaired .
" it is still as strong as in former times and if we look to the development of our civilization , i personally think that the united states is something like the leading civilized nation of the world , " he says .
" and there are a lot of different developments which are already there - if we like them or not - and many of them i do not like , i would not agree with all developments which are under way in the u.s. they will come to our state , to our country , to europe soon or later .
but we have to decide individually if we want to adopt them . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.06.2003 eu farming policy set for major revamp großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's reformed agricultural policy is likely to mean change for many farms in europe .
european union agricultural ministers reached a deal thursday to overhaul the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- after years of deadlock , ending brussels ’ controversial policy of generous farm hand-outs . eu farming ministers meeting in luxembourg agreed on a comprehensive reform package for the 15-nation bloc ’ s agriculture policy on thursday after a marathon round of negotiations to thrash out the last details .
portugal was the only country to vote against the reform .
the move amounts to the most radical shake-up of the eu ’ s expensive 45-year-old cap , which critics have long argued undermines world trade and puts poor countries at a disadvantage .
the main thrust of the reforms is to cut back the eu ’ s program of huge direct subsidies to farmers , which account to about € 43 billion -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- a year - almost half the entire eu budget .
crop subsidies eliminated the chief architect of the reform plan , eu agricultural commissioner franz fischler , managed to largely salvage the cornerstone of his reform plan - namely breaking down the traditional link between subsidy and agricultural output , which has been blamed for offering an incentive to farmers to overproduce merely to get more cash from brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commissioner for agriculture , rural development and fisheries franz fischler fischler -lrb- photo -rrb- said the reforms would shape the future of european farming and end the practice of automatic farm handouts . " this decision marks the beginning of a new era .
our farm policy will fundamentally change.today , europe has given itself a new and effective farm policy , " he said .
the accord was hailed by leaders from several member countries .
" the agreement today delivers what we wanted - real change , " said britain 's agriculture minister , margaret beckett .
" it will give stability and security to farmers in the next decade , " said irish farm minister joe walsh .
german agricultural minister renate künast described the reform as a big success .
" with it we can finally break out of the old agricultural system , " she said .
in the future , subsidies from brussels will be distributed more evenly , rewarding farmers who switch to environmentally-friendly farming methods that promote increased food quality and improved rural management .
the european commission is also eager to end subsidies prior to 2004 when the agriculturally dependant economies of eastern europe join the eu .
critics feared that extending handouts to the new eu countries would only worsen the problem of over-production in europe .
agreement expected to revive trade talks the agreement on eu farm reforms is also seen as essential to kickstart the stalled doha round of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks .
fischler said the deal would boost the eu ’ s negotiating position in upcoming trade talks in mexico in september and appease the united states and japan , who had criticized the current system of eu farm hand-outs saying it violates wto rules .
" we ’ re also sending out a message to the world that we have a more trade-friendly policy .
we are saying goodbye to a policy that used to distort trade , " fischler told a news conference on thursday .
" we can go with our heads held high to cancun , " fischler said .
wto chief supachai panitchpakdi welcomed the deal .
" i see that this would have a positive effect on movement in areas , if not all areas of agriculture , " supachai said in geneva .
angry farmers despite the breakthrough on the reform package , fischler was forced to compromised on several elements of his original plan under heavy pressure from big farming nations such as france .
france , the largest beneficiary of eu farm aid , had strongly resisted decoupling farm aid from production subsidies .
in the latest deal , fischler compromised by abandoning his plan to cut minimum prices on key grains - including wheat , barley and maize and by allowing countries a high degree of flexibility over how it may apply decoupling rules for livestock .
but some french farmers were still dissatisfied .
" france has badly defended the interests of the cap and of french farmers , " jerome despey , head of france ’ s young farmers organization told radio france international .
likewise , farming unions in germany , one of the eu ’ s largest contributors to cap , were also dismayed by the deal .
the german farmers association -lrb- dbv -rrb- said farmers in that country would lose between € 1.2 and € 2 billion as a result of the cuts and warned that the decision would discourage further investment .
" this decision is a major burden for german and european farmers , " german farmers association president gerd sonnleitner told german public radio .
" it ’ s a typical eu compromise which gives and takes a little from everyone and creates terrible difficulties for those who have to implement it , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu farm reform proposals weakened in political power play german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would help france water down a radical reform of the european union ’ s common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
eu ministers will attempt to hammer out a deal next week . -lrb- june 13 , 2003 -rrb- a summer of discontent for eastern german farmers the eu 's plan to cut direct subsidies to large farms will hit eastern german farmers harder than those in any other region in europe .

european union agricultural ministers reached a deal thursday to overhaul the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- after years of deadlock , ending brussels ’ controversial policy of generous farm hand-outs . eu farming ministers meeting in luxembourg agreed on a comprehensive reform package for the 15-nation bloc ’ s agriculture policy on thursday after a marathon round of negotiations to thrash out the last details .
portugal was the only country to vote against the reform .
the move amounts to the most radical shake-up of the eu ’ s expensive 45-year-old cap , which critics have long argued undermines world trade and puts poor countries at a disadvantage .
the main thrust of the reforms is to cut back the eu ’ s program of huge direct subsidies to farmers , which account to about € 43 billion -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- a year - almost half the entire eu budget .
crop subsidies eliminated the chief architect of the reform plan , eu agricultural commissioner franz fischler , managed to largely salvage the cornerstone of his reform plan - namely breaking down the traditional link between subsidy and agricultural output , which has been blamed for offering an incentive to farmers to overproduce merely to get more cash from brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commissioner for agriculture , rural development and fisheries franz fischler fischler -lrb- photo -rrb- said the reforms would shape the future of european farming and end the practice of automatic farm handouts . " this decision marks the beginning of a new era .
our farm policy will fundamentally change.today , europe has given itself a new and effective farm policy , " he said .
the accord was hailed by leaders from several member countries .
" the agreement today delivers what we wanted - real change , " said britain 's agriculture minister , margaret beckett .
" it will give stability and security to farmers in the next decade , " said irish farm minister joe walsh .
german agricultural minister renate künast described the reform as a big success .
" with it we can finally break out of the old agricultural system , " she said .
in the future , subsidies from brussels will be distributed more evenly , rewarding farmers who switch to environmentally-friendly farming methods that promote increased food quality and improved rural management .
the european commission is also eager to end subsidies prior to 2004 when the agriculturally dependant economies of eastern europe join the eu .
critics feared that extending handouts to the new eu countries would only worsen the problem of over-production in europe .
agreement expected to revive trade talks the agreement on eu farm reforms is also seen as essential to kickstart the stalled doha round of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks .
fischler said the deal would boost the eu ’ s negotiating position in upcoming trade talks in mexico in september and appease the united states and japan , who had criticized the current system of eu farm hand-outs saying it violates wto rules .
" we ’ re also sending out a message to the world that we have a more trade-friendly policy .
we are saying goodbye to a policy that used to distort trade , " fischler told a news conference on thursday .
" we can go with our heads held high to cancun , " fischler said .
wto chief supachai panitchpakdi welcomed the deal .
" i see that this would have a positive effect on movement in areas , if not all areas of agriculture , " supachai said in geneva .
angry farmers despite the breakthrough on the reform package , fischler was forced to compromised on several elements of his original plan under heavy pressure from big farming nations such as france .
france , the largest beneficiary of eu farm aid , had strongly resisted decoupling farm aid from production subsidies .
in the latest deal , fischler compromised by abandoning his plan to cut minimum prices on key grains - including wheat , barley and maize and by allowing countries a high degree of flexibility over how it may apply decoupling rules for livestock .
but some french farmers were still dissatisfied .
" france has badly defended the interests of the cap and of french farmers , " jerome despey , head of france ’ s young farmers organization told radio france international .
likewise , farming unions in germany , one of the eu ’ s largest contributors to cap , were also dismayed by the deal .
the german farmers association -lrb- dbv -rrb- said farmers in that country would lose between € 1.2 and € 2 billion as a result of the cuts and warned that the decision would discourage further investment .
" this decision is a major burden for german and european farmers , " german farmers association president gerd sonnleitner told german public radio .
" it ’ s a typical eu compromise which gives and takes a little from everyone and creates terrible difficulties for those who have to implement it , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu farm reform proposals weakened in political power play german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would help france water down a radical reform of the european union ’ s common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
eu ministers will attempt to hammer out a deal next week . -lrb- june 13 , 2003 -rrb- a summer of discontent for eastern german farmers the eu 's plan to cut direct subsidies to large farms will hit eastern german farmers harder than those in any other region in europe .

the first eu-u.s. summit after the iraq war brought europeans and americans together once again and proved their ability to face up to common problems with combined powers .
good cooperation in the fight against terrorism plays a significant role here . new agreements in this sector not only stipulate joint investigative teams to uncover terrorist criminals , but also clarify the extradition of suspected terrorists to the united states .
in the case of the latter , the europeans do not need to fear that the suspects will be sentenced to death or tried before a military tribunal once they are on american soil . this agreement shows that both sides are capable of cooperating while respectfully recognizing the legal tradition of the other , together with its ethical-moral implications . working together for peace the common efforts to secure peace in the middle east follow a similar path .
though progression in this conflict is moving more slowly than in the fight against terrorism , new rays of hope have appeared on the horizon .
these involve efforts within the group know as the middle east quartet - made up of the united states , the eu , the united nations and russia - as well as the personal commitment by u.s. president george w. bush .
now , it is essential to withdraw the financial basis for the hamas movement 's activities , to press israel to reduce its settlements in the west bank and to use the signalized ceasefire by palestinian groups for a consequential implementation of the u.s. and eu-backed " road map " to peace . surprisingly , the transatlantic views on iran have conformed to each other relatively quickly .
the nuclear program of a nation blessed with rich energy sources is , in fact , cause for worry on all sides .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.06.2003 business briefs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troubled mannheimer insurance has stopped accepting new customers .
mannheimer woes seen troubling insurance industry ; deutsche bahn forced to offer competitor 's timetables ; economists see light at the end of the tunnel . mannheimer insolvency signals trouble for industry one of germany ’ s oldest insurance companies was left looking for a bailout plan on thursday after the german insurance industry association -lrb- gdv -rrb- announced that a last-minute rescue initiative to raise € 370 million -lrb- $ 426 million -rrb- from fellow insurers had failed .
the mannheimer lebensversicherung ag , which has been struggling to stay afloat following significant losses on the capital markets last year , turned to the gdv – a cooperation of 110 insurance companies - in the hopes of drumming up enough fresh cash to prevent it from being the first german insurer to go under in 50 years .
the gdv , however , could not convince the necessary 90 percent of its members to back the rescue plan .
it now looks as if mannheimer will become the first german insurer to seek help from protektor , the industry-backed safety net set up last year to protect policyholder ’ s investments in the event of an insurer ’ s insolvency .
but protektor so far only exists on paper , and with a start-up capital of just € 3.2 million put forth by 10 insurers , its rescue funds remain rather limited .
that ’ s not good news for the german government , which has been encouraging citizens to invest in equity-based life insurance plans rather than rely on state support for their retirement .
a perceived weakness in the insurance industry could cause the public to lose confidence in the whole concept .
deutsche bahn to provide timetables for connex the deutsche bahn , germany ’ s largest rail company , must include information from its competitor connex in its long-distance timetables , according to a new ruling by the berlin regional court on thursday .
from now on , the formerly state-owned bahn is required to provide route plans and times for connex via its internet and telephone services .

europe and the united states are slowly smoothing out their troubled relations originating from the iraq conflict .
but there are still enough problems between the two to spark future political disagreements . who would have imagined ?
the shattered transatlantic bond between the united states and the european union appears to be on its way out of its crisis .
the two sides may not be moving towards a hot love affair .
but a partnership of convenience is certain to result .
the first eu-u.s. summit after the iraq war brought europeans and americans together once again and proved their ability to face up to common problems with combined powers .
good cooperation in the fight against terrorism plays a significant role here . new agreements in this sector not only stipulate joint investigative teams to uncover terrorist criminals , but also clarify the extradition of suspected terrorists to the united states .
in the case of the latter , the europeans do not need to fear that the suspects will be sentenced to death or tried before a military tribunal once they are on american soil . this agreement shows that both sides are capable of cooperating while respectfully recognizing the legal tradition of the other , together with its ethical-moral implications . working together for peace the common efforts to secure peace in the middle east follow a similar path .
though progression in this conflict is moving more slowly than in the fight against terrorism , new rays of hope have appeared on the horizon .
these involve efforts within the group know as the middle east quartet - made up of the united states , the eu , the united nations and russia - as well as the personal commitment by u.s. president george w. bush .
now , it is essential to withdraw the financial basis for the hamas movement 's activities , to press israel to reduce its settlements in the west bank and to use the signalized ceasefire by palestinian groups for a consequential implementation of the u.s. and eu-backed " road map " to peace . surprisingly , the transatlantic views on iran have conformed to each other relatively quickly .
the nuclear program of a nation blessed with rich energy sources is , in fact , cause for worry on all sides .
but a military intervention by the u.s. similar to that in iraq is currently not under discussion .
and the eu can use its good economic relations to iran to increase pressure on the country 's ayatollahs . moving forward despite differences despite political synergies , the problems of transatlantic cooperation remain on the agenda even after this summit .
europe 's ban on importing genetically-modified food continues to be a thorn in washington 's side .
and europe views the u.s. 's continuous refusal to work with the international criminal court as somewhat paranoid .
here , the devil lies in the detail .
but even if this transatlantic bond represents a partnership of convenience , the willingness to solve problems is growing to such a degree that it can reinstate lost trust .
in this sense , the summit in washington has taken europe and the united states a good step forward . daniel scheschkewitz is deutsche welle 's washington correspondent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de transatlantic summit dominated by anti-terror talks the one-day transatlantic summit in washington meant to smooth over iraq-war tensions saw leaders making progress on anti-terror cooperation , even as the united states urged europe to cut off funding to hamas -lrb- june 25 , 2003 -rrb- .

mannheimer woes seen troubling insurance industry ; deutsche bahn forced to offer competitor 's timetables ; economists see light at the end of the tunnel . mannheimer insolvency signals trouble for industry one of germany ’ s oldest insurance companies was left looking for a bailout plan on thursday after the german insurance industry association -lrb- gdv -rrb- announced that a last-minute rescue initiative to raise € 370 million -lrb- $ 426 million -rrb- from fellow insurers had failed .
the mannheimer lebensversicherung ag , which has been struggling to stay afloat following significant losses on the capital markets last year , turned to the gdv – a cooperation of 110 insurance companies - in the hopes of drumming up enough fresh cash to prevent it from being the first german insurer to go under in 50 years .
the gdv , however , could not convince the necessary 90 percent of its members to back the rescue plan .
it now looks as if mannheimer will become the first german insurer to seek help from protektor , the industry-backed safety net set up last year to protect policyholder ’ s investments in the event of an insurer ’ s insolvency .
but protektor so far only exists on paper , and with a start-up capital of just € 3.2 million put forth by 10 insurers , its rescue funds remain rather limited .
that ’ s not good news for the german government , which has been encouraging citizens to invest in equity-based life insurance plans rather than rely on state support for their retirement .
a perceived weakness in the insurance industry could cause the public to lose confidence in the whole concept .
deutsche bahn to provide timetables for connex the deutsche bahn , germany ’ s largest rail company , must include information from its competitor connex in its long-distance timetables , according to a new ruling by the berlin regional court on thursday .
from now on , the formerly state-owned bahn is required to provide route plans and times for connex via its internet and telephone services .
the ruling came after months of failed negotiations and connex , a subsidiary of the french vivendi corporation , took the bahn to court claiming its monopoly over long-distance timetables reflected an unfair competition advantage .
the bahn rejected such arguments as unfounded .
but the german cartel office , which had warned the bahn of a possible investigation back in february , said the bahn ’ s refusal to provide information on prices and timetables for connex blocked efforts to open up the country ’ s rail system to more competitors .

in an interview with deutsche welle , he said security was still the country 's biggest problem . " afghanistan is a very violent place .
we ’ ve got to be careful and take as many precautions as possible .
there are still spoilers out there who do not want this peace process to succeed , " brahimi said in an interview with deutsche welle .
the united nations special envoy to afghanistan is in germany to receive a special peace prize from the federal state of hessen on thursday .
ahead of the award ceremony , he met with german foreign minister joschka fischer and defense minister peter struck .
during the meeting with the two german ministers , brahimi stressed how important the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- was to maintaining the peace in conflict-ridden afghanistan .
after nearly 25 years of war and civil strife , the country needs the international peacekeepers and the provincial reconstruction teams to restore security , rebuild the infrastructure and help the central government establish its authority outside kabul , brahimi said .
" the international troops , isaf , are needed now and they will be needed for some time .
how long is difficult to say .
my personal calculation is a couple of years before the afghan army and national police can provide security for the people of afghanistan , especially in kabul .
i think it will take one or two years . "
limited influence one of the main problems facing reconstruction efforts in afghanistan is the limited reach of the central government under president hamid karsai , whose position , although recognized and respected in the provinces , has hardly any influence over the warlords and militias who still control considerable areas of the country .
brahimi said this was understandable in a state that has been completely destroyed .
" we are in a process of rebuilding the state machinery .
there are no roads , no telephones , no lines of communication .
that is why it is so difficult to project the influence of the central government in the country , " brahimi explained .
" the government is limited in its resources , but it is recognized in the provinces , " he said , " and therefore what is required is to help the government rebuild the state , not only in kabul , but in the provinces . "
" the best way of doing this , " brahimi stressed , " is to extend isaf outside the capital . "
extending the isaf mandate but the issue of extending the commitment of international peacekeepers in afghanistan is still a matter of discussion .
the isaf , which will be operated under dutch-german command until august , is currently restricted to the afghan capital kabul , but the united states and u.n. secretary general kofi annan have requested that troops also be sent to the provinces to protect civilian workers who are helping rebuild the country .
in berlin , the question of extending the isaf mandate beyond kabul has been met with a good deal of opposition following a june 7 bombing in the capital city that killed four german soldiers .
germany , which supplies the largest troop contingent in the international force , has been hesitant to commit more soldiers and extend their area of operation until the security situation in the provinces improves .
the german parliament in not scheduled to vote on an extension of the mandate until september .
brahimi said he respects the german government ’ s deliberations in light of the recent terrorist attack , but at the same time he expressed hope that germany would not rule against extending the security forces outside kabul .
" i think we would be sorry if that was the decision of the federal republic of germany , " he told deutsche welle .
the isaf is still developing , brahimi explained , " but it promises to be helpful for the progress of the peace process , for the training of the afghan police and the army . "
he added that not expanding isaf ’ s mandate beyond kabul would hinder the security and reconstruction efforts in the provinces and prolong the instability in the country .
" afghanistan is certainly in some parts still a dangerous place , " brahimi conceded , " but i think in the places -lsb- the german government -rsb- is contemplating , we don ’ t see many problems for the german soldiers if they were there . "
" of course we must be careful , " he continued while pointing out that the united nations itself has been sending unarmed civilians into the provinces for quite some time .
brahimi admitted , though , that security was a serious problem for u.n. reconstruction workers who are not able to access certain regions in the south and east and can only enter other regions with bodyguards .
the road to democracy according to brahimi , it will take some time before afghanistan is in a position to provide its own effective security .
he estimated that by september the national police and army are expected to have trained about 6,000 people , but it will be at least another year before the central government will have built up enough of a security force to make a substantial difference .
building a democratic state takes time , brahimi emphasized .
it is a slow and difficult process .
nonetheless , he expects that afghanistan will have a constitution in the near future .
" the constitution work has started and it is going reasonably well .
barring any unforeseen difficulties , we hope the country will have a new constitution by october , " he stated .
elections , on the other hand , are more difficult .
the u.n. envoy described them as a logistical nightmare .
" we have to register people all over the country , in every village .
and we have to go there ourselves , because they will not come to us , especially the women .
that means we have to recruit thousands of people , and it will cost a lot of money . "
but he believes elections can take place as early as october 2004 , if the security situation in the countryside allows for it , brahimi added .
waning interest in afghanistan ?
when asked if international interest in afghanistan was fading and whether or not money from western donor countries was drying up , brahimi responded that there is always the fear of donor fatigue and competition with the attraction of other international crisis situations .
" probably the attention has diminished a little bit , " he said , " but i think there ’ s still a reasonable amount of interest and support for what is happening in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.06.2003 kennedy still a ' berliner ' after all these years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john f. kennedy : " ich bin ein berliner " thursday marks the 40th anniversary of u.s. president john f. kennedy 's famous " ich bin ein berliner " speech .
his words still resound today in berlin , even 12 years after reunification . " two thousand years ago the proudest boast was " civis romanus sum . "
today , in the world of freedom , the proudest boast is " ich bin ein berliner . "
when united states president john f. kennedy made the famous statement " ich bin ein berliner " – -lrb- i am a berliner -rrb- - in front of the city hall of west berlin on june 26 , 1963 , he uttered words that went straight to the hearts of the citizens of berlin .
he insinuated that they were - just like the citizens of rome in earlier times - free people , with an unalienable right to freedom and the right to be protected by the rest of the free world .
it was a rousing speech that quite possibly turned the tide in favor of holding on to berlin as an isolated outpost in communist east germany at a time when it was in very real danger of falling to the communist german democratic republic .
" this was a very intense feeling of closeness , " recalls alexander longolius , a member of west germany 's city council in 1963 and later director of the checkpoint charlie foundation .
" if the americans had turned away from us , if that speech had told us we were leaving the city , then it would have been dramatic .
i remember that i went home and told my wife -lrb- ... -rrb- that our worries are over and everything would be good . "
a divided city from the end of world war ii in 1945 until the beginning of german reunification in 1989 , germany as a whole , and berlin as a city , was divided by the cold war a state of open confrontation between the communist bloc and the nato alliance .
in august 1961 , the soviets erected the berlin wall to stop the mass exodus of people fleeing soviet east berlin for west berlin and the non-communist world , thus sealing west berlin behind a 12-foot wall for some 28 years .
two years after this , kennedy gave his historic speech , which still finds incredible resonance here 40 years later .
in 1963 , west berlin was militarily protected by and partly governed by american , french and british forces .
the largest military contingent was american , and faced off a sizeable soviet contingent on the other side of the wall .
many people - and companies - had left the divided city for greener and safer pastures .
in his speech , kennedy expressed admiration for those who stayed on despite the city 's isolation .
" i want to say , on behalf of my countrymen , who live many miles away on the other side of the atlantic , who are far distant from you , that they take the greatest pride that they have been able to share with you , even from a distance , the story of the last 18 years .
i know of no town , no city , that has been besieged for 18 years that still lives with the vitality and the force and the hope and the determination of the city of west berlin . "
these words , uttered by the american president , had a soothing effect not only on the souls of beleaguered west berliners , but on the german post-war psyche as a whole .
many germans still felt a deep sense of guilt for the crimes they or their parents had committed - or at least had not prevented - during world war ii and the holocaust .
berliners were particularly receptive of the support kennedy expressed .
after all , when the wall went up in 1961 , many west germans were convinced the city was entirely lost to the communists .
" i was on vacation in west germany in the bavarian forest to the south of berlin , " longolius says .
" we were on a farm , and did n't have a radio .
so i did n't hear about the wall on that sunday .
i heard about it on tuesday , two days later , when our landlady - a farmer 's woman - asked me where i would go when my vacation was over .
and i said i would go home .
and she said to me : you ca n't do that any more because they 've cut west berlin off . "
when he toured west berlin , kennedy was accompanied by the then-mayor of berlin , willy brandt , and german chancellor konrad adenauer .
many berliners felt the chancellor and other west germans did not fully understand the importance of their city as a bulwark against communism , protecting the entire country against a soviet invasion .
" i said to myself : once the russians are berlin , they will be sitting on the rhine four weeks later , " says a woman , who has been a longtime resident of berlin .
" and i think that would have been the case .
the russians would simply have marched through .
once they had reached west berlin , they would have bulldozed the country - maybe not in four weeks , maybe a little later .
and they would not only have gone as far as the rhine , but even further .
that was the opinion of many people at the time . "
in the early 1960s , the cold war was at it 's peak .
not only was james bond fighting fictitious communist villains in the cinemas of the west .
the delivery of soviet nuclear medium-range missiles to cuba in 1962 had only just brought the world to the brink of a nuclear war .
communism as an ideology seemed like a viable and attractive alternative to capitalism for many intellectuals , even in the west .
john f. kennedy therefore used his speech in west berlin not only to boost the morale of the inhabitants there , but also to condemn communism as a politically , economically and morally inferior system everywhere in the world , with the berlin wall the most obvious and vivid demonstration of communism 's failures .
" there are many people in the world who really do n't understand , or say they do n't , what is the great issue between the free world and the communist world .
let them come to berlin .
there are some who say that communism is the wave of the future .
let them come to berlin .
and there are some who say in europe and elsewhere we can work with the communists .
let them come to berlin . "
an american legend according to alexander longolius , john f. kennedy became a mythical figure in germany and elsewhere because he was highly credible .
" he was not only an american president .
he was the leader of the west , " he says .
" the man who gave all of us hope , a perspective and a dream .
the united states at that time combined military , economic , cultural and moral leadership .
and there was no doubt in our mind that kennedy stood for all that . "
kennedy 's premature death at the hands of a gunman in dallas only a few months after holding his berlin speech temporarily plunged the city into depression and despair .
today , 40 years later , kennedy 's legacy lives on in germany 's collective memory - for example in school books , documentaries about the cold war and in an exhibition at the german national museum of contemporary history in bonn .
there , the most famous excerpt of kennedy 's speech is displayed on a television monitor , and there is a copy of the piece of paper john f. kennedy held in his hand when delivering his speech , complete with the lines " ich bin ein berliner " and " let them come to berlin " scrawled on it in his own hand-writing .
herman schäfer , a custodian at the museum , says the document still elicits a deep response today .
" the reaction of our visitors is very enthusiastic , still enthusiastic , even though this 40 years ago .
everybody - be it young or old people - have in mind that this is a quotation from john f. kennedy .
so they hear this quotation and then the look into the glass case and see with even more surprise that there is this little document with the phonetic transcription of john f. kennedy .
so there is still this enthusiasm about this quotation that -lrb- puts -rrb- so much emphasis on the german-american friendship during the 1960s . "
kennedy 's speech has been cited and used as a model by other politicians since 1963 .
shortly before the berlin wall came down in 1989 , u.s. president ronald reagan addressed soviet leader mikhail gorbachev from the same location , telling him the time was ripe for german reunification .
and when after the sept .
11. attacks on new york and washington , chancellor schröder pledged " unlimited " support to the us in its war on terrorism , he alluded to george w. bush ' famous predecessor .
" when the defense of berlin was at stake , john f. kennedy said - and you all know this famous sentence - ' i am a berliner ' , " schröder said .
" that was the expression of incredible solidarity .
today i believe that we have every reason - especially we germans - to return this solidarity by expressing our solidarity with the american people . "
strained relations however , following germany 's refusal to back the u.s.-led war on iraq , relations between the two countries reached a historic low .
many germans refused to believe that the ideals kennedy had upheld in berlin were being appropriately defended by bush .
because of the widespread rejection of the war , germans have been accused of anti-americanism .
but according to schäfer of the national museum in bonn , the us-german relationship has not been fundamentally impaired .
" it is still as strong as in former times and if we look to the development of our civilization , i personally think that the united states is something like the leading civilized nation of the world , " he says .
" and there are a lot of different developments which are already there - if we like them or not - and many of them i do not like , i would not agree with all developments which are under way in the u.s. they will come to our state , to our country , to europe soon or later .

mannheimer woes seen troubling insurance industry ; deutsche bahn forced to offer competitor 's timetables ; economists see light at the end of the tunnel . mannheimer insolvency signals trouble for industry one of germany ’ s oldest insurance companies was left looking for a bailout plan on thursday after the german insurance industry association -lrb- gdv -rrb- announced that a last-minute rescue initiative to raise € 370 million -lrb- $ 426 million -rrb- from fellow insurers had failed .
the mannheimer lebensversicherung ag , which has been struggling to stay afloat following significant losses on the capital markets last year , turned to the gdv – a cooperation of 110 insurance companies - in the hopes of drumming up enough fresh cash to prevent it from being the first german insurer to go under in 50 years .
the gdv , however , could not convince the necessary 90 percent of its members to back the rescue plan .
it now looks as if mannheimer will become the first german insurer to seek help from protektor , the industry-backed safety net set up last year to protect policyholder ’ s investments in the event of an insurer ’ s insolvency .
but protektor so far only exists on paper , and with a start-up capital of just € 3.2 million put forth by 10 insurers , its rescue funds remain rather limited .
that ’ s not good news for the german government , which has been encouraging citizens to invest in equity-based life insurance plans rather than rely on state support for their retirement .

deutsche bahn to provide timetables for connex the deutsche bahn , germany ’ s largest rail company , must include information from its competitor connex in its long-distance timetables , according to a new ruling by the berlin regional court on thursday .

europe and the united states are slowly smoothing out their troubled relations originating from the iraq conflict .
but there are still enough problems between the two to spark future political disagreements . who would have imagined ?
the shattered transatlantic bond between the united states and the european union appears to be on its way out of its crisis .
the two sides may not be moving towards a hot love affair .
but a partnership of convenience is certain to result .
the first eu-u.s. summit after the iraq war brought europeans and americans together once again and proved their ability to face up to common problems with combined powers .
good cooperation in the fight against terrorism plays a significant role here . new agreements in this sector not only stipulate joint investigative teams to uncover terrorist criminals , but also clarify the extradition of suspected terrorists to the united states .
in the case of the latter , the europeans do not need to fear that the suspects will be sentenced to death or tried before a military tribunal once they are on american soil . this agreement shows that both sides are capable of cooperating while respectfully recognizing the legal tradition of the other , together with its ethical-moral implications . working together for peace the common efforts to secure peace in the middle east follow a similar path .
though progression in this conflict is moving more slowly than in the fight against terrorism , new rays of hope have appeared on the horizon .
these involve efforts within the group know as the middle east quartet - made up of the united states , the eu , the united nations and russia - as well as the personal commitment by u.s. president george w. bush .
now , it is essential to withdraw the financial basis for the hamas movement 's activities , to press israel to reduce its settlements in the west bank and to use the signalized ceasefire by palestinian groups for a consequential implementation of the u.s. and eu-backed " road map " to peace . surprisingly , the transatlantic views on iran have conformed to each other relatively quickly .
the nuclear program of a nation blessed with rich energy sources is , in fact , cause for worry on all sides .
but a military intervention by the u.s. similar to that in iraq is currently not under discussion .
and the eu can use its good economic relations to iran to increase pressure on the country 's ayatollahs . moving forward despite differences despite political synergies , the problems of transatlantic cooperation remain on the agenda even after this summit .
europe 's ban on importing genetically-modified food continues to be a thorn in washington 's side .
and europe views the u.s. 's continuous refusal to work with the international criminal court as somewhat paranoid .
here , the devil lies in the detail .
but even if this transatlantic bond represents a partnership of convenience , the willingness to solve problems is growing to such a degree that it can reinstate lost trust .
in this sense , the summit in washington has taken europe and the united states a good step forward . daniel scheschkewitz is deutsche welle 's washington correspondent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de transatlantic summit dominated by anti-terror talks the one-day transatlantic summit in washington meant to smooth over iraq-war tensions saw leaders making progress on anti-terror cooperation , even as the united states urged europe to cut off funding to hamas -lrb- june 25 , 2003 -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.06.2003 eu farming policy set for major revamp großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's reformed agricultural policy is likely to mean change for many farms in europe .
european union agricultural ministers reached a deal thursday to overhaul the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- after years of deadlock , ending brussels ’ controversial policy of generous farm hand-outs . eu farming ministers meeting in luxembourg agreed on a comprehensive reform package for the 15-nation bloc ’ s agriculture policy on thursday after a marathon round of negotiations to thrash out the last details .
portugal was the only country to vote against the reform .
the move amounts to the most radical shake-up of the eu ’ s expensive 45-year-old cap , which critics have long argued undermines world trade and puts poor countries at a disadvantage .
the main thrust of the reforms is to cut back the eu ’ s program of huge direct subsidies to farmers , which account to about € 43 billion -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- a year - almost half the entire eu budget .
crop subsidies eliminated the chief architect of the reform plan , eu agricultural commissioner franz fischler , managed to largely salvage the cornerstone of his reform plan - namely breaking down the traditional link between subsidy and agricultural output , which has been blamed for offering an incentive to farmers to overproduce merely to get more cash from brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commissioner for agriculture , rural development and fisheries franz fischler fischler -lrb- photo -rrb- said the reforms would shape the future of european farming and end the practice of automatic farm handouts . " this decision marks the beginning of a new era .
our farm policy will fundamentally change.today , europe has given itself a new and effective farm policy , " he said .
the accord was hailed by leaders from several member countries .
" the agreement today delivers what we wanted - real change , " said britain 's agriculture minister , margaret beckett .
" it will give stability and security to farmers in the next decade , " said irish farm minister joe walsh .
german agricultural minister renate künast described the reform as a big success .
" with it we can finally break out of the old agricultural system , " she said .
in the future , subsidies from brussels will be distributed more evenly , rewarding farmers who switch to environmentally-friendly farming methods that promote increased food quality and improved rural management .
the european commission is also eager to end subsidies prior to 2004 when the agriculturally dependant economies of eastern europe join the eu .
critics feared that extending handouts to the new eu countries would only worsen the problem of over-production in europe .
agreement expected to revive trade talks the agreement on eu farm reforms is also seen as essential to kickstart the stalled doha round of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks .
fischler said the deal would boost the eu ’ s negotiating position in upcoming trade talks in mexico in september and appease the united states and japan , who had criticized the current system of eu farm hand-outs saying it violates wto rules .
" we ’ re also sending out a message to the world that we have a more trade-friendly policy .
we are saying goodbye to a policy that used to distort trade , " fischler told a news conference on thursday .
" we can go with our heads held high to cancun , " fischler said .
wto chief supachai panitchpakdi welcomed the deal .
" i see that this would have a positive effect on movement in areas , if not all areas of agriculture , " supachai said in geneva .
angry farmers despite the breakthrough on the reform package , fischler was forced to compromised on several elements of his original plan under heavy pressure from big farming nations such as france .
france , the largest beneficiary of eu farm aid , had strongly resisted decoupling farm aid from production subsidies .
in the latest deal , fischler compromised by abandoning his plan to cut minimum prices on key grains - including wheat , barley and maize and by allowing countries a high degree of flexibility over how it may apply decoupling rules for livestock .
but some french farmers were still dissatisfied .
" france has badly defended the interests of the cap and of french farmers , " jerome despey , head of france ’ s young farmers organization told radio france international .
likewise , farming unions in germany , one of the eu ’ s largest contributors to cap , were also dismayed by the deal .
the german farmers association -lrb- dbv -rrb- said farmers in that country would lose between € 1.2 and € 2 billion as a result of the cuts and warned that the decision would discourage further investment .
" this decision is a major burden for german and european farmers , " german farmers association president gerd sonnleitner told german public radio .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.06.2003 kennedy still a ' berliner ' after all these years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john f. kennedy : " ich bin ein berliner " thursday marks the 40th anniversary of u.s. president john f. kennedy 's famous " ich bin ein berliner " speech .
his words still resound today in berlin , even 12 years after reunification . " two thousand years ago the proudest boast was " civis romanus sum . "
today , in the world of freedom , the proudest boast is " ich bin ein berliner . "
when united states president john f. kennedy made the famous statement " ich bin ein berliner " – -lrb- i am a berliner -rrb- - in front of the city hall of west berlin on june 26 , 1963 , he uttered words that went straight to the hearts of the citizens of berlin .
he insinuated that they were - just like the citizens of rome in earlier times - free people , with an unalienable right to freedom and the right to be protected by the rest of the free world .
it was a rousing speech that quite possibly turned the tide in favor of holding on to berlin as an isolated outpost in communist east germany at a time when it was in very real danger of falling to the communist german democratic republic .
" this was a very intense feeling of closeness , " recalls alexander longolius , a member of west germany 's city council in 1963 and later director of the checkpoint charlie foundation .
" if the americans had turned away from us , if that speech had told us we were leaving the city , then it would have been dramatic .
i remember that i went home and told my wife -lrb- ... -rrb- that our worries are over and everything would be good . "
a divided city from the end of world war ii in 1945 until the beginning of german reunification in 1989 , germany as a whole , and berlin as a city , was divided by the cold war a state of open confrontation between the communist bloc and the nato alliance .
in august 1961 , the soviets erected the berlin wall to stop the mass exodus of people fleeing soviet east berlin for west berlin and the non-communist world , thus sealing west berlin behind a 12-foot wall for some 28 years .
two years after this , kennedy gave his historic speech , which still finds incredible resonance here 40 years later .
in 1963 , west berlin was militarily protected by and partly governed by american , french and british forces .
the largest military contingent was american , and faced off a sizeable soviet contingent on the other side of the wall .
many people - and companies - had left the divided city for greener and safer pastures .
in his speech , kennedy expressed admiration for those who stayed on despite the city 's isolation .
" i want to say , on behalf of my countrymen , who live many miles away on the other side of the atlantic , who are far distant from you , that they take the greatest pride that they have been able to share with you , even from a distance , the story of the last 18 years .
i know of no town , no city , that has been besieged for 18 years that still lives with the vitality and the force and the hope and the determination of the city of west berlin . "
these words , uttered by the american president , had a soothing effect not only on the souls of beleaguered west berliners , but on the german post-war psyche as a whole .
many germans still felt a deep sense of guilt for the crimes they or their parents had committed - or at least had not prevented - during world war ii and the holocaust .
berliners were particularly receptive of the support kennedy expressed .
after all , when the wall went up in 1961 , many west germans were convinced the city was entirely lost to the communists .
" i was on vacation in west germany in the bavarian forest to the south of berlin , " longolius says .
" we were on a farm , and did n't have a radio .
so i did n't hear about the wall on that sunday .
i heard about it on tuesday , two days later , when our landlady - a farmer 's woman - asked me where i would go when my vacation was over .
and i said i would go home .
and she said to me : you ca n't do that any more because they 've cut west berlin off . "
when he toured west berlin , kennedy was accompanied by the then-mayor of berlin , willy brandt , and german chancellor konrad adenauer .
many berliners felt the chancellor and other west germans did not fully understand the importance of their city as a bulwark against communism , protecting the entire country against a soviet invasion .
" i said to myself : once the russians are berlin , they will be sitting on the rhine four weeks later , " says a woman , who has been a longtime resident of berlin .
" and i think that would have been the case .
the russians would simply have marched through .
once they had reached west berlin , they would have bulldozed the country - maybe not in four weeks , maybe a little later .
and they would not only have gone as far as the rhine , but even further .
that was the opinion of many people at the time . "
in the early 1960s , the cold war was at it 's peak .
not only was james bond fighting fictitious communist villains in the cinemas of the west .
the delivery of soviet nuclear medium-range missiles to cuba in 1962 had only just brought the world to the brink of a nuclear war .
communism as an ideology seemed like a viable and attractive alternative to capitalism for many intellectuals , even in the west .
john f. kennedy therefore used his speech in west berlin not only to boost the morale of the inhabitants there , but also to condemn communism as a politically , economically and morally inferior system everywhere in the world , with the berlin wall the most obvious and vivid demonstration of communism 's failures .
" there are many people in the world who really do n't understand , or say they do n't , what is the great issue between the free world and the communist world .
let them come to berlin .
there are some who say that communism is the wave of the future .
let them come to berlin .
and there are some who say in europe and elsewhere we can work with the communists .
let them come to berlin . "
an american legend according to alexander longolius , john f. kennedy became a mythical figure in germany and elsewhere because he was highly credible .
" he was not only an american president .
he was the leader of the west , " he says .
" the man who gave all of us hope , a perspective and a dream .
the united states at that time combined military , economic , cultural and moral leadership .
and there was no doubt in our mind that kennedy stood for all that . "
kennedy 's premature death at the hands of a gunman in dallas only a few months after holding his berlin speech temporarily plunged the city into depression and despair .
today , 40 years later , kennedy 's legacy lives on in germany 's collective memory - for example in school books , documentaries about the cold war and in an exhibition at the german national museum of contemporary history in bonn .
there , the most famous excerpt of kennedy 's speech is displayed on a television monitor , and there is a copy of the piece of paper john f. kennedy held in his hand when delivering his speech , complete with the lines " ich bin ein berliner " and " let them come to berlin " scrawled on it in his own hand-writing .
herman schäfer , a custodian at the museum , says the document still elicits a deep response today .
" the reaction of our visitors is very enthusiastic , still enthusiastic , even though this 40 years ago .
everybody - be it young or old people - have in mind that this is a quotation from john f. kennedy .
so they hear this quotation and then the look into the glass case and see with even more surprise that there is this little document with the phonetic transcription of john f. kennedy .
so there is still this enthusiasm about this quotation that -lrb- puts -rrb- so much emphasis on the german-american friendship during the 1960s . "
kennedy 's speech has been cited and used as a model by other politicians since 1963 .
shortly before the berlin wall came down in 1989 , u.s. president ronald reagan addressed soviet leader mikhail gorbachev from the same location , telling him the time was ripe for german reunification .
and when after the sept .
11. attacks on new york and washington , chancellor schröder pledged " unlimited " support to the us in its war on terrorism , he alluded to george w. bush ' famous predecessor .
" when the defense of berlin was at stake , john f. kennedy said - and you all know this famous sentence - ' i am a berliner ' , " schröder said .
" that was the expression of incredible solidarity .
today i believe that we have every reason - especially we germans - to return this solidarity by expressing our solidarity with the american people . "
strained relations however , following germany 's refusal to back the u.s.-led war on iraq , relations between the two countries reached a historic low .
many germans refused to believe that the ideals kennedy had upheld in berlin were being appropriately defended by bush .
because of the widespread rejection of the war , germans have been accused of anti-americanism .
but according to schäfer of the national museum in bonn , the us-german relationship has not been fundamentally impaired .
" it is still as strong as in former times and if we look to the development of our civilization , i personally think that the united states is something like the leading civilized nation of the world , " he says .
" and there are a lot of different developments which are already there - if we like them or not - and many of them i do not like , i would not agree with all developments which are under way in the u.s. they will come to our state , to our country , to europe soon or later .
but we have to decide individually if we want to adopt them . "
editor 's note : john f. kennedy 's historic visit to berlin in 1963 is also the subject of a new exhibit at the german historical museum in berlin , which will be displaying 400 artifacts from the life of the former president through oct .

in an interview with deutsche welle , he said security was still the country 's biggest problem . " afghanistan is a very violent place .
we ’ ve got to be careful and take as many precautions as possible .
there are still spoilers out there who do not want this peace process to succeed , " brahimi said in an interview with deutsche welle .
the united nations special envoy to afghanistan is in germany to receive a special peace prize from the federal state of hessen on thursday .
ahead of the award ceremony , he met with german foreign minister joschka fischer and defense minister peter struck .
during the meeting with the two german ministers , brahimi stressed how important the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- was to maintaining the peace in conflict-ridden afghanistan .
after nearly 25 years of war and civil strife , the country needs the international peacekeepers and the provincial reconstruction teams to restore security , rebuild the infrastructure and help the central government establish its authority outside kabul , brahimi said .
" the international troops , isaf , are needed now and they will be needed for some time .
how long is difficult to say .
my personal calculation is a couple of years before the afghan army and national police can provide security for the people of afghanistan , especially in kabul .
i think it will take one or two years . "
limited influence one of the main problems facing reconstruction efforts in afghanistan is the limited reach of the central government under president hamid karsai , whose position , although recognized and respected in the provinces , has hardly any influence over the warlords and militias who still control considerable areas of the country .
brahimi said this was understandable in a state that has been completely destroyed .
" we are in a process of rebuilding the state machinery .
there are no roads , no telephones , no lines of communication .
that is why it is so difficult to project the influence of the central government in the country , " brahimi explained .
" the government is limited in its resources , but it is recognized in the provinces , " he said , " and therefore what is required is to help the government rebuild the state , not only in kabul , but in the provinces . "
" the best way of doing this , " brahimi stressed , " is to extend isaf outside the capital . "
extending the isaf mandate but the issue of extending the commitment of international peacekeepers in afghanistan is still a matter of discussion .
the isaf , which will be operated under dutch-german command until august , is currently restricted to the afghan capital kabul , but the united states and u.n. secretary general kofi annan have requested that troops also be sent to the provinces to protect civilian workers who are helping rebuild the country .
in berlin , the question of extending the isaf mandate beyond kabul has been met with a good deal of opposition following a june 7 bombing in the capital city that killed four german soldiers .
germany , which supplies the largest troop contingent in the international force , has been hesitant to commit more soldiers and extend their area of operation until the security situation in the provinces improves .
the german parliament in not scheduled to vote on an extension of the mandate until september .
brahimi said he respects the german government ’ s deliberations in light of the recent terrorist attack , but at the same time he expressed hope that germany would not rule against extending the security forces outside kabul .
" i think we would be sorry if that was the decision of the federal republic of germany , " he told deutsche welle .
the isaf is still developing , brahimi explained , " but it promises to be helpful for the progress of the peace process , for the training of the afghan police and the army . "
he added that not expanding isaf ’ s mandate beyond kabul would hinder the security and reconstruction efforts in the provinces and prolong the instability in the country .
" afghanistan is certainly in some parts still a dangerous place , " brahimi conceded , " but i think in the places -lsb- the german government -rsb- is contemplating , we don ’ t see many problems for the german soldiers if they were there . "
" of course we must be careful , " he continued while pointing out that the united nations itself has been sending unarmed civilians into the provinces for quite some time .
brahimi admitted , though , that security was a serious problem for u.n. reconstruction workers who are not able to access certain regions in the south and east and can only enter other regions with bodyguards .
the road to democracy according to brahimi , it will take some time before afghanistan is in a position to provide its own effective security .
he estimated that by september the national police and army are expected to have trained about 6,000 people , but it will be at least another year before the central government will have built up enough of a security force to make a substantial difference .
building a democratic state takes time , brahimi emphasized .
it is a slow and difficult process .
nonetheless , he expects that afghanistan will have a constitution in the near future .
" the constitution work has started and it is going reasonably well .
barring any unforeseen difficulties , we hope the country will have a new constitution by october , " he stated .
elections , on the other hand , are more difficult .
the u.n. envoy described them as a logistical nightmare .
" we have to register people all over the country , in every village .
and we have to go there ourselves , because they will not come to us , especially the women .
that means we have to recruit thousands of people , and it will cost a lot of money . "
but he believes elections can take place as early as october 2004 , if the security situation in the countryside allows for it , brahimi added .
waning interest in afghanistan ?
when asked if international interest in afghanistan was fading and whether or not money from western donor countries was drying up , brahimi responded that there is always the fear of donor fatigue and competition with the attraction of other international crisis situations .
" probably the attention has diminished a little bit , " he said , " but i think there ’ s still a reasonable amount of interest and support for what is happening in afghanistan .

mannheimer woes seen troubling insurance industry ; deutsche bahn forced to offer competitor 's timetables ; economists see light at the end of the tunnel . mannheimer insolvency signals trouble for industry one of germany ’ s oldest insurance companies was left looking for a bailout plan on thursday after the german insurance industry association -lrb- gdv -rrb- announced that a last-minute rescue initiative to raise € 370 million -lrb- $ 426 million -rrb- from fellow insurers had failed .
the mannheimer lebensversicherung ag , which has been struggling to stay afloat following significant losses on the capital markets last year , turned to the gdv – a cooperation of 110 insurance companies - in the hopes of drumming up enough fresh cash to prevent it from being the first german insurer to go under in 50 years .
the gdv , however , could not convince the necessary 90 percent of its members to back the rescue plan .
it now looks as if mannheimer will become the first german insurer to seek help from protektor , the industry-backed safety net set up last year to protect policyholder ’ s investments in the event of an insurer ’ s insolvency .
but protektor so far only exists on paper , and with a start-up capital of just € 3.2 million put forth by 10 insurers , its rescue funds remain rather limited .
that ’ s not good news for the german government , which has been encouraging citizens to invest in equity-based life insurance plans rather than rely on state support for their retirement .
a perceived weakness in the insurance industry could cause the public to lose confidence in the whole concept .
deutsche bahn to provide timetables for connex the deutsche bahn , germany ’ s largest rail company , must include information from its competitor connex in its long-distance timetables , according to a new ruling by the berlin regional court on thursday .
from now on , the formerly state-owned bahn is required to provide route plans and times for connex via its internet and telephone services .
the ruling came after months of failed negotiations and connex , a subsidiary of the french vivendi corporation , took the bahn to court claiming its monopoly over long-distance timetables reflected an unfair competition advantage .
the bahn rejected such arguments as unfounded .
but the german cartel office , which had warned the bahn of a possible investigation back in february , said the bahn ’ s refusal to provide information on prices and timetables for connex blocked efforts to open up the country ’ s rail system to more competitors .
connex , with its three routes , including the newly-opened cologne-rostock stretch , is the deutsche bahn ’ s only competitor in long-distance train travel .
economy seen rebounding after all the bad news about germany ’ s economy , from rumors of deflation to signs of a recession , it now looks as if there might be light at the end of the tunnel .
six of the leading german economic research institutes said there are signs that the economy will improve by the end of the year .
according to a survey of the institutes ’ directors published in the berliner zeitung newspaper on thursday , the majority of the experts are convinced the country will experience considerable economic growth in the coming year .
they cited the government ’ s plans to reform health care and the pension plan as well as its steps to bring forward a tax cut as the source of the renewed optimism .
the director of the institute for economic research -lrb- iwh -rrb- in halle , rüdiger pohl , was quoted as saying , " the reform agenda is being pushed through with momentum .
everyone is noticing that germany is serious about its efforts to revitalize the economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.06.2003 eu farming policy set for major revamp großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's reformed agricultural policy is likely to mean change for many farms in europe .
european union agricultural ministers reached a deal thursday to overhaul the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- after years of deadlock , ending brussels ’ controversial policy of generous farm hand-outs . eu farming ministers meeting in luxembourg agreed on a comprehensive reform package for the 15-nation bloc ’ s agriculture policy on thursday after a marathon round of negotiations to thrash out the last details .
portugal was the only country to vote against the reform .
the move amounts to the most radical shake-up of the eu ’ s expensive 45-year-old cap , which critics have long argued undermines world trade and puts poor countries at a disadvantage .
the main thrust of the reforms is to cut back the eu ’ s program of huge direct subsidies to farmers , which account to about € 43 billion -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- a year - almost half the entire eu budget .
crop subsidies eliminated the chief architect of the reform plan , eu agricultural commissioner franz fischler , managed to largely salvage the cornerstone of his reform plan - namely breaking down the traditional link between subsidy and agricultural output , which has been blamed for offering an incentive to farmers to overproduce merely to get more cash from brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commissioner for agriculture , rural development and fisheries franz fischler fischler -lrb- photo -rrb- said the reforms would shape the future of european farming and end the practice of automatic farm handouts . " this decision marks the beginning of a new era .
our farm policy will fundamentally change.today , europe has given itself a new and effective farm policy , " he said .
the accord was hailed by leaders from several member countries .
" the agreement today delivers what we wanted - real change , " said britain 's agriculture minister , margaret beckett .
" it will give stability and security to farmers in the next decade , " said irish farm minister joe walsh .
german agricultural minister renate künast described the reform as a big success .
" with it we can finally break out of the old agricultural system , " she said .
in the future , subsidies from brussels will be distributed more evenly , rewarding farmers who switch to environmentally-friendly farming methods that promote increased food quality and improved rural management .
the european commission is also eager to end subsidies prior to 2004 when the agriculturally dependant economies of eastern europe join the eu .
critics feared that extending handouts to the new eu countries would only worsen the problem of over-production in europe .
agreement expected to revive trade talks the agreement on eu farm reforms is also seen as essential to kickstart the stalled doha round of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks .
fischler said the deal would boost the eu ’ s negotiating position in upcoming trade talks in mexico in september and appease the united states and japan , who had criticized the current system of eu farm hand-outs saying it violates wto rules .
" we ’ re also sending out a message to the world that we have a more trade-friendly policy .
we are saying goodbye to a policy that used to distort trade , " fischler told a news conference on thursday .
" we can go with our heads held high to cancun , " fischler said .
wto chief supachai panitchpakdi welcomed the deal .
" i see that this would have a positive effect on movement in areas , if not all areas of agriculture , " supachai said in geneva .
angry farmers despite the breakthrough on the reform package , fischler was forced to compromised on several elements of his original plan under heavy pressure from big farming nations such as france .
france , the largest beneficiary of eu farm aid , had strongly resisted decoupling farm aid from production subsidies .
in the latest deal , fischler compromised by abandoning his plan to cut minimum prices on key grains - including wheat , barley and maize and by allowing countries a high degree of flexibility over how it may apply decoupling rules for livestock .
but some french farmers were still dissatisfied .
" france has badly defended the interests of the cap and of french farmers , " jerome despey , head of france ’ s young farmers organization told radio france international .
likewise , farming unions in germany , one of the eu ’ s largest contributors to cap , were also dismayed by the deal .
the german farmers association -lrb- dbv -rrb- said farmers in that country would lose between € 1.2 and € 2 billion as a result of the cuts and warned that the decision would discourage further investment .
" this decision is a major burden for german and european farmers , " german farmers association president gerd sonnleitner told german public radio .
" it ’ s a typical eu compromise which gives and takes a little from everyone and creates terrible difficulties for those who have to implement it , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu farm reform proposals weakened in political power play german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would help france water down a radical reform of the european union ’ s common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .

mannheimer woes seen troubling insurance industry ; deutsche bahn forced to offer competitor 's timetables ; economists see light at the end of the tunnel . mannheimer insolvency signals trouble for industry one of germany ’ s oldest insurance companies was left looking for a bailout plan on thursday after the german insurance industry association -lrb- gdv -rrb- announced that a last-minute rescue initiative to raise € 370 million -lrb- $ 426 million -rrb- from fellow insurers had failed .
the mannheimer lebensversicherung ag , which has been struggling to stay afloat following significant losses on the capital markets last year , turned to the gdv – a cooperation of 110 insurance companies - in the hopes of drumming up enough fresh cash to prevent it from being the first german insurer to go under in 50 years .
the gdv , however , could not convince the necessary 90 percent of its members to back the rescue plan .
it now looks as if mannheimer will become the first german insurer to seek help from protektor , the industry-backed safety net set up last year to protect policyholder ’ s investments in the event of an insurer ’ s insolvency .
but protektor so far only exists on paper , and with a start-up capital of just € 3.2 million put forth by 10 insurers , its rescue funds remain rather limited .
that ’ s not good news for the german government , which has been encouraging citizens to invest in equity-based life insurance plans rather than rely on state support for their retirement .
a perceived weakness in the insurance industry could cause the public to lose confidence in the whole concept .
deutsche bahn to provide timetables for connex the deutsche bahn , germany ’ s largest rail company , must include information from its competitor connex in its long-distance timetables , according to a new ruling by the berlin regional court on thursday .
from now on , the formerly state-owned bahn is required to provide route plans and times for connex via its internet and telephone services .
the ruling came after months of failed negotiations and connex , a subsidiary of the french vivendi corporation , took the bahn to court claiming its monopoly over long-distance timetables reflected an unfair competition advantage .
the bahn rejected such arguments as unfounded .
but the german cartel office , which had warned the bahn of a possible investigation back in february , said the bahn ’ s refusal to provide information on prices and timetables for connex blocked efforts to open up the country ’ s rail system to more competitors .
connex , with its three routes , including the newly-opened cologne-rostock stretch , is the deutsche bahn ’ s only competitor in long-distance train travel .
economy seen rebounding after all the bad news about germany ’ s economy , from rumors of deflation to signs of a recession , it now looks as if there might be light at the end of the tunnel .
six of the leading german economic research institutes said there are signs that the economy will improve by the end of the year .
according to a survey of the institutes ’ directors published in the berliner zeitung newspaper on thursday , the majority of the experts are convinced the country will experience considerable economic growth in the coming year .
they cited the government ’ s plans to reform health care and the pension plan as well as its steps to bring forward a tax cut as the source of the renewed optimism .
the director of the institute for economic research -lrb- iwh -rrb- in halle , rüdiger pohl , was quoted as saying , " the reform agenda is being pushed through with momentum .
everyone is noticing that germany is serious about its efforts to revitalize the economy .

in an interview with deutsche welle , he said security was still the country 's biggest problem . " afghanistan is a very violent place .
we ’ ve got to be careful and take as many precautions as possible .
there are still spoilers out there who do not want this peace process to succeed , " brahimi said in an interview with deutsche welle .
the united nations special envoy to afghanistan is in germany to receive a special peace prize from the federal state of hessen on thursday .
ahead of the award ceremony , he met with german foreign minister joschka fischer and defense minister peter struck .
during the meeting with the two german ministers , brahimi stressed how important the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- was to maintaining the peace in conflict-ridden afghanistan .
after nearly 25 years of war and civil strife , the country needs the international peacekeepers and the provincial reconstruction teams to restore security , rebuild the infrastructure and help the central government establish its authority outside kabul , brahimi said .
" the international troops , isaf , are needed now and they will be needed for some time .
how long is difficult to say .
my personal calculation is a couple of years before the afghan army and national police can provide security for the people of afghanistan , especially in kabul .
i think it will take one or two years . "
limited influence one of the main problems facing reconstruction efforts in afghanistan is the limited reach of the central government under president hamid karsai , whose position , although recognized and respected in the provinces , has hardly any influence over the warlords and militias who still control considerable areas of the country .
brahimi said this was understandable in a state that has been completely destroyed .
" we are in a process of rebuilding the state machinery .
there are no roads , no telephones , no lines of communication .
that is why it is so difficult to project the influence of the central government in the country , " brahimi explained .
" the government is limited in its resources , but it is recognized in the provinces , " he said , " and therefore what is required is to help the government rebuild the state , not only in kabul , but in the provinces . "
" the best way of doing this , " brahimi stressed , " is to extend isaf outside the capital . "
extending the isaf mandate but the issue of extending the commitment of international peacekeepers in afghanistan is still a matter of discussion .
the isaf , which will be operated under dutch-german command until august , is currently restricted to the afghan capital kabul , but the united states and u.n. secretary general kofi annan have requested that troops also be sent to the provinces to protect civilian workers who are helping rebuild the country .
in berlin , the question of extending the isaf mandate beyond kabul has been met with a good deal of opposition following a june 7 bombing in the capital city that killed four german soldiers .
germany , which supplies the largest troop contingent in the international force , has been hesitant to commit more soldiers and extend their area of operation until the security situation in the provinces improves .
the german parliament in not scheduled to vote on an extension of the mandate until september .
brahimi said he respects the german government ’ s deliberations in light of the recent terrorist attack , but at the same time he expressed hope that germany would not rule against extending the security forces outside kabul .
" i think we would be sorry if that was the decision of the federal republic of germany , " he told deutsche welle .
the isaf is still developing , brahimi explained , " but it promises to be helpful for the progress of the peace process , for the training of the afghan police and the army . "
he added that not expanding isaf ’ s mandate beyond kabul would hinder the security and reconstruction efforts in the provinces and prolong the instability in the country .
" afghanistan is certainly in some parts still a dangerous place , " brahimi conceded , " but i think in the places -lsb- the german government -rsb- is contemplating , we don ’ t see many problems for the german soldiers if they were there . "
" of course we must be careful , " he continued while pointing out that the united nations itself has been sending unarmed civilians into the provinces for quite some time .
brahimi admitted , though , that security was a serious problem for u.n. reconstruction workers who are not able to access certain regions in the south and east and can only enter other regions with bodyguards .
the road to democracy according to brahimi , it will take some time before afghanistan is in a position to provide its own effective security .
he estimated that by september the national police and army are expected to have trained about 6,000 people , but it will be at least another year before the central government will have built up enough of a security force to make a substantial difference .
building a democratic state takes time , brahimi emphasized .
it is a slow and difficult process .
nonetheless , he expects that afghanistan will have a constitution in the near future .
" the constitution work has started and it is going reasonably well .
barring any unforeseen difficulties , we hope the country will have a new constitution by october , " he stated .
elections , on the other hand , are more difficult .
the u.n. envoy described them as a logistical nightmare .
" we have to register people all over the country , in every village .
and we have to go there ourselves , because they will not come to us , especially the women .
that means we have to recruit thousands of people , and it will cost a lot of money . "

limited influence one of the main problems facing reconstruction efforts in afghanistan is the limited reach of the central government under president hamid karsai , whose position , although recognized and respected in the provinces , has hardly any influence over the warlords and militias who still control considerable areas of the country .
brahimi said this was understandable in a state that has been completely destroyed .
" we are in a process of rebuilding the state machinery .
there are no roads , no telephones , no lines of communication .
that is why it is so difficult to project the influence of the central government in the country , " brahimi explained .
" the government is limited in its resources , but it is recognized in the provinces , " he said , " and therefore what is required is to help the government rebuild the state , not only in kabul , but in the provinces . "
" the best way of doing this , " brahimi stressed , " is to extend isaf outside the capital . "
extending the isaf mandate but the issue of extending the commitment of international peacekeepers in afghanistan is still a matter of discussion .
the isaf , which will be operated under dutch-german command until august , is currently restricted to the afghan capital kabul , but the united states and u.n. secretary general kofi annan have requested that troops also be sent to the provinces to protect civilian workers who are helping rebuild the country .
in berlin , the question of extending the isaf mandate beyond kabul has been met with a good deal of opposition following a june 7 bombing in the capital city that killed four german soldiers .
germany , which supplies the largest troop contingent in the international force , has been hesitant to commit more soldiers and extend their area of operation until the security situation in the provinces improves .
the german parliament in not scheduled to vote on an extension of the mandate until september .
brahimi said he respects the german government ’ s deliberations in light of the recent terrorist attack , but at the same time he expressed hope that germany would not rule against extending the security forces outside kabul .
" i think we would be sorry if that was the decision of the federal republic of germany , " he told deutsche welle .
the isaf is still developing , brahimi explained , " but it promises to be helpful for the progress of the peace process , for the training of the afghan police and the army . "
he added that not expanding isaf ’ s mandate beyond kabul would hinder the security and reconstruction efforts in the provinces and prolong the instability in the country .
" afghanistan is certainly in some parts still a dangerous place , " brahimi conceded , " but i think in the places -lsb- the german government -rsb- is contemplating , we don ’ t see many problems for the german soldiers if they were there . "
" of course we must be careful , " he continued while pointing out that the united nations itself has been sending unarmed civilians into the provinces for quite some time .
brahimi admitted , though , that security was a serious problem for u.n. reconstruction workers who are not able to access certain regions in the south and east and can only enter other regions with bodyguards .
the road to democracy according to brahimi , it will take some time before afghanistan is in a position to provide its own effective security .
he estimated that by september the national police and army are expected to have trained about 6,000 people , but it will be at least another year before the central government will have built up enough of a security force to make a substantial difference .
building a democratic state takes time , brahimi emphasized .
it is a slow and difficult process .
nonetheless , he expects that afghanistan will have a constitution in the near future .
" the constitution work has started and it is going reasonably well .
barring any unforeseen difficulties , we hope the country will have a new constitution by october , " he stated .
elections , on the other hand , are more difficult .
the u.n. envoy described them as a logistical nightmare .
" we have to register people all over the country , in every village .
and we have to go there ourselves , because they will not come to us , especially the women .
that means we have to recruit thousands of people , and it will cost a lot of money . "
but he believes elections can take place as early as october 2004 , if the security situation in the countryside allows for it , brahimi added .
waning interest in afghanistan ?
when asked if international interest in afghanistan was fading and whether or not money from western donor countries was drying up , brahimi responded that there is always the fear of donor fatigue and competition with the attraction of other international crisis situations .
" probably the attention has diminished a little bit , " he said , " but i think there ’ s still a reasonable amount of interest and support for what is happening in afghanistan .

mannheimer woes seen troubling insurance industry ; deutsche bahn forced to offer competitor 's timetables ; economists see light at the end of the tunnel . mannheimer insolvency signals trouble for industry one of germany ’ s oldest insurance companies was left looking for a bailout plan on thursday after the german insurance industry association -lrb- gdv -rrb- announced that a last-minute rescue initiative to raise € 370 million -lrb- $ 426 million -rrb- from fellow insurers had failed .
the mannheimer lebensversicherung ag , which has been struggling to stay afloat following significant losses on the capital markets last year , turned to the gdv – a cooperation of 110 insurance companies - in the hopes of drumming up enough fresh cash to prevent it from being the first german insurer to go under in 50 years .
the gdv , however , could not convince the necessary 90 percent of its members to back the rescue plan .
it now looks as if mannheimer will become the first german insurer to seek help from protektor , the industry-backed safety net set up last year to protect policyholder ’ s investments in the event of an insurer ’ s insolvency .
but protektor so far only exists on paper , and with a start-up capital of just € 3.2 million put forth by 10 insurers , its rescue funds remain rather limited .
that ’ s not good news for the german government , which has been encouraging citizens to invest in equity-based life insurance plans rather than rely on state support for their retirement .
a perceived weakness in the insurance industry could cause the public to lose confidence in the whole concept .
deutsche bahn to provide timetables for connex the deutsche bahn , germany ’ s largest rail company , must include information from its competitor connex in its long-distance timetables , according to a new ruling by the berlin regional court on thursday .
from now on , the formerly state-owned bahn is required to provide route plans and times for connex via its internet and telephone services .
the ruling came after months of failed negotiations and connex , a subsidiary of the french vivendi corporation , took the bahn to court claiming its monopoly over long-distance timetables reflected an unfair competition advantage .
the bahn rejected such arguments as unfounded .
but the german cartel office , which had warned the bahn of a possible investigation back in february , said the bahn ’ s refusal to provide information on prices and timetables for connex blocked efforts to open up the country ’ s rail system to more competitors .
connex , with its three routes , including the newly-opened cologne-rostock stretch , is the deutsche bahn ’ s only competitor in long-distance train travel .
economy seen rebounding after all the bad news about germany ’ s economy , from rumors of deflation to signs of a recession , it now looks as if there might be light at the end of the tunnel .
six of the leading german economic research institutes said there are signs that the economy will improve by the end of the year .
according to a survey of the institutes ’ directors published in the berliner zeitung newspaper on thursday , the majority of the experts are convinced the country will experience considerable economic growth in the coming year .
they cited the government ’ s plans to reform health care and the pension plan as well as its steps to bring forward a tax cut as the source of the renewed optimism .

in an interview with deutsche welle , he said security was still the country 's biggest problem . " afghanistan is a very violent place .
we ’ ve got to be careful and take as many precautions as possible .
there are still spoilers out there who do not want this peace process to succeed , " brahimi said in an interview with deutsche welle .
the united nations special envoy to afghanistan is in germany to receive a special peace prize from the federal state of hessen on thursday .
ahead of the award ceremony , he met with german foreign minister joschka fischer and defense minister peter struck .
during the meeting with the two german ministers , brahimi stressed how important the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- was to maintaining the peace in conflict-ridden afghanistan .
after nearly 25 years of war and civil strife , the country needs the international peacekeepers and the provincial reconstruction teams to restore security , rebuild the infrastructure and help the central government establish its authority outside kabul , brahimi said .
" the international troops , isaf , are needed now and they will be needed for some time .
how long is difficult to say .
my personal calculation is a couple of years before the afghan army and national police can provide security for the people of afghanistan , especially in kabul .
i think it will take one or two years . "

europe and the united states are slowly smoothing out their troubled relations originating from the iraq conflict .
but there are still enough problems between the two to spark future political disagreements . who would have imagined ?
the shattered transatlantic bond between the united states and the european union appears to be on its way out of its crisis .
the two sides may not be moving towards a hot love affair .
but a partnership of convenience is certain to result .
the first eu-u.s. summit after the iraq war brought europeans and americans together once again and proved their ability to face up to common problems with combined powers .
good cooperation in the fight against terrorism plays a significant role here . new agreements in this sector not only stipulate joint investigative teams to uncover terrorist criminals , but also clarify the extradition of suspected terrorists to the united states .
in the case of the latter , the europeans do not need to fear that the suspects will be sentenced to death or tried before a military tribunal once they are on american soil . this agreement shows that both sides are capable of cooperating while respectfully recognizing the legal tradition of the other , together with its ethical-moral implications . working together for peace the common efforts to secure peace in the middle east follow a similar path .
though progression in this conflict is moving more slowly than in the fight against terrorism , new rays of hope have appeared on the horizon .
these involve efforts within the group know as the middle east quartet - made up of the united states , the eu , the united nations and russia - as well as the personal commitment by u.s. president george w. bush .
now , it is essential to withdraw the financial basis for the hamas movement 's activities , to press israel to reduce its settlements in the west bank and to use the signalized ceasefire by palestinian groups for a consequential implementation of the u.s. and eu-backed " road map " to peace . surprisingly , the transatlantic views on iran have conformed to each other relatively quickly .
the nuclear program of a nation blessed with rich energy sources is , in fact , cause for worry on all sides .
but a military intervention by the u.s. similar to that in iraq is currently not under discussion .
and the eu can use its good economic relations to iran to increase pressure on the country 's ayatollahs . moving forward despite differences despite political synergies , the problems of transatlantic cooperation remain on the agenda even after this summit .
europe 's ban on importing genetically-modified food continues to be a thorn in washington 's side .
and europe views the u.s. 's continuous refusal to work with the international criminal court as somewhat paranoid .
here , the devil lies in the detail .
but even if this transatlantic bond represents a partnership of convenience , the willingness to solve problems is growing to such a degree that it can reinstate lost trust .

his words still resound today in berlin , even 12 years after reunification . " two thousand years ago the proudest boast was " civis romanus sum . "
today , in the world of freedom , the proudest boast is " ich bin ein berliner . "
when united states president john f. kennedy made the famous statement " ich bin ein berliner " – -lrb- i am a berliner -rrb- - in front of the city hall of west berlin on june 26 , 1963 , he uttered words that went straight to the hearts of the citizens of berlin .
he insinuated that they were - just like the citizens of rome in earlier times - free people , with an unalienable right to freedom and the right to be protected by the rest of the free world .
it was a rousing speech that quite possibly turned the tide in favor of holding on to berlin as an isolated outpost in communist east germany at a time when it was in very real danger of falling to the communist german democratic republic .
" this was a very intense feeling of closeness , " recalls alexander longolius , a member of west germany 's city council in 1963 and later director of the checkpoint charlie foundation .
" if the americans had turned away from us , if that speech had told us we were leaving the city , then it would have been dramatic .
i remember that i went home and told my wife -lrb- ... -rrb- that our worries are over and everything would be good . "
a divided city from the end of world war ii in 1945 until the beginning of german reunification in 1989 , germany as a whole , and berlin as a city , was divided by the cold war a state of open confrontation between the communist bloc and the nato alliance .
in august 1961 , the soviets erected the berlin wall to stop the mass exodus of people fleeing soviet east berlin for west berlin and the non-communist world , thus sealing west berlin behind a 12-foot wall for some 28 years .
two years after this , kennedy gave his historic speech , which still finds incredible resonance here 40 years later .
in 1963 , west berlin was militarily protected by and partly governed by american , french and british forces .
the largest military contingent was american , and faced off a sizeable soviet contingent on the other side of the wall .
many people - and companies - had left the divided city for greener and safer pastures .
in his speech , kennedy expressed admiration for those who stayed on despite the city 's isolation .
" i want to say , on behalf of my countrymen , who live many miles away on the other side of the atlantic , who are far distant from you , that they take the greatest pride that they have been able to share with you , even from a distance , the story of the last 18 years .
i know of no town , no city , that has been besieged for 18 years that still lives with the vitality and the force and the hope and the determination of the city of west berlin . "
these words , uttered by the american president , had a soothing effect not only on the souls of beleaguered west berliners , but on the german post-war psyche as a whole .
many germans still felt a deep sense of guilt for the crimes they or their parents had committed - or at least had not prevented - during world war ii and the holocaust .
berliners were particularly receptive of the support kennedy expressed .
after all , when the wall went up in 1961 , many west germans were convinced the city was entirely lost to the communists .
" i was on vacation in west germany in the bavarian forest to the south of berlin , " longolius says .
" we were on a farm , and did n't have a radio .
so i did n't hear about the wall on that sunday .
i heard about it on tuesday , two days later , when our landlady - a farmer 's woman - asked me where i would go when my vacation was over .
and i said i would go home .
and she said to me : you ca n't do that any more because they 've cut west berlin off . "
when he toured west berlin , kennedy was accompanied by the then-mayor of berlin , willy brandt , and german chancellor konrad adenauer .
many berliners felt the chancellor and other west germans did not fully understand the importance of their city as a bulwark against communism , protecting the entire country against a soviet invasion .
" i said to myself : once the russians are berlin , they will be sitting on the rhine four weeks later , " says a woman , who has been a longtime resident of berlin .
" and i think that would have been the case .
the russians would simply have marched through .
once they had reached west berlin , they would have bulldozed the country - maybe not in four weeks , maybe a little later .
and they would not only have gone as far as the rhine , but even further .
that was the opinion of many people at the time . "
in the early 1960s , the cold war was at it 's peak .
not only was james bond fighting fictitious communist villains in the cinemas of the west .
the delivery of soviet nuclear medium-range missiles to cuba in 1962 had only just brought the world to the brink of a nuclear war .
communism as an ideology seemed like a viable and attractive alternative to capitalism for many intellectuals , even in the west .
john f. kennedy therefore used his speech in west berlin not only to boost the morale of the inhabitants there , but also to condemn communism as a politically , economically and morally inferior system everywhere in the world , with the berlin wall the most obvious and vivid demonstration of communism 's failures .
" there are many people in the world who really do n't understand , or say they do n't , what is the great issue between the free world and the communist world .
let them come to berlin .
there are some who say that communism is the wave of the future .
let them come to berlin .
and there are some who say in europe and elsewhere we can work with the communists .
let them come to berlin . "
an american legend according to alexander longolius , john f. kennedy became a mythical figure in germany and elsewhere because he was highly credible .
" he was not only an american president .
he was the leader of the west , " he says .
" the man who gave all of us hope , a perspective and a dream .
the united states at that time combined military , economic , cultural and moral leadership .
and there was no doubt in our mind that kennedy stood for all that . "
kennedy 's premature death at the hands of a gunman in dallas only a few months after holding his berlin speech temporarily plunged the city into depression and despair .
today , 40 years later , kennedy 's legacy lives on in germany 's collective memory - for example in school books , documentaries about the cold war and in an exhibition at the german national museum of contemporary history in bonn .
there , the most famous excerpt of kennedy 's speech is displayed on a television monitor , and there is a copy of the piece of paper john f. kennedy held in his hand when delivering his speech , complete with the lines " ich bin ein berliner " and " let them come to berlin " scrawled on it in his own hand-writing .
herman schäfer , a custodian at the museum , says the document still elicits a deep response today .
" the reaction of our visitors is very enthusiastic , still enthusiastic , even though this 40 years ago .
everybody - be it young or old people - have in mind that this is a quotation from john f. kennedy .
so they hear this quotation and then the look into the glass case and see with even more surprise that there is this little document with the phonetic transcription of john f. kennedy .
so there is still this enthusiasm about this quotation that -lrb- puts -rrb- so much emphasis on the german-american friendship during the 1960s . "
kennedy 's speech has been cited and used as a model by other politicians since 1963 .
shortly before the berlin wall came down in 1989 , u.s. president ronald reagan addressed soviet leader mikhail gorbachev from the same location , telling him the time was ripe for german reunification .
and when after the sept .
11. attacks on new york and washington , chancellor schröder pledged " unlimited " support to the us in its war on terrorism , he alluded to george w. bush ' famous predecessor .
" when the defense of berlin was at stake , john f. kennedy said - and you all know this famous sentence - ' i am a berliner ' , " schröder said .
" that was the expression of incredible solidarity .
today i believe that we have every reason - especially we germans - to return this solidarity by expressing our solidarity with the american people . "
strained relations however , following germany 's refusal to back the u.s.-led war on iraq , relations between the two countries reached a historic low .
many germans refused to believe that the ideals kennedy had upheld in berlin were being appropriately defended by bush .
because of the widespread rejection of the war , germans have been accused of anti-americanism .
but according to schäfer of the national museum in bonn , the us-german relationship has not been fundamentally impaired .
" it is still as strong as in former times and if we look to the development of our civilization , i personally think that the united states is something like the leading civilized nation of the world , " he says .
" and there are a lot of different developments which are already there - if we like them or not - and many of them i do not like , i would not agree with all developments which are under way in the u.s. they will come to our state , to our country , to europe soon or later .
but we have to decide individually if we want to adopt them . "

when he toured west berlin , kennedy was accompanied by the then-mayor of berlin , willy brandt , and german chancellor konrad adenauer .
many berliners felt the chancellor and other west germans did not fully understand the importance of their city as a bulwark against communism , protecting the entire country against a soviet invasion .
" i said to myself : once the russians are berlin , they will be sitting on the rhine four weeks later , " says a woman , who has been a longtime resident of berlin .
" and i think that would have been the case .
the russians would simply have marched through .
once they had reached west berlin , they would have bulldozed the country - maybe not in four weeks , maybe a little later .
and they would not only have gone as far as the rhine , but even further .
that was the opinion of many people at the time . "
in the early 1960s , the cold war was at it 's peak .
not only was james bond fighting fictitious communist villains in the cinemas of the west .
the delivery of soviet nuclear medium-range missiles to cuba in 1962 had only just brought the world to the brink of a nuclear war .
communism as an ideology seemed like a viable and attractive alternative to capitalism for many intellectuals , even in the west .
john f. kennedy therefore used his speech in west berlin not only to boost the morale of the inhabitants there , but also to condemn communism as a politically , economically and morally inferior system everywhere in the world , with the berlin wall the most obvious and vivid demonstration of communism 's failures .
" there are many people in the world who really do n't understand , or say they do n't , what is the great issue between the free world and the communist world .
let them come to berlin .
there are some who say that communism is the wave of the future .
let them come to berlin .
and there are some who say in europe and elsewhere we can work with the communists .
let them come to berlin . "
an american legend according to alexander longolius , john f. kennedy became a mythical figure in germany and elsewhere because he was highly credible .
" he was not only an american president .
he was the leader of the west , " he says .
" the man who gave all of us hope , a perspective and a dream .
the united states at that time combined military , economic , cultural and moral leadership .
and there was no doubt in our mind that kennedy stood for all that . "
kennedy 's premature death at the hands of a gunman in dallas only a few months after holding his berlin speech temporarily plunged the city into depression and despair .
today , 40 years later , kennedy 's legacy lives on in germany 's collective memory - for example in school books , documentaries about the cold war and in an exhibition at the german national museum of contemporary history in bonn .
there , the most famous excerpt of kennedy 's speech is displayed on a television monitor , and there is a copy of the piece of paper john f. kennedy held in his hand when delivering his speech , complete with the lines " ich bin ein berliner " and " let them come to berlin " scrawled on it in his own hand-writing .
herman schäfer , a custodian at the museum , says the document still elicits a deep response today .
" the reaction of our visitors is very enthusiastic , still enthusiastic , even though this 40 years ago .
everybody - be it young or old people - have in mind that this is a quotation from john f. kennedy .
so they hear this quotation and then the look into the glass case and see with even more surprise that there is this little document with the phonetic transcription of john f. kennedy .
so there is still this enthusiasm about this quotation that -lrb- puts -rrb- so much emphasis on the german-american friendship during the 1960s . "
kennedy 's speech has been cited and used as a model by other politicians since 1963 .
shortly before the berlin wall came down in 1989 , u.s. president ronald reagan addressed soviet leader mikhail gorbachev from the same location , telling him the time was ripe for german reunification .
and when after the sept .

" when the defense of berlin was at stake , john f. kennedy said - and you all know this famous sentence - ' i am a berliner ' , " schröder said .
" that was the expression of incredible solidarity .
today i believe that we have every reason - especially we germans - to return this solidarity by expressing our solidarity with the american people . "
strained relations however , following germany 's refusal to back the u.s.-led war on iraq , relations between the two countries reached a historic low .
many germans refused to believe that the ideals kennedy had upheld in berlin were being appropriately defended by bush .
because of the widespread rejection of the war , germans have been accused of anti-americanism .
but according to schäfer of the national museum in bonn , the us-german relationship has not been fundamentally impaired .
" it is still as strong as in former times and if we look to the development of our civilization , i personally think that the united states is something like the leading civilized nation of the world , " he says .

but we have to decide individually if we want to adopt them . "

his words still resound today in berlin , even 12 years after reunification . " two thousand years ago the proudest boast was " civis romanus sum . "
today , in the world of freedom , the proudest boast is " ich bin ein berliner . "
when united states president john f. kennedy made the famous statement " ich bin ein berliner " – -lrb- i am a berliner -rrb- - in front of the city hall of west berlin on june 26 , 1963 , he uttered words that went straight to the hearts of the citizens of berlin .
he insinuated that they were - just like the citizens of rome in earlier times - free people , with an unalienable right to freedom and the right to be protected by the rest of the free world .
it was a rousing speech that quite possibly turned the tide in favor of holding on to berlin as an isolated outpost in communist east germany at a time when it was in very real danger of falling to the communist german democratic republic .
" this was a very intense feeling of closeness , " recalls alexander longolius , a member of west germany 's city council in 1963 and later director of the checkpoint charlie foundation .
" if the americans had turned away from us , if that speech had told us we were leaving the city , then it would have been dramatic .
i remember that i went home and told my wife -lrb- ... -rrb- that our worries are over and everything would be good . "
a divided city from the end of world war ii in 1945 until the beginning of german reunification in 1989 , germany as a whole , and berlin as a city , was divided by the cold war a state of open confrontation between the communist bloc and the nato alliance .
in august 1961 , the soviets erected the berlin wall to stop the mass exodus of people fleeing soviet east berlin for west berlin and the non-communist world , thus sealing west berlin behind a 12-foot wall for some 28 years .
two years after this , kennedy gave his historic speech , which still finds incredible resonance here 40 years later .
in 1963 , west berlin was militarily protected by and partly governed by american , french and british forces .
the largest military contingent was american , and faced off a sizeable soviet contingent on the other side of the wall .
many people - and companies - had left the divided city for greener and safer pastures .
in his speech , kennedy expressed admiration for those who stayed on despite the city 's isolation .
" i want to say , on behalf of my countrymen , who live many miles away on the other side of the atlantic , who are far distant from you , that they take the greatest pride that they have been able to share with you , even from a distance , the story of the last 18 years .
i know of no town , no city , that has been besieged for 18 years that still lives with the vitality and the force and the hope and the determination of the city of west berlin . "
these words , uttered by the american president , had a soothing effect not only on the souls of beleaguered west berliners , but on the german post-war psyche as a whole .
many germans still felt a deep sense of guilt for the crimes they or their parents had committed - or at least had not prevented - during world war ii and the holocaust .
berliners were particularly receptive of the support kennedy expressed .
after all , when the wall went up in 1961 , many west germans were convinced the city was entirely lost to the communists .
" i was on vacation in west germany in the bavarian forest to the south of berlin , " longolius says .
" we were on a farm , and did n't have a radio .
so i did n't hear about the wall on that sunday .
i heard about it on tuesday , two days later , when our landlady - a farmer 's woman - asked me where i would go when my vacation was over .
and i said i would go home .
and she said to me : you ca n't do that any more because they 've cut west berlin off . "
when he toured west berlin , kennedy was accompanied by the then-mayor of berlin , willy brandt , and german chancellor konrad adenauer .
many berliners felt the chancellor and other west germans did not fully understand the importance of their city as a bulwark against communism , protecting the entire country against a soviet invasion .
" i said to myself : once the russians are berlin , they will be sitting on the rhine four weeks later , " says a woman , who has been a longtime resident of berlin .
" and i think that would have been the case .
the russians would simply have marched through .

european union agricultural ministers reached a deal thursday to overhaul the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- after years of deadlock , ending brussels ’ controversial policy of generous farm hand-outs . eu farming ministers meeting in luxembourg agreed on a comprehensive reform package for the 15-nation bloc ’ s agriculture policy on thursday after a marathon round of negotiations to thrash out the last details .
portugal was the only country to vote against the reform .
the move amounts to the most radical shake-up of the eu ’ s expensive 45-year-old cap , which critics have long argued undermines world trade and puts poor countries at a disadvantage .
the main thrust of the reforms is to cut back the eu ’ s program of huge direct subsidies to farmers , which account to about € 43 billion -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- a year - almost half the entire eu budget .
crop subsidies eliminated the chief architect of the reform plan , eu agricultural commissioner franz fischler , managed to largely salvage the cornerstone of his reform plan - namely breaking down the traditional link between subsidy and agricultural output , which has been blamed for offering an incentive to farmers to overproduce merely to get more cash from brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commissioner for agriculture , rural development and fisheries franz fischler fischler -lrb- photo -rrb- said the reforms would shape the future of european farming and end the practice of automatic farm handouts . " this decision marks the beginning of a new era .
our farm policy will fundamentally change.today , europe has given itself a new and effective farm policy , " he said .
the accord was hailed by leaders from several member countries .
" the agreement today delivers what we wanted - real change , " said britain 's agriculture minister , margaret beckett .
" it will give stability and security to farmers in the next decade , " said irish farm minister joe walsh .
german agricultural minister renate künast described the reform as a big success .
" with it we can finally break out of the old agricultural system , " she said .
in the future , subsidies from brussels will be distributed more evenly , rewarding farmers who switch to environmentally-friendly farming methods that promote increased food quality and improved rural management .
the european commission is also eager to end subsidies prior to 2004 when the agriculturally dependant economies of eastern europe join the eu .
critics feared that extending handouts to the new eu countries would only worsen the problem of over-production in europe .
agreement expected to revive trade talks the agreement on eu farm reforms is also seen as essential to kickstart the stalled doha round of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks .
fischler said the deal would boost the eu ’ s negotiating position in upcoming trade talks in mexico in september and appease the united states and japan , who had criticized the current system of eu farm hand-outs saying it violates wto rules .
" we ’ re also sending out a message to the world that we have a more trade-friendly policy .
we are saying goodbye to a policy that used to distort trade , " fischler told a news conference on thursday .
" we can go with our heads held high to cancun , " fischler said .
wto chief supachai panitchpakdi welcomed the deal .
" i see that this would have a positive effect on movement in areas , if not all areas of agriculture , " supachai said in geneva .
angry farmers despite the breakthrough on the reform package , fischler was forced to compromised on several elements of his original plan under heavy pressure from big farming nations such as france .
france , the largest beneficiary of eu farm aid , had strongly resisted decoupling farm aid from production subsidies .
in the latest deal , fischler compromised by abandoning his plan to cut minimum prices on key grains - including wheat , barley and maize and by allowing countries a high degree of flexibility over how it may apply decoupling rules for livestock .
but some french farmers were still dissatisfied .
" france has badly defended the interests of the cap and of french farmers , " jerome despey , head of france ’ s young farmers organization told radio france international .
likewise , farming unions in germany , one of the eu ’ s largest contributors to cap , were also dismayed by the deal .
the german farmers association -lrb- dbv -rrb- said farmers in that country would lose between € 1.2 and € 2 billion as a result of the cuts and warned that the decision would discourage further investment .
" this decision is a major burden for german and european farmers , " german farmers association president gerd sonnleitner told german public radio .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.06.2003 eu farming policy set for major revamp großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's reformed agricultural policy is likely to mean change for many farms in europe .
european union agricultural ministers reached a deal thursday to overhaul the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- after years of deadlock , ending brussels ’ controversial policy of generous farm hand-outs . eu farming ministers meeting in luxembourg agreed on a comprehensive reform package for the 15-nation bloc ’ s agriculture policy on thursday after a marathon round of negotiations to thrash out the last details .
portugal was the only country to vote against the reform .
the move amounts to the most radical shake-up of the eu ’ s expensive 45-year-old cap , which critics have long argued undermines world trade and puts poor countries at a disadvantage .
the main thrust of the reforms is to cut back the eu ’ s program of huge direct subsidies to farmers , which account to about € 43 billion -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- a year - almost half the entire eu budget .
crop subsidies eliminated the chief architect of the reform plan , eu agricultural commissioner franz fischler , managed to largely salvage the cornerstone of his reform plan - namely breaking down the traditional link between subsidy and agricultural output , which has been blamed for offering an incentive to farmers to overproduce merely to get more cash from brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commissioner for agriculture , rural development and fisheries franz fischler fischler -lrb- photo -rrb- said the reforms would shape the future of european farming and end the practice of automatic farm handouts . " this decision marks the beginning of a new era .
our farm policy will fundamentally change.today , europe has given itself a new and effective farm policy , " he said .
the accord was hailed by leaders from several member countries .
" the agreement today delivers what we wanted - real change , " said britain 's agriculture minister , margaret beckett .
" it will give stability and security to farmers in the next decade , " said irish farm minister joe walsh .
german agricultural minister renate künast described the reform as a big success .
" with it we can finally break out of the old agricultural system , " she said .
in the future , subsidies from brussels will be distributed more evenly , rewarding farmers who switch to environmentally-friendly farming methods that promote increased food quality and improved rural management .
the european commission is also eager to end subsidies prior to 2004 when the agriculturally dependant economies of eastern europe join the eu .
critics feared that extending handouts to the new eu countries would only worsen the problem of over-production in europe .
agreement expected to revive trade talks the agreement on eu farm reforms is also seen as essential to kickstart the stalled doha round of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks .
fischler said the deal would boost the eu ’ s negotiating position in upcoming trade talks in mexico in september and appease the united states and japan , who had criticized the current system of eu farm hand-outs saying it violates wto rules .
" we ’ re also sending out a message to the world that we have a more trade-friendly policy .
we are saying goodbye to a policy that used to distort trade , " fischler told a news conference on thursday .
" we can go with our heads held high to cancun , " fischler said .
wto chief supachai panitchpakdi welcomed the deal .
" i see that this would have a positive effect on movement in areas , if not all areas of agriculture , " supachai said in geneva .
angry farmers despite the breakthrough on the reform package , fischler was forced to compromised on several elements of his original plan under heavy pressure from big farming nations such as france .
france , the largest beneficiary of eu farm aid , had strongly resisted decoupling farm aid from production subsidies .
in the latest deal , fischler compromised by abandoning his plan to cut minimum prices on key grains - including wheat , barley and maize and by allowing countries a high degree of flexibility over how it may apply decoupling rules for livestock .
but some french farmers were still dissatisfied .
" france has badly defended the interests of the cap and of french farmers , " jerome despey , head of france ’ s young farmers organization told radio france international .
likewise , farming unions in germany , one of the eu ’ s largest contributors to cap , were also dismayed by the deal .
the german farmers association -lrb- dbv -rrb- said farmers in that country would lose between € 1.2 and € 2 billion as a result of the cuts and warned that the decision would discourage further investment .
" this decision is a major burden for german and european farmers , " german farmers association president gerd sonnleitner told german public radio .
" it ’ s a typical eu compromise which gives and takes a little from everyone and creates terrible difficulties for those who have to implement it , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu farm reform proposals weakened in political power play german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would help france water down a radical reform of the european union ’ s common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
eu ministers will attempt to hammer out a deal next week . -lrb- june 13 , 2003 -rrb- a summer of discontent for eastern german farmers the eu 's plan to cut direct subsidies to large farms will hit eastern german farmers harder than those in any other region in europe .

the society says the nhs in wales has fewer than half the european average of these medical experts working in the field .
in some areas of the country , patients with lung cancer and tuberculosis have to travel miles to have a consultation , with consultant vacancies remaining unfilled .
at its annual meeting in cardiff on thursday the bts is warning that what it calls a " critical shortage " is seriously affecting patient care .
currently there are no permanent chest physicians in caerphilly , neath , llanelli , haverfordwest or aberystwyth .
according to the royal college of physicians -lrb- rcp -rrb- , wales needs 86 consultants to serve the population .
at the moment the health system operates with only 27 % of the permanent consultants needed , or one per 126,200 people .
the european average is one per 60,000 . "
the eventual loser is the patient , many of whom ca n't even see a specialist in their closest hospital " dr andrew leonard dr ian campbell , president of the bts in wales and chest specialist at llandough hospital , penarth , said consultants leaving the medical profession were not being replaced quickly enough .
" we are losing consultants early and we are not training enough junior doctors for the number of posts coming up , " he said .
" consultants are finding the pressure on them too great and they are going . "
urgent bts manpower committee chairman dr andrew leonard said the problem had to be tackled .
" this situation is beginning to be addressed , with the welsh assembly recently creating four new trainee posts , but we need a lot more in order to help patients who are suffering with lung disease , " he said .
" in wales where you often have one consultant working in a hospital , and that person retires , it leaves a gaping hole in the service .
" we need to make sure we have adequate new blood who will become the chest consultants of the future .
" a third of our current consultant posts are unfilled by permanent staff at the present , but this is set to get a lot worse . "
dr leonard said lung disease was the second-biggest killer in wales and the shortage of specialists was putting a huge strain on the health system .
" the eventual loser is the patient , many of whom ca n't even see a specialist in their closest hospital , " he added .
" we 're in urgent need of funding for more trainees to care for welsh patients with lung disease . "
it is estimated that eight million people have lung disease in the uk , and 26,000 people in cardiff alone have asthma .

urgent bts manpower committee chairman dr andrew leonard said the problem had to be tackled .
" this situation is beginning to be addressed , with the welsh assembly recently creating four new trainee posts , but we need a lot more in order to help patients who are suffering with lung disease , " he said .
" in wales where you often have one consultant working in a hospital , and that person retires , it leaves a gaping hole in the service .
" we need to make sure we have adequate new blood who will become the chest consultants of the future .
" a third of our current consultant posts are unfilled by permanent staff at the present , but this is set to get a lot worse . "
dr leonard said lung disease was the second-biggest killer in wales and the shortage of specialists was putting a huge strain on the health system .
" the eventual loser is the patient , many of whom ca n't even see a specialist in their closest hospital , " he added .
" we 're in urgent need of funding for more trainees to care for welsh patients with lung disease . "
it is estimated that eight million people have lung disease in the uk , and 26,000 people in cardiff alone have asthma .

road fatalities deaths -lrb- and rate per 100,000 population -rrb- united states 41,821 -lrb- 15.2 -rrb- japan 10,403 -lrb- 8.2 -rrb- south korea 10,236 -lrb- 21.8 -rrb- france 8079 -lrb- 13.6 -rrb- italy 6410 -lrb- 11.1 -rrb- spain 5776 -lrb- 14.6 -rrb- united kingdom 3580 -lrb- 6.0 -rrb- australia 1824 -lrb- 9.5 -rrb- figures from 2000 mobile phones banned with an estimated 30 million people killed in crashes world-wide since the invention of the motor vehicle , debate is always raging about how to save lives .
in the latest move , the uk government announced this week it would be banning the use of mobile phones while driving .
below is a selection of other suggestions to improve road safety , drawn from various sources .
bbc news online would also like to hear your views by filling out the form below .
head bands would drivers wear these ?
many of the most serious road crashes result in head injuries .
they may not look too fashionable , but these head bands have been identified as one way of reducing the human impact of car accidents .
leading research in this area is the road accident research unit at the university of adelaide , in australia .
its tests have already shown headbands would reduce injuries from frontal car crashes , and research is continuing on other types of crash .
essentially the bands are crash helmets which have been scaled down to look less bulky .
it may be hard to imagine people wearing them - but many people opposed wearing seat belts when they were introduced .
go-slow cars cars could stop their own drivers from speeding experts at the university of leeds are working on a car equipped with a speed limiter which makes it impossible to break the legal limit .
professor of transport safety , oliver carsten , said : " we believe this kind of technology can contribute to road safety .
" if all drivers kept to the speed limit , deaths on the road -lrb- in the uk -rrb- would fall by 37 % , over 1,200 each year . "
the system has been dubbed intelligent speed adaptation .
death markers black markers signify deaths and red indicate serious injuries an idea used in various countries where the risk of crashes increases on long stretches of road .
black markers -lrb- usually small wooden posts -rrb- are installed at locations where fatal accidents have occurred .
they may be slightly morbid , but these markers , which feature small crosses at the top , are sobering reminder of how dangerous driving can be .
they also serve to highlight corners or stretches of road which may be more hazardous than they appear .
additional red markers indicate sites of crashes which resulted in serious injuries .
design and roadside objects road design is crucial many vehicle deaths would be avoided if authorities paid closer attention to removing or fencing off roadside objects , such as dangerous trees and posts .
collisions with trees kill 1,600 people a year in germany , 800 in france and more than 200 in britain .
general design of roads is also important , with some research suggesting poor design contributes to 33 % of crashes .
refresher courses middle-aged men are getting back on the road a concern raised by the aa is the number of middle-aged men " rediscovering their youth " by getting back on their motorcycles .
it can sometimes be too late when they discover the road environment has changed over the last 20 to 30 years .
many would benefit from refresher courses to hone their skills , which may have diminished over the years and must be adapted to modern road conditions .
hitting home cars can be fragile machines many people do not fully comprehend the horror of car crashes , and thus do not drive accordingly .
numerous advertisements have used shocking images of accidents in the hope of reforming attitudes .
some say this could be taken a step further by occasionally putting badly damaged and burnt out vehicles at the roadside .
it would surely be a stark reminder of how fragile a car can be when travelling at speed .
lower speed limits is 40mph too fast ?
it seems obvious , but few people realise the difference made by slower driving .
not only are you less likely to suffer serious injuries , but there is less chance of the accident happening in the first place .
research in areas where the speed limit is 60km / h -lrb- just under 40mph -rrb- has shown the chance of crashing could be reduced by as much as 40 % if the limit was lowered by just 10km / h .
however suggestions of lowering speed limits often encounter resistance from motorists who are in a hurry to get where they are going .
drink driving drunk drivers can be lethal alcohol is still a major cause of car crashes .
the royal society for the prevention of accidents says the allowable amount of alcohol should be lowered from 80mg to 50mg .
furthermore , it wants police empowered to test drivers randomly .
" they should be able to test anywhere at any time , " a spokesman said .
a selection of views from bbc news online readers : clear , logical road direction signs , well in advance of junctions would reduce accidents where people brake sharply because they have nearly missed a turn .
a lot more thinking needs to go into how direction signs are laid out , located and lead the driver confidently to their destination .
eric woodcock , united kingdom tail-gating is at least as dangerous as speeding , but seems to be completely unenforced .
also the comments other people have made here hardly mention it .
why is there such a blind spot about safe distances ?
it would be quite easy to put a forward radar in cars to warn about being too close , perhaps even to enforce a minimum distance , along similar lines to a speed governor .
stephen burke , england i think those head bands are a bad idea .
people will not want to be seen dead in those so will speed through towns in order not to be seen .
come on honestly is that the best they can come up with henry , england manufacturers still do not do enough to stop vehicles from being stolen .
many crimes , not only " joy riding " use stolen cars .
the public are put at great danger by this crime .
enormous police and victims resources are absorbed by the effects and results of stolen cars .
vehicles can be manufactured so that the need to put extra steering locks on them becomes redundant .
alternatively legislation should be brought in so that vehicle security systems are far more difficult to defeat .
scott , yorkshire roads should all be marked every 100 metres with the speed limit .
all speed cameras should have the speed limit painted on them .
half the time you do n't know what the speed limit is on uk roads - a cynical attempt to catch more motorists out ?
rooster , uk " occasionally putting badly damaged and burnt out vehicles at the roadside " - anybody who has ever lived in an inner city area will be well aware that this occurs frequently and does nothing to help road safety !
lee i agree with the comment about sight tests .
as well as doing a breath test at the scene of any incident police officers should also be required to check somebody 's eye sight .
many people do n't realise their eyesight is getting worse as it happens so slow .
i 've seen a number of people have very near misses , who subsequently go for an eye test to find out they need glasses at least for driving , and been amazed at what they were missing as regards things happening around them .
zippy , uk it 's driver psychology which needs to be addressed ahead of any other life-saving devices jessica , uk the revenue collected from " speed cameras " should be used to improve the general standard and safety of the actual roads .
placing cameras on awkward bends and corners is not the answer .
make the roads straight and fence off trees .
or even cut down trees .
at the moment revenue is just another form of taxation .
shaun grimes , uk the telling fact is in the chart : six deaths per hundred thousand people per year .
the figure is miniscule .
do we really need all the inconvenience of the road safety industry for this tiny risk ?
simon richardson , uk many contributors mention the physical distraction of smoking at the wheel .
there seems to be a reluctance to realise that although cigarettes are legal , nicotine is a highly addictive narcotic which often causes symptoms of aggressive behavior .
the smoke also reduces blood oxygen levels and increases levels of carbon monoxide in the blood , which is not conducive to clear thinking .
it seems strange that whilst alcohol is blamed for so much , being " high " off cigarettes is considered " normal " .
mike , uk encourage people to use their cars less .
invest in the public transport infrastructure .
use bicyles for short trips .
allan wishart , uk it 's driver psychology which needs to be addressed ahead of any other life-saving devices .
until people get it into their thick heads that speeding is unacceptable , then you 'll never reduce the number of fatalities on our roads .
it 's the " i 'm bigger and better and faster and more important than you " attitude which is so destructive .
jessica , uk zero mg of alcohol .
no smoking in cars , especially when the driver is trying to locate the dying embers that have fallen between the seats at 80mph on the m1 .
no phones -lrb- soon to be law thankfully -rrb- .
i do n't think shock tactics work .
people invariably believe it wo n't happen to them - just ask a smoker if they fear their own mortality .
without question swift and deterrent punishment to match the offence , including lifetime bans will get their attention .
why do we pander to these lunatics who threaten us and our children everyday ?
simon , london , uk touching as these memorials are , they are not as effective a means of saving lives on the highways as are driving more slowly and lawfully tetman callis , usa road safety would be improved by encouraging better driving standards not lowering speeds to ridiculously low levels which induce boredom and reduce concentration .
some would have the return of a man with red flag walking in front of the vehicle !
equal effort should also go into the quality of car maintenance - a special stringent mot test should be introduced for cars over 8 years old with a view to reducing the nation 's stock of bangers .
bill finch , scotland all of the above ideas will most likely reduce accidents , injuries and death .
there are two other areas that should be addressed .
1 .
a comprehensive driving test -lrb- road and classroom -rrb- that needs to retaken every 10 years , and passed or you loose your driving license .
2 .
giving the police enough resources and incentive to effectively and fairly enforced the current road rules .
these two actions are required in the uk , australia and the us .
counties i have lived , worked and driven in over the last 13 years .
ronald spiers usa , usa i work outdoors with children / students in a rural area .
thirty years ago , more than 95 % of drivers would slow down noticeably or even stop if we were walking in single file along the edge of a narrow road .
these days the proportion of arrogant and aggressive drivers -lrb- mainly men -rrb- speeding past even young children on the same road , leaving just inches to spare , has risen to more than a quarter .
bob burn , wales here in new mexico , there is a long-standing tradition of friends and family erecting roadside crosses along the sides of roads where loved ones have died in automobile accidents .
touching as these memorials are , they are not as effective a means of saving lives on the highways as are driving more slowly and lawfully -lrb- people in new mexico are notorious speeders and runners of stop lights -rrb- , paying attention , and driving sober .
tetman callis , usa the seatbelt was a revelation for some but a huge step forward .
i would like to see more , effective measures for in car safety such as harness type seatbelts that race car drivers wear .
in fact , legal measures should be implemented to take safety innovations from the race-track where safety is a primary concern and translate them into the family vehicle arena .
brett jackson , us ban buses and taxi s from speeding .
it seems that they are above the law in the uk and they too are responsible for a massive number of road deaths / injuries .
ban smoking while driving - lighting up is really dangerous and does detract attention from the road .
ban young men from owning white nova 's n benson , uk two words : slow down ! !
jill , northern ireland it is the appalling standard of driving in this country that needs addressing-inappropriate speed for the conditions can mean that 20mph is too fast .
at the same time too slow a speed can also cause serious accidents-overtaking traffic at 2-3mph more than their speed in the 3rd lane of a motorway is a common cause of tailbacks & subsequent frustration .
the problem is that drivers are not taught " situational awareness " -something that motorcyclists have to develop in order to survive , as do military pilots .
speed cameras are not the answer , as they are incapable of recording hgv 's exceeding their limit -lrb- 56mph -rrb- , by 20mph & yet they will result in prosecution for a driver doing 90mph at 3am on the m6 in cumbria when there is nothing else on the motorway .
mike sterland , uk where can i buy one ?
i 'd rather live than worry about fashion peter , uk some of the suggestions in this article are already in place in new zealand .
" death markers " in the form of white wooden crosses can be seen at the sides of many roads although i believe that these crosses are placed by relatives of people killed in road traffic accidents .
" shock " adverts regularly appear on nz tv at peak viewing times .
they are usually quite graphic and hard hitting .
" random " breath testing is commonplace .
it may not be regarded as random as the police stop all vehicles passing through the check point .
sadly however there are still too many accidents .
an apparent lack of basic driving skills and excessive speed seem to be the main causes .
peter , new zealand lower speed limits , head bands -lrb- where can i buy one ?
i 'd rather live than worry about fashion -rrb- , death markers are all excellent ideas .
driving would be less ' fun ' , and slower , but so what ?
i 'd rather get to my destination ten minutes later than arrive thirty years early in the next world .
peter , uk there appears to be an increase in speed cameras , and a decrease in police patrols .
clearly , the speed cameras aim only to catch speeding motorists -lrb- and , of course , are a great revenue generator -rrb- .
meanwhile , other offences are committed , such as dangerous driving , and are not detected .
we need to see more police patrols .
sean , uk the uk is increasingly becoming the country of excessive restrictions on it 's residents .
from roadside cameras to increasing limitations on daily life , people do not appreciate how much their freedoms are being eroded .
educate but not legislate - if people do n't want to wear a seatbelt so be it - their choice .
time for nanny to leave the citizens to make choices for themselves - glad i left it all behind .
james , usa speeding may very well contributing factor , but is n't driving slow as well ?
i drive 25,000 miles a year and everyday i see car moving at 30-35 mph in a 60 speed limit , this causes frustration among drivers and will encourage them to overtake in places which are not safe .
if a driver is not comfortable doing 60 in a 60 they are obviously not confident and therefore should not be on the road , then again these slow coaches are the same ones who do not slow down when entering a built up 30mph area ! !
you know who you are ! !
aled , uk the government should consider school safety zones where speed limits are reduced still further , extra speed humps are employed , and extra fencing used .
a colour coded scheme -lrb- yellow is used in france -rrb- would also highlight the danger area to motorists .
entry into the zone should be clearly indicated e.g.
' warning , you are entering a school safety zone ' .
james , france maybe a radical solution is to make all occupant safety aids on cars illegal david clift , uk soft cars - instead of hard brittle sharp heavy ponty cars why not make cars from soft but durable foam ?
they would be lighter and more likely to bounce in a collision .
of course this would require replacing all vehicles on the road with rubbery cars in a fairly short time frame , but imagine the jobs that would be created .
mark s , brit in the usa the headband / minimal crash helmet idea is good .
as a recreational downhill skier i have become used to wearing a ski helmet and while this wo n't be able to prevent all damage , it could help .
likewise the headband idea might help and also help users think , " i am not indestructible " . sally deutschmann , canada prohibit by law all insurance that covers damage to vehicles one 's own and others - drivers would be very much more cautious .
john clark , dominican republic why are technological solutions always sought to human problems ?
better training , testing and enforcement of the existing laws would reduce the number of accidents .
mick sheppard , uk i feel everyone should be made to take a motorcycle cbt -lrb- compulsory basic training -rrb- .
i believe this would remove any false sense of security they may have when in a car , and also increase their awareness when on the road ..
gary hutton , spain maybe we are looking at this the wrong way , there is a lot of effort put into making car 's safer for their occupants , this leads to drivers feeling that if they crash then they will walk away uninjured .
maybe a radical solution is to make all occupant safety aids on cars illegal ! !
then maybe you would think twice before breaking the speed limit or driving too close to the car in front .
just an idea .
david clift , uk here is a suggestion for stopping people driving while chatting away on their mobile phone .
simply stop calls being transferred between area cells .
our motorways seem to have phone masts every 10m so they would n't even get a " hello " in before being cut off .
however they could always stop and make their call if its important .
jenny , uk get a big off road vehicle and then your most likely to come off best in a crash with another vehicle .
andrew , oxford lower speed limits , especially on country lanes would be a good idea .
its insane to allow motorist to do 60mph -lrb- and many will be doing 70mph or more -rrb- on winding , narrow , bumpy lanes , where around the next bend there could be a tractor , horse rider , cyclist or walker , plus probably another car approaching at 60mph , resulting in a 120mph collision .
lower speed limits , and an intelligent speed control system could prevent thousands of accidents and lives .
i guarantee most motorists would oppose this , as it would spoil their fun and would out-vote their victims to-be and victims relatives , if there was ever a vote on it .
mark humphries , uk getting stuck behind someone driving far beneath the speed limit because they think they 're being safe is going to frustrate other drivers and is very likely to make a person do something foolish or risky sim , uk / usa i believe the " go-slow " concept is a good idea , but something should be done to encourage people to purchase such automobiles .
i feel a tax credit or some type of financial incentive would be needed to encourage people to buy such vehicles .
higher speeds result in a higher level of fatal accidents ; unfortunately many are ignorant of this .
steve , usa how about going too slow being dangerous ?
getting stuck behind someone driving far beneath the speed limit because they think they 're being safe is going to frustrate other drivers and is very likely to make a person do something foolish or risky .
how about having speed restrictions timed ?
some people prefer driving at night when there 's less traffic on the roads and yet are still restricted to speed limits .
speed should be appropriate to circumstances .
sim , uk / usa it would be nice if people actually wore the seatbelts in their cars - the amount of cars i see in the town where i live in essex not wearing their belts is alarming ; especially when you consider that -lrb- 1 -rrb- most of the drivers were either extremely young or not even born when wearing seatbelts in the uk became law and -lrb- 2 -rrb- the cars being driven are not always new enough to have airbags .
personally , i 'm in favour of drivers not wearing seatbelts who are involved in accidents having their insurance voided - and having to pay for any nhs treatment .
it may sound harsh , but quite often these people have children in the back of the car and are just selfish .
catriona , uk i think that the use of signs to show where fatal or serious accidents have occurred is one of the best measures for stating just how dangerous the roads are .
when i was younger i remember seeing signs which were black spots for places of danger .
well worth considering again .
lisa fahy , england why is it assumed that all people are genetically pre-disposed to being good at driving ?
i think that people who do n't pass their test within 5 attempts should n't be allowed on the road. matt , uk i think there should be a reactions test before you are allowed to drive or rid a motorbike .
dan , uk i welcome any of these ideas if it helps save lives .
my dad was killed in a road accident in 1998 , and it never stops seeming so stupid that someone could be killed while on a cycle path , just because the path was not wide enough for two bikes to cross !
elizabeth warn , albania it 's not only blokes who ride big motorcycles , us ladies do too .
it seems to cause a lot of male car drivers extreme angst to see a lady rider on a big , powerful bike .
so much so in fact that it appears to be a direct challenge to their penis size , and they do their best to cut us up , swerve in front of us and make extravagant hand gestures .
shouting obscenities out of car windows when the sisters pass by is a favourite too .
i suggest making it law to oblige all women bikers to dress like men when on a bike , fake beards , hide it all away jackets and a mighty morphin plastic ranger attitude to the road .
us ladies want to be real men too ! ! !
louisa morgan , uk people drive fast because they are impatient -lrb- more so in the south east of england -rrb- .
people get impatient because they know their car is capable of going faster , especially if stuck behind a slower vehicle .
if all vehicles were restricted to the legal speed limit , there would be no impatience and no speeding .
in theory anyway !
lee , uk i think that all motorists should be made to do a refresher course every 10 years monique denton , uk i am an advanced motorcyclist and have practised as a specialist injury solicitor for over 18 years .
there are two main causes of road accidents that could be reduced relatively cheaply ; -lrb- 1 -rrb- it should be illegal to drive any motor vehicle on a public road having consumed any alcohol at all- there is no logical argument for allowing any consumption of a known inhibitor when driving -lrb- 2 -rrb- all drivers should be subject to compulsory re-test every 10 years up to the age of 50 and every 5 years thereafter .
it is insane that drivers who passed their test 40 years ago can still drive in today 's environment without retesting of their abilities .
mike clarke , england the driving test is too easy .
what is now called the advanced test should be the standard .
then the people operating cars would be able to drive properly and i 'm sure the number of accidents would drop .
increasing the difficulty of obtaining a licence means the threat of having it taken away becomes more serious .
james begent , england stopping distance , stopping distance , stopping distance .
last week i drove along a wet crowded motorway at 65mph , in the leftmost lane , keeping a good distance behind the car in front of me .
and all i could see in my rear-view mirror was the radiator grille of the huge lorry driving about a foot behind me .
people like that should be prosecuted for attempted murder .
but you never hear about that sort of bad driving - what you get are stories about ambulance drivers speeding on empty dry roads while trying to save lives - and being prosecuted for their trouble .
can we be grown-up about it and attack inappropriate speed rather than absolute speeding ?
peter , england i like the head band protection -lrb- do they come in child sizes too ? -rrb- , the speed limiters on vehicles and random breath tests .
i think that all motorists should be made to do a refresher course every 10 years .
i would also like to see compulsory lights and reflective wear for cyclists and motorcyclists monique denton , uk i think all cars should be equipped with reflective vests , so that when cars break down at the roadside , the passengers of the car become clearly visible on the roadside .
far too many people are killed on the hard shoulder each year in the uk and something needs to be done about it .
perhaps they should be supplied as standard with all knew cars ?
caroline walton , uk some cars make a noise when the seatbelt is not plugged in and have proper seatbelts in the middle backseat. both of these features would be great if made compulsory .
emma , uk i recall reading about a proposal for a simple change to cars to save lives - the change was to replace the drivers air bag with a big spike .
the idea is that when drivers can see the danger that they are in if they do not drive carefully , they pay attention and drive very carefully indeed .
martin , uk another idea might be to raise the age at which drivers can learn to drive .
the number of ' ' boy racers " on the road must be a contributory factor to the incidents of speed and carnage on the road -lrb- and probably road rage , too , not to mention noise pollution from the massive sound systems many have - if a mobile ' phone is deemed dangerous what about a stereo booming out 100 + watts of sound ?
surely such levels of sound must be distracting to the point of danger . -rrb- andrew , england i think there is an over emphasis on road safety in this country .
the roads are safer than houses .
more people are now killed in accidents in their home each year than on the roads .
more than 4,000 people are killed annually in the home compared to 3,600 on the roads .
one of the safest places you can be is locked up in a padded cell but would you want to live your life that way ?
colin smith , uk to rebecca : yes it is sometimes vital to get out of someone 's way .
that 's what your brakes are for - speeding is never a solution top danger on the roads .
and to b essada : how would a " driving test " for bikes " save 500 kids per year ? "
that 's more than ten times the annual child pedal cyclist fatality rate .
the real barrier to improved road safety is our refusal to take responsibility .
for the most parts these are not " accidents , " over 90 % are crashes resulting from negligence on the part of at least one road user .
pay more attention to the road and less to trying to shave five seconds off your journey .
guy chapman , uk i think smoking at the wheel is more dangerous than using a mobile phone .
you have to take both hands off the wheel to light it , and if you drop it a burning cigarette will land in your lap - very likely to be distracting !
lisa , scotland maybe we need to concentrate on educating pedestrians on how to use crossings and not automatically say that drivers are evil denzil pemberthy , uk " collisions with trees kill 1,600 people a year in germany , 800 in france and more than 200 in britain " look at the figures !
i think that britain already has some of the world 's safest roads , none of the suggestions would help to make us any safer -lrb- unless we were all banned from driving -rrb- .
as a driver it really annoys me how it seems that anything is the drivers fault .
for instance the kill your speed , not a child campaign , if the child had n't walked out from in front of another car he would n't have been hit in the first place .
maybe we need to concentrate on educating pedestrians on how to use crossings and not automatically say that drivers are evil .
denzil pemberthy , uk i like the indian solution : signs by the road - " do n't drive silly , enjoy the valley " and other little poems .
cute but totally ineffective of course .
delhi also has a large sign showing the daily death and serious injury stats for the city .
averages 4 of each per day .
carrie , uk i think that everyone should be required to take part in a refresher course every 10 to 15 years .
i ca n't think of one person i know over forty who would pass their driving test if they re-took it now .
roz , germany anything that makes people less tunnel visioned when they enter their car ca n't hurt .
may i suggest that in place of the air bag on the steering a large spike is put there instead .
it will certainly make people go slower know that they could be kebabed if they had to reduce their speed quickly .
lucy , uk speeding is viewed by many as the be all and end all of road safety and seems as a consequence to be the only target when it comes to road safety .
as a regular motorway driver i see far more accidents caused by people driving too close to the car in front .
would n't speed camera technology be better employed capturing this rather than targeting someone on what may very well be an empty road .
a simple survey of passing cars still reveals a significant percentage not wearing seatbelts .
tim k , uk better road markings , higher quality tarmac that can reduce ' spray ' on the roads , making visibility better and safer for all .
george williams , uk after seeing the ' the uk 's worst driver ' tv program , i think that anyone caught in an accident should have to take a mini driving test , if they pass , no problem , if they perform ' acceptably ' , they should have their fault pointed out , perhaps made to retake this test , if they fail .. they should lose their licence completely .
all accidents are caused by bad driving - whether going to fast for the conditions , or simply poor judgement. by making drivers take a test , it could be used as a means of ensuring only good drivers get to drive .
andy , uk in england 14 % of the driving population fail to meet the eyesight requirements for driving , which i believe are amongst the laxest in europe .
why do n't the police take any action against such dangerous drivers ?
drivers should be required to take annual eyesight tests , particularly older drivers .
andy gambles , england all cars should be fitted with a breathalyser tube which must be blown into to start the car .
if you fail the test the car wo n't start .
simple ! !
bill robertson , scotland my idea is that no-one should be allowed to drive a car before they have learned how to ride a motor bike and ridden one for two years .
this will only increase their road awareness and make the realise that even in a car they are vulnerable to bad drivers .
russell , london , uk is 71mph any more dangerous than 69mph on a motorway ?
mike wicks , uk making cars out of sponge , banning all drivers except me , the ' safer ' driving is the more risks people take .
a compulsory re-test every 5 years would be a better plan , tackling the real issue - the people who drive !
gnome , uk the only suggestion which i can see being as dangerous as the current situation is a go slow car .
whilst not advocating speeding on a general basis -lrb- although let 's face it , most of us do it if only by a couple of miles an hour -rrb- , there are times when it is vital for safety to be able to get out of someone else 's way , for which it may be necessary to speed for a brief moment .
without the ability to do this , i would certainly have been in a number of accidents in my time which were totally unrelated to my own driving .
rebecca , uk is 71mph any more dangerous than 69mph on a motorway ?
the concentration by the authorities and pressure groups on absolute speeds , instead of appropriate speed is a waste of time .
how many speed cameras do we need to reduce the fatalities on the road to 0 ?
if you concentrate solely on speed , the most cost-effective solution surely would be to bring back the red flag act of the 1800s , when all horseless carriages were required to be preceded by a man walking in front with a red flag .
fortunately the maximum speed under this system is about 3 to 5 mph , so no one would ever get killed on the road again , but the country would grind to a halt .
mike wicks , uk simple a driving test for bike riders .
bikes are great kids toys for off road use .
if they are going to be used on road the rider should either hold , or be escorted by someone holding , a driving licence .
this would save 500 kids a year with very little cost .

in the latest move , the uk government announced this week it would be banning the use of mobile phones while driving .
below is a selection of other suggestions to improve road safety , drawn from various sources .
bbc news online would also like to hear your views by filling out the form below .
head bands would drivers wear these ?
many of the most serious road crashes result in head injuries .
they may not look too fashionable , but these head bands have been identified as one way of reducing the human impact of car accidents .
leading research in this area is the road accident research unit at the university of adelaide , in australia .
its tests have already shown headbands would reduce injuries from frontal car crashes , and research is continuing on other types of crash .
essentially the bands are crash helmets which have been scaled down to look less bulky .
it may be hard to imagine people wearing them - but many people opposed wearing seat belts when they were introduced .
go-slow cars cars could stop their own drivers from speeding experts at the university of leeds are working on a car equipped with a speed limiter which makes it impossible to break the legal limit .
professor of transport safety , oliver carsten , said : " we believe this kind of technology can contribute to road safety .
" if all drivers kept to the speed limit , deaths on the road -lrb- in the uk -rrb- would fall by 37 % , over 1,200 each year . "
the system has been dubbed intelligent speed adaptation .
death markers black markers signify deaths and red indicate serious injuries an idea used in various countries where the risk of crashes increases on long stretches of road .
black markers -lrb- usually small wooden posts -rrb- are installed at locations where fatal accidents have occurred .
they may be slightly morbid , but these markers , which feature small crosses at the top , are sobering reminder of how dangerous driving can be .
they also serve to highlight corners or stretches of road which may be more hazardous than they appear .
additional red markers indicate sites of crashes which resulted in serious injuries .
design and roadside objects road design is crucial many vehicle deaths would be avoided if authorities paid closer attention to removing or fencing off roadside objects , such as dangerous trees and posts .
collisions with trees kill 1,600 people a year in germany , 800 in france and more than 200 in britain .
general design of roads is also important , with some research suggesting poor design contributes to 33 % of crashes .
refresher courses middle-aged men are getting back on the road a concern raised by the aa is the number of middle-aged men " rediscovering their youth " by getting back on their motorcycles .
it can sometimes be too late when they discover the road environment has changed over the last 20 to 30 years .
many would benefit from refresher courses to hone their skills , which may have diminished over the years and must be adapted to modern road conditions .
hitting home cars can be fragile machines many people do not fully comprehend the horror of car crashes , and thus do not drive accordingly .
numerous advertisements have used shocking images of accidents in the hope of reforming attitudes .
some say this could be taken a step further by occasionally putting badly damaged and burnt out vehicles at the roadside .
it would surely be a stark reminder of how fragile a car can be when travelling at speed .
lower speed limits is 40mph too fast ?
it seems obvious , but few people realise the difference made by slower driving .
not only are you less likely to suffer serious injuries , but there is less chance of the accident happening in the first place .
research in areas where the speed limit is 60km / h -lrb- just under 40mph -rrb- has shown the chance of crashing could be reduced by as much as 40 % if the limit was lowered by just 10km / h .
however suggestions of lowering speed limits often encounter resistance from motorists who are in a hurry to get where they are going .
drink driving drunk drivers can be lethal alcohol is still a major cause of car crashes .
the royal society for the prevention of accidents says the allowable amount of alcohol should be lowered from 80mg to 50mg .
furthermore , it wants police empowered to test drivers randomly .
" they should be able to test anywhere at any time , " a spokesman said .
a selection of views from bbc news online readers : clear , logical road direction signs , well in advance of junctions would reduce accidents where people brake sharply because they have nearly missed a turn .
a lot more thinking needs to go into how direction signs are laid out , located and lead the driver confidently to their destination .
eric woodcock , united kingdom tail-gating is at least as dangerous as speeding , but seems to be completely unenforced .
also the comments other people have made here hardly mention it .
why is there such a blind spot about safe distances ?
it would be quite easy to put a forward radar in cars to warn about being too close , perhaps even to enforce a minimum distance , along similar lines to a speed governor .
stephen burke , england i think those head bands are a bad idea .
people will not want to be seen dead in those so will speed through towns in order not to be seen .
come on honestly is that the best they can come up with henry , england manufacturers still do not do enough to stop vehicles from being stolen .
many crimes , not only " joy riding " use stolen cars .
the public are put at great danger by this crime .
enormous police and victims resources are absorbed by the effects and results of stolen cars .
vehicles can be manufactured so that the need to put extra steering locks on them becomes redundant .
alternatively legislation should be brought in so that vehicle security systems are far more difficult to defeat .
scott , yorkshire roads should all be marked every 100 metres with the speed limit .
all speed cameras should have the speed limit painted on them .
half the time you do n't know what the speed limit is on uk roads - a cynical attempt to catch more motorists out ?
rooster , uk " occasionally putting badly damaged and burnt out vehicles at the roadside " - anybody who has ever lived in an inner city area will be well aware that this occurs frequently and does nothing to help road safety !
lee i agree with the comment about sight tests .
as well as doing a breath test at the scene of any incident police officers should also be required to check somebody 's eye sight .
many people do n't realise their eyesight is getting worse as it happens so slow .
i 've seen a number of people have very near misses , who subsequently go for an eye test to find out they need glasses at least for driving , and been amazed at what they were missing as regards things happening around them .
zippy , uk it 's driver psychology which needs to be addressed ahead of any other life-saving devices jessica , uk the revenue collected from " speed cameras " should be used to improve the general standard and safety of the actual roads .
placing cameras on awkward bends and corners is not the answer .
make the roads straight and fence off trees .
or even cut down trees .
at the moment revenue is just another form of taxation .
shaun grimes , uk the telling fact is in the chart : six deaths per hundred thousand people per year .
the figure is miniscule .
do we really need all the inconvenience of the road safety industry for this tiny risk ?
simon richardson , uk many contributors mention the physical distraction of smoking at the wheel .
there seems to be a reluctance to realise that although cigarettes are legal , nicotine is a highly addictive narcotic which often causes symptoms of aggressive behavior .
the smoke also reduces blood oxygen levels and increases levels of carbon monoxide in the blood , which is not conducive to clear thinking .
it seems strange that whilst alcohol is blamed for so much , being " high " off cigarettes is considered " normal " .
mike , uk encourage people to use their cars less .
invest in the public transport infrastructure .
use bicyles for short trips .
allan wishart , uk it 's driver psychology which needs to be addressed ahead of any other life-saving devices .
until people get it into their thick heads that speeding is unacceptable , then you 'll never reduce the number of fatalities on our roads .
it 's the " i 'm bigger and better and faster and more important than you " attitude which is so destructive .
jessica , uk zero mg of alcohol .
no smoking in cars , especially when the driver is trying to locate the dying embers that have fallen between the seats at 80mph on the m1 .
no phones -lrb- soon to be law thankfully -rrb- .
i do n't think shock tactics work .
people invariably believe it wo n't happen to them - just ask a smoker if they fear their own mortality .
without question swift and deterrent punishment to match the offence , including lifetime bans will get their attention .
why do we pander to these lunatics who threaten us and our children everyday ?
simon , london , uk touching as these memorials are , they are not as effective a means of saving lives on the highways as are driving more slowly and lawfully tetman callis , usa road safety would be improved by encouraging better driving standards not lowering speeds to ridiculously low levels which induce boredom and reduce concentration .
some would have the return of a man with red flag walking in front of the vehicle !
equal effort should also go into the quality of car maintenance - a special stringent mot test should be introduced for cars over 8 years old with a view to reducing the nation 's stock of bangers .
bill finch , scotland all of the above ideas will most likely reduce accidents , injuries and death .
there are two other areas that should be addressed .
1 .
a comprehensive driving test -lrb- road and classroom -rrb- that needs to retaken every 10 years , and passed or you loose your driving license .
2 .
giving the police enough resources and incentive to effectively and fairly enforced the current road rules .
these two actions are required in the uk , australia and the us .
counties i have lived , worked and driven in over the last 13 years .
ronald spiers usa , usa i work outdoors with children / students in a rural area .
thirty years ago , more than 95 % of drivers would slow down noticeably or even stop if we were walking in single file along the edge of a narrow road .
these days the proportion of arrogant and aggressive drivers -lrb- mainly men -rrb- speeding past even young children on the same road , leaving just inches to spare , has risen to more than a quarter .
bob burn , wales here in new mexico , there is a long-standing tradition of friends and family erecting roadside crosses along the sides of roads where loved ones have died in automobile accidents .
touching as these memorials are , they are not as effective a means of saving lives on the highways as are driving more slowly and lawfully -lrb- people in new mexico are notorious speeders and runners of stop lights -rrb- , paying attention , and driving sober .
tetman callis , usa the seatbelt was a revelation for some but a huge step forward .
i would like to see more , effective measures for in car safety such as harness type seatbelts that race car drivers wear .
in fact , legal measures should be implemented to take safety innovations from the race-track where safety is a primary concern and translate them into the family vehicle arena .
brett jackson , us ban buses and taxi s from speeding .
it seems that they are above the law in the uk and they too are responsible for a massive number of road deaths / injuries .
ban smoking while driving - lighting up is really dangerous and does detract attention from the road .
ban young men from owning white nova 's n benson , uk two words : slow down ! !
jill , northern ireland it is the appalling standard of driving in this country that needs addressing-inappropriate speed for the conditions can mean that 20mph is too fast .
at the same time too slow a speed can also cause serious accidents-overtaking traffic at 2-3mph more than their speed in the 3rd lane of a motorway is a common cause of tailbacks & subsequent frustration .
the problem is that drivers are not taught " situational awareness " -something that motorcyclists have to develop in order to survive , as do military pilots .
speed cameras are not the answer , as they are incapable of recording hgv 's exceeding their limit -lrb- 56mph -rrb- , by 20mph & yet they will result in prosecution for a driver doing 90mph at 3am on the m6 in cumbria when there is nothing else on the motorway .
mike sterland , uk where can i buy one ?
i 'd rather live than worry about fashion peter , uk some of the suggestions in this article are already in place in new zealand .
" death markers " in the form of white wooden crosses can be seen at the sides of many roads although i believe that these crosses are placed by relatives of people killed in road traffic accidents .
" shock " adverts regularly appear on nz tv at peak viewing times .
they are usually quite graphic and hard hitting .
" random " breath testing is commonplace .
it may not be regarded as random as the police stop all vehicles passing through the check point .
sadly however there are still too many accidents .
an apparent lack of basic driving skills and excessive speed seem to be the main causes .
peter , new zealand lower speed limits , head bands -lrb- where can i buy one ?
i 'd rather live than worry about fashion -rrb- , death markers are all excellent ideas .
driving would be less ' fun ' , and slower , but so what ?
i 'd rather get to my destination ten minutes later than arrive thirty years early in the next world .
peter , uk there appears to be an increase in speed cameras , and a decrease in police patrols .
clearly , the speed cameras aim only to catch speeding motorists -lrb- and , of course , are a great revenue generator -rrb- .
meanwhile , other offences are committed , such as dangerous driving , and are not detected .
we need to see more police patrols .
sean , uk the uk is increasingly becoming the country of excessive restrictions on it 's residents .
from roadside cameras to increasing limitations on daily life , people do not appreciate how much their freedoms are being eroded .
educate but not legislate - if people do n't want to wear a seatbelt so be it - their choice .
time for nanny to leave the citizens to make choices for themselves - glad i left it all behind .
james , usa speeding may very well contributing factor , but is n't driving slow as well ?
i drive 25,000 miles a year and everyday i see car moving at 30-35 mph in a 60 speed limit , this causes frustration among drivers and will encourage them to overtake in places which are not safe .
if a driver is not comfortable doing 60 in a 60 they are obviously not confident and therefore should not be on the road , then again these slow coaches are the same ones who do not slow down when entering a built up 30mph area ! !
you know who you are ! !
aled , uk the government should consider school safety zones where speed limits are reduced still further , extra speed humps are employed , and extra fencing used .
a colour coded scheme -lrb- yellow is used in france -rrb- would also highlight the danger area to motorists .
entry into the zone should be clearly indicated e.g.
' warning , you are entering a school safety zone ' .
james , france maybe a radical solution is to make all occupant safety aids on cars illegal david clift , uk soft cars - instead of hard brittle sharp heavy ponty cars why not make cars from soft but durable foam ?
they would be lighter and more likely to bounce in a collision .
of course this would require replacing all vehicles on the road with rubbery cars in a fairly short time frame , but imagine the jobs that would be created .
mark s , brit in the usa the headband / minimal crash helmet idea is good .
as a recreational downhill skier i have become used to wearing a ski helmet and while this wo n't be able to prevent all damage , it could help .
likewise the headband idea might help and also help users think , " i am not indestructible " . sally deutschmann , canada prohibit by law all insurance that covers damage to vehicles one 's own and others - drivers would be very much more cautious .
john clark , dominican republic why are technological solutions always sought to human problems ?
better training , testing and enforcement of the existing laws would reduce the number of accidents .
mick sheppard , uk i feel everyone should be made to take a motorcycle cbt -lrb- compulsory basic training -rrb- .
i believe this would remove any false sense of security they may have when in a car , and also increase their awareness when on the road ..
gary hutton , spain maybe we are looking at this the wrong way , there is a lot of effort put into making car 's safer for their occupants , this leads to drivers feeling that if they crash then they will walk away uninjured .
maybe a radical solution is to make all occupant safety aids on cars illegal ! !
then maybe you would think twice before breaking the speed limit or driving too close to the car in front .
just an idea .
david clift , uk here is a suggestion for stopping people driving while chatting away on their mobile phone .
simply stop calls being transferred between area cells .
our motorways seem to have phone masts every 10m so they would n't even get a " hello " in before being cut off .
however they could always stop and make their call if its important .
jenny , uk get a big off road vehicle and then your most likely to come off best in a crash with another vehicle .
andrew , oxford lower speed limits , especially on country lanes would be a good idea .
its insane to allow motorist to do 60mph -lrb- and many will be doing 70mph or more -rrb- on winding , narrow , bumpy lanes , where around the next bend there could be a tractor , horse rider , cyclist or walker , plus probably another car approaching at 60mph , resulting in a 120mph collision .
lower speed limits , and an intelligent speed control system could prevent thousands of accidents and lives .
i guarantee most motorists would oppose this , as it would spoil their fun and would out-vote their victims to-be and victims relatives , if there was ever a vote on it .
mark humphries , uk getting stuck behind someone driving far beneath the speed limit because they think they 're being safe is going to frustrate other drivers and is very likely to make a person do something foolish or risky sim , uk / usa i believe the " go-slow " concept is a good idea , but something should be done to encourage people to purchase such automobiles .
i feel a tax credit or some type of financial incentive would be needed to encourage people to buy such vehicles .
higher speeds result in a higher level of fatal accidents ; unfortunately many are ignorant of this .
steve , usa how about going too slow being dangerous ?
getting stuck behind someone driving far beneath the speed limit because they think they 're being safe is going to frustrate other drivers and is very likely to make a person do something foolish or risky .
how about having speed restrictions timed ?
some people prefer driving at night when there 's less traffic on the roads and yet are still restricted to speed limits .
speed should be appropriate to circumstances .
sim , uk / usa it would be nice if people actually wore the seatbelts in their cars - the amount of cars i see in the town where i live in essex not wearing their belts is alarming ; especially when you consider that -lrb- 1 -rrb- most of the drivers were either extremely young or not even born when wearing seatbelts in the uk became law and -lrb- 2 -rrb- the cars being driven are not always new enough to have airbags .
personally , i 'm in favour of drivers not wearing seatbelts who are involved in accidents having their insurance voided - and having to pay for any nhs treatment .
it may sound harsh , but quite often these people have children in the back of the car and are just selfish .
catriona , uk i think that the use of signs to show where fatal or serious accidents have occurred is one of the best measures for stating just how dangerous the roads are .
when i was younger i remember seeing signs which were black spots for places of danger .
well worth considering again .
lisa fahy , england why is it assumed that all people are genetically pre-disposed to being good at driving ?
i think that people who do n't pass their test within 5 attempts should n't be allowed on the road. matt , uk i think there should be a reactions test before you are allowed to drive or rid a motorbike .
dan , uk i welcome any of these ideas if it helps save lives .
my dad was killed in a road accident in 1998 , and it never stops seeming so stupid that someone could be killed while on a cycle path , just because the path was not wide enough for two bikes to cross !
elizabeth warn , albania it 's not only blokes who ride big motorcycles , us ladies do too .
it seems to cause a lot of male car drivers extreme angst to see a lady rider on a big , powerful bike .
so much so in fact that it appears to be a direct challenge to their penis size , and they do their best to cut us up , swerve in front of us and make extravagant hand gestures .
shouting obscenities out of car windows when the sisters pass by is a favourite too .
i suggest making it law to oblige all women bikers to dress like men when on a bike , fake beards , hide it all away jackets and a mighty morphin plastic ranger attitude to the road .
us ladies want to be real men too ! ! !
louisa morgan , uk people drive fast because they are impatient -lrb- more so in the south east of england -rrb- .
people get impatient because they know their car is capable of going faster , especially if stuck behind a slower vehicle .
if all vehicles were restricted to the legal speed limit , there would be no impatience and no speeding .
in theory anyway !
lee , uk i think that all motorists should be made to do a refresher course every 10 years monique denton , uk i am an advanced motorcyclist and have practised as a specialist injury solicitor for over 18 years .
there are two main causes of road accidents that could be reduced relatively cheaply ; -lrb- 1 -rrb- it should be illegal to drive any motor vehicle on a public road having consumed any alcohol at all- there is no logical argument for allowing any consumption of a known inhibitor when driving -lrb- 2 -rrb- all drivers should be subject to compulsory re-test every 10 years up to the age of 50 and every 5 years thereafter .
it is insane that drivers who passed their test 40 years ago can still drive in today 's environment without retesting of their abilities .
mike clarke , england the driving test is too easy .
what is now called the advanced test should be the standard .
then the people operating cars would be able to drive properly and i 'm sure the number of accidents would drop .
increasing the difficulty of obtaining a licence means the threat of having it taken away becomes more serious .
james begent , england stopping distance , stopping distance , stopping distance .
last week i drove along a wet crowded motorway at 65mph , in the leftmost lane , keeping a good distance behind the car in front of me .
and all i could see in my rear-view mirror was the radiator grille of the huge lorry driving about a foot behind me .
people like that should be prosecuted for attempted murder .
but you never hear about that sort of bad driving - what you get are stories about ambulance drivers speeding on empty dry roads while trying to save lives - and being prosecuted for their trouble .
can we be grown-up about it and attack inappropriate speed rather than absolute speeding ?
peter , england i like the head band protection -lrb- do they come in child sizes too ? -rrb- , the speed limiters on vehicles and random breath tests .
i think that all motorists should be made to do a refresher course every 10 years .
i would also like to see compulsory lights and reflective wear for cyclists and motorcyclists monique denton , uk i think all cars should be equipped with reflective vests , so that when cars break down at the roadside , the passengers of the car become clearly visible on the roadside .
far too many people are killed on the hard shoulder each year in the uk and something needs to be done about it .
perhaps they should be supplied as standard with all knew cars ?
caroline walton , uk some cars make a noise when the seatbelt is not plugged in and have proper seatbelts in the middle backseat. both of these features would be great if made compulsory .
emma , uk i recall reading about a proposal for a simple change to cars to save lives - the change was to replace the drivers air bag with a big spike .
the idea is that when drivers can see the danger that they are in if they do not drive carefully , they pay attention and drive very carefully indeed .
martin , uk another idea might be to raise the age at which drivers can learn to drive .
the number of ' ' boy racers " on the road must be a contributory factor to the incidents of speed and carnage on the road -lrb- and probably road rage , too , not to mention noise pollution from the massive sound systems many have - if a mobile ' phone is deemed dangerous what about a stereo booming out 100 + watts of sound ?
surely such levels of sound must be distracting to the point of danger . -rrb- andrew , england i think there is an over emphasis on road safety in this country .
the roads are safer than houses .
more people are now killed in accidents in their home each year than on the roads .
more than 4,000 people are killed annually in the home compared to 3,600 on the roads .
one of the safest places you can be is locked up in a padded cell but would you want to live your life that way ?
colin smith , uk to rebecca : yes it is sometimes vital to get out of someone 's way .
that 's what your brakes are for - speeding is never a solution top danger on the roads .
and to b essada : how would a " driving test " for bikes " save 500 kids per year ? "
that 's more than ten times the annual child pedal cyclist fatality rate .
the real barrier to improved road safety is our refusal to take responsibility .
for the most parts these are not " accidents , " over 90 % are crashes resulting from negligence on the part of at least one road user .
pay more attention to the road and less to trying to shave five seconds off your journey .
guy chapman , uk i think smoking at the wheel is more dangerous than using a mobile phone .
you have to take both hands off the wheel to light it , and if you drop it a burning cigarette will land in your lap - very likely to be distracting !
lisa , scotland maybe we need to concentrate on educating pedestrians on how to use crossings and not automatically say that drivers are evil denzil pemberthy , uk " collisions with trees kill 1,600 people a year in germany , 800 in france and more than 200 in britain " look at the figures !
i think that britain already has some of the world 's safest roads , none of the suggestions would help to make us any safer -lrb- unless we were all banned from driving -rrb- .
as a driver it really annoys me how it seems that anything is the drivers fault .
for instance the kill your speed , not a child campaign , if the child had n't walked out from in front of another car he would n't have been hit in the first place .
maybe we need to concentrate on educating pedestrians on how to use crossings and not automatically say that drivers are evil .
denzil pemberthy , uk i like the indian solution : signs by the road - " do n't drive silly , enjoy the valley " and other little poems .
cute but totally ineffective of course .
delhi also has a large sign showing the daily death and serious injury stats for the city .
averages 4 of each per day .
carrie , uk i think that everyone should be required to take part in a refresher course every 10 to 15 years .
i ca n't think of one person i know over forty who would pass their driving test if they re-took it now .
roz , germany anything that makes people less tunnel visioned when they enter their car ca n't hurt .
may i suggest that in place of the air bag on the steering a large spike is put there instead .
it will certainly make people go slower know that they could be kebabed if they had to reduce their speed quickly .
lucy , uk speeding is viewed by many as the be all and end all of road safety and seems as a consequence to be the only target when it comes to road safety .
as a regular motorway driver i see far more accidents caused by people driving too close to the car in front .
would n't speed camera technology be better employed capturing this rather than targeting someone on what may very well be an empty road .
a simple survey of passing cars still reveals a significant percentage not wearing seatbelts .
tim k , uk better road markings , higher quality tarmac that can reduce ' spray ' on the roads , making visibility better and safer for all .
george williams , uk after seeing the ' the uk 's worst driver ' tv program , i think that anyone caught in an accident should have to take a mini driving test , if they pass , no problem , if they perform ' acceptably ' , they should have their fault pointed out , perhaps made to retake this test , if they fail .. they should lose their licence completely .
all accidents are caused by bad driving - whether going to fast for the conditions , or simply poor judgement. by making drivers take a test , it could be used as a means of ensuring only good drivers get to drive .
andy , uk in england 14 % of the driving population fail to meet the eyesight requirements for driving , which i believe are amongst the laxest in europe .
why do n't the police take any action against such dangerous drivers ?
drivers should be required to take annual eyesight tests , particularly older drivers .
andy gambles , england all cars should be fitted with a breathalyser tube which must be blown into to start the car .
if you fail the test the car wo n't start .
simple ! !
bill robertson , scotland my idea is that no-one should be allowed to drive a car before they have learned how to ride a motor bike and ridden one for two years .
this will only increase their road awareness and make the realise that even in a car they are vulnerable to bad drivers .
russell , london , uk is 71mph any more dangerous than 69mph on a motorway ?
mike wicks , uk making cars out of sponge , banning all drivers except me , the ' safer ' driving is the more risks people take .
a compulsory re-test every 5 years would be a better plan , tackling the real issue - the people who drive !
gnome , uk the only suggestion which i can see being as dangerous as the current situation is a go slow car .
whilst not advocating speeding on a general basis -lrb- although let 's face it , most of us do it if only by a couple of miles an hour -rrb- , there are times when it is vital for safety to be able to get out of someone else 's way , for which it may be necessary to speed for a brief moment .
without the ability to do this , i would certainly have been in a number of accidents in my time which were totally unrelated to my own driving .
rebecca , uk is 71mph any more dangerous than 69mph on a motorway ?
the concentration by the authorities and pressure groups on absolute speeds , instead of appropriate speed is a waste of time .
how many speed cameras do we need to reduce the fatalities on the road to 0 ?
if you concentrate solely on speed , the most cost-effective solution surely would be to bring back the red flag act of the 1800s , when all horseless carriages were required to be preceded by a man walking in front with a red flag .
fortunately the maximum speed under this system is about 3 to 5 mph , so no one would ever get killed on the road again , but the country would grind to a halt .
mike wicks , uk simple a driving test for bike riders .
bikes are great kids toys for off road use .
if they are going to be used on road the rider should either hold , or be escorted by someone holding , a driving licence .
this would save 500 kids a year with very little cost .

in the latest move , the uk government announced this week it would be banning the use of mobile phones while driving .
below is a selection of other suggestions to improve road safety , drawn from various sources .
bbc news online would also like to hear your views by filling out the form below .
head bands would drivers wear these ?
many of the most serious road crashes result in head injuries .
they may not look too fashionable , but these head bands have been identified as one way of reducing the human impact of car accidents .
leading research in this area is the road accident research unit at the university of adelaide , in australia .
its tests have already shown headbands would reduce injuries from frontal car crashes , and research is continuing on other types of crash .
essentially the bands are crash helmets which have been scaled down to look less bulky .
it may be hard to imagine people wearing them - but many people opposed wearing seat belts when they were introduced .
go-slow cars cars could stop their own drivers from speeding experts at the university of leeds are working on a car equipped with a speed limiter which makes it impossible to break the legal limit .
professor of transport safety , oliver carsten , said : " we believe this kind of technology can contribute to road safety .
" if all drivers kept to the speed limit , deaths on the road -lrb- in the uk -rrb- would fall by 37 % , over 1,200 each year . "
the system has been dubbed intelligent speed adaptation .
death markers black markers signify deaths and red indicate serious injuries an idea used in various countries where the risk of crashes increases on long stretches of road .
black markers -lrb- usually small wooden posts -rrb- are installed at locations where fatal accidents have occurred .
they may be slightly morbid , but these markers , which feature small crosses at the top , are sobering reminder of how dangerous driving can be .
they also serve to highlight corners or stretches of road which may be more hazardous than they appear .
additional red markers indicate sites of crashes which resulted in serious injuries .
design and roadside objects road design is crucial many vehicle deaths would be avoided if authorities paid closer attention to removing or fencing off roadside objects , such as dangerous trees and posts .
collisions with trees kill 1,600 people a year in germany , 800 in france and more than 200 in britain .
general design of roads is also important , with some research suggesting poor design contributes to 33 % of crashes .
refresher courses middle-aged men are getting back on the road a concern raised by the aa is the number of middle-aged men " rediscovering their youth " by getting back on their motorcycles .
it can sometimes be too late when they discover the road environment has changed over the last 20 to 30 years .
many would benefit from refresher courses to hone their skills , which may have diminished over the years and must be adapted to modern road conditions .
hitting home cars can be fragile machines many people do not fully comprehend the horror of car crashes , and thus do not drive accordingly .
numerous advertisements have used shocking images of accidents in the hope of reforming attitudes .
some say this could be taken a step further by occasionally putting badly damaged and burnt out vehicles at the roadside .
it would surely be a stark reminder of how fragile a car can be when travelling at speed .
lower speed limits is 40mph too fast ?
it seems obvious , but few people realise the difference made by slower driving .
not only are you less likely to suffer serious injuries , but there is less chance of the accident happening in the first place .
research in areas where the speed limit is 60km / h -lrb- just under 40mph -rrb- has shown the chance of crashing could be reduced by as much as 40 % if the limit was lowered by just 10km / h .
however suggestions of lowering speed limits often encounter resistance from motorists who are in a hurry to get where they are going .
drink driving drunk drivers can be lethal alcohol is still a major cause of car crashes .
the royal society for the prevention of accidents says the allowable amount of alcohol should be lowered from 80mg to 50mg .
furthermore , it wants police empowered to test drivers randomly .
" they should be able to test anywhere at any time , " a spokesman said .
a selection of views from bbc news online readers : clear , logical road direction signs , well in advance of junctions would reduce accidents where people brake sharply because they have nearly missed a turn .
a lot more thinking needs to go into how direction signs are laid out , located and lead the driver confidently to their destination .
eric woodcock , united kingdom tail-gating is at least as dangerous as speeding , but seems to be completely unenforced .
also the comments other people have made here hardly mention it .
why is there such a blind spot about safe distances ?
it would be quite easy to put a forward radar in cars to warn about being too close , perhaps even to enforce a minimum distance , along similar lines to a speed governor .
stephen burke , england i think those head bands are a bad idea .
people will not want to be seen dead in those so will speed through towns in order not to be seen .
come on honestly is that the best they can come up with henry , england manufacturers still do not do enough to stop vehicles from being stolen .
many crimes , not only " joy riding " use stolen cars .
the public are put at great danger by this crime .
enormous police and victims resources are absorbed by the effects and results of stolen cars .
vehicles can be manufactured so that the need to put extra steering locks on them becomes redundant .
alternatively legislation should be brought in so that vehicle security systems are far more difficult to defeat .
scott , yorkshire roads should all be marked every 100 metres with the speed limit .
all speed cameras should have the speed limit painted on them .
half the time you do n't know what the speed limit is on uk roads - a cynical attempt to catch more motorists out ?
rooster , uk " occasionally putting badly damaged and burnt out vehicles at the roadside " - anybody who has ever lived in an inner city area will be well aware that this occurs frequently and does nothing to help road safety !
lee i agree with the comment about sight tests .
as well as doing a breath test at the scene of any incident police officers should also be required to check somebody 's eye sight .
many people do n't realise their eyesight is getting worse as it happens so slow .
i 've seen a number of people have very near misses , who subsequently go for an eye test to find out they need glasses at least for driving , and been amazed at what they were missing as regards things happening around them .
zippy , uk it 's driver psychology which needs to be addressed ahead of any other life-saving devices jessica , uk the revenue collected from " speed cameras " should be used to improve the general standard and safety of the actual roads .
placing cameras on awkward bends and corners is not the answer .
make the roads straight and fence off trees .
or even cut down trees .
at the moment revenue is just another form of taxation .
shaun grimes , uk the telling fact is in the chart : six deaths per hundred thousand people per year .
the figure is miniscule .
do we really need all the inconvenience of the road safety industry for this tiny risk ?
simon richardson , uk many contributors mention the physical distraction of smoking at the wheel .
there seems to be a reluctance to realise that although cigarettes are legal , nicotine is a highly addictive narcotic which often causes symptoms of aggressive behavior .
the smoke also reduces blood oxygen levels and increases levels of carbon monoxide in the blood , which is not conducive to clear thinking .
it seems strange that whilst alcohol is blamed for so much , being " high " off cigarettes is considered " normal " .
mike , uk encourage people to use their cars less .
invest in the public transport infrastructure .
use bicyles for short trips .
allan wishart , uk it 's driver psychology which needs to be addressed ahead of any other life-saving devices .
until people get it into their thick heads that speeding is unacceptable , then you 'll never reduce the number of fatalities on our roads .
it 's the " i 'm bigger and better and faster and more important than you " attitude which is so destructive .
jessica , uk zero mg of alcohol .
no smoking in cars , especially when the driver is trying to locate the dying embers that have fallen between the seats at 80mph on the m1 .
no phones -lrb- soon to be law thankfully -rrb- .
i do n't think shock tactics work .
people invariably believe it wo n't happen to them - just ask a smoker if they fear their own mortality .
without question swift and deterrent punishment to match the offence , including lifetime bans will get their attention .
why do we pander to these lunatics who threaten us and our children everyday ?
simon , london , uk touching as these memorials are , they are not as effective a means of saving lives on the highways as are driving more slowly and lawfully tetman callis , usa road safety would be improved by encouraging better driving standards not lowering speeds to ridiculously low levels which induce boredom and reduce concentration .
some would have the return of a man with red flag walking in front of the vehicle !
equal effort should also go into the quality of car maintenance - a special stringent mot test should be introduced for cars over 8 years old with a view to reducing the nation 's stock of bangers .
bill finch , scotland all of the above ideas will most likely reduce accidents , injuries and death .
there are two other areas that should be addressed .
1 .
a comprehensive driving test -lrb- road and classroom -rrb- that needs to retaken every 10 years , and passed or you loose your driving license .
2 .
giving the police enough resources and incentive to effectively and fairly enforced the current road rules .
these two actions are required in the uk , australia and the us .
counties i have lived , worked and driven in over the last 13 years .
ronald spiers usa , usa i work outdoors with children / students in a rural area .
thirty years ago , more than 95 % of drivers would slow down noticeably or even stop if we were walking in single file along the edge of a narrow road .
these days the proportion of arrogant and aggressive drivers -lrb- mainly men -rrb- speeding past even young children on the same road , leaving just inches to spare , has risen to more than a quarter .
bob burn , wales here in new mexico , there is a long-standing tradition of friends and family erecting roadside crosses along the sides of roads where loved ones have died in automobile accidents .
touching as these memorials are , they are not as effective a means of saving lives on the highways as are driving more slowly and lawfully -lrb- people in new mexico are notorious speeders and runners of stop lights -rrb- , paying attention , and driving sober .
tetman callis , usa the seatbelt was a revelation for some but a huge step forward .
i would like to see more , effective measures for in car safety such as harness type seatbelts that race car drivers wear .
in fact , legal measures should be implemented to take safety innovations from the race-track where safety is a primary concern and translate them into the family vehicle arena .
brett jackson , us ban buses and taxi s from speeding .
it seems that they are above the law in the uk and they too are responsible for a massive number of road deaths / injuries .
ban smoking while driving - lighting up is really dangerous and does detract attention from the road .
ban young men from owning white nova 's n benson , uk two words : slow down ! !
jill , northern ireland it is the appalling standard of driving in this country that needs addressing-inappropriate speed for the conditions can mean that 20mph is too fast .
at the same time too slow a speed can also cause serious accidents-overtaking traffic at 2-3mph more than their speed in the 3rd lane of a motorway is a common cause of tailbacks & subsequent frustration .
the problem is that drivers are not taught " situational awareness " -something that motorcyclists have to develop in order to survive , as do military pilots .
speed cameras are not the answer , as they are incapable of recording hgv 's exceeding their limit -lrb- 56mph -rrb- , by 20mph & yet they will result in prosecution for a driver doing 90mph at 3am on the m6 in cumbria when there is nothing else on the motorway .
mike sterland , uk where can i buy one ?
i 'd rather live than worry about fashion peter , uk some of the suggestions in this article are already in place in new zealand .
" death markers " in the form of white wooden crosses can be seen at the sides of many roads although i believe that these crosses are placed by relatives of people killed in road traffic accidents .
" shock " adverts regularly appear on nz tv at peak viewing times .
they are usually quite graphic and hard hitting .
" random " breath testing is commonplace .
it may not be regarded as random as the police stop all vehicles passing through the check point .
sadly however there are still too many accidents .
an apparent lack of basic driving skills and excessive speed seem to be the main causes .
peter , new zealand lower speed limits , head bands -lrb- where can i buy one ?
i 'd rather live than worry about fashion -rrb- , death markers are all excellent ideas .
driving would be less ' fun ' , and slower , but so what ?
i 'd rather get to my destination ten minutes later than arrive thirty years early in the next world .
peter , uk there appears to be an increase in speed cameras , and a decrease in police patrols .
clearly , the speed cameras aim only to catch speeding motorists -lrb- and , of course , are a great revenue generator -rrb- .
meanwhile , other offences are committed , such as dangerous driving , and are not detected .
we need to see more police patrols .
sean , uk the uk is increasingly becoming the country of excessive restrictions on it 's residents .
from roadside cameras to increasing limitations on daily life , people do not appreciate how much their freedoms are being eroded .
educate but not legislate - if people do n't want to wear a seatbelt so be it - their choice .
time for nanny to leave the citizens to make choices for themselves - glad i left it all behind .
james , usa speeding may very well contributing factor , but is n't driving slow as well ?
i drive 25,000 miles a year and everyday i see car moving at 30-35 mph in a 60 speed limit , this causes frustration among drivers and will encourage them to overtake in places which are not safe .
if a driver is not comfortable doing 60 in a 60 they are obviously not confident and therefore should not be on the road , then again these slow coaches are the same ones who do not slow down when entering a built up 30mph area ! !
you know who you are ! !
aled , uk the government should consider school safety zones where speed limits are reduced still further , extra speed humps are employed , and extra fencing used .
a colour coded scheme -lrb- yellow is used in france -rrb- would also highlight the danger area to motorists .
entry into the zone should be clearly indicated e.g.
' warning , you are entering a school safety zone ' .
james , france maybe a radical solution is to make all occupant safety aids on cars illegal david clift , uk soft cars - instead of hard brittle sharp heavy ponty cars why not make cars from soft but durable foam ?
they would be lighter and more likely to bounce in a collision .
of course this would require replacing all vehicles on the road with rubbery cars in a fairly short time frame , but imagine the jobs that would be created .
mark s , brit in the usa the headband / minimal crash helmet idea is good .
as a recreational downhill skier i have become used to wearing a ski helmet and while this wo n't be able to prevent all damage , it could help .
likewise the headband idea might help and also help users think , " i am not indestructible " . sally deutschmann , canada prohibit by law all insurance that covers damage to vehicles one 's own and others - drivers would be very much more cautious .
john clark , dominican republic why are technological solutions always sought to human problems ?
better training , testing and enforcement of the existing laws would reduce the number of accidents .
mick sheppard , uk i feel everyone should be made to take a motorcycle cbt -lrb- compulsory basic training -rrb- .
i believe this would remove any false sense of security they may have when in a car , and also increase their awareness when on the road ..
gary hutton , spain maybe we are looking at this the wrong way , there is a lot of effort put into making car 's safer for their occupants , this leads to drivers feeling that if they crash then they will walk away uninjured .
maybe a radical solution is to make all occupant safety aids on cars illegal ! !
then maybe you would think twice before breaking the speed limit or driving too close to the car in front .
just an idea .
david clift , uk here is a suggestion for stopping people driving while chatting away on their mobile phone .
simply stop calls being transferred between area cells .
our motorways seem to have phone masts every 10m so they would n't even get a " hello " in before being cut off .
however they could always stop and make their call if its important .
jenny , uk get a big off road vehicle and then your most likely to come off best in a crash with another vehicle .
andrew , oxford lower speed limits , especially on country lanes would be a good idea .
its insane to allow motorist to do 60mph -lrb- and many will be doing 70mph or more -rrb- on winding , narrow , bumpy lanes , where around the next bend there could be a tractor , horse rider , cyclist or walker , plus probably another car approaching at 60mph , resulting in a 120mph collision .
lower speed limits , and an intelligent speed control system could prevent thousands of accidents and lives .
i guarantee most motorists would oppose this , as it would spoil their fun and would out-vote their victims to-be and victims relatives , if there was ever a vote on it .
mark humphries , uk getting stuck behind someone driving far beneath the speed limit because they think they 're being safe is going to frustrate other drivers and is very likely to make a person do something foolish or risky sim , uk / usa i believe the " go-slow " concept is a good idea , but something should be done to encourage people to purchase such automobiles .
i feel a tax credit or some type of financial incentive would be needed to encourage people to buy such vehicles .
higher speeds result in a higher level of fatal accidents ; unfortunately many are ignorant of this .
steve , usa how about going too slow being dangerous ?
getting stuck behind someone driving far beneath the speed limit because they think they 're being safe is going to frustrate other drivers and is very likely to make a person do something foolish or risky .
how about having speed restrictions timed ?
some people prefer driving at night when there 's less traffic on the roads and yet are still restricted to speed limits .
speed should be appropriate to circumstances .
sim , uk / usa it would be nice if people actually wore the seatbelts in their cars - the amount of cars i see in the town where i live in essex not wearing their belts is alarming ; especially when you consider that -lrb- 1 -rrb- most of the drivers were either extremely young or not even born when wearing seatbelts in the uk became law and -lrb- 2 -rrb- the cars being driven are not always new enough to have airbags .
personally , i 'm in favour of drivers not wearing seatbelts who are involved in accidents having their insurance voided - and having to pay for any nhs treatment .
it may sound harsh , but quite often these people have children in the back of the car and are just selfish .
catriona , uk i think that the use of signs to show where fatal or serious accidents have occurred is one of the best measures for stating just how dangerous the roads are .
when i was younger i remember seeing signs which were black spots for places of danger .
well worth considering again .
lisa fahy , england why is it assumed that all people are genetically pre-disposed to being good at driving ?
i think that people who do n't pass their test within 5 attempts should n't be allowed on the road. matt , uk i think there should be a reactions test before you are allowed to drive or rid a motorbike .
dan , uk i welcome any of these ideas if it helps save lives .
my dad was killed in a road accident in 1998 , and it never stops seeming so stupid that someone could be killed while on a cycle path , just because the path was not wide enough for two bikes to cross !
elizabeth warn , albania it 's not only blokes who ride big motorcycles , us ladies do too .
it seems to cause a lot of male car drivers extreme angst to see a lady rider on a big , powerful bike .
so much so in fact that it appears to be a direct challenge to their penis size , and they do their best to cut us up , swerve in front of us and make extravagant hand gestures .
shouting obscenities out of car windows when the sisters pass by is a favourite too .
i suggest making it law to oblige all women bikers to dress like men when on a bike , fake beards , hide it all away jackets and a mighty morphin plastic ranger attitude to the road .
us ladies want to be real men too ! ! !
louisa morgan , uk people drive fast because they are impatient -lrb- more so in the south east of england -rrb- .
people get impatient because they know their car is capable of going faster , especially if stuck behind a slower vehicle .
if all vehicles were restricted to the legal speed limit , there would be no impatience and no speeding .
in theory anyway !
lee , uk i think that all motorists should be made to do a refresher course every 10 years monique denton , uk i am an advanced motorcyclist and have practised as a specialist injury solicitor for over 18 years .
there are two main causes of road accidents that could be reduced relatively cheaply ; -lrb- 1 -rrb- it should be illegal to drive any motor vehicle on a public road having consumed any alcohol at all- there is no logical argument for allowing any consumption of a known inhibitor when driving -lrb- 2 -rrb- all drivers should be subject to compulsory re-test every 10 years up to the age of 50 and every 5 years thereafter .
it is insane that drivers who passed their test 40 years ago can still drive in today 's environment without retesting of their abilities .
mike clarke , england the driving test is too easy .
what is now called the advanced test should be the standard .
then the people operating cars would be able to drive properly and i 'm sure the number of accidents would drop .
increasing the difficulty of obtaining a licence means the threat of having it taken away becomes more serious .
james begent , england stopping distance , stopping distance , stopping distance .
last week i drove along a wet crowded motorway at 65mph , in the leftmost lane , keeping a good distance behind the car in front of me .
and all i could see in my rear-view mirror was the radiator grille of the huge lorry driving about a foot behind me .
people like that should be prosecuted for attempted murder .
but you never hear about that sort of bad driving - what you get are stories about ambulance drivers speeding on empty dry roads while trying to save lives - and being prosecuted for their trouble .
can we be grown-up about it and attack inappropriate speed rather than absolute speeding ?
peter , england i like the head band protection -lrb- do they come in child sizes too ? -rrb- , the speed limiters on vehicles and random breath tests .
i think that all motorists should be made to do a refresher course every 10 years .
i would also like to see compulsory lights and reflective wear for cyclists and motorcyclists monique denton , uk i think all cars should be equipped with reflective vests , so that when cars break down at the roadside , the passengers of the car become clearly visible on the roadside .
far too many people are killed on the hard shoulder each year in the uk and something needs to be done about it .
perhaps they should be supplied as standard with all knew cars ?
caroline walton , uk some cars make a noise when the seatbelt is not plugged in and have proper seatbelts in the middle backseat. both of these features would be great if made compulsory .
emma , uk i recall reading about a proposal for a simple change to cars to save lives - the change was to replace the drivers air bag with a big spike .
the idea is that when drivers can see the danger that they are in if they do not drive carefully , they pay attention and drive very carefully indeed .
martin , uk another idea might be to raise the age at which drivers can learn to drive .
the number of ' ' boy racers " on the road must be a contributory factor to the incidents of speed and carnage on the road -lrb- and probably road rage , too , not to mention noise pollution from the massive sound systems many have - if a mobile ' phone is deemed dangerous what about a stereo booming out 100 + watts of sound ?
surely such levels of sound must be distracting to the point of danger . -rrb- andrew , england i think there is an over emphasis on road safety in this country .
the roads are safer than houses .
more people are now killed in accidents in their home each year than on the roads .
more than 4,000 people are killed annually in the home compared to 3,600 on the roads .
one of the safest places you can be is locked up in a padded cell but would you want to live your life that way ?
colin smith , uk to rebecca : yes it is sometimes vital to get out of someone 's way .
that 's what your brakes are for - speeding is never a solution top danger on the roads .
and to b essada : how would a " driving test " for bikes " save 500 kids per year ? "
that 's more than ten times the annual child pedal cyclist fatality rate .
the real barrier to improved road safety is our refusal to take responsibility .
for the most parts these are not " accidents , " over 90 % are crashes resulting from negligence on the part of at least one road user .
pay more attention to the road and less to trying to shave five seconds off your journey .
guy chapman , uk i think smoking at the wheel is more dangerous than using a mobile phone .
you have to take both hands off the wheel to light it , and if you drop it a burning cigarette will land in your lap - very likely to be distracting !
lisa , scotland maybe we need to concentrate on educating pedestrians on how to use crossings and not automatically say that drivers are evil denzil pemberthy , uk " collisions with trees kill 1,600 people a year in germany , 800 in france and more than 200 in britain " look at the figures !
i think that britain already has some of the world 's safest roads , none of the suggestions would help to make us any safer -lrb- unless we were all banned from driving -rrb- .
as a driver it really annoys me how it seems that anything is the drivers fault .
for instance the kill your speed , not a child campaign , if the child had n't walked out from in front of another car he would n't have been hit in the first place .
maybe we need to concentrate on educating pedestrians on how to use crossings and not automatically say that drivers are evil .
denzil pemberthy , uk i like the indian solution : signs by the road - " do n't drive silly , enjoy the valley " and other little poems .
cute but totally ineffective of course .
delhi also has a large sign showing the daily death and serious injury stats for the city .
averages 4 of each per day .
carrie , uk i think that everyone should be required to take part in a refresher course every 10 to 15 years .
i ca n't think of one person i know over forty who would pass their driving test if they re-took it now .
roz , germany anything that makes people less tunnel visioned when they enter their car ca n't hurt .
may i suggest that in place of the air bag on the steering a large spike is put there instead .
it will certainly make people go slower know that they could be kebabed if they had to reduce their speed quickly .
lucy , uk speeding is viewed by many as the be all and end all of road safety and seems as a consequence to be the only target when it comes to road safety .
as a regular motorway driver i see far more accidents caused by people driving too close to the car in front .
would n't speed camera technology be better employed capturing this rather than targeting someone on what may very well be an empty road .
a simple survey of passing cars still reveals a significant percentage not wearing seatbelts .
tim k , uk better road markings , higher quality tarmac that can reduce ' spray ' on the roads , making visibility better and safer for all .
george williams , uk after seeing the ' the uk 's worst driver ' tv program , i think that anyone caught in an accident should have to take a mini driving test , if they pass , no problem , if they perform ' acceptably ' , they should have their fault pointed out , perhaps made to retake this test , if they fail .. they should lose their licence completely .
all accidents are caused by bad driving - whether going to fast for the conditions , or simply poor judgement. by making drivers take a test , it could be used as a means of ensuring only good drivers get to drive .
andy , uk in england 14 % of the driving population fail to meet the eyesight requirements for driving , which i believe are amongst the laxest in europe .
why do n't the police take any action against such dangerous drivers ?
drivers should be required to take annual eyesight tests , particularly older drivers .
andy gambles , england all cars should be fitted with a breathalyser tube which must be blown into to start the car .
if you fail the test the car wo n't start .
simple ! !
bill robertson , scotland my idea is that no-one should be allowed to drive a car before they have learned how to ride a motor bike and ridden one for two years .
this will only increase their road awareness and make the realise that even in a car they are vulnerable to bad drivers .
russell , london , uk is 71mph any more dangerous than 69mph on a motorway ?
mike wicks , uk making cars out of sponge , banning all drivers except me , the ' safer ' driving is the more risks people take .
a compulsory re-test every 5 years would be a better plan , tackling the real issue - the people who drive !
gnome , uk the only suggestion which i can see being as dangerous as the current situation is a go slow car .
whilst not advocating speeding on a general basis -lrb- although let 's face it , most of us do it if only by a couple of miles an hour -rrb- , there are times when it is vital for safety to be able to get out of someone else 's way , for which it may be necessary to speed for a brief moment .
without the ability to do this , i would certainly have been in a number of accidents in my time which were totally unrelated to my own driving .
rebecca , uk is 71mph any more dangerous than 69mph on a motorway ?
the concentration by the authorities and pressure groups on absolute speeds , instead of appropriate speed is a waste of time .
how many speed cameras do we need to reduce the fatalities on the road to 0 ?
if you concentrate solely on speed , the most cost-effective solution surely would be to bring back the red flag act of the 1800s , when all horseless carriages were required to be preceded by a man walking in front with a red flag .
fortunately the maximum speed under this system is about 3 to 5 mph , so no one would ever get killed on the road again , but the country would grind to a halt .
mike wicks , uk simple a driving test for bike riders .
bikes are great kids toys for off road use .
if they are going to be used on road the rider should either hold , or be escorted by someone holding , a driving licence .
this would save 500 kids a year with very little cost .

in the latest move , the uk government announced this week it would be banning the use of mobile phones while driving .
below is a selection of other suggestions to improve road safety , drawn from various sources .
bbc news online would also like to hear your views by filling out the form below .
head bands would drivers wear these ?
many of the most serious road crashes result in head injuries .
they may not look too fashionable , but these head bands have been identified as one way of reducing the human impact of car accidents .
leading research in this area is the road accident research unit at the university of adelaide , in australia .
its tests have already shown headbands would reduce injuries from frontal car crashes , and research is continuing on other types of crash .
essentially the bands are crash helmets which have been scaled down to look less bulky .
it may be hard to imagine people wearing them - but many people opposed wearing seat belts when they were introduced .
go-slow cars cars could stop their own drivers from speeding experts at the university of leeds are working on a car equipped with a speed limiter which makes it impossible to break the legal limit .
professor of transport safety , oliver carsten , said : " we believe this kind of technology can contribute to road safety .
" if all drivers kept to the speed limit , deaths on the road -lrb- in the uk -rrb- would fall by 37 % , over 1,200 each year . "
the system has been dubbed intelligent speed adaptation .
death markers black markers signify deaths and red indicate serious injuries an idea used in various countries where the risk of crashes increases on long stretches of road .
black markers -lrb- usually small wooden posts -rrb- are installed at locations where fatal accidents have occurred .
they may be slightly morbid , but these markers , which feature small crosses at the top , are sobering reminder of how dangerous driving can be .
they also serve to highlight corners or stretches of road which may be more hazardous than they appear .
additional red markers indicate sites of crashes which resulted in serious injuries .
design and roadside objects road design is crucial many vehicle deaths would be avoided if authorities paid closer attention to removing or fencing off roadside objects , such as dangerous trees and posts .
collisions with trees kill 1,600 people a year in germany , 800 in france and more than 200 in britain .
general design of roads is also important , with some research suggesting poor design contributes to 33 % of crashes .
refresher courses middle-aged men are getting back on the road a concern raised by the aa is the number of middle-aged men " rediscovering their youth " by getting back on their motorcycles .
it can sometimes be too late when they discover the road environment has changed over the last 20 to 30 years .
many would benefit from refresher courses to hone their skills , which may have diminished over the years and must be adapted to modern road conditions .
hitting home cars can be fragile machines many people do not fully comprehend the horror of car crashes , and thus do not drive accordingly .
numerous advertisements have used shocking images of accidents in the hope of reforming attitudes .
some say this could be taken a step further by occasionally putting badly damaged and burnt out vehicles at the roadside .
it would surely be a stark reminder of how fragile a car can be when travelling at speed .
lower speed limits is 40mph too fast ?
it seems obvious , but few people realise the difference made by slower driving .
not only are you less likely to suffer serious injuries , but there is less chance of the accident happening in the first place .
research in areas where the speed limit is 60km / h -lrb- just under 40mph -rrb- has shown the chance of crashing could be reduced by as much as 40 % if the limit was lowered by just 10km / h .
however suggestions of lowering speed limits often encounter resistance from motorists who are in a hurry to get where they are going .
drink driving drunk drivers can be lethal alcohol is still a major cause of car crashes .
the royal society for the prevention of accidents says the allowable amount of alcohol should be lowered from 80mg to 50mg .
furthermore , it wants police empowered to test drivers randomly .
" they should be able to test anywhere at any time , " a spokesman said .
a selection of views from bbc news online readers : clear , logical road direction signs , well in advance of junctions would reduce accidents where people brake sharply because they have nearly missed a turn .
a lot more thinking needs to go into how direction signs are laid out , located and lead the driver confidently to their destination .
eric woodcock , united kingdom tail-gating is at least as dangerous as speeding , but seems to be completely unenforced .
also the comments other people have made here hardly mention it .
why is there such a blind spot about safe distances ?
it would be quite easy to put a forward radar in cars to warn about being too close , perhaps even to enforce a minimum distance , along similar lines to a speed governor .
stephen burke , england i think those head bands are a bad idea .
people will not want to be seen dead in those so will speed through towns in order not to be seen .
come on honestly is that the best they can come up with henry , england manufacturers still do not do enough to stop vehicles from being stolen .
many crimes , not only " joy riding " use stolen cars .
the public are put at great danger by this crime .
enormous police and victims resources are absorbed by the effects and results of stolen cars .
vehicles can be manufactured so that the need to put extra steering locks on them becomes redundant .
alternatively legislation should be brought in so that vehicle security systems are far more difficult to defeat .
scott , yorkshire roads should all be marked every 100 metres with the speed limit .
all speed cameras should have the speed limit painted on them .
half the time you do n't know what the speed limit is on uk roads - a cynical attempt to catch more motorists out ?
rooster , uk " occasionally putting badly damaged and burnt out vehicles at the roadside " - anybody who has ever lived in an inner city area will be well aware that this occurs frequently and does nothing to help road safety !
lee i agree with the comment about sight tests .
as well as doing a breath test at the scene of any incident police officers should also be required to check somebody 's eye sight .
many people do n't realise their eyesight is getting worse as it happens so slow .
i 've seen a number of people have very near misses , who subsequently go for an eye test to find out they need glasses at least for driving , and been amazed at what they were missing as regards things happening around them .
zippy , uk it 's driver psychology which needs to be addressed ahead of any other life-saving devices jessica , uk the revenue collected from " speed cameras " should be used to improve the general standard and safety of the actual roads .
placing cameras on awkward bends and corners is not the answer .
make the roads straight and fence off trees .
or even cut down trees .
at the moment revenue is just another form of taxation .
shaun grimes , uk the telling fact is in the chart : six deaths per hundred thousand people per year .
the figure is miniscule .
do we really need all the inconvenience of the road safety industry for this tiny risk ?
simon richardson , uk many contributors mention the physical distraction of smoking at the wheel .
there seems to be a reluctance to realise that although cigarettes are legal , nicotine is a highly addictive narcotic which often causes symptoms of aggressive behavior .
the smoke also reduces blood oxygen levels and increases levels of carbon monoxide in the blood , which is not conducive to clear thinking .
it seems strange that whilst alcohol is blamed for so much , being " high " off cigarettes is considered " normal " .
mike , uk encourage people to use their cars less .
invest in the public transport infrastructure .
use bicyles for short trips .
allan wishart , uk it 's driver psychology which needs to be addressed ahead of any other life-saving devices .
until people get it into their thick heads that speeding is unacceptable , then you 'll never reduce the number of fatalities on our roads .
it 's the " i 'm bigger and better and faster and more important than you " attitude which is so destructive .
jessica , uk zero mg of alcohol .
no smoking in cars , especially when the driver is trying to locate the dying embers that have fallen between the seats at 80mph on the m1 .
no phones -lrb- soon to be law thankfully -rrb- .
i do n't think shock tactics work .
people invariably believe it wo n't happen to them - just ask a smoker if they fear their own mortality .
without question swift and deterrent punishment to match the offence , including lifetime bans will get their attention .
why do we pander to these lunatics who threaten us and our children everyday ?
simon , london , uk touching as these memorials are , they are not as effective a means of saving lives on the highways as are driving more slowly and lawfully tetman callis , usa road safety would be improved by encouraging better driving standards not lowering speeds to ridiculously low levels which induce boredom and reduce concentration .
some would have the return of a man with red flag walking in front of the vehicle !
equal effort should also go into the quality of car maintenance - a special stringent mot test should be introduced for cars over 8 years old with a view to reducing the nation 's stock of bangers .
bill finch , scotland all of the above ideas will most likely reduce accidents , injuries and death .
there are two other areas that should be addressed .
1 .
a comprehensive driving test -lrb- road and classroom -rrb- that needs to retaken every 10 years , and passed or you loose your driving license .
2 .
giving the police enough resources and incentive to effectively and fairly enforced the current road rules .
these two actions are required in the uk , australia and the us .
counties i have lived , worked and driven in over the last 13 years .
ronald spiers usa , usa i work outdoors with children / students in a rural area .
thirty years ago , more than 95 % of drivers would slow down noticeably or even stop if we were walking in single file along the edge of a narrow road .
these days the proportion of arrogant and aggressive drivers -lrb- mainly men -rrb- speeding past even young children on the same road , leaving just inches to spare , has risen to more than a quarter .
bob burn , wales here in new mexico , there is a long-standing tradition of friends and family erecting roadside crosses along the sides of roads where loved ones have died in automobile accidents .
touching as these memorials are , they are not as effective a means of saving lives on the highways as are driving more slowly and lawfully -lrb- people in new mexico are notorious speeders and runners of stop lights -rrb- , paying attention , and driving sober .
tetman callis , usa the seatbelt was a revelation for some but a huge step forward .
i would like to see more , effective measures for in car safety such as harness type seatbelts that race car drivers wear .
in fact , legal measures should be implemented to take safety innovations from the race-track where safety is a primary concern and translate them into the family vehicle arena .
brett jackson , us ban buses and taxi s from speeding .
it seems that they are above the law in the uk and they too are responsible for a massive number of road deaths / injuries .
ban smoking while driving - lighting up is really dangerous and does detract attention from the road .
ban young men from owning white nova 's n benson , uk two words : slow down ! !
jill , northern ireland it is the appalling standard of driving in this country that needs addressing-inappropriate speed for the conditions can mean that 20mph is too fast .
at the same time too slow a speed can also cause serious accidents-overtaking traffic at 2-3mph more than their speed in the 3rd lane of a motorway is a common cause of tailbacks & subsequent frustration .
the problem is that drivers are not taught " situational awareness " -something that motorcyclists have to develop in order to survive , as do military pilots .
speed cameras are not the answer , as they are incapable of recording hgv 's exceeding their limit -lrb- 56mph -rrb- , by 20mph & yet they will result in prosecution for a driver doing 90mph at 3am on the m6 in cumbria when there is nothing else on the motorway .
mike sterland , uk where can i buy one ?
i 'd rather live than worry about fashion peter , uk some of the suggestions in this article are already in place in new zealand .
" death markers " in the form of white wooden crosses can be seen at the sides of many roads although i believe that these crosses are placed by relatives of people killed in road traffic accidents .
" shock " adverts regularly appear on nz tv at peak viewing times .
they are usually quite graphic and hard hitting .
" random " breath testing is commonplace .
it may not be regarded as random as the police stop all vehicles passing through the check point .
sadly however there are still too many accidents .
an apparent lack of basic driving skills and excessive speed seem to be the main causes .
peter , new zealand lower speed limits , head bands -lrb- where can i buy one ?
i 'd rather live than worry about fashion -rrb- , death markers are all excellent ideas .
driving would be less ' fun ' , and slower , but so what ?
i 'd rather get to my destination ten minutes later than arrive thirty years early in the next world .
peter , uk there appears to be an increase in speed cameras , and a decrease in police patrols .
clearly , the speed cameras aim only to catch speeding motorists -lrb- and , of course , are a great revenue generator -rrb- .
meanwhile , other offences are committed , such as dangerous driving , and are not detected .
we need to see more police patrols .
sean , uk the uk is increasingly becoming the country of excessive restrictions on it 's residents .
from roadside cameras to increasing limitations on daily life , people do not appreciate how much their freedoms are being eroded .
educate but not legislate - if people do n't want to wear a seatbelt so be it - their choice .
time for nanny to leave the citizens to make choices for themselves - glad i left it all behind .
james , usa speeding may very well contributing factor , but is n't driving slow as well ?
i drive 25,000 miles a year and everyday i see car moving at 30-35 mph in a 60 speed limit , this causes frustration among drivers and will encourage them to overtake in places which are not safe .
if a driver is not comfortable doing 60 in a 60 they are obviously not confident and therefore should not be on the road , then again these slow coaches are the same ones who do not slow down when entering a built up 30mph area ! !
you know who you are ! !
aled , uk the government should consider school safety zones where speed limits are reduced still further , extra speed humps are employed , and extra fencing used .
a colour coded scheme -lrb- yellow is used in france -rrb- would also highlight the danger area to motorists .
entry into the zone should be clearly indicated e.g.
' warning , you are entering a school safety zone ' .
james , france maybe a radical solution is to make all occupant safety aids on cars illegal david clift , uk soft cars - instead of hard brittle sharp heavy ponty cars why not make cars from soft but durable foam ?
they would be lighter and more likely to bounce in a collision .
of course this would require replacing all vehicles on the road with rubbery cars in a fairly short time frame , but imagine the jobs that would be created .
mark s , brit in the usa the headband / minimal crash helmet idea is good .
as a recreational downhill skier i have become used to wearing a ski helmet and while this wo n't be able to prevent all damage , it could help .
likewise the headband idea might help and also help users think , " i am not indestructible " . sally deutschmann , canada prohibit by law all insurance that covers damage to vehicles one 's own and others - drivers would be very much more cautious .
john clark , dominican republic why are technological solutions always sought to human problems ?
better training , testing and enforcement of the existing laws would reduce the number of accidents .
mick sheppard , uk i feel everyone should be made to take a motorcycle cbt -lrb- compulsory basic training -rrb- .
i believe this would remove any false sense of security they may have when in a car , and also increase their awareness when on the road ..
gary hutton , spain maybe we are looking at this the wrong way , there is a lot of effort put into making car 's safer for their occupants , this leads to drivers feeling that if they crash then they will walk away uninjured .
maybe a radical solution is to make all occupant safety aids on cars illegal ! !
then maybe you would think twice before breaking the speed limit or driving too close to the car in front .
just an idea .
david clift , uk here is a suggestion for stopping people driving while chatting away on their mobile phone .
simply stop calls being transferred between area cells .
our motorways seem to have phone masts every 10m so they would n't even get a " hello " in before being cut off .
however they could always stop and make their call if its important .
jenny , uk get a big off road vehicle and then your most likely to come off best in a crash with another vehicle .
andrew , oxford lower speed limits , especially on country lanes would be a good idea .
its insane to allow motorist to do 60mph -lrb- and many will be doing 70mph or more -rrb- on winding , narrow , bumpy lanes , where around the next bend there could be a tractor , horse rider , cyclist or walker , plus probably another car approaching at 60mph , resulting in a 120mph collision .
lower speed limits , and an intelligent speed control system could prevent thousands of accidents and lives .
i guarantee most motorists would oppose this , as it would spoil their fun and would out-vote their victims to-be and victims relatives , if there was ever a vote on it .
mark humphries , uk getting stuck behind someone driving far beneath the speed limit because they think they 're being safe is going to frustrate other drivers and is very likely to make a person do something foolish or risky sim , uk / usa i believe the " go-slow " concept is a good idea , but something should be done to encourage people to purchase such automobiles .
i feel a tax credit or some type of financial incentive would be needed to encourage people to buy such vehicles .
higher speeds result in a higher level of fatal accidents ; unfortunately many are ignorant of this .
steve , usa how about going too slow being dangerous ?
getting stuck behind someone driving far beneath the speed limit because they think they 're being safe is going to frustrate other drivers and is very likely to make a person do something foolish or risky .
how about having speed restrictions timed ?
some people prefer driving at night when there 's less traffic on the roads and yet are still restricted to speed limits .
speed should be appropriate to circumstances .
sim , uk / usa it would be nice if people actually wore the seatbelts in their cars - the amount of cars i see in the town where i live in essex not wearing their belts is alarming ; especially when you consider that -lrb- 1 -rrb- most of the drivers were either extremely young or not even born when wearing seatbelts in the uk became law and -lrb- 2 -rrb- the cars being driven are not always new enough to have airbags .
personally , i 'm in favour of drivers not wearing seatbelts who are involved in accidents having their insurance voided - and having to pay for any nhs treatment .
it may sound harsh , but quite often these people have children in the back of the car and are just selfish .
catriona , uk i think that the use of signs to show where fatal or serious accidents have occurred is one of the best measures for stating just how dangerous the roads are .
when i was younger i remember seeing signs which were black spots for places of danger .
well worth considering again .
lisa fahy , england why is it assumed that all people are genetically pre-disposed to being good at driving ?
i think that people who do n't pass their test within 5 attempts should n't be allowed on the road. matt , uk i think there should be a reactions test before you are allowed to drive or rid a motorbike .
dan , uk i welcome any of these ideas if it helps save lives .
my dad was killed in a road accident in 1998 , and it never stops seeming so stupid that someone could be killed while on a cycle path , just because the path was not wide enough for two bikes to cross !
elizabeth warn , albania it 's not only blokes who ride big motorcycles , us ladies do too .
it seems to cause a lot of male car drivers extreme angst to see a lady rider on a big , powerful bike .
so much so in fact that it appears to be a direct challenge to their penis size , and they do their best to cut us up , swerve in front of us and make extravagant hand gestures .
shouting obscenities out of car windows when the sisters pass by is a favourite too .
i suggest making it law to oblige all women bikers to dress like men when on a bike , fake beards , hide it all away jackets and a mighty morphin plastic ranger attitude to the road .
us ladies want to be real men too ! ! !
louisa morgan , uk people drive fast because they are impatient -lrb- more so in the south east of england -rrb- .
people get impatient because they know their car is capable of going faster , especially if stuck behind a slower vehicle .
if all vehicles were restricted to the legal speed limit , there would be no impatience and no speeding .
in theory anyway !
lee , uk i think that all motorists should be made to do a refresher course every 10 years monique denton , uk i am an advanced motorcyclist and have practised as a specialist injury solicitor for over 18 years .
there are two main causes of road accidents that could be reduced relatively cheaply ; -lrb- 1 -rrb- it should be illegal to drive any motor vehicle on a public road having consumed any alcohol at all- there is no logical argument for allowing any consumption of a known inhibitor when driving -lrb- 2 -rrb- all drivers should be subject to compulsory re-test every 10 years up to the age of 50 and every 5 years thereafter .
it is insane that drivers who passed their test 40 years ago can still drive in today 's environment without retesting of their abilities .
mike clarke , england the driving test is too easy .
what is now called the advanced test should be the standard .
then the people operating cars would be able to drive properly and i 'm sure the number of accidents would drop .
increasing the difficulty of obtaining a licence means the threat of having it taken away becomes more serious .
james begent , england stopping distance , stopping distance , stopping distance .
last week i drove along a wet crowded motorway at 65mph , in the leftmost lane , keeping a good distance behind the car in front of me .
and all i could see in my rear-view mirror was the radiator grille of the huge lorry driving about a foot behind me .
people like that should be prosecuted for attempted murder .
but you never hear about that sort of bad driving - what you get are stories about ambulance drivers speeding on empty dry roads while trying to save lives - and being prosecuted for their trouble .
can we be grown-up about it and attack inappropriate speed rather than absolute speeding ?
peter , england i like the head band protection -lrb- do they come in child sizes too ? -rrb- , the speed limiters on vehicles and random breath tests .
i think that all motorists should be made to do a refresher course every 10 years .
i would also like to see compulsory lights and reflective wear for cyclists and motorcyclists monique denton , uk i think all cars should be equipped with reflective vests , so that when cars break down at the roadside , the passengers of the car become clearly visible on the roadside .
far too many people are killed on the hard shoulder each year in the uk and something needs to be done about it .
perhaps they should be supplied as standard with all knew cars ?
caroline walton , uk some cars make a noise when the seatbelt is not plugged in and have proper seatbelts in the middle backseat. both of these features would be great if made compulsory .
emma , uk i recall reading about a proposal for a simple change to cars to save lives - the change was to replace the drivers air bag with a big spike .
the idea is that when drivers can see the danger that they are in if they do not drive carefully , they pay attention and drive very carefully indeed .
martin , uk another idea might be to raise the age at which drivers can learn to drive .
the number of ' ' boy racers " on the road must be a contributory factor to the incidents of speed and carnage on the road -lrb- and probably road rage , too , not to mention noise pollution from the massive sound systems many have - if a mobile ' phone is deemed dangerous what about a stereo booming out 100 + watts of sound ?
surely such levels of sound must be distracting to the point of danger . -rrb- andrew , england i think there is an over emphasis on road safety in this country .
the roads are safer than houses .
more people are now killed in accidents in their home each year than on the roads .
more than 4,000 people are killed annually in the home compared to 3,600 on the roads .
one of the safest places you can be is locked up in a padded cell but would you want to live your life that way ?
colin smith , uk to rebecca : yes it is sometimes vital to get out of someone 's way .
that 's what your brakes are for - speeding is never a solution top danger on the roads .
and to b essada : how would a " driving test " for bikes " save 500 kids per year ? "
that 's more than ten times the annual child pedal cyclist fatality rate .
the real barrier to improved road safety is our refusal to take responsibility .
for the most parts these are not " accidents , " over 90 % are crashes resulting from negligence on the part of at least one road user .
pay more attention to the road and less to trying to shave five seconds off your journey .
guy chapman , uk i think smoking at the wheel is more dangerous than using a mobile phone .
you have to take both hands off the wheel to light it , and if you drop it a burning cigarette will land in your lap - very likely to be distracting !
lisa , scotland maybe we need to concentrate on educating pedestrians on how to use crossings and not automatically say that drivers are evil denzil pemberthy , uk " collisions with trees kill 1,600 people a year in germany , 800 in france and more than 200 in britain " look at the figures !
i think that britain already has some of the world 's safest roads , none of the suggestions would help to make us any safer -lrb- unless we were all banned from driving -rrb- .
as a driver it really annoys me how it seems that anything is the drivers fault .
for instance the kill your speed , not a child campaign , if the child had n't walked out from in front of another car he would n't have been hit in the first place .
maybe we need to concentrate on educating pedestrians on how to use crossings and not automatically say that drivers are evil .
denzil pemberthy , uk i like the indian solution : signs by the road - " do n't drive silly , enjoy the valley " and other little poems .
cute but totally ineffective of course .
delhi also has a large sign showing the daily death and serious injury stats for the city .
averages 4 of each per day .
carrie , uk i think that everyone should be required to take part in a refresher course every 10 to 15 years .
i ca n't think of one person i know over forty who would pass their driving test if they re-took it now .
roz , germany anything that makes people less tunnel visioned when they enter their car ca n't hurt .
may i suggest that in place of the air bag on the steering a large spike is put there instead .
it will certainly make people go slower know that they could be kebabed if they had to reduce their speed quickly .
lucy , uk speeding is viewed by many as the be all and end all of road safety and seems as a consequence to be the only target when it comes to road safety .
as a regular motorway driver i see far more accidents caused by people driving too close to the car in front .
would n't speed camera technology be better employed capturing this rather than targeting someone on what may very well be an empty road .
a simple survey of passing cars still reveals a significant percentage not wearing seatbelts .
tim k , uk better road markings , higher quality tarmac that can reduce ' spray ' on the roads , making visibility better and safer for all .
george williams , uk after seeing the ' the uk 's worst driver ' tv program , i think that anyone caught in an accident should have to take a mini driving test , if they pass , no problem , if they perform ' acceptably ' , they should have their fault pointed out , perhaps made to retake this test , if they fail .. they should lose their licence completely .
all accidents are caused by bad driving - whether going to fast for the conditions , or simply poor judgement. by making drivers take a test , it could be used as a means of ensuring only good drivers get to drive .
andy , uk in england 14 % of the driving population fail to meet the eyesight requirements for driving , which i believe are amongst the laxest in europe .
why do n't the police take any action against such dangerous drivers ?
drivers should be required to take annual eyesight tests , particularly older drivers .
andy gambles , england all cars should be fitted with a breathalyser tube which must be blown into to start the car .
if you fail the test the car wo n't start .
simple ! !
bill robertson , scotland my idea is that no-one should be allowed to drive a car before they have learned how to ride a motor bike and ridden one for two years .
this will only increase their road awareness and make the realise that even in a car they are vulnerable to bad drivers .
russell , london , uk is 71mph any more dangerous than 69mph on a motorway ?
mike wicks , uk making cars out of sponge , banning all drivers except me , the ' safer ' driving is the more risks people take .
a compulsory re-test every 5 years would be a better plan , tackling the real issue - the people who drive !
gnome , uk the only suggestion which i can see being as dangerous as the current situation is a go slow car .
whilst not advocating speeding on a general basis -lrb- although let 's face it , most of us do it if only by a couple of miles an hour -rrb- , there are times when it is vital for safety to be able to get out of someone else 's way , for which it may be necessary to speed for a brief moment .
without the ability to do this , i would certainly have been in a number of accidents in my time which were totally unrelated to my own driving .
rebecca , uk is 71mph any more dangerous than 69mph on a motorway ?
the concentration by the authorities and pressure groups on absolute speeds , instead of appropriate speed is a waste of time .
how many speed cameras do we need to reduce the fatalities on the road to 0 ?
if you concentrate solely on speed , the most cost-effective solution surely would be to bring back the red flag act of the 1800s , when all horseless carriages were required to be preceded by a man walking in front with a red flag .
fortunately the maximum speed under this system is about 3 to 5 mph , so no one would ever get killed on the road again , but the country would grind to a halt .
mike wicks , uk simple a driving test for bike riders .
bikes are great kids toys for off road use .
if they are going to be used on road the rider should either hold , or be escorted by someone holding , a driving licence .
this would save 500 kids a year with very little cost .

in the latest move , the uk government announced this week it would be banning the use of mobile phones while driving .
below is a selection of other suggestions to improve road safety , drawn from various sources .
bbc news online would also like to hear your views by filling out the form below .
head bands would drivers wear these ?
many of the most serious road crashes result in head injuries .
they may not look too fashionable , but these head bands have been identified as one way of reducing the human impact of car accidents .
leading research in this area is the road accident research unit at the university of adelaide , in australia .
its tests have already shown headbands would reduce injuries from frontal car crashes , and research is continuing on other types of crash .
essentially the bands are crash helmets which have been scaled down to look less bulky .
it may be hard to imagine people wearing them - but many people opposed wearing seat belts when they were introduced .
go-slow cars cars could stop their own drivers from speeding experts at the university of leeds are working on a car equipped with a speed limiter which makes it impossible to break the legal limit .
professor of transport safety , oliver carsten , said : " we believe this kind of technology can contribute to road safety .
" if all drivers kept to the speed limit , deaths on the road -lrb- in the uk -rrb- would fall by 37 % , over 1,200 each year . "
the system has been dubbed intelligent speed adaptation .
death markers black markers signify deaths and red indicate serious injuries an idea used in various countries where the risk of crashes increases on long stretches of road .
black markers -lrb- usually small wooden posts -rrb- are installed at locations where fatal accidents have occurred .
they may be slightly morbid , but these markers , which feature small crosses at the top , are sobering reminder of how dangerous driving can be .
they also serve to highlight corners or stretches of road which may be more hazardous than they appear .
additional red markers indicate sites of crashes which resulted in serious injuries .
design and roadside objects road design is crucial many vehicle deaths would be avoided if authorities paid closer attention to removing or fencing off roadside objects , such as dangerous trees and posts .
collisions with trees kill 1,600 people a year in germany , 800 in france and more than 200 in britain .
general design of roads is also important , with some research suggesting poor design contributes to 33 % of crashes .
refresher courses middle-aged men are getting back on the road a concern raised by the aa is the number of middle-aged men " rediscovering their youth " by getting back on their motorcycles .
it can sometimes be too late when they discover the road environment has changed over the last 20 to 30 years .
many would benefit from refresher courses to hone their skills , which may have diminished over the years and must be adapted to modern road conditions .
hitting home cars can be fragile machines many people do not fully comprehend the horror of car crashes , and thus do not drive accordingly .
numerous advertisements have used shocking images of accidents in the hope of reforming attitudes .
some say this could be taken a step further by occasionally putting badly damaged and burnt out vehicles at the roadside .
it would surely be a stark reminder of how fragile a car can be when travelling at speed .
lower speed limits is 40mph too fast ?
it seems obvious , but few people realise the difference made by slower driving .
not only are you less likely to suffer serious injuries , but there is less chance of the accident happening in the first place .
research in areas where the speed limit is 60km / h -lrb- just under 40mph -rrb- has shown the chance of crashing could be reduced by as much as 40 % if the limit was lowered by just 10km / h .
however suggestions of lowering speed limits often encounter resistance from motorists who are in a hurry to get where they are going .
drink driving drunk drivers can be lethal alcohol is still a major cause of car crashes .
the royal society for the prevention of accidents says the allowable amount of alcohol should be lowered from 80mg to 50mg .
furthermore , it wants police empowered to test drivers randomly .
" they should be able to test anywhere at any time , " a spokesman said .
a selection of views from bbc news online readers : clear , logical road direction signs , well in advance of junctions would reduce accidents where people brake sharply because they have nearly missed a turn .
a lot more thinking needs to go into how direction signs are laid out , located and lead the driver confidently to their destination .
eric woodcock , united kingdom tail-gating is at least as dangerous as speeding , but seems to be completely unenforced .
also the comments other people have made here hardly mention it .
why is there such a blind spot about safe distances ?
it would be quite easy to put a forward radar in cars to warn about being too close , perhaps even to enforce a minimum distance , along similar lines to a speed governor .
stephen burke , england i think those head bands are a bad idea .
people will not want to be seen dead in those so will speed through towns in order not to be seen .
come on honestly is that the best they can come up with henry , england manufacturers still do not do enough to stop vehicles from being stolen .
many crimes , not only " joy riding " use stolen cars .
the public are put at great danger by this crime .
enormous police and victims resources are absorbed by the effects and results of stolen cars .
vehicles can be manufactured so that the need to put extra steering locks on them becomes redundant .
alternatively legislation should be brought in so that vehicle security systems are far more difficult to defeat .
scott , yorkshire roads should all be marked every 100 metres with the speed limit .
all speed cameras should have the speed limit painted on them .
half the time you do n't know what the speed limit is on uk roads - a cynical attempt to catch more motorists out ?
rooster , uk " occasionally putting badly damaged and burnt out vehicles at the roadside " - anybody who has ever lived in an inner city area will be well aware that this occurs frequently and does nothing to help road safety !
lee i agree with the comment about sight tests .
as well as doing a breath test at the scene of any incident police officers should also be required to check somebody 's eye sight .
many people do n't realise their eyesight is getting worse as it happens so slow .
i 've seen a number of people have very near misses , who subsequently go for an eye test to find out they need glasses at least for driving , and been amazed at what they were missing as regards things happening around them .
zippy , uk it 's driver psychology which needs to be addressed ahead of any other life-saving devices jessica , uk the revenue collected from " speed cameras " should be used to improve the general standard and safety of the actual roads .
placing cameras on awkward bends and corners is not the answer .
make the roads straight and fence off trees .
or even cut down trees .
at the moment revenue is just another form of taxation .
shaun grimes , uk the telling fact is in the chart : six deaths per hundred thousand people per year .
the figure is miniscule .
do we really need all the inconvenience of the road safety industry for this tiny risk ?
simon richardson , uk many contributors mention the physical distraction of smoking at the wheel .
there seems to be a reluctance to realise that although cigarettes are legal , nicotine is a highly addictive narcotic which often causes symptoms of aggressive behavior .
the smoke also reduces blood oxygen levels and increases levels of carbon monoxide in the blood , which is not conducive to clear thinking .
it seems strange that whilst alcohol is blamed for so much , being " high " off cigarettes is considered " normal " .
mike , uk encourage people to use their cars less .
invest in the public transport infrastructure .
use bicyles for short trips .
allan wishart , uk it 's driver psychology which needs to be addressed ahead of any other life-saving devices .
until people get it into their thick heads that speeding is unacceptable , then you 'll never reduce the number of fatalities on our roads .
it 's the " i 'm bigger and better and faster and more important than you " attitude which is so destructive .
jessica , uk zero mg of alcohol .
no smoking in cars , especially when the driver is trying to locate the dying embers that have fallen between the seats at 80mph on the m1 .
no phones -lrb- soon to be law thankfully -rrb- .
i do n't think shock tactics work .
people invariably believe it wo n't happen to them - just ask a smoker if they fear their own mortality .
without question swift and deterrent punishment to match the offence , including lifetime bans will get their attention .
why do we pander to these lunatics who threaten us and our children everyday ?
simon , london , uk touching as these memorials are , they are not as effective a means of saving lives on the highways as are driving more slowly and lawfully tetman callis , usa road safety would be improved by encouraging better driving standards not lowering speeds to ridiculously low levels which induce boredom and reduce concentration .
some would have the return of a man with red flag walking in front of the vehicle !
equal effort should also go into the quality of car maintenance - a special stringent mot test should be introduced for cars over 8 years old with a view to reducing the nation 's stock of bangers .
bill finch , scotland all of the above ideas will most likely reduce accidents , injuries and death .
there are two other areas that should be addressed .
1 .
a comprehensive driving test -lrb- road and classroom -rrb- that needs to retaken every 10 years , and passed or you loose your driving license .
2 .
giving the police enough resources and incentive to effectively and fairly enforced the current road rules .
these two actions are required in the uk , australia and the us .
counties i have lived , worked and driven in over the last 13 years .
ronald spiers usa , usa i work outdoors with children / students in a rural area .
thirty years ago , more than 95 % of drivers would slow down noticeably or even stop if we were walking in single file along the edge of a narrow road .
these days the proportion of arrogant and aggressive drivers -lrb- mainly men -rrb- speeding past even young children on the same road , leaving just inches to spare , has risen to more than a quarter .
bob burn , wales here in new mexico , there is a long-standing tradition of friends and family erecting roadside crosses along the sides of roads where loved ones have died in automobile accidents .
touching as these memorials are , they are not as effective a means of saving lives on the highways as are driving more slowly and lawfully -lrb- people in new mexico are notorious speeders and runners of stop lights -rrb- , paying attention , and driving sober .
tetman callis , usa the seatbelt was a revelation for some but a huge step forward .
i would like to see more , effective measures for in car safety such as harness type seatbelts that race car drivers wear .
in fact , legal measures should be implemented to take safety innovations from the race-track where safety is a primary concern and translate them into the family vehicle arena .
brett jackson , us ban buses and taxi s from speeding .
it seems that they are above the law in the uk and they too are responsible for a massive number of road deaths / injuries .
ban smoking while driving - lighting up is really dangerous and does detract attention from the road .
ban young men from owning white nova 's n benson , uk two words : slow down ! !
jill , northern ireland it is the appalling standard of driving in this country that needs addressing-inappropriate speed for the conditions can mean that 20mph is too fast .
at the same time too slow a speed can also cause serious accidents-overtaking traffic at 2-3mph more than their speed in the 3rd lane of a motorway is a common cause of tailbacks & subsequent frustration .
the problem is that drivers are not taught " situational awareness " -something that motorcyclists have to develop in order to survive , as do military pilots .
speed cameras are not the answer , as they are incapable of recording hgv 's exceeding their limit -lrb- 56mph -rrb- , by 20mph & yet they will result in prosecution for a driver doing 90mph at 3am on the m6 in cumbria when there is nothing else on the motorway .
mike sterland , uk where can i buy one ?
i 'd rather live than worry about fashion peter , uk some of the suggestions in this article are already in place in new zealand .
" death markers " in the form of white wooden crosses can be seen at the sides of many roads although i believe that these crosses are placed by relatives of people killed in road traffic accidents .
" shock " adverts regularly appear on nz tv at peak viewing times .
they are usually quite graphic and hard hitting .
" random " breath testing is commonplace .
it may not be regarded as random as the police stop all vehicles passing through the check point .
sadly however there are still too many accidents .
an apparent lack of basic driving skills and excessive speed seem to be the main causes .
peter , new zealand lower speed limits , head bands -lrb- where can i buy one ?
i 'd rather live than worry about fashion -rrb- , death markers are all excellent ideas .
driving would be less ' fun ' , and slower , but so what ?
i 'd rather get to my destination ten minutes later than arrive thirty years early in the next world .
peter , uk there appears to be an increase in speed cameras , and a decrease in police patrols .
clearly , the speed cameras aim only to catch speeding motorists -lrb- and , of course , are a great revenue generator -rrb- .
meanwhile , other offences are committed , such as dangerous driving , and are not detected .
we need to see more police patrols .
sean , uk the uk is increasingly becoming the country of excessive restrictions on it 's residents .
from roadside cameras to increasing limitations on daily life , people do not appreciate how much their freedoms are being eroded .
educate but not legislate - if people do n't want to wear a seatbelt so be it - their choice .
time for nanny to leave the citizens to make choices for themselves - glad i left it all behind .
james , usa speeding may very well contributing factor , but is n't driving slow as well ?
i drive 25,000 miles a year and everyday i see car moving at 30-35 mph in a 60 speed limit , this causes frustration among drivers and will encourage them to overtake in places which are not safe .
if a driver is not comfortable doing 60 in a 60 they are obviously not confident and therefore should not be on the road , then again these slow coaches are the same ones who do not slow down when entering a built up 30mph area ! !
you know who you are ! !
aled , uk the government should consider school safety zones where speed limits are reduced still further , extra speed humps are employed , and extra fencing used .
a colour coded scheme -lrb- yellow is used in france -rrb- would also highlight the danger area to motorists .
entry into the zone should be clearly indicated e.g.
' warning , you are entering a school safety zone ' .
james , france maybe a radical solution is to make all occupant safety aids on cars illegal david clift , uk soft cars - instead of hard brittle sharp heavy ponty cars why not make cars from soft but durable foam ?
they would be lighter and more likely to bounce in a collision .
of course this would require replacing all vehicles on the road with rubbery cars in a fairly short time frame , but imagine the jobs that would be created .
mark s , brit in the usa the headband / minimal crash helmet idea is good .
as a recreational downhill skier i have become used to wearing a ski helmet and while this wo n't be able to prevent all damage , it could help .
likewise the headband idea might help and also help users think , " i am not indestructible " . sally deutschmann , canada prohibit by law all insurance that covers damage to vehicles one 's own and others - drivers would be very much more cautious .
john clark , dominican republic why are technological solutions always sought to human problems ?
better training , testing and enforcement of the existing laws would reduce the number of accidents .
mick sheppard , uk i feel everyone should be made to take a motorcycle cbt -lrb- compulsory basic training -rrb- .
i believe this would remove any false sense of security they may have when in a car , and also increase their awareness when on the road ..
gary hutton , spain maybe we are looking at this the wrong way , there is a lot of effort put into making car 's safer for their occupants , this leads to drivers feeling that if they crash then they will walk away uninjured .
maybe a radical solution is to make all occupant safety aids on cars illegal ! !
then maybe you would think twice before breaking the speed limit or driving too close to the car in front .
just an idea .
david clift , uk here is a suggestion for stopping people driving while chatting away on their mobile phone .
simply stop calls being transferred between area cells .
our motorways seem to have phone masts every 10m so they would n't even get a " hello " in before being cut off .
however they could always stop and make their call if its important .
jenny , uk get a big off road vehicle and then your most likely to come off best in a crash with another vehicle .
andrew , oxford lower speed limits , especially on country lanes would be a good idea .
its insane to allow motorist to do 60mph -lrb- and many will be doing 70mph or more -rrb- on winding , narrow , bumpy lanes , where around the next bend there could be a tractor , horse rider , cyclist or walker , plus probably another car approaching at 60mph , resulting in a 120mph collision .
lower speed limits , and an intelligent speed control system could prevent thousands of accidents and lives .
i guarantee most motorists would oppose this , as it would spoil their fun and would out-vote their victims to-be and victims relatives , if there was ever a vote on it .
mark humphries , uk getting stuck behind someone driving far beneath the speed limit because they think they 're being safe is going to frustrate other drivers and is very likely to make a person do something foolish or risky sim , uk / usa i believe the " go-slow " concept is a good idea , but something should be done to encourage people to purchase such automobiles .
i feel a tax credit or some type of financial incentive would be needed to encourage people to buy such vehicles .
higher speeds result in a higher level of fatal accidents ; unfortunately many are ignorant of this .
steve , usa how about going too slow being dangerous ?
getting stuck behind someone driving far beneath the speed limit because they think they 're being safe is going to frustrate other drivers and is very likely to make a person do something foolish or risky .
how about having speed restrictions timed ?
some people prefer driving at night when there 's less traffic on the roads and yet are still restricted to speed limits .
speed should be appropriate to circumstances .
sim , uk / usa it would be nice if people actually wore the seatbelts in their cars - the amount of cars i see in the town where i live in essex not wearing their belts is alarming ; especially when you consider that -lrb- 1 -rrb- most of the drivers were either extremely young or not even born when wearing seatbelts in the uk became law and -lrb- 2 -rrb- the cars being driven are not always new enough to have airbags .
personally , i 'm in favour of drivers not wearing seatbelts who are involved in accidents having their insurance voided - and having to pay for any nhs treatment .
it may sound harsh , but quite often these people have children in the back of the car and are just selfish .
catriona , uk i think that the use of signs to show where fatal or serious accidents have occurred is one of the best measures for stating just how dangerous the roads are .
when i was younger i remember seeing signs which were black spots for places of danger .
well worth considering again .
lisa fahy , england why is it assumed that all people are genetically pre-disposed to being good at driving ?
i think that people who do n't pass their test within 5 attempts should n't be allowed on the road. matt , uk i think there should be a reactions test before you are allowed to drive or rid a motorbike .
dan , uk i welcome any of these ideas if it helps save lives .
my dad was killed in a road accident in 1998 , and it never stops seeming so stupid that someone could be killed while on a cycle path , just because the path was not wide enough for two bikes to cross !
elizabeth warn , albania it 's not only blokes who ride big motorcycles , us ladies do too .
it seems to cause a lot of male car drivers extreme angst to see a lady rider on a big , powerful bike .
so much so in fact that it appears to be a direct challenge to their penis size , and they do their best to cut us up , swerve in front of us and make extravagant hand gestures .
shouting obscenities out of car windows when the sisters pass by is a favourite too .
i suggest making it law to oblige all women bikers to dress like men when on a bike , fake beards , hide it all away jackets and a mighty morphin plastic ranger attitude to the road .
us ladies want to be real men too ! ! !
louisa morgan , uk people drive fast because they are impatient -lrb- more so in the south east of england -rrb- .
people get impatient because they know their car is capable of going faster , especially if stuck behind a slower vehicle .
if all vehicles were restricted to the legal speed limit , there would be no impatience and no speeding .
in theory anyway !
lee , uk i think that all motorists should be made to do a refresher course every 10 years monique denton , uk i am an advanced motorcyclist and have practised as a specialist injury solicitor for over 18 years .
there are two main causes of road accidents that could be reduced relatively cheaply ; -lrb- 1 -rrb- it should be illegal to drive any motor vehicle on a public road having consumed any alcohol at all- there is no logical argument for allowing any consumption of a known inhibitor when driving -lrb- 2 -rrb- all drivers should be subject to compulsory re-test every 10 years up to the age of 50 and every 5 years thereafter .
it is insane that drivers who passed their test 40 years ago can still drive in today 's environment without retesting of their abilities .
mike clarke , england the driving test is too easy .
what is now called the advanced test should be the standard .
then the people operating cars would be able to drive properly and i 'm sure the number of accidents would drop .
increasing the difficulty of obtaining a licence means the threat of having it taken away becomes more serious .
james begent , england stopping distance , stopping distance , stopping distance .
last week i drove along a wet crowded motorway at 65mph , in the leftmost lane , keeping a good distance behind the car in front of me .
and all i could see in my rear-view mirror was the radiator grille of the huge lorry driving about a foot behind me .
people like that should be prosecuted for attempted murder .
but you never hear about that sort of bad driving - what you get are stories about ambulance drivers speeding on empty dry roads while trying to save lives - and being prosecuted for their trouble .
can we be grown-up about it and attack inappropriate speed rather than absolute speeding ?
peter , england i like the head band protection -lrb- do they come in child sizes too ? -rrb- , the speed limiters on vehicles and random breath tests .
i think that all motorists should be made to do a refresher course every 10 years .
i would also like to see compulsory lights and reflective wear for cyclists and motorcyclists monique denton , uk i think all cars should be equipped with reflective vests , so that when cars break down at the roadside , the passengers of the car become clearly visible on the roadside .
far too many people are killed on the hard shoulder each year in the uk and something needs to be done about it .
perhaps they should be supplied as standard with all knew cars ?
caroline walton , uk some cars make a noise when the seatbelt is not plugged in and have proper seatbelts in the middle backseat. both of these features would be great if made compulsory .
emma , uk i recall reading about a proposal for a simple change to cars to save lives - the change was to replace the drivers air bag with a big spike .
the idea is that when drivers can see the danger that they are in if they do not drive carefully , they pay attention and drive very carefully indeed .
martin , uk another idea might be to raise the age at which drivers can learn to drive .
the number of ' ' boy racers " on the road must be a contributory factor to the incidents of speed and carnage on the road -lrb- and probably road rage , too , not to mention noise pollution from the massive sound systems many have - if a mobile ' phone is deemed dangerous what about a stereo booming out 100 + watts of sound ?
surely such levels of sound must be distracting to the point of danger . -rrb- andrew , england i think there is an over emphasis on road safety in this country .
the roads are safer than houses .
more people are now killed in accidents in their home each year than on the roads .
more than 4,000 people are killed annually in the home compared to 3,600 on the roads .
one of the safest places you can be is locked up in a padded cell but would you want to live your life that way ?
colin smith , uk to rebecca : yes it is sometimes vital to get out of someone 's way .
that 's what your brakes are for - speeding is never a solution top danger on the roads .
and to b essada : how would a " driving test " for bikes " save 500 kids per year ? "
that 's more than ten times the annual child pedal cyclist fatality rate .
the real barrier to improved road safety is our refusal to take responsibility .
for the most parts these are not " accidents , " over 90 % are crashes resulting from negligence on the part of at least one road user .
pay more attention to the road and less to trying to shave five seconds off your journey .
guy chapman , uk i think smoking at the wheel is more dangerous than using a mobile phone .
you have to take both hands off the wheel to light it , and if you drop it a burning cigarette will land in your lap - very likely to be distracting !
lisa , scotland maybe we need to concentrate on educating pedestrians on how to use crossings and not automatically say that drivers are evil denzil pemberthy , uk " collisions with trees kill 1,600 people a year in germany , 800 in france and more than 200 in britain " look at the figures !
i think that britain already has some of the world 's safest roads , none of the suggestions would help to make us any safer -lrb- unless we were all banned from driving -rrb- .
as a driver it really annoys me how it seems that anything is the drivers fault .
for instance the kill your speed , not a child campaign , if the child had n't walked out from in front of another car he would n't have been hit in the first place .
maybe we need to concentrate on educating pedestrians on how to use crossings and not automatically say that drivers are evil .
denzil pemberthy , uk i like the indian solution : signs by the road - " do n't drive silly , enjoy the valley " and other little poems .
cute but totally ineffective of course .
delhi also has a large sign showing the daily death and serious injury stats for the city .
averages 4 of each per day .
carrie , uk i think that everyone should be required to take part in a refresher course every 10 to 15 years .
i ca n't think of one person i know over forty who would pass their driving test if they re-took it now .
roz , germany anything that makes people less tunnel visioned when they enter their car ca n't hurt .
may i suggest that in place of the air bag on the steering a large spike is put there instead .
it will certainly make people go slower know that they could be kebabed if they had to reduce their speed quickly .
lucy , uk speeding is viewed by many as the be all and end all of road safety and seems as a consequence to be the only target when it comes to road safety .
as a regular motorway driver i see far more accidents caused by people driving too close to the car in front .
would n't speed camera technology be better employed capturing this rather than targeting someone on what may very well be an empty road .
a simple survey of passing cars still reveals a significant percentage not wearing seatbelts .
tim k , uk better road markings , higher quality tarmac that can reduce ' spray ' on the roads , making visibility better and safer for all .
george williams , uk after seeing the ' the uk 's worst driver ' tv program , i think that anyone caught in an accident should have to take a mini driving test , if they pass , no problem , if they perform ' acceptably ' , they should have their fault pointed out , perhaps made to retake this test , if they fail .. they should lose their licence completely .
all accidents are caused by bad driving - whether going to fast for the conditions , or simply poor judgement. by making drivers take a test , it could be used as a means of ensuring only good drivers get to drive .
andy , uk in england 14 % of the driving population fail to meet the eyesight requirements for driving , which i believe are amongst the laxest in europe .
why do n't the police take any action against such dangerous drivers ?
drivers should be required to take annual eyesight tests , particularly older drivers .
andy gambles , england all cars should be fitted with a breathalyser tube which must be blown into to start the car .
if you fail the test the car wo n't start .
simple ! !
bill robertson , scotland my idea is that no-one should be allowed to drive a car before they have learned how to ride a motor bike and ridden one for two years .
this will only increase their road awareness and make the realise that even in a car they are vulnerable to bad drivers .
russell , london , uk is 71mph any more dangerous than 69mph on a motorway ?
mike wicks , uk making cars out of sponge , banning all drivers except me , the ' safer ' driving is the more risks people take .
a compulsory re-test every 5 years would be a better plan , tackling the real issue - the people who drive !
gnome , uk the only suggestion which i can see being as dangerous as the current situation is a go slow car .
whilst not advocating speeding on a general basis -lrb- although let 's face it , most of us do it if only by a couple of miles an hour -rrb- , there are times when it is vital for safety to be able to get out of someone else 's way , for which it may be necessary to speed for a brief moment .
without the ability to do this , i would certainly have been in a number of accidents in my time which were totally unrelated to my own driving .
rebecca , uk is 71mph any more dangerous than 69mph on a motorway ?
the concentration by the authorities and pressure groups on absolute speeds , instead of appropriate speed is a waste of time .
how many speed cameras do we need to reduce the fatalities on the road to 0 ?
if you concentrate solely on speed , the most cost-effective solution surely would be to bring back the red flag act of the 1800s , when all horseless carriages were required to be preceded by a man walking in front with a red flag .
fortunately the maximum speed under this system is about 3 to 5 mph , so no one would ever get killed on the road again , but the country would grind to a halt .
mike wicks , uk simple a driving test for bike riders .
bikes are great kids toys for off road use .
if they are going to be used on road the rider should either hold , or be escorted by someone holding , a driving licence .
this would save 500 kids a year with very little cost .

in the latest move , the uk government announced this week it would be banning the use of mobile phones while driving .
below is a selection of other suggestions to improve road safety , drawn from various sources .
bbc news online would also like to hear your views by filling out the form below .
head bands would drivers wear these ?
many of the most serious road crashes result in head injuries .
they may not look too fashionable , but these head bands have been identified as one way of reducing the human impact of car accidents .
leading research in this area is the road accident research unit at the university of adelaide , in australia .
its tests have already shown headbands would reduce injuries from frontal car crashes , and research is continuing on other types of crash .
essentially the bands are crash helmets which have been scaled down to look less bulky .
it may be hard to imagine people wearing them - but many people opposed wearing seat belts when they were introduced .
go-slow cars cars could stop their own drivers from speeding experts at the university of leeds are working on a car equipped with a speed limiter which makes it impossible to break the legal limit .
professor of transport safety , oliver carsten , said : " we believe this kind of technology can contribute to road safety .
" if all drivers kept to the speed limit , deaths on the road -lrb- in the uk -rrb- would fall by 37 % , over 1,200 each year . "
the system has been dubbed intelligent speed adaptation .
death markers black markers signify deaths and red indicate serious injuries an idea used in various countries where the risk of crashes increases on long stretches of road .
black markers -lrb- usually small wooden posts -rrb- are installed at locations where fatal accidents have occurred .
they may be slightly morbid , but these markers , which feature small crosses at the top , are sobering reminder of how dangerous driving can be .
they also serve to highlight corners or stretches of road which may be more hazardous than they appear .
additional red markers indicate sites of crashes which resulted in serious injuries .
design and roadside objects road design is crucial many vehicle deaths would be avoided if authorities paid closer attention to removing or fencing off roadside objects , such as dangerous trees and posts .
collisions with trees kill 1,600 people a year in germany , 800 in france and more than 200 in britain .
general design of roads is also important , with some research suggesting poor design contributes to 33 % of crashes .
refresher courses middle-aged men are getting back on the road a concern raised by the aa is the number of middle-aged men " rediscovering their youth " by getting back on their motorcycles .
it can sometimes be too late when they discover the road environment has changed over the last 20 to 30 years .
many would benefit from refresher courses to hone their skills , which may have diminished over the years and must be adapted to modern road conditions .
hitting home cars can be fragile machines many people do not fully comprehend the horror of car crashes , and thus do not drive accordingly .
numerous advertisements have used shocking images of accidents in the hope of reforming attitudes .
some say this could be taken a step further by occasionally putting badly damaged and burnt out vehicles at the roadside .
it would surely be a stark reminder of how fragile a car can be when travelling at speed .
lower speed limits is 40mph too fast ?
it seems obvious , but few people realise the difference made by slower driving .
not only are you less likely to suffer serious injuries , but there is less chance of the accident happening in the first place .
research in areas where the speed limit is 60km / h -lrb- just under 40mph -rrb- has shown the chance of crashing could be reduced by as much as 40 % if the limit was lowered by just 10km / h .
however suggestions of lowering speed limits often encounter resistance from motorists who are in a hurry to get where they are going .
drink driving drunk drivers can be lethal alcohol is still a major cause of car crashes .
the royal society for the prevention of accidents says the allowable amount of alcohol should be lowered from 80mg to 50mg .
furthermore , it wants police empowered to test drivers randomly .
" they should be able to test anywhere at any time , " a spokesman said .
a selection of views from bbc news online readers : clear , logical road direction signs , well in advance of junctions would reduce accidents where people brake sharply because they have nearly missed a turn .
a lot more thinking needs to go into how direction signs are laid out , located and lead the driver confidently to their destination .
eric woodcock , united kingdom tail-gating is at least as dangerous as speeding , but seems to be completely unenforced .
also the comments other people have made here hardly mention it .
why is there such a blind spot about safe distances ?
it would be quite easy to put a forward radar in cars to warn about being too close , perhaps even to enforce a minimum distance , along similar lines to a speed governor .
stephen burke , england i think those head bands are a bad idea .
people will not want to be seen dead in those so will speed through towns in order not to be seen .
come on honestly is that the best they can come up with henry , england manufacturers still do not do enough to stop vehicles from being stolen .
many crimes , not only " joy riding " use stolen cars .
the public are put at great danger by this crime .
enormous police and victims resources are absorbed by the effects and results of stolen cars .
vehicles can be manufactured so that the need to put extra steering locks on them becomes redundant .
alternatively legislation should be brought in so that vehicle security systems are far more difficult to defeat .
scott , yorkshire roads should all be marked every 100 metres with the speed limit .
all speed cameras should have the speed limit painted on them .
half the time you do n't know what the speed limit is on uk roads - a cynical attempt to catch more motorists out ?
rooster , uk " occasionally putting badly damaged and burnt out vehicles at the roadside " - anybody who has ever lived in an inner city area will be well aware that this occurs frequently and does nothing to help road safety !
lee i agree with the comment about sight tests .
as well as doing a breath test at the scene of any incident police officers should also be required to check somebody 's eye sight .
many people do n't realise their eyesight is getting worse as it happens so slow .
i 've seen a number of people have very near misses , who subsequently go for an eye test to find out they need glasses at least for driving , and been amazed at what they were missing as regards things happening around them .
zippy , uk it 's driver psychology which needs to be addressed ahead of any other life-saving devices jessica , uk the revenue collected from " speed cameras " should be used to improve the general standard and safety of the actual roads .
placing cameras on awkward bends and corners is not the answer .
make the roads straight and fence off trees .
or even cut down trees .
at the moment revenue is just another form of taxation .
shaun grimes , uk the telling fact is in the chart : six deaths per hundred thousand people per year .
the figure is miniscule .
do we really need all the inconvenience of the road safety industry for this tiny risk ?
simon richardson , uk many contributors mention the physical distraction of smoking at the wheel .
there seems to be a reluctance to realise that although cigarettes are legal , nicotine is a highly addictive narcotic which often causes symptoms of aggressive behavior .
the smoke also reduces blood oxygen levels and increases levels of carbon monoxide in the blood , which is not conducive to clear thinking .
it seems strange that whilst alcohol is blamed for so much , being " high " off cigarettes is considered " normal " .
mike , uk encourage people to use their cars less .
invest in the public transport infrastructure .
use bicyles for short trips .
allan wishart , uk it 's driver psychology which needs to be addressed ahead of any other life-saving devices .
until people get it into their thick heads that speeding is unacceptable , then you 'll never reduce the number of fatalities on our roads .
it 's the " i 'm bigger and better and faster and more important than you " attitude which is so destructive .
jessica , uk zero mg of alcohol .
no smoking in cars , especially when the driver is trying to locate the dying embers that have fallen between the seats at 80mph on the m1 .
no phones -lrb- soon to be law thankfully -rrb- .
i do n't think shock tactics work .
people invariably believe it wo n't happen to them - just ask a smoker if they fear their own mortality .
without question swift and deterrent punishment to match the offence , including lifetime bans will get their attention .
why do we pander to these lunatics who threaten us and our children everyday ?
simon , london , uk touching as these memorials are , they are not as effective a means of saving lives on the highways as are driving more slowly and lawfully tetman callis , usa road safety would be improved by encouraging better driving standards not lowering speeds to ridiculously low levels which induce boredom and reduce concentration .
some would have the return of a man with red flag walking in front of the vehicle !
equal effort should also go into the quality of car maintenance - a special stringent mot test should be introduced for cars over 8 years old with a view to reducing the nation 's stock of bangers .
bill finch , scotland all of the above ideas will most likely reduce accidents , injuries and death .
there are two other areas that should be addressed .
1 .
a comprehensive driving test -lrb- road and classroom -rrb- that needs to retaken every 10 years , and passed or you loose your driving license .
2 .
giving the police enough resources and incentive to effectively and fairly enforced the current road rules .
these two actions are required in the uk , australia and the us .
counties i have lived , worked and driven in over the last 13 years .
ronald spiers usa , usa i work outdoors with children / students in a rural area .
thirty years ago , more than 95 % of drivers would slow down noticeably or even stop if we were walking in single file along the edge of a narrow road .
these days the proportion of arrogant and aggressive drivers -lrb- mainly men -rrb- speeding past even young children on the same road , leaving just inches to spare , has risen to more than a quarter .
bob burn , wales here in new mexico , there is a long-standing tradition of friends and family erecting roadside crosses along the sides of roads where loved ones have died in automobile accidents .
touching as these memorials are , they are not as effective a means of saving lives on the highways as are driving more slowly and lawfully -lrb- people in new mexico are notorious speeders and runners of stop lights -rrb- , paying attention , and driving sober .
tetman callis , usa the seatbelt was a revelation for some but a huge step forward .
i would like to see more , effective measures for in car safety such as harness type seatbelts that race car drivers wear .
in fact , legal measures should be implemented to take safety innovations from the race-track where safety is a primary concern and translate them into the family vehicle arena .
brett jackson , us ban buses and taxi s from speeding .
it seems that they are above the law in the uk and they too are responsible for a massive number of road deaths / injuries .
ban smoking while driving - lighting up is really dangerous and does detract attention from the road .
ban young men from owning white nova 's n benson , uk two words : slow down ! !
jill , northern ireland it is the appalling standard of driving in this country that needs addressing-inappropriate speed for the conditions can mean that 20mph is too fast .
at the same time too slow a speed can also cause serious accidents-overtaking traffic at 2-3mph more than their speed in the 3rd lane of a motorway is a common cause of tailbacks & subsequent frustration .
the problem is that drivers are not taught " situational awareness " -something that motorcyclists have to develop in order to survive , as do military pilots .
speed cameras are not the answer , as they are incapable of recording hgv 's exceeding their limit -lrb- 56mph -rrb- , by 20mph & yet they will result in prosecution for a driver doing 90mph at 3am on the m6 in cumbria when there is nothing else on the motorway .
mike sterland , uk where can i buy one ?
i 'd rather live than worry about fashion peter , uk some of the suggestions in this article are already in place in new zealand .
" death markers " in the form of white wooden crosses can be seen at the sides of many roads although i believe that these crosses are placed by relatives of people killed in road traffic accidents .
" shock " adverts regularly appear on nz tv at peak viewing times .
they are usually quite graphic and hard hitting .
" random " breath testing is commonplace .
it may not be regarded as random as the police stop all vehicles passing through the check point .
sadly however there are still too many accidents .
an apparent lack of basic driving skills and excessive speed seem to be the main causes .
peter , new zealand lower speed limits , head bands -lrb- where can i buy one ?
i 'd rather live than worry about fashion -rrb- , death markers are all excellent ideas .
driving would be less ' fun ' , and slower , but so what ?
i 'd rather get to my destination ten minutes later than arrive thirty years early in the next world .
peter , uk there appears to be an increase in speed cameras , and a decrease in police patrols .
clearly , the speed cameras aim only to catch speeding motorists -lrb- and , of course , are a great revenue generator -rrb- .
meanwhile , other offences are committed , such as dangerous driving , and are not detected .
we need to see more police patrols .
sean , uk the uk is increasingly becoming the country of excessive restrictions on it 's residents .
from roadside cameras to increasing limitations on daily life , people do not appreciate how much their freedoms are being eroded .
educate but not legislate - if people do n't want to wear a seatbelt so be it - their choice .
time for nanny to leave the citizens to make choices for themselves - glad i left it all behind .
james , usa speeding may very well contributing factor , but is n't driving slow as well ?
i drive 25,000 miles a year and everyday i see car moving at 30-35 mph in a 60 speed limit , this causes frustration among drivers and will encourage them to overtake in places which are not safe .
if a driver is not comfortable doing 60 in a 60 they are obviously not confident and therefore should not be on the road , then again these slow coaches are the same ones who do not slow down when entering a built up 30mph area ! !
you know who you are ! !
aled , uk the government should consider school safety zones where speed limits are reduced still further , extra speed humps are employed , and extra fencing used .
a colour coded scheme -lrb- yellow is used in france -rrb- would also highlight the danger area to motorists .
entry into the zone should be clearly indicated e.g.
' warning , you are entering a school safety zone ' .
james , france maybe a radical solution is to make all occupant safety aids on cars illegal david clift , uk soft cars - instead of hard brittle sharp heavy ponty cars why not make cars from soft but durable foam ?
they would be lighter and more likely to bounce in a collision .
of course this would require replacing all vehicles on the road with rubbery cars in a fairly short time frame , but imagine the jobs that would be created .
mark s , brit in the usa the headband / minimal crash helmet idea is good .
as a recreational downhill skier i have become used to wearing a ski helmet and while this wo n't be able to prevent all damage , it could help .
likewise the headband idea might help and also help users think , " i am not indestructible " . sally deutschmann , canada prohibit by law all insurance that covers damage to vehicles one 's own and others - drivers would be very much more cautious .
john clark , dominican republic why are technological solutions always sought to human problems ?
better training , testing and enforcement of the existing laws would reduce the number of accidents .
mick sheppard , uk i feel everyone should be made to take a motorcycle cbt -lrb- compulsory basic training -rrb- .
i believe this would remove any false sense of security they may have when in a car , and also increase their awareness when on the road ..
gary hutton , spain maybe we are looking at this the wrong way , there is a lot of effort put into making car 's safer for their occupants , this leads to drivers feeling that if they crash then they will walk away uninjured .
maybe a radical solution is to make all occupant safety aids on cars illegal ! !
then maybe you would think twice before breaking the speed limit or driving too close to the car in front .
just an idea .
david clift , uk here is a suggestion for stopping people driving while chatting away on their mobile phone .
simply stop calls being transferred between area cells .
our motorways seem to have phone masts every 10m so they would n't even get a " hello " in before being cut off .
however they could always stop and make their call if its important .
jenny , uk get a big off road vehicle and then your most likely to come off best in a crash with another vehicle .
andrew , oxford lower speed limits , especially on country lanes would be a good idea .
its insane to allow motorist to do 60mph -lrb- and many will be doing 70mph or more -rrb- on winding , narrow , bumpy lanes , where around the next bend there could be a tractor , horse rider , cyclist or walker , plus probably another car approaching at 60mph , resulting in a 120mph collision .
lower speed limits , and an intelligent speed control system could prevent thousands of accidents and lives .
i guarantee most motorists would oppose this , as it would spoil their fun and would out-vote their victims to-be and victims relatives , if there was ever a vote on it .
mark humphries , uk getting stuck behind someone driving far beneath the speed limit because they think they 're being safe is going to frustrate other drivers and is very likely to make a person do something foolish or risky sim , uk / usa i believe the " go-slow " concept is a good idea , but something should be done to encourage people to purchase such automobiles .
i feel a tax credit or some type of financial incentive would be needed to encourage people to buy such vehicles .
higher speeds result in a higher level of fatal accidents ; unfortunately many are ignorant of this .
steve , usa how about going too slow being dangerous ?
getting stuck behind someone driving far beneath the speed limit because they think they 're being safe is going to frustrate other drivers and is very likely to make a person do something foolish or risky .
how about having speed restrictions timed ?
some people prefer driving at night when there 's less traffic on the roads and yet are still restricted to speed limits .
speed should be appropriate to circumstances .
sim , uk / usa it would be nice if people actually wore the seatbelts in their cars - the amount of cars i see in the town where i live in essex not wearing their belts is alarming ; especially when you consider that -lrb- 1 -rrb- most of the drivers were either extremely young or not even born when wearing seatbelts in the uk became law and -lrb- 2 -rrb- the cars being driven are not always new enough to have airbags .
personally , i 'm in favour of drivers not wearing seatbelts who are involved in accidents having their insurance voided - and having to pay for any nhs treatment .
it may sound harsh , but quite often these people have children in the back of the car and are just selfish .
catriona , uk i think that the use of signs to show where fatal or serious accidents have occurred is one of the best measures for stating just how dangerous the roads are .
when i was younger i remember seeing signs which were black spots for places of danger .
well worth considering again .
lisa fahy , england why is it assumed that all people are genetically pre-disposed to being good at driving ?
i think that people who do n't pass their test within 5 attempts should n't be allowed on the road. matt , uk i think there should be a reactions test before you are allowed to drive or rid a motorbike .
dan , uk i welcome any of these ideas if it helps save lives .
my dad was killed in a road accident in 1998 , and it never stops seeming so stupid that someone could be killed while on a cycle path , just because the path was not wide enough for two bikes to cross !
elizabeth warn , albania it 's not only blokes who ride big motorcycles , us ladies do too .
it seems to cause a lot of male car drivers extreme angst to see a lady rider on a big , powerful bike .
so much so in fact that it appears to be a direct challenge to their penis size , and they do their best to cut us up , swerve in front of us and make extravagant hand gestures .
shouting obscenities out of car windows when the sisters pass by is a favourite too .
i suggest making it law to oblige all women bikers to dress like men when on a bike , fake beards , hide it all away jackets and a mighty morphin plastic ranger attitude to the road .
us ladies want to be real men too ! ! !
louisa morgan , uk people drive fast because they are impatient -lrb- more so in the south east of england -rrb- .
people get impatient because they know their car is capable of going faster , especially if stuck behind a slower vehicle .
if all vehicles were restricted to the legal speed limit , there would be no impatience and no speeding .
in theory anyway !
lee , uk i think that all motorists should be made to do a refresher course every 10 years monique denton , uk i am an advanced motorcyclist and have practised as a specialist injury solicitor for over 18 years .
there are two main causes of road accidents that could be reduced relatively cheaply ; -lrb- 1 -rrb- it should be illegal to drive any motor vehicle on a public road having consumed any alcohol at all- there is no logical argument for allowing any consumption of a known inhibitor when driving -lrb- 2 -rrb- all drivers should be subject to compulsory re-test every 10 years up to the age of 50 and every 5 years thereafter .
it is insane that drivers who passed their test 40 years ago can still drive in today 's environment without retesting of their abilities .
mike clarke , england the driving test is too easy .
what is now called the advanced test should be the standard .
then the people operating cars would be able to drive properly and i 'm sure the number of accidents would drop .
increasing the difficulty of obtaining a licence means the threat of having it taken away becomes more serious .
james begent , england stopping distance , stopping distance , stopping distance .
last week i drove along a wet crowded motorway at 65mph , in the leftmost lane , keeping a good distance behind the car in front of me .
and all i could see in my rear-view mirror was the radiator grille of the huge lorry driving about a foot behind me .
people like that should be prosecuted for attempted murder .
but you never hear about that sort of bad driving - what you get are stories about ambulance drivers speeding on empty dry roads while trying to save lives - and being prosecuted for their trouble .
can we be grown-up about it and attack inappropriate speed rather than absolute speeding ?
peter , england i like the head band protection -lrb- do they come in child sizes too ? -rrb- , the speed limiters on vehicles and random breath tests .
i think that all motorists should be made to do a refresher course every 10 years .
i would also like to see compulsory lights and reflective wear for cyclists and motorcyclists monique denton , uk i think all cars should be equipped with reflective vests , so that when cars break down at the roadside , the passengers of the car become clearly visible on the roadside .
far too many people are killed on the hard shoulder each year in the uk and something needs to be done about it .
perhaps they should be supplied as standard with all knew cars ?
caroline walton , uk some cars make a noise when the seatbelt is not plugged in and have proper seatbelts in the middle backseat. both of these features would be great if made compulsory .
emma , uk i recall reading about a proposal for a simple change to cars to save lives - the change was to replace the drivers air bag with a big spike .
the idea is that when drivers can see the danger that they are in if they do not drive carefully , they pay attention and drive very carefully indeed .
martin , uk another idea might be to raise the age at which drivers can learn to drive .
the number of ' ' boy racers " on the road must be a contributory factor to the incidents of speed and carnage on the road -lrb- and probably road rage , too , not to mention noise pollution from the massive sound systems many have - if a mobile ' phone is deemed dangerous what about a stereo booming out 100 + watts of sound ?
surely such levels of sound must be distracting to the point of danger . -rrb- andrew , england i think there is an over emphasis on road safety in this country .
the roads are safer than houses .
more people are now killed in accidents in their home each year than on the roads .
more than 4,000 people are killed annually in the home compared to 3,600 on the roads .
one of the safest places you can be is locked up in a padded cell but would you want to live your life that way ?
colin smith , uk to rebecca : yes it is sometimes vital to get out of someone 's way .
that 's what your brakes are for - speeding is never a solution top danger on the roads .
and to b essada : how would a " driving test " for bikes " save 500 kids per year ? "
that 's more than ten times the annual child pedal cyclist fatality rate .
the real barrier to improved road safety is our refusal to take responsibility .
for the most parts these are not " accidents , " over 90 % are crashes resulting from negligence on the part of at least one road user .
pay more attention to the road and less to trying to shave five seconds off your journey .
guy chapman , uk i think smoking at the wheel is more dangerous than using a mobile phone .
you have to take both hands off the wheel to light it , and if you drop it a burning cigarette will land in your lap - very likely to be distracting !
lisa , scotland maybe we need to concentrate on educating pedestrians on how to use crossings and not automatically say that drivers are evil denzil pemberthy , uk " collisions with trees kill 1,600 people a year in germany , 800 in france and more than 200 in britain " look at the figures !
i think that britain already has some of the world 's safest roads , none of the suggestions would help to make us any safer -lrb- unless we were all banned from driving -rrb- .
as a driver it really annoys me how it seems that anything is the drivers fault .
for instance the kill your speed , not a child campaign , if the child had n't walked out from in front of another car he would n't have been hit in the first place .
maybe we need to concentrate on educating pedestrians on how to use crossings and not automatically say that drivers are evil .
denzil pemberthy , uk i like the indian solution : signs by the road - " do n't drive silly , enjoy the valley " and other little poems .
cute but totally ineffective of course .
delhi also has a large sign showing the daily death and serious injury stats for the city .
averages 4 of each per day .
carrie , uk i think that everyone should be required to take part in a refresher course every 10 to 15 years .
i ca n't think of one person i know over forty who would pass their driving test if they re-took it now .
roz , germany anything that makes people less tunnel visioned when they enter their car ca n't hurt .
may i suggest that in place of the air bag on the steering a large spike is put there instead .
it will certainly make people go slower know that they could be kebabed if they had to reduce their speed quickly .
lucy , uk speeding is viewed by many as the be all and end all of road safety and seems as a consequence to be the only target when it comes to road safety .
as a regular motorway driver i see far more accidents caused by people driving too close to the car in front .
would n't speed camera technology be better employed capturing this rather than targeting someone on what may very well be an empty road .
a simple survey of passing cars still reveals a significant percentage not wearing seatbelts .
tim k , uk better road markings , higher quality tarmac that can reduce ' spray ' on the roads , making visibility better and safer for all .
george williams , uk after seeing the ' the uk 's worst driver ' tv program , i think that anyone caught in an accident should have to take a mini driving test , if they pass , no problem , if they perform ' acceptably ' , they should have their fault pointed out , perhaps made to retake this test , if they fail .. they should lose their licence completely .
all accidents are caused by bad driving - whether going to fast for the conditions , or simply poor judgement. by making drivers take a test , it could be used as a means of ensuring only good drivers get to drive .
andy , uk in england 14 % of the driving population fail to meet the eyesight requirements for driving , which i believe are amongst the laxest in europe .
why do n't the police take any action against such dangerous drivers ?
drivers should be required to take annual eyesight tests , particularly older drivers .
andy gambles , england all cars should be fitted with a breathalyser tube which must be blown into to start the car .
if you fail the test the car wo n't start .
simple ! !
bill robertson , scotland my idea is that no-one should be allowed to drive a car before they have learned how to ride a motor bike and ridden one for two years .
this will only increase their road awareness and make the realise that even in a car they are vulnerable to bad drivers .
russell , london , uk is 71mph any more dangerous than 69mph on a motorway ?
mike wicks , uk making cars out of sponge , banning all drivers except me , the ' safer ' driving is the more risks people take .
a compulsory re-test every 5 years would be a better plan , tackling the real issue - the people who drive !
gnome , uk the only suggestion which i can see being as dangerous as the current situation is a go slow car .
whilst not advocating speeding on a general basis -lrb- although let 's face it , most of us do it if only by a couple of miles an hour -rrb- , there are times when it is vital for safety to be able to get out of someone else 's way , for which it may be necessary to speed for a brief moment .
without the ability to do this , i would certainly have been in a number of accidents in my time which were totally unrelated to my own driving .
rebecca , uk is 71mph any more dangerous than 69mph on a motorway ?
the concentration by the authorities and pressure groups on absolute speeds , instead of appropriate speed is a waste of time .
how many speed cameras do we need to reduce the fatalities on the road to 0 ?
if you concentrate solely on speed , the most cost-effective solution surely would be to bring back the red flag act of the 1800s , when all horseless carriages were required to be preceded by a man walking in front with a red flag .
fortunately the maximum speed under this system is about 3 to 5 mph , so no one would ever get killed on the road again , but the country would grind to a halt .
mike wicks , uk simple a driving test for bike riders .
bikes are great kids toys for off road use .
if they are going to be used on road the rider should either hold , or be escorted by someone holding , a driving licence .
this would save 500 kids a year with very little cost .

in the latest move , the uk government announced this week it would be banning the use of mobile phones while driving .
below is a selection of other suggestions to improve road safety , drawn from various sources .
bbc news online would also like to hear your views by filling out the form below .
head bands would drivers wear these ?
many of the most serious road crashes result in head injuries .
they may not look too fashionable , but these head bands have been identified as one way of reducing the human impact of car accidents .
leading research in this area is the road accident research unit at the university of adelaide , in australia .
its tests have already shown headbands would reduce injuries from frontal car crashes , and research is continuing on other types of crash .
essentially the bands are crash helmets which have been scaled down to look less bulky .
it may be hard to imagine people wearing them - but many people opposed wearing seat belts when they were introduced .
go-slow cars cars could stop their own drivers from speeding experts at the university of leeds are working on a car equipped with a speed limiter which makes it impossible to break the legal limit .
professor of transport safety , oliver carsten , said : " we believe this kind of technology can contribute to road safety .
" if all drivers kept to the speed limit , deaths on the road -lrb- in the uk -rrb- would fall by 37 % , over 1,200 each year . "
the system has been dubbed intelligent speed adaptation .
death markers black markers signify deaths and red indicate serious injuries an idea used in various countries where the risk of crashes increases on long stretches of road .
black markers -lrb- usually small wooden posts -rrb- are installed at locations where fatal accidents have occurred .
they may be slightly morbid , but these markers , which feature small crosses at the top , are sobering reminder of how dangerous driving can be .
they also serve to highlight corners or stretches of road which may be more hazardous than they appear .
additional red markers indicate sites of crashes which resulted in serious injuries .
design and roadside objects road design is crucial many vehicle deaths would be avoided if authorities paid closer attention to removing or fencing off roadside objects , such as dangerous trees and posts .
collisions with trees kill 1,600 people a year in germany , 800 in france and more than 200 in britain .
general design of roads is also important , with some research suggesting poor design contributes to 33 % of crashes .
refresher courses middle-aged men are getting back on the road a concern raised by the aa is the number of middle-aged men " rediscovering their youth " by getting back on their motorcycles .
it can sometimes be too late when they discover the road environment has changed over the last 20 to 30 years .
many would benefit from refresher courses to hone their skills , which may have diminished over the years and must be adapted to modern road conditions .
hitting home cars can be fragile machines many people do not fully comprehend the horror of car crashes , and thus do not drive accordingly .
numerous advertisements have used shocking images of accidents in the hope of reforming attitudes .
some say this could be taken a step further by occasionally putting badly damaged and burnt out vehicles at the roadside .
it would surely be a stark reminder of how fragile a car can be when travelling at speed .
lower speed limits is 40mph too fast ?
it seems obvious , but few people realise the difference made by slower driving .
not only are you less likely to suffer serious injuries , but there is less chance of the accident happening in the first place .
research in areas where the speed limit is 60km / h -lrb- just under 40mph -rrb- has shown the chance of crashing could be reduced by as much as 40 % if the limit was lowered by just 10km / h .
however suggestions of lowering speed limits often encounter resistance from motorists who are in a hurry to get where they are going .
drink driving drunk drivers can be lethal alcohol is still a major cause of car crashes .
the royal society for the prevention of accidents says the allowable amount of alcohol should be lowered from 80mg to 50mg .
furthermore , it wants police empowered to test drivers randomly .
" they should be able to test anywhere at any time , " a spokesman said .
a selection of views from bbc news online readers : clear , logical road direction signs , well in advance of junctions would reduce accidents where people brake sharply because they have nearly missed a turn .
a lot more thinking needs to go into how direction signs are laid out , located and lead the driver confidently to their destination .
eric woodcock , united kingdom tail-gating is at least as dangerous as speeding , but seems to be completely unenforced .
also the comments other people have made here hardly mention it .
why is there such a blind spot about safe distances ?
it would be quite easy to put a forward radar in cars to warn about being too close , perhaps even to enforce a minimum distance , along similar lines to a speed governor .
stephen burke , england i think those head bands are a bad idea .
people will not want to be seen dead in those so will speed through towns in order not to be seen .
come on honestly is that the best they can come up with henry , england manufacturers still do not do enough to stop vehicles from being stolen .
many crimes , not only " joy riding " use stolen cars .
the public are put at great danger by this crime .
enormous police and victims resources are absorbed by the effects and results of stolen cars .
vehicles can be manufactured so that the need to put extra steering locks on them becomes redundant .
alternatively legislation should be brought in so that vehicle security systems are far more difficult to defeat .
scott , yorkshire roads should all be marked every 100 metres with the speed limit .
all speed cameras should have the speed limit painted on them .
half the time you do n't know what the speed limit is on uk roads - a cynical attempt to catch more motorists out ?
rooster , uk " occasionally putting badly damaged and burnt out vehicles at the roadside " - anybody who has ever lived in an inner city area will be well aware that this occurs frequently and does nothing to help road safety !
lee i agree with the comment about sight tests .
as well as doing a breath test at the scene of any incident police officers should also be required to check somebody 's eye sight .
many people do n't realise their eyesight is getting worse as it happens so slow .
i 've seen a number of people have very near misses , who subsequently go for an eye test to find out they need glasses at least for driving , and been amazed at what they were missing as regards things happening around them .
zippy , uk it 's driver psychology which needs to be addressed ahead of any other life-saving devices jessica , uk the revenue collected from " speed cameras " should be used to improve the general standard and safety of the actual roads .
placing cameras on awkward bends and corners is not the answer .
make the roads straight and fence off trees .
or even cut down trees .
at the moment revenue is just another form of taxation .
shaun grimes , uk the telling fact is in the chart : six deaths per hundred thousand people per year .
the figure is miniscule .
do we really need all the inconvenience of the road safety industry for this tiny risk ?
simon richardson , uk many contributors mention the physical distraction of smoking at the wheel .
there seems to be a reluctance to realise that although cigarettes are legal , nicotine is a highly addictive narcotic which often causes symptoms of aggressive behavior .
the smoke also reduces blood oxygen levels and increases levels of carbon monoxide in the blood , which is not conducive to clear thinking .
it seems strange that whilst alcohol is blamed for so much , being " high " off cigarettes is considered " normal " .
mike , uk encourage people to use their cars less .
invest in the public transport infrastructure .
use bicyles for short trips .
allan wishart , uk it 's driver psychology which needs to be addressed ahead of any other life-saving devices .
until people get it into their thick heads that speeding is unacceptable , then you 'll never reduce the number of fatalities on our roads .
it 's the " i 'm bigger and better and faster and more important than you " attitude which is so destructive .
jessica , uk zero mg of alcohol .
no smoking in cars , especially when the driver is trying to locate the dying embers that have fallen between the seats at 80mph on the m1 .
no phones -lrb- soon to be law thankfully -rrb- .
i do n't think shock tactics work .
people invariably believe it wo n't happen to them - just ask a smoker if they fear their own mortality .
without question swift and deterrent punishment to match the offence , including lifetime bans will get their attention .
why do we pander to these lunatics who threaten us and our children everyday ?
simon , london , uk touching as these memorials are , they are not as effective a means of saving lives on the highways as are driving more slowly and lawfully tetman callis , usa road safety would be improved by encouraging better driving standards not lowering speeds to ridiculously low levels which induce boredom and reduce concentration .
some would have the return of a man with red flag walking in front of the vehicle !
equal effort should also go into the quality of car maintenance - a special stringent mot test should be introduced for cars over 8 years old with a view to reducing the nation 's stock of bangers .
bill finch , scotland all of the above ideas will most likely reduce accidents , injuries and death .
there are two other areas that should be addressed .
1 .
a comprehensive driving test -lrb- road and classroom -rrb- that needs to retaken every 10 years , and passed or you loose your driving license .
2 .
giving the police enough resources and incentive to effectively and fairly enforced the current road rules .
these two actions are required in the uk , australia and the us .
counties i have lived , worked and driven in over the last 13 years .
ronald spiers usa , usa i work outdoors with children / students in a rural area .
thirty years ago , more than 95 % of drivers would slow down noticeably or even stop if we were walking in single file along the edge of a narrow road .
these days the proportion of arrogant and aggressive drivers -lrb- mainly men -rrb- speeding past even young children on the same road , leaving just inches to spare , has risen to more than a quarter .
bob burn , wales here in new mexico , there is a long-standing tradition of friends and family erecting roadside crosses along the sides of roads where loved ones have died in automobile accidents .
touching as these memorials are , they are not as effective a means of saving lives on the highways as are driving more slowly and lawfully -lrb- people in new mexico are notorious speeders and runners of stop lights -rrb- , paying attention , and driving sober .
tetman callis , usa the seatbelt was a revelation for some but a huge step forward .
i would like to see more , effective measures for in car safety such as harness type seatbelts that race car drivers wear .
in fact , legal measures should be implemented to take safety innovations from the race-track where safety is a primary concern and translate them into the family vehicle arena .
brett jackson , us ban buses and taxi s from speeding .
it seems that they are above the law in the uk and they too are responsible for a massive number of road deaths / injuries .
ban smoking while driving - lighting up is really dangerous and does detract attention from the road .
ban young men from owning white nova 's n benson , uk two words : slow down ! !
jill , northern ireland it is the appalling standard of driving in this country that needs addressing-inappropriate speed for the conditions can mean that 20mph is too fast .
at the same time too slow a speed can also cause serious accidents-overtaking traffic at 2-3mph more than their speed in the 3rd lane of a motorway is a common cause of tailbacks & subsequent frustration .
the problem is that drivers are not taught " situational awareness " -something that motorcyclists have to develop in order to survive , as do military pilots .
speed cameras are not the answer , as they are incapable of recording hgv 's exceeding their limit -lrb- 56mph -rrb- , by 20mph & yet they will result in prosecution for a driver doing 90mph at 3am on the m6 in cumbria when there is nothing else on the motorway .
mike sterland , uk where can i buy one ?
i 'd rather live than worry about fashion peter , uk some of the suggestions in this article are already in place in new zealand .
" death markers " in the form of white wooden crosses can be seen at the sides of many roads although i believe that these crosses are placed by relatives of people killed in road traffic accidents .
" shock " adverts regularly appear on nz tv at peak viewing times .
they are usually quite graphic and hard hitting .
" random " breath testing is commonplace .
it may not be regarded as random as the police stop all vehicles passing through the check point .
sadly however there are still too many accidents .
an apparent lack of basic driving skills and excessive speed seem to be the main causes .
peter , new zealand lower speed limits , head bands -lrb- where can i buy one ?
i 'd rather live than worry about fashion -rrb- , death markers are all excellent ideas .
driving would be less ' fun ' , and slower , but so what ?
i 'd rather get to my destination ten minutes later than arrive thirty years early in the next world .
peter , uk there appears to be an increase in speed cameras , and a decrease in police patrols .
clearly , the speed cameras aim only to catch speeding motorists -lrb- and , of course , are a great revenue generator -rrb- .
meanwhile , other offences are committed , such as dangerous driving , and are not detected .
we need to see more police patrols .
sean , uk the uk is increasingly becoming the country of excessive restrictions on it 's residents .
from roadside cameras to increasing limitations on daily life , people do not appreciate how much their freedoms are being eroded .
educate but not legislate - if people do n't want to wear a seatbelt so be it - their choice .
time for nanny to leave the citizens to make choices for themselves - glad i left it all behind .
james , usa speeding may very well contributing factor , but is n't driving slow as well ?
i drive 25,000 miles a year and everyday i see car moving at 30-35 mph in a 60 speed limit , this causes frustration among drivers and will encourage them to overtake in places which are not safe .
if a driver is not comfortable doing 60 in a 60 they are obviously not confident and therefore should not be on the road , then again these slow coaches are the same ones who do not slow down when entering a built up 30mph area ! !
you know who you are ! !
aled , uk the government should consider school safety zones where speed limits are reduced still further , extra speed humps are employed , and extra fencing used .
a colour coded scheme -lrb- yellow is used in france -rrb- would also highlight the danger area to motorists .
entry into the zone should be clearly indicated e.g.
' warning , you are entering a school safety zone ' .
james , france maybe a radical solution is to make all occupant safety aids on cars illegal david clift , uk soft cars - instead of hard brittle sharp heavy ponty cars why not make cars from soft but durable foam ?
they would be lighter and more likely to bounce in a collision .
of course this would require replacing all vehicles on the road with rubbery cars in a fairly short time frame , but imagine the jobs that would be created .
mark s , brit in the usa the headband / minimal crash helmet idea is good .
as a recreational downhill skier i have become used to wearing a ski helmet and while this wo n't be able to prevent all damage , it could help .
likewise the headband idea might help and also help users think , " i am not indestructible " . sally deutschmann , canada prohibit by law all insurance that covers damage to vehicles one 's own and others - drivers would be very much more cautious .
john clark , dominican republic why are technological solutions always sought to human problems ?
better training , testing and enforcement of the existing laws would reduce the number of accidents .
mick sheppard , uk i feel everyone should be made to take a motorcycle cbt -lrb- compulsory basic training -rrb- .
i believe this would remove any false sense of security they may have when in a car , and also increase their awareness when on the road ..
gary hutton , spain maybe we are looking at this the wrong way , there is a lot of effort put into making car 's safer for their occupants , this leads to drivers feeling that if they crash then they will walk away uninjured .
maybe a radical solution is to make all occupant safety aids on cars illegal ! !
then maybe you would think twice before breaking the speed limit or driving too close to the car in front .
just an idea .
david clift , uk here is a suggestion for stopping people driving while chatting away on their mobile phone .
simply stop calls being transferred between area cells .
our motorways seem to have phone masts every 10m so they would n't even get a " hello " in before being cut off .
however they could always stop and make their call if its important .
jenny , uk get a big off road vehicle and then your most likely to come off best in a crash with another vehicle .
andrew , oxford lower speed limits , especially on country lanes would be a good idea .
its insane to allow motorist to do 60mph -lrb- and many will be doing 70mph or more -rrb- on winding , narrow , bumpy lanes , where around the next bend there could be a tractor , horse rider , cyclist or walker , plus probably another car approaching at 60mph , resulting in a 120mph collision .
lower speed limits , and an intelligent speed control system could prevent thousands of accidents and lives .
i guarantee most motorists would oppose this , as it would spoil their fun and would out-vote their victims to-be and victims relatives , if there was ever a vote on it .
mark humphries , uk getting stuck behind someone driving far beneath the speed limit because they think they 're being safe is going to frustrate other drivers and is very likely to make a person do something foolish or risky sim , uk / usa i believe the " go-slow " concept is a good idea , but something should be done to encourage people to purchase such automobiles .
i feel a tax credit or some type of financial incentive would be needed to encourage people to buy such vehicles .
higher speeds result in a higher level of fatal accidents ; unfortunately many are ignorant of this .
steve , usa how about going too slow being dangerous ?
getting stuck behind someone driving far beneath the speed limit because they think they 're being safe is going to frustrate other drivers and is very likely to make a person do something foolish or risky .
how about having speed restrictions timed ?
some people prefer driving at night when there 's less traffic on the roads and yet are still restricted to speed limits .
speed should be appropriate to circumstances .
sim , uk / usa it would be nice if people actually wore the seatbelts in their cars - the amount of cars i see in the town where i live in essex not wearing their belts is alarming ; especially when you consider that -lrb- 1 -rrb- most of the drivers were either extremely young or not even born when wearing seatbelts in the uk became law and -lrb- 2 -rrb- the cars being driven are not always new enough to have airbags .
personally , i 'm in favour of drivers not wearing seatbelts who are involved in accidents having their insurance voided - and having to pay for any nhs treatment .
it may sound harsh , but quite often these people have children in the back of the car and are just selfish .
catriona , uk i think that the use of signs to show where fatal or serious accidents have occurred is one of the best measures for stating just how dangerous the roads are .
when i was younger i remember seeing signs which were black spots for places of danger .
well worth considering again .
lisa fahy , england why is it assumed that all people are genetically pre-disposed to being good at driving ?
i think that people who do n't pass their test within 5 attempts should n't be allowed on the road. matt , uk i think there should be a reactions test before you are allowed to drive or rid a motorbike .
dan , uk i welcome any of these ideas if it helps save lives .
my dad was killed in a road accident in 1998 , and it never stops seeming so stupid that someone could be killed while on a cycle path , just because the path was not wide enough for two bikes to cross !
elizabeth warn , albania it 's not only blokes who ride big motorcycles , us ladies do too .
it seems to cause a lot of male car drivers extreme angst to see a lady rider on a big , powerful bike .
so much so in fact that it appears to be a direct challenge to their penis size , and they do their best to cut us up , swerve in front of us and make extravagant hand gestures .
shouting obscenities out of car windows when the sisters pass by is a favourite too .
i suggest making it law to oblige all women bikers to dress like men when on a bike , fake beards , hide it all away jackets and a mighty morphin plastic ranger attitude to the road .
us ladies want to be real men too ! ! !
louisa morgan , uk people drive fast because they are impatient -lrb- more so in the south east of england -rrb- .
people get impatient because they know their car is capable of going faster , especially if stuck behind a slower vehicle .
if all vehicles were restricted to the legal speed limit , there would be no impatience and no speeding .
in theory anyway !
lee , uk i think that all motorists should be made to do a refresher course every 10 years monique denton , uk i am an advanced motorcyclist and have practised as a specialist injury solicitor for over 18 years .
there are two main causes of road accidents that could be reduced relatively cheaply ; -lrb- 1 -rrb- it should be illegal to drive any motor vehicle on a public road having consumed any alcohol at all- there is no logical argument for allowing any consumption of a known inhibitor when driving -lrb- 2 -rrb- all drivers should be subject to compulsory re-test every 10 years up to the age of 50 and every 5 years thereafter .
it is insane that drivers who passed their test 40 years ago can still drive in today 's environment without retesting of their abilities .
mike clarke , england the driving test is too easy .
what is now called the advanced test should be the standard .
then the people operating cars would be able to drive properly and i 'm sure the number of accidents would drop .
increasing the difficulty of obtaining a licence means the threat of having it taken away becomes more serious .
james begent , england stopping distance , stopping distance , stopping distance .
last week i drove along a wet crowded motorway at 65mph , in the leftmost lane , keeping a good distance behind the car in front of me .
and all i could see in my rear-view mirror was the radiator grille of the huge lorry driving about a foot behind me .
people like that should be prosecuted for attempted murder .
but you never hear about that sort of bad driving - what you get are stories about ambulance drivers speeding on empty dry roads while trying to save lives - and being prosecuted for their trouble .
can we be grown-up about it and attack inappropriate speed rather than absolute speeding ?
peter , england i like the head band protection -lrb- do they come in child sizes too ? -rrb- , the speed limiters on vehicles and random breath tests .
i think that all motorists should be made to do a refresher course every 10 years .
i would also like to see compulsory lights and reflective wear for cyclists and motorcyclists monique denton , uk i think all cars should be equipped with reflective vests , so that when cars break down at the roadside , the passengers of the car become clearly visible on the roadside .
far too many people are killed on the hard shoulder each year in the uk and something needs to be done about it .
perhaps they should be supplied as standard with all knew cars ?
caroline walton , uk some cars make a noise when the seatbelt is not plugged in and have proper seatbelts in the middle backseat. both of these features would be great if made compulsory .
emma , uk i recall reading about a proposal for a simple change to cars to save lives - the change was to replace the drivers air bag with a big spike .
the idea is that when drivers can see the danger that they are in if they do not drive carefully , they pay attention and drive very carefully indeed .
martin , uk another idea might be to raise the age at which drivers can learn to drive .
the number of ' ' boy racers " on the road must be a contributory factor to the incidents of speed and carnage on the road -lrb- and probably road rage , too , not to mention noise pollution from the massive sound systems many have - if a mobile ' phone is deemed dangerous what about a stereo booming out 100 + watts of sound ?
surely such levels of sound must be distracting to the point of danger . -rrb- andrew , england i think there is an over emphasis on road safety in this country .
the roads are safer than houses .
more people are now killed in accidents in their home each year than on the roads .
more than 4,000 people are killed annually in the home compared to 3,600 on the roads .
one of the safest places you can be is locked up in a padded cell but would you want to live your life that way ?
colin smith , uk to rebecca : yes it is sometimes vital to get out of someone 's way .
that 's what your brakes are for - speeding is never a solution top danger on the roads .
and to b essada : how would a " driving test " for bikes " save 500 kids per year ? "
that 's more than ten times the annual child pedal cyclist fatality rate .
the real barrier to improved road safety is our refusal to take responsibility .
for the most parts these are not " accidents , " over 90 % are crashes resulting from negligence on the part of at least one road user .
pay more attention to the road and less to trying to shave five seconds off your journey .
guy chapman , uk i think smoking at the wheel is more dangerous than using a mobile phone .
you have to take both hands off the wheel to light it , and if you drop it a burning cigarette will land in your lap - very likely to be distracting !
lisa , scotland maybe we need to concentrate on educating pedestrians on how to use crossings and not automatically say that drivers are evil denzil pemberthy , uk " collisions with trees kill 1,600 people a year in germany , 800 in france and more than 200 in britain " look at the figures !
i think that britain already has some of the world 's safest roads , none of the suggestions would help to make us any safer -lrb- unless we were all banned from driving -rrb- .
as a driver it really annoys me how it seems that anything is the drivers fault .
for instance the kill your speed , not a child campaign , if the child had n't walked out from in front of another car he would n't have been hit in the first place .
maybe we need to concentrate on educating pedestrians on how to use crossings and not automatically say that drivers are evil .
denzil pemberthy , uk i like the indian solution : signs by the road - " do n't drive silly , enjoy the valley " and other little poems .
cute but totally ineffective of course .
delhi also has a large sign showing the daily death and serious injury stats for the city .
averages 4 of each per day .
carrie , uk i think that everyone should be required to take part in a refresher course every 10 to 15 years .
i ca n't think of one person i know over forty who would pass their driving test if they re-took it now .
roz , germany anything that makes people less tunnel visioned when they enter their car ca n't hurt .
may i suggest that in place of the air bag on the steering a large spike is put there instead .
it will certainly make people go slower know that they could be kebabed if they had to reduce their speed quickly .
lucy , uk speeding is viewed by many as the be all and end all of road safety and seems as a consequence to be the only target when it comes to road safety .
as a regular motorway driver i see far more accidents caused by people driving too close to the car in front .
would n't speed camera technology be better employed capturing this rather than targeting someone on what may very well be an empty road .
a simple survey of passing cars still reveals a significant percentage not wearing seatbelts .
tim k , uk better road markings , higher quality tarmac that can reduce ' spray ' on the roads , making visibility better and safer for all .
george williams , uk after seeing the ' the uk 's worst driver ' tv program , i think that anyone caught in an accident should have to take a mini driving test , if they pass , no problem , if they perform ' acceptably ' , they should have their fault pointed out , perhaps made to retake this test , if they fail .. they should lose their licence completely .
all accidents are caused by bad driving - whether going to fast for the conditions , or simply poor judgement. by making drivers take a test , it could be used as a means of ensuring only good drivers get to drive .
andy , uk in england 14 % of the driving population fail to meet the eyesight requirements for driving , which i believe are amongst the laxest in europe .
why do n't the police take any action against such dangerous drivers ?
drivers should be required to take annual eyesight tests , particularly older drivers .
andy gambles , england all cars should be fitted with a breathalyser tube which must be blown into to start the car .
if you fail the test the car wo n't start .
simple ! !
bill robertson , scotland my idea is that no-one should be allowed to drive a car before they have learned how to ride a motor bike and ridden one for two years .
this will only increase their road awareness and make the realise that even in a car they are vulnerable to bad drivers .
russell , london , uk is 71mph any more dangerous than 69mph on a motorway ?
mike wicks , uk making cars out of sponge , banning all drivers except me , the ' safer ' driving is the more risks people take .
a compulsory re-test every 5 years would be a better plan , tackling the real issue - the people who drive !
gnome , uk the only suggestion which i can see being as dangerous as the current situation is a go slow car .
whilst not advocating speeding on a general basis -lrb- although let 's face it , most of us do it if only by a couple of miles an hour -rrb- , there are times when it is vital for safety to be able to get out of someone else 's way , for which it may be necessary to speed for a brief moment .
without the ability to do this , i would certainly have been in a number of accidents in my time which were totally unrelated to my own driving .
rebecca , uk is 71mph any more dangerous than 69mph on a motorway ?
the concentration by the authorities and pressure groups on absolute speeds , instead of appropriate speed is a waste of time .
how many speed cameras do we need to reduce the fatalities on the road to 0 ?
if you concentrate solely on speed , the most cost-effective solution surely would be to bring back the red flag act of the 1800s , when all horseless carriages were required to be preceded by a man walking in front with a red flag .
fortunately the maximum speed under this system is about 3 to 5 mph , so no one would ever get killed on the road again , but the country would grind to a halt .
mike wicks , uk simple a driving test for bike riders .
bikes are great kids toys for off road use .
if they are going to be used on road the rider should either hold , or be escorted by someone holding , a driving licence .
this would save 500 kids a year with very little cost .

in the latest move , the uk government announced this week it would be banning the use of mobile phones while driving .
below is a selection of other suggestions to improve road safety , drawn from various sources .
bbc news online would also like to hear your views by filling out the form below .
head bands would drivers wear these ?
many of the most serious road crashes result in head injuries .
they may not look too fashionable , but these head bands have been identified as one way of reducing the human impact of car accidents .
leading research in this area is the road accident research unit at the university of adelaide , in australia .
its tests have already shown headbands would reduce injuries from frontal car crashes , and research is continuing on other types of crash .
essentially the bands are crash helmets which have been scaled down to look less bulky .
it may be hard to imagine people wearing them - but many people opposed wearing seat belts when they were introduced .
go-slow cars cars could stop their own drivers from speeding experts at the university of leeds are working on a car equipped with a speed limiter which makes it impossible to break the legal limit .
professor of transport safety , oliver carsten , said : " we believe this kind of technology can contribute to road safety .
" if all drivers kept to the speed limit , deaths on the road -lrb- in the uk -rrb- would fall by 37 % , over 1,200 each year . "
the system has been dubbed intelligent speed adaptation .
death markers black markers signify deaths and red indicate serious injuries an idea used in various countries where the risk of crashes increases on long stretches of road .
black markers -lrb- usually small wooden posts -rrb- are installed at locations where fatal accidents have occurred .
they may be slightly morbid , but these markers , which feature small crosses at the top , are sobering reminder of how dangerous driving can be .
they also serve to highlight corners or stretches of road which may be more hazardous than they appear .
additional red markers indicate sites of crashes which resulted in serious injuries .
design and roadside objects road design is crucial many vehicle deaths would be avoided if authorities paid closer attention to removing or fencing off roadside objects , such as dangerous trees and posts .
collisions with trees kill 1,600 people a year in germany , 800 in france and more than 200 in britain .
general design of roads is also important , with some research suggesting poor design contributes to 33 % of crashes .
refresher courses middle-aged men are getting back on the road a concern raised by the aa is the number of middle-aged men " rediscovering their youth " by getting back on their motorcycles .
it can sometimes be too late when they discover the road environment has changed over the last 20 to 30 years .
many would benefit from refresher courses to hone their skills , which may have diminished over the years and must be adapted to modern road conditions .
hitting home cars can be fragile machines many people do not fully comprehend the horror of car crashes , and thus do not drive accordingly .
numerous advertisements have used shocking images of accidents in the hope of reforming attitudes .
some say this could be taken a step further by occasionally putting badly damaged and burnt out vehicles at the roadside .
it would surely be a stark reminder of how fragile a car can be when travelling at speed .
lower speed limits is 40mph too fast ?
it seems obvious , but few people realise the difference made by slower driving .
not only are you less likely to suffer serious injuries , but there is less chance of the accident happening in the first place .
research in areas where the speed limit is 60km / h -lrb- just under 40mph -rrb- has shown the chance of crashing could be reduced by as much as 40 % if the limit was lowered by just 10km / h .
however suggestions of lowering speed limits often encounter resistance from motorists who are in a hurry to get where they are going .
drink driving drunk drivers can be lethal alcohol is still a major cause of car crashes .
the royal society for the prevention of accidents says the allowable amount of alcohol should be lowered from 80mg to 50mg .
furthermore , it wants police empowered to test drivers randomly .
" they should be able to test anywhere at any time , " a spokesman said .
a selection of views from bbc news online readers : clear , logical road direction signs , well in advance of junctions would reduce accidents where people brake sharply because they have nearly missed a turn .
a lot more thinking needs to go into how direction signs are laid out , located and lead the driver confidently to their destination .
eric woodcock , united kingdom tail-gating is at least as dangerous as speeding , but seems to be completely unenforced .
also the comments other people have made here hardly mention it .
why is there such a blind spot about safe distances ?
it would be quite easy to put a forward radar in cars to warn about being too close , perhaps even to enforce a minimum distance , along similar lines to a speed governor .
stephen burke , england i think those head bands are a bad idea .
people will not want to be seen dead in those so will speed through towns in order not to be seen .
come on honestly is that the best they can come up with henry , england manufacturers still do not do enough to stop vehicles from being stolen .
many crimes , not only " joy riding " use stolen cars .
the public are put at great danger by this crime .
enormous police and victims resources are absorbed by the effects and results of stolen cars .
vehicles can be manufactured so that the need to put extra steering locks on them becomes redundant .
alternatively legislation should be brought in so that vehicle security systems are far more difficult to defeat .
scott , yorkshire roads should all be marked every 100 metres with the speed limit .
all speed cameras should have the speed limit painted on them .
half the time you do n't know what the speed limit is on uk roads - a cynical attempt to catch more motorists out ?
rooster , uk " occasionally putting badly damaged and burnt out vehicles at the roadside " - anybody who has ever lived in an inner city area will be well aware that this occurs frequently and does nothing to help road safety !
lee i agree with the comment about sight tests .
as well as doing a breath test at the scene of any incident police officers should also be required to check somebody 's eye sight .
many people do n't realise their eyesight is getting worse as it happens so slow .
i 've seen a number of people have very near misses , who subsequently go for an eye test to find out they need glasses at least for driving , and been amazed at what they were missing as regards things happening around them .
zippy , uk it 's driver psychology which needs to be addressed ahead of any other life-saving devices jessica , uk the revenue collected from " speed cameras " should be used to improve the general standard and safety of the actual roads .
placing cameras on awkward bends and corners is not the answer .
make the roads straight and fence off trees .
or even cut down trees .
at the moment revenue is just another form of taxation .
shaun grimes , uk the telling fact is in the chart : six deaths per hundred thousand people per year .
the figure is miniscule .
do we really need all the inconvenience of the road safety industry for this tiny risk ?
simon richardson , uk many contributors mention the physical distraction of smoking at the wheel .
there seems to be a reluctance to realise that although cigarettes are legal , nicotine is a highly addictive narcotic which often causes symptoms of aggressive behavior .
the smoke also reduces blood oxygen levels and increases levels of carbon monoxide in the blood , which is not conducive to clear thinking .
it seems strange that whilst alcohol is blamed for so much , being " high " off cigarettes is considered " normal " .
mike , uk encourage people to use their cars less .
invest in the public transport infrastructure .
use bicyles for short trips .
allan wishart , uk it 's driver psychology which needs to be addressed ahead of any other life-saving devices .
until people get it into their thick heads that speeding is unacceptable , then you 'll never reduce the number of fatalities on our roads .
it 's the " i 'm bigger and better and faster and more important than you " attitude which is so destructive .
jessica , uk zero mg of alcohol .
no smoking in cars , especially when the driver is trying to locate the dying embers that have fallen between the seats at 80mph on the m1 .
no phones -lrb- soon to be law thankfully -rrb- .
i do n't think shock tactics work .
people invariably believe it wo n't happen to them - just ask a smoker if they fear their own mortality .
without question swift and deterrent punishment to match the offence , including lifetime bans will get their attention .
why do we pander to these lunatics who threaten us and our children everyday ?
simon , london , uk touching as these memorials are , they are not as effective a means of saving lives on the highways as are driving more slowly and lawfully tetman callis , usa road safety would be improved by encouraging better driving standards not lowering speeds to ridiculously low levels which induce boredom and reduce concentration .
some would have the return of a man with red flag walking in front of the vehicle !
equal effort should also go into the quality of car maintenance - a special stringent mot test should be introduced for cars over 8 years old with a view to reducing the nation 's stock of bangers .
bill finch , scotland all of the above ideas will most likely reduce accidents , injuries and death .
there are two other areas that should be addressed .
1 .
a comprehensive driving test -lrb- road and classroom -rrb- that needs to retaken every 10 years , and passed or you loose your driving license .
2 .
giving the police enough resources and incentive to effectively and fairly enforced the current road rules .
these two actions are required in the uk , australia and the us .
counties i have lived , worked and driven in over the last 13 years .
ronald spiers usa , usa i work outdoors with children / students in a rural area .
thirty years ago , more than 95 % of drivers would slow down noticeably or even stop if we were walking in single file along the edge of a narrow road .
these days the proportion of arrogant and aggressive drivers -lrb- mainly men -rrb- speeding past even young children on the same road , leaving just inches to spare , has risen to more than a quarter .
bob burn , wales here in new mexico , there is a long-standing tradition of friends and family erecting roadside crosses along the sides of roads where loved ones have died in automobile accidents .
touching as these memorials are , they are not as effective a means of saving lives on the highways as are driving more slowly and lawfully -lrb- people in new mexico are notorious speeders and runners of stop lights -rrb- , paying attention , and driving sober .
tetman callis , usa the seatbelt was a revelation for some but a huge step forward .
i would like to see more , effective measures for in car safety such as harness type seatbelts that race car drivers wear .
in fact , legal measures should be implemented to take safety innovations from the race-track where safety is a primary concern and translate them into the family vehicle arena .
brett jackson , us ban buses and taxi s from speeding .
it seems that they are above the law in the uk and they too are responsible for a massive number of road deaths / injuries .
ban smoking while driving - lighting up is really dangerous and does detract attention from the road .
ban young men from owning white nova 's n benson , uk two words : slow down ! !
jill , northern ireland it is the appalling standard of driving in this country that needs addressing-inappropriate speed for the conditions can mean that 20mph is too fast .
at the same time too slow a speed can also cause serious accidents-overtaking traffic at 2-3mph more than their speed in the 3rd lane of a motorway is a common cause of tailbacks & subsequent frustration .
the problem is that drivers are not taught " situational awareness " -something that motorcyclists have to develop in order to survive , as do military pilots .
speed cameras are not the answer , as they are incapable of recording hgv 's exceeding their limit -lrb- 56mph -rrb- , by 20mph & yet they will result in prosecution for a driver doing 90mph at 3am on the m6 in cumbria when there is nothing else on the motorway .
mike sterland , uk where can i buy one ?
i 'd rather live than worry about fashion peter , uk some of the suggestions in this article are already in place in new zealand .
" death markers " in the form of white wooden crosses can be seen at the sides of many roads although i believe that these crosses are placed by relatives of people killed in road traffic accidents .
" shock " adverts regularly appear on nz tv at peak viewing times .
they are usually quite graphic and hard hitting .
" random " breath testing is commonplace .
it may not be regarded as random as the police stop all vehicles passing through the check point .
sadly however there are still too many accidents .
an apparent lack of basic driving skills and excessive speed seem to be the main causes .
peter , new zealand lower speed limits , head bands -lrb- where can i buy one ?
i 'd rather live than worry about fashion -rrb- , death markers are all excellent ideas .
driving would be less ' fun ' , and slower , but so what ?
i 'd rather get to my destination ten minutes later than arrive thirty years early in the next world .
peter , uk there appears to be an increase in speed cameras , and a decrease in police patrols .
clearly , the speed cameras aim only to catch speeding motorists -lrb- and , of course , are a great revenue generator -rrb- .
meanwhile , other offences are committed , such as dangerous driving , and are not detected .
we need to see more police patrols .
sean , uk the uk is increasingly becoming the country of excessive restrictions on it 's residents .
from roadside cameras to increasing limitations on daily life , people do not appreciate how much their freedoms are being eroded .
educate but not legislate - if people do n't want to wear a seatbelt so be it - their choice .
time for nanny to leave the citizens to make choices for themselves - glad i left it all behind .
james , usa speeding may very well contributing factor , but is n't driving slow as well ?
i drive 25,000 miles a year and everyday i see car moving at 30-35 mph in a 60 speed limit , this causes frustration among drivers and will encourage them to overtake in places which are not safe .
if a driver is not comfortable doing 60 in a 60 they are obviously not confident and therefore should not be on the road , then again these slow coaches are the same ones who do not slow down when entering a built up 30mph area ! !
you know who you are ! !
aled , uk the government should consider school safety zones where speed limits are reduced still further , extra speed humps are employed , and extra fencing used .
a colour coded scheme -lrb- yellow is used in france -rrb- would also highlight the danger area to motorists .
entry into the zone should be clearly indicated e.g.
' warning , you are entering a school safety zone ' .
james , france maybe a radical solution is to make all occupant safety aids on cars illegal david clift , uk soft cars - instead of hard brittle sharp heavy ponty cars why not make cars from soft but durable foam ?
they would be lighter and more likely to bounce in a collision .
of course this would require replacing all vehicles on the road with rubbery cars in a fairly short time frame , but imagine the jobs that would be created .
mark s , brit in the usa the headband / minimal crash helmet idea is good .
as a recreational downhill skier i have become used to wearing a ski helmet and while this wo n't be able to prevent all damage , it could help .
likewise the headband idea might help and also help users think , " i am not indestructible " . sally deutschmann , canada prohibit by law all insurance that covers damage to vehicles one 's own and others - drivers would be very much more cautious .
john clark , dominican republic why are technological solutions always sought to human problems ?
better training , testing and enforcement of the existing laws would reduce the number of accidents .
mick sheppard , uk i feel everyone should be made to take a motorcycle cbt -lrb- compulsory basic training -rrb- .
i believe this would remove any false sense of security they may have when in a car , and also increase their awareness when on the road ..
gary hutton , spain maybe we are looking at this the wrong way , there is a lot of effort put into making car 's safer for their occupants , this leads to drivers feeling that if they crash then they will walk away uninjured .
maybe a radical solution is to make all occupant safety aids on cars illegal ! !
then maybe you would think twice before breaking the speed limit or driving too close to the car in front .
just an idea .
david clift , uk here is a suggestion for stopping people driving while chatting away on their mobile phone .
simply stop calls being transferred between area cells .
our motorways seem to have phone masts every 10m so they would n't even get a " hello " in before being cut off .
however they could always stop and make their call if its important .
jenny , uk get a big off road vehicle and then your most likely to come off best in a crash with another vehicle .
andrew , oxford lower speed limits , especially on country lanes would be a good idea .
its insane to allow motorist to do 60mph -lrb- and many will be doing 70mph or more -rrb- on winding , narrow , bumpy lanes , where around the next bend there could be a tractor , horse rider , cyclist or walker , plus probably another car approaching at 60mph , resulting in a 120mph collision .
lower speed limits , and an intelligent speed control system could prevent thousands of accidents and lives .
i guarantee most motorists would oppose this , as it would spoil their fun and would out-vote their victims to-be and victims relatives , if there was ever a vote on it .
mark humphries , uk getting stuck behind someone driving far beneath the speed limit because they think they 're being safe is going to frustrate other drivers and is very likely to make a person do something foolish or risky sim , uk / usa i believe the " go-slow " concept is a good idea , but something should be done to encourage people to purchase such automobiles .
i feel a tax credit or some type of financial incentive would be needed to encourage people to buy such vehicles .
higher speeds result in a higher level of fatal accidents ; unfortunately many are ignorant of this .
steve , usa how about going too slow being dangerous ?
getting stuck behind someone driving far beneath the speed limit because they think they 're being safe is going to frustrate other drivers and is very likely to make a person do something foolish or risky .
how about having speed restrictions timed ?
some people prefer driving at night when there 's less traffic on the roads and yet are still restricted to speed limits .
speed should be appropriate to circumstances .
sim , uk / usa it would be nice if people actually wore the seatbelts in their cars - the amount of cars i see in the town where i live in essex not wearing their belts is alarming ; especially when you consider that -lrb- 1 -rrb- most of the drivers were either extremely young or not even born when wearing seatbelts in the uk became law and -lrb- 2 -rrb- the cars being driven are not always new enough to have airbags .
personally , i 'm in favour of drivers not wearing seatbelts who are involved in accidents having their insurance voided - and having to pay for any nhs treatment .
it may sound harsh , but quite often these people have children in the back of the car and are just selfish .
catriona , uk i think that the use of signs to show where fatal or serious accidents have occurred is one of the best measures for stating just how dangerous the roads are .
when i was younger i remember seeing signs which were black spots for places of danger .
well worth considering again .
lisa fahy , england why is it assumed that all people are genetically pre-disposed to being good at driving ?
i think that people who do n't pass their test within 5 attempts should n't be allowed on the road. matt , uk i think there should be a reactions test before you are allowed to drive or rid a motorbike .
dan , uk i welcome any of these ideas if it helps save lives .
my dad was killed in a road accident in 1998 , and it never stops seeming so stupid that someone could be killed while on a cycle path , just because the path was not wide enough for two bikes to cross !
elizabeth warn , albania it 's not only blokes who ride big motorcycles , us ladies do too .
it seems to cause a lot of male car drivers extreme angst to see a lady rider on a big , powerful bike .
so much so in fact that it appears to be a direct challenge to their penis size , and they do their best to cut us up , swerve in front of us and make extravagant hand gestures .
shouting obscenities out of car windows when the sisters pass by is a favourite too .
i suggest making it law to oblige all women bikers to dress like men when on a bike , fake beards , hide it all away jackets and a mighty morphin plastic ranger attitude to the road .
us ladies want to be real men too ! ! !
louisa morgan , uk people drive fast because they are impatient -lrb- more so in the south east of england -rrb- .
people get impatient because they know their car is capable of going faster , especially if stuck behind a slower vehicle .
if all vehicles were restricted to the legal speed limit , there would be no impatience and no speeding .
in theory anyway !
lee , uk i think that all motorists should be made to do a refresher course every 10 years monique denton , uk i am an advanced motorcyclist and have practised as a specialist injury solicitor for over 18 years .
there are two main causes of road accidents that could be reduced relatively cheaply ; -lrb- 1 -rrb- it should be illegal to drive any motor vehicle on a public road having consumed any alcohol at all- there is no logical argument for allowing any consumption of a known inhibitor when driving -lrb- 2 -rrb- all drivers should be subject to compulsory re-test every 10 years up to the age of 50 and every 5 years thereafter .
it is insane that drivers who passed their test 40 years ago can still drive in today 's environment without retesting of their abilities .
mike clarke , england the driving test is too easy .
what is now called the advanced test should be the standard .
then the people operating cars would be able to drive properly and i 'm sure the number of accidents would drop .
increasing the difficulty of obtaining a licence means the threat of having it taken away becomes more serious .
james begent , england stopping distance , stopping distance , stopping distance .
last week i drove along a wet crowded motorway at 65mph , in the leftmost lane , keeping a good distance behind the car in front of me .
and all i could see in my rear-view mirror was the radiator grille of the huge lorry driving about a foot behind me .
people like that should be prosecuted for attempted murder .
but you never hear about that sort of bad driving - what you get are stories about ambulance drivers speeding on empty dry roads while trying to save lives - and being prosecuted for their trouble .
can we be grown-up about it and attack inappropriate speed rather than absolute speeding ?
peter , england i like the head band protection -lrb- do they come in child sizes too ? -rrb- , the speed limiters on vehicles and random breath tests .
i think that all motorists should be made to do a refresher course every 10 years .
i would also like to see compulsory lights and reflective wear for cyclists and motorcyclists monique denton , uk i think all cars should be equipped with reflective vests , so that when cars break down at the roadside , the passengers of the car become clearly visible on the roadside .
far too many people are killed on the hard shoulder each year in the uk and something needs to be done about it .
perhaps they should be supplied as standard with all knew cars ?
caroline walton , uk some cars make a noise when the seatbelt is not plugged in and have proper seatbelts in the middle backseat. both of these features would be great if made compulsory .
emma , uk i recall reading about a proposal for a simple change to cars to save lives - the change was to replace the drivers air bag with a big spike .
the idea is that when drivers can see the danger that they are in if they do not drive carefully , they pay attention and drive very carefully indeed .
martin , uk another idea might be to raise the age at which drivers can learn to drive .
the number of ' ' boy racers " on the road must be a contributory factor to the incidents of speed and carnage on the road -lrb- and probably road rage , too , not to mention noise pollution from the massive sound systems many have - if a mobile ' phone is deemed dangerous what about a stereo booming out 100 + watts of sound ?
surely such levels of sound must be distracting to the point of danger . -rrb- andrew , england i think there is an over emphasis on road safety in this country .
the roads are safer than houses .
more people are now killed in accidents in their home each year than on the roads .
more than 4,000 people are killed annually in the home compared to 3,600 on the roads .
one of the safest places you can be is locked up in a padded cell but would you want to live your life that way ?
colin smith , uk to rebecca : yes it is sometimes vital to get out of someone 's way .
that 's what your brakes are for - speeding is never a solution top danger on the roads .
and to b essada : how would a " driving test " for bikes " save 500 kids per year ? "
that 's more than ten times the annual child pedal cyclist fatality rate .
the real barrier to improved road safety is our refusal to take responsibility .
for the most parts these are not " accidents , " over 90 % are crashes resulting from negligence on the part of at least one road user .
pay more attention to the road and less to trying to shave five seconds off your journey .
guy chapman , uk i think smoking at the wheel is more dangerous than using a mobile phone .
you have to take both hands off the wheel to light it , and if you drop it a burning cigarette will land in your lap - very likely to be distracting !
lisa , scotland maybe we need to concentrate on educating pedestrians on how to use crossings and not automatically say that drivers are evil denzil pemberthy , uk " collisions with trees kill 1,600 people a year in germany , 800 in france and more than 200 in britain " look at the figures !
i think that britain already has some of the world 's safest roads , none of the suggestions would help to make us any safer -lrb- unless we were all banned from driving -rrb- .
as a driver it really annoys me how it seems that anything is the drivers fault .
for instance the kill your speed , not a child campaign , if the child had n't walked out from in front of another car he would n't have been hit in the first place .
maybe we need to concentrate on educating pedestrians on how to use crossings and not automatically say that drivers are evil .
denzil pemberthy , uk i like the indian solution : signs by the road - " do n't drive silly , enjoy the valley " and other little poems .
cute but totally ineffective of course .
delhi also has a large sign showing the daily death and serious injury stats for the city .
averages 4 of each per day .
carrie , uk i think that everyone should be required to take part in a refresher course every 10 to 15 years .
i ca n't think of one person i know over forty who would pass their driving test if they re-took it now .
roz , germany anything that makes people less tunnel visioned when they enter their car ca n't hurt .
may i suggest that in place of the air bag on the steering a large spike is put there instead .
it will certainly make people go slower know that they could be kebabed if they had to reduce their speed quickly .
lucy , uk speeding is viewed by many as the be all and end all of road safety and seems as a consequence to be the only target when it comes to road safety .
as a regular motorway driver i see far more accidents caused by people driving too close to the car in front .
would n't speed camera technology be better employed capturing this rather than targeting someone on what may very well be an empty road .
a simple survey of passing cars still reveals a significant percentage not wearing seatbelts .
tim k , uk better road markings , higher quality tarmac that can reduce ' spray ' on the roads , making visibility better and safer for all .
george williams , uk after seeing the ' the uk 's worst driver ' tv program , i think that anyone caught in an accident should have to take a mini driving test , if they pass , no problem , if they perform ' acceptably ' , they should have their fault pointed out , perhaps made to retake this test , if they fail .. they should lose their licence completely .
all accidents are caused by bad driving - whether going to fast for the conditions , or simply poor judgement. by making drivers take a test , it could be used as a means of ensuring only good drivers get to drive .
andy , uk in england 14 % of the driving population fail to meet the eyesight requirements for driving , which i believe are amongst the laxest in europe .
why do n't the police take any action against such dangerous drivers ?
drivers should be required to take annual eyesight tests , particularly older drivers .
andy gambles , england all cars should be fitted with a breathalyser tube which must be blown into to start the car .
if you fail the test the car wo n't start .
simple ! !
bill robertson , scotland my idea is that no-one should be allowed to drive a car before they have learned how to ride a motor bike and ridden one for two years .
this will only increase their road awareness and make the realise that even in a car they are vulnerable to bad drivers .
russell , london , uk is 71mph any more dangerous than 69mph on a motorway ?
mike wicks , uk making cars out of sponge , banning all drivers except me , the ' safer ' driving is the more risks people take .
a compulsory re-test every 5 years would be a better plan , tackling the real issue - the people who drive !
gnome , uk the only suggestion which i can see being as dangerous as the current situation is a go slow car .
whilst not advocating speeding on a general basis -lrb- although let 's face it , most of us do it if only by a couple of miles an hour -rrb- , there are times when it is vital for safety to be able to get out of someone else 's way , for which it may be necessary to speed for a brief moment .
without the ability to do this , i would certainly have been in a number of accidents in my time which were totally unrelated to my own driving .
rebecca , uk is 71mph any more dangerous than 69mph on a motorway ?
the concentration by the authorities and pressure groups on absolute speeds , instead of appropriate speed is a waste of time .
how many speed cameras do we need to reduce the fatalities on the road to 0 ?
if you concentrate solely on speed , the most cost-effective solution surely would be to bring back the red flag act of the 1800s , when all horseless carriages were required to be preceded by a man walking in front with a red flag .
fortunately the maximum speed under this system is about 3 to 5 mph , so no one would ever get killed on the road again , but the country would grind to a halt .
mike wicks , uk simple a driving test for bike riders .
bikes are great kids toys for off road use .
if they are going to be used on road the rider should either hold , or be escorted by someone holding , a driving licence .
this would save 500 kids a year with very little cost .

in the latest move , the uk government announced this week it would be banning the use of mobile phones while driving .
below is a selection of other suggestions to improve road safety , drawn from various sources .
bbc news online would also like to hear your views by filling out the form below .
head bands would drivers wear these ?
many of the most serious road crashes result in head injuries .
they may not look too fashionable , but these head bands have been identified as one way of reducing the human impact of car accidents .
leading research in this area is the road accident research unit at the university of adelaide , in australia .
its tests have already shown headbands would reduce injuries from frontal car crashes , and research is continuing on other types of crash .
essentially the bands are crash helmets which have been scaled down to look less bulky .
it may be hard to imagine people wearing them - but many people opposed wearing seat belts when they were introduced .
go-slow cars cars could stop their own drivers from speeding experts at the university of leeds are working on a car equipped with a speed limiter which makes it impossible to break the legal limit .
professor of transport safety , oliver carsten , said : " we believe this kind of technology can contribute to road safety .
" if all drivers kept to the speed limit , deaths on the road -lrb- in the uk -rrb- would fall by 37 % , over 1,200 each year . "
the system has been dubbed intelligent speed adaptation .
death markers black markers signify deaths and red indicate serious injuries an idea used in various countries where the risk of crashes increases on long stretches of road .
black markers -lrb- usually small wooden posts -rrb- are installed at locations where fatal accidents have occurred .
they may be slightly morbid , but these markers , which feature small crosses at the top , are sobering reminder of how dangerous driving can be .
they also serve to highlight corners or stretches of road which may be more hazardous than they appear .
additional red markers indicate sites of crashes which resulted in serious injuries .
design and roadside objects road design is crucial many vehicle deaths would be avoided if authorities paid closer attention to removing or fencing off roadside objects , such as dangerous trees and posts .
collisions with trees kill 1,600 people a year in germany , 800 in france and more than 200 in britain .
general design of roads is also important , with some research suggesting poor design contributes to 33 % of crashes .
refresher courses middle-aged men are getting back on the road a concern raised by the aa is the number of middle-aged men " rediscovering their youth " by getting back on their motorcycles .
it can sometimes be too late when they discover the road environment has changed over the last 20 to 30 years .
many would benefit from refresher courses to hone their skills , which may have diminished over the years and must be adapted to modern road conditions .
hitting home cars can be fragile machines many people do not fully comprehend the horror of car crashes , and thus do not drive accordingly .
numerous advertisements have used shocking images of accidents in the hope of reforming attitudes .
some say this could be taken a step further by occasionally putting badly damaged and burnt out vehicles at the roadside .
it would surely be a stark reminder of how fragile a car can be when travelling at speed .
lower speed limits is 40mph too fast ?
it seems obvious , but few people realise the difference made by slower driving .
not only are you less likely to suffer serious injuries , but there is less chance of the accident happening in the first place .
research in areas where the speed limit is 60km / h -lrb- just under 40mph -rrb- has shown the chance of crashing could be reduced by as much as 40 % if the limit was lowered by just 10km / h .
however suggestions of lowering speed limits often encounter resistance from motorists who are in a hurry to get where they are going .
drink driving drunk drivers can be lethal alcohol is still a major cause of car crashes .
the royal society for the prevention of accidents says the allowable amount of alcohol should be lowered from 80mg to 50mg .
furthermore , it wants police empowered to test drivers randomly .
" they should be able to test anywhere at any time , " a spokesman said .
a selection of views from bbc news online readers : clear , logical road direction signs , well in advance of junctions would reduce accidents where people brake sharply because they have nearly missed a turn .
a lot more thinking needs to go into how direction signs are laid out , located and lead the driver confidently to their destination .
eric woodcock , united kingdom tail-gating is at least as dangerous as speeding , but seems to be completely unenforced .
also the comments other people have made here hardly mention it .
why is there such a blind spot about safe distances ?
it would be quite easy to put a forward radar in cars to warn about being too close , perhaps even to enforce a minimum distance , along similar lines to a speed governor .
stephen burke , england i think those head bands are a bad idea .
people will not want to be seen dead in those so will speed through towns in order not to be seen .
come on honestly is that the best they can come up with henry , england manufacturers still do not do enough to stop vehicles from being stolen .
many crimes , not only " joy riding " use stolen cars .
the public are put at great danger by this crime .
enormous police and victims resources are absorbed by the effects and results of stolen cars .
vehicles can be manufactured so that the need to put extra steering locks on them becomes redundant .
alternatively legislation should be brought in so that vehicle security systems are far more difficult to defeat .
scott , yorkshire roads should all be marked every 100 metres with the speed limit .
all speed cameras should have the speed limit painted on them .
half the time you do n't know what the speed limit is on uk roads - a cynical attempt to catch more motorists out ?
rooster , uk " occasionally putting badly damaged and burnt out vehicles at the roadside " - anybody who has ever lived in an inner city area will be well aware that this occurs frequently and does nothing to help road safety !
lee i agree with the comment about sight tests .
as well as doing a breath test at the scene of any incident police officers should also be required to check somebody 's eye sight .
many people do n't realise their eyesight is getting worse as it happens so slow .
i 've seen a number of people have very near misses , who subsequently go for an eye test to find out they need glasses at least for driving , and been amazed at what they were missing as regards things happening around them .
zippy , uk it 's driver psychology which needs to be addressed ahead of any other life-saving devices jessica , uk the revenue collected from " speed cameras " should be used to improve the general standard and safety of the actual roads .
placing cameras on awkward bends and corners is not the answer .
make the roads straight and fence off trees .
or even cut down trees .
at the moment revenue is just another form of taxation .
shaun grimes , uk the telling fact is in the chart : six deaths per hundred thousand people per year .
the figure is miniscule .
do we really need all the inconvenience of the road safety industry for this tiny risk ?
simon richardson , uk many contributors mention the physical distraction of smoking at the wheel .
there seems to be a reluctance to realise that although cigarettes are legal , nicotine is a highly addictive narcotic which often causes symptoms of aggressive behavior .
the smoke also reduces blood oxygen levels and increases levels of carbon monoxide in the blood , which is not conducive to clear thinking .
it seems strange that whilst alcohol is blamed for so much , being " high " off cigarettes is considered " normal " .
mike , uk encourage people to use their cars less .
invest in the public transport infrastructure .
use bicyles for short trips .
allan wishart , uk it 's driver psychology which needs to be addressed ahead of any other life-saving devices .
until people get it into their thick heads that speeding is unacceptable , then you 'll never reduce the number of fatalities on our roads .
it 's the " i 'm bigger and better and faster and more important than you " attitude which is so destructive .
jessica , uk zero mg of alcohol .
no smoking in cars , especially when the driver is trying to locate the dying embers that have fallen between the seats at 80mph on the m1 .
no phones -lrb- soon to be law thankfully -rrb- .
i do n't think shock tactics work .
people invariably believe it wo n't happen to them - just ask a smoker if they fear their own mortality .
without question swift and deterrent punishment to match the offence , including lifetime bans will get their attention .
why do we pander to these lunatics who threaten us and our children everyday ?
simon , london , uk touching as these memorials are , they are not as effective a means of saving lives on the highways as are driving more slowly and lawfully tetman callis , usa road safety would be improved by encouraging better driving standards not lowering speeds to ridiculously low levels which induce boredom and reduce concentration .
some would have the return of a man with red flag walking in front of the vehicle !
equal effort should also go into the quality of car maintenance - a special stringent mot test should be introduced for cars over 8 years old with a view to reducing the nation 's stock of bangers .
bill finch , scotland all of the above ideas will most likely reduce accidents , injuries and death .
there are two other areas that should be addressed .
1 .
a comprehensive driving test -lrb- road and classroom -rrb- that needs to retaken every 10 years , and passed or you loose your driving license .
2 .
giving the police enough resources and incentive to effectively and fairly enforced the current road rules .
these two actions are required in the uk , australia and the us .
counties i have lived , worked and driven in over the last 13 years .
ronald spiers usa , usa i work outdoors with children / students in a rural area .
thirty years ago , more than 95 % of drivers would slow down noticeably or even stop if we were walking in single file along the edge of a narrow road .
these days the proportion of arrogant and aggressive drivers -lrb- mainly men -rrb- speeding past even young children on the same road , leaving just inches to spare , has risen to more than a quarter .
bob burn , wales here in new mexico , there is a long-standing tradition of friends and family erecting roadside crosses along the sides of roads where loved ones have died in automobile accidents .
touching as these memorials are , they are not as effective a means of saving lives on the highways as are driving more slowly and lawfully -lrb- people in new mexico are notorious speeders and runners of stop lights -rrb- , paying attention , and driving sober .
tetman callis , usa the seatbelt was a revelation for some but a huge step forward .
i would like to see more , effective measures for in car safety such as harness type seatbelts that race car drivers wear .
in fact , legal measures should be implemented to take safety innovations from the race-track where safety is a primary concern and translate them into the family vehicle arena .
brett jackson , us ban buses and taxi s from speeding .
it seems that they are above the law in the uk and they too are responsible for a massive number of road deaths / injuries .
ban smoking while driving - lighting up is really dangerous and does detract attention from the road .
ban young men from owning white nova 's n benson , uk two words : slow down ! !
jill , northern ireland it is the appalling standard of driving in this country that needs addressing-inappropriate speed for the conditions can mean that 20mph is too fast .
at the same time too slow a speed can also cause serious accidents-overtaking traffic at 2-3mph more than their speed in the 3rd lane of a motorway is a common cause of tailbacks & subsequent frustration .
the problem is that drivers are not taught " situational awareness " -something that motorcyclists have to develop in order to survive , as do military pilots .
speed cameras are not the answer , as they are incapable of recording hgv 's exceeding their limit -lrb- 56mph -rrb- , by 20mph & yet they will result in prosecution for a driver doing 90mph at 3am on the m6 in cumbria when there is nothing else on the motorway .
mike sterland , uk where can i buy one ?
i 'd rather live than worry about fashion peter , uk some of the suggestions in this article are already in place in new zealand .
" death markers " in the form of white wooden crosses can be seen at the sides of many roads although i believe that these crosses are placed by relatives of people killed in road traffic accidents .
" shock " adverts regularly appear on nz tv at peak viewing times .
they are usually quite graphic and hard hitting .
" random " breath testing is commonplace .
it may not be regarded as random as the police stop all vehicles passing through the check point .
sadly however there are still too many accidents .
an apparent lack of basic driving skills and excessive speed seem to be the main causes .
peter , new zealand lower speed limits , head bands -lrb- where can i buy one ?
i 'd rather live than worry about fashion -rrb- , death markers are all excellent ideas .
driving would be less ' fun ' , and slower , but so what ?
i 'd rather get to my destination ten minutes later than arrive thirty years early in the next world .
peter , uk there appears to be an increase in speed cameras , and a decrease in police patrols .
clearly , the speed cameras aim only to catch speeding motorists -lrb- and , of course , are a great revenue generator -rrb- .
meanwhile , other offences are committed , such as dangerous driving , and are not detected .
we need to see more police patrols .
sean , uk the uk is increasingly becoming the country of excessive restrictions on it 's residents .
from roadside cameras to increasing limitations on daily life , people do not appreciate how much their freedoms are being eroded .
educate but not legislate - if people do n't want to wear a seatbelt so be it - their choice .
time for nanny to leave the citizens to make choices for themselves - glad i left it all behind .
james , usa speeding may very well contributing factor , but is n't driving slow as well ?
i drive 25,000 miles a year and everyday i see car moving at 30-35 mph in a 60 speed limit , this causes frustration among drivers and will encourage them to overtake in places which are not safe .
if a driver is not comfortable doing 60 in a 60 they are obviously not confident and therefore should not be on the road , then again these slow coaches are the same ones who do not slow down when entering a built up 30mph area ! !
you know who you are ! !
aled , uk the government should consider school safety zones where speed limits are reduced still further , extra speed humps are employed , and extra fencing used .
a colour coded scheme -lrb- yellow is used in france -rrb- would also highlight the danger area to motorists .
entry into the zone should be clearly indicated e.g.
' warning , you are entering a school safety zone ' .
james , france maybe a radical solution is to make all occupant safety aids on cars illegal david clift , uk soft cars - instead of hard brittle sharp heavy ponty cars why not make cars from soft but durable foam ?
they would be lighter and more likely to bounce in a collision .
of course this would require replacing all vehicles on the road with rubbery cars in a fairly short time frame , but imagine the jobs that would be created .
mark s , brit in the usa the headband / minimal crash helmet idea is good .
as a recreational downhill skier i have become used to wearing a ski helmet and while this wo n't be able to prevent all damage , it could help .
likewise the headband idea might help and also help users think , " i am not indestructible " . sally deutschmann , canada prohibit by law all insurance that covers damage to vehicles one 's own and others - drivers would be very much more cautious .
john clark , dominican republic why are technological solutions always sought to human problems ?
better training , testing and enforcement of the existing laws would reduce the number of accidents .
mick sheppard , uk i feel everyone should be made to take a motorcycle cbt -lrb- compulsory basic training -rrb- .
i believe this would remove any false sense of security they may have when in a car , and also increase their awareness when on the road ..
gary hutton , spain maybe we are looking at this the wrong way , there is a lot of effort put into making car 's safer for their occupants , this leads to drivers feeling that if they crash then they will walk away uninjured .
maybe a radical solution is to make all occupant safety aids on cars illegal ! !
then maybe you would think twice before breaking the speed limit or driving too close to the car in front .
just an idea .
david clift , uk here is a suggestion for stopping people driving while chatting away on their mobile phone .
simply stop calls being transferred between area cells .
our motorways seem to have phone masts every 10m so they would n't even get a " hello " in before being cut off .
however they could always stop and make their call if its important .
jenny , uk get a big off road vehicle and then your most likely to come off best in a crash with another vehicle .
andrew , oxford lower speed limits , especially on country lanes would be a good idea .
its insane to allow motorist to do 60mph -lrb- and many will be doing 70mph or more -rrb- on winding , narrow , bumpy lanes , where around the next bend there could be a tractor , horse rider , cyclist or walker , plus probably another car approaching at 60mph , resulting in a 120mph collision .
lower speed limits , and an intelligent speed control system could prevent thousands of accidents and lives .
i guarantee most motorists would oppose this , as it would spoil their fun and would out-vote their victims to-be and victims relatives , if there was ever a vote on it .
mark humphries , uk getting stuck behind someone driving far beneath the speed limit because they think they 're being safe is going to frustrate other drivers and is very likely to make a person do something foolish or risky sim , uk / usa i believe the " go-slow " concept is a good idea , but something should be done to encourage people to purchase such automobiles .
i feel a tax credit or some type of financial incentive would be needed to encourage people to buy such vehicles .
higher speeds result in a higher level of fatal accidents ; unfortunately many are ignorant of this .
steve , usa how about going too slow being dangerous ?
getting stuck behind someone driving far beneath the speed limit because they think they 're being safe is going to frustrate other drivers and is very likely to make a person do something foolish or risky .
how about having speed restrictions timed ?
some people prefer driving at night when there 's less traffic on the roads and yet are still restricted to speed limits .
speed should be appropriate to circumstances .
sim , uk / usa it would be nice if people actually wore the seatbelts in their cars - the amount of cars i see in the town where i live in essex not wearing their belts is alarming ; especially when you consider that -lrb- 1 -rrb- most of the drivers were either extremely young or not even born when wearing seatbelts in the uk became law and -lrb- 2 -rrb- the cars being driven are not always new enough to have airbags .
personally , i 'm in favour of drivers not wearing seatbelts who are involved in accidents having their insurance voided - and having to pay for any nhs treatment .
it may sound harsh , but quite often these people have children in the back of the car and are just selfish .
catriona , uk i think that the use of signs to show where fatal or serious accidents have occurred is one of the best measures for stating just how dangerous the roads are .
when i was younger i remember seeing signs which were black spots for places of danger .
well worth considering again .
lisa fahy , england why is it assumed that all people are genetically pre-disposed to being good at driving ?
i think that people who do n't pass their test within 5 attempts should n't be allowed on the road. matt , uk i think there should be a reactions test before you are allowed to drive or rid a motorbike .
dan , uk i welcome any of these ideas if it helps save lives .
my dad was killed in a road accident in 1998 , and it never stops seeming so stupid that someone could be killed while on a cycle path , just because the path was not wide enough for two bikes to cross !
elizabeth warn , albania it 's not only blokes who ride big motorcycles , us ladies do too .
it seems to cause a lot of male car drivers extreme angst to see a lady rider on a big , powerful bike .
so much so in fact that it appears to be a direct challenge to their penis size , and they do their best to cut us up , swerve in front of us and make extravagant hand gestures .
shouting obscenities out of car windows when the sisters pass by is a favourite too .
i suggest making it law to oblige all women bikers to dress like men when on a bike , fake beards , hide it all away jackets and a mighty morphin plastic ranger attitude to the road .
us ladies want to be real men too ! ! !
louisa morgan , uk people drive fast because they are impatient -lrb- more so in the south east of england -rrb- .
people get impatient because they know their car is capable of going faster , especially if stuck behind a slower vehicle .
if all vehicles were restricted to the legal speed limit , there would be no impatience and no speeding .
in theory anyway !
lee , uk i think that all motorists should be made to do a refresher course every 10 years monique denton , uk i am an advanced motorcyclist and have practised as a specialist injury solicitor for over 18 years .
there are two main causes of road accidents that could be reduced relatively cheaply ; -lrb- 1 -rrb- it should be illegal to drive any motor vehicle on a public road having consumed any alcohol at all- there is no logical argument for allowing any consumption of a known inhibitor when driving -lrb- 2 -rrb- all drivers should be subject to compulsory re-test every 10 years up to the age of 50 and every 5 years thereafter .
it is insane that drivers who passed their test 40 years ago can still drive in today 's environment without retesting of their abilities .
mike clarke , england the driving test is too easy .
what is now called the advanced test should be the standard .
then the people operating cars would be able to drive properly and i 'm sure the number of accidents would drop .
increasing the difficulty of obtaining a licence means the threat of having it taken away becomes more serious .
james begent , england stopping distance , stopping distance , stopping distance .
last week i drove along a wet crowded motorway at 65mph , in the leftmost lane , keeping a good distance behind the car in front of me .
and all i could see in my rear-view mirror was the radiator grille of the huge lorry driving about a foot behind me .
people like that should be prosecuted for attempted murder .
but you never hear about that sort of bad driving - what you get are stories about ambulance drivers speeding on empty dry roads while trying to save lives - and being prosecuted for their trouble .
can we be grown-up about it and attack inappropriate speed rather than absolute speeding ?
peter , england i like the head band protection -lrb- do they come in child sizes too ? -rrb- , the speed limiters on vehicles and random breath tests .
i think that all motorists should be made to do a refresher course every 10 years .
i would also like to see compulsory lights and reflective wear for cyclists and motorcyclists monique denton , uk i think all cars should be equipped with reflective vests , so that when cars break down at the roadside , the passengers of the car become clearly visible on the roadside .
far too many people are killed on the hard shoulder each year in the uk and something needs to be done about it .
perhaps they should be supplied as standard with all knew cars ?
caroline walton , uk some cars make a noise when the seatbelt is not plugged in and have proper seatbelts in the middle backseat. both of these features would be great if made compulsory .
emma , uk i recall reading about a proposal for a simple change to cars to save lives - the change was to replace the drivers air bag with a big spike .
the idea is that when drivers can see the danger that they are in if they do not drive carefully , they pay attention and drive very carefully indeed .
martin , uk another idea might be to raise the age at which drivers can learn to drive .
the number of ' ' boy racers " on the road must be a contributory factor to the incidents of speed and carnage on the road -lrb- and probably road rage , too , not to mention noise pollution from the massive sound systems many have - if a mobile ' phone is deemed dangerous what about a stereo booming out 100 + watts of sound ?
surely such levels of sound must be distracting to the point of danger . -rrb- andrew , england i think there is an over emphasis on road safety in this country .
the roads are safer than houses .
more people are now killed in accidents in their home each year than on the roads .
more than 4,000 people are killed annually in the home compared to 3,600 on the roads .
one of the safest places you can be is locked up in a padded cell but would you want to live your life that way ?
colin smith , uk to rebecca : yes it is sometimes vital to get out of someone 's way .
that 's what your brakes are for - speeding is never a solution top danger on the roads .
and to b essada : how would a " driving test " for bikes " save 500 kids per year ? "
that 's more than ten times the annual child pedal cyclist fatality rate .
the real barrier to improved road safety is our refusal to take responsibility .
for the most parts these are not " accidents , " over 90 % are crashes resulting from negligence on the part of at least one road user .
pay more attention to the road and less to trying to shave five seconds off your journey .
guy chapman , uk i think smoking at the wheel is more dangerous than using a mobile phone .
you have to take both hands off the wheel to light it , and if you drop it a burning cigarette will land in your lap - very likely to be distracting !
lisa , scotland maybe we need to concentrate on educating pedestrians on how to use crossings and not automatically say that drivers are evil denzil pemberthy , uk " collisions with trees kill 1,600 people a year in germany , 800 in france and more than 200 in britain " look at the figures !
i think that britain already has some of the world 's safest roads , none of the suggestions would help to make us any safer -lrb- unless we were all banned from driving -rrb- .
as a driver it really annoys me how it seems that anything is the drivers fault .
for instance the kill your speed , not a child campaign , if the child had n't walked out from in front of another car he would n't have been hit in the first place .
maybe we need to concentrate on educating pedestrians on how to use crossings and not automatically say that drivers are evil .
denzil pemberthy , uk i like the indian solution : signs by the road - " do n't drive silly , enjoy the valley " and other little poems .
cute but totally ineffective of course .
delhi also has a large sign showing the daily death and serious injury stats for the city .
averages 4 of each per day .
carrie , uk i think that everyone should be required to take part in a refresher course every 10 to 15 years .
i ca n't think of one person i know over forty who would pass their driving test if they re-took it now .
roz , germany anything that makes people less tunnel visioned when they enter their car ca n't hurt .
may i suggest that in place of the air bag on the steering a large spike is put there instead .
it will certainly make people go slower know that they could be kebabed if they had to reduce their speed quickly .
lucy , uk speeding is viewed by many as the be all and end all of road safety and seems as a consequence to be the only target when it comes to road safety .
as a regular motorway driver i see far more accidents caused by people driving too close to the car in front .
would n't speed camera technology be better employed capturing this rather than targeting someone on what may very well be an empty road .
a simple survey of passing cars still reveals a significant percentage not wearing seatbelts .
tim k , uk better road markings , higher quality tarmac that can reduce ' spray ' on the roads , making visibility better and safer for all .
george williams , uk after seeing the ' the uk 's worst driver ' tv program , i think that anyone caught in an accident should have to take a mini driving test , if they pass , no problem , if they perform ' acceptably ' , they should have their fault pointed out , perhaps made to retake this test , if they fail .. they should lose their licence completely .
all accidents are caused by bad driving - whether going to fast for the conditions , or simply poor judgement. by making drivers take a test , it could be used as a means of ensuring only good drivers get to drive .
andy , uk in england 14 % of the driving population fail to meet the eyesight requirements for driving , which i believe are amongst the laxest in europe .
why do n't the police take any action against such dangerous drivers ?
drivers should be required to take annual eyesight tests , particularly older drivers .
andy gambles , england all cars should be fitted with a breathalyser tube which must be blown into to start the car .
if you fail the test the car wo n't start .
simple ! !
bill robertson , scotland my idea is that no-one should be allowed to drive a car before they have learned how to ride a motor bike and ridden one for two years .
this will only increase their road awareness and make the realise that even in a car they are vulnerable to bad drivers .
russell , london , uk is 71mph any more dangerous than 69mph on a motorway ?
mike wicks , uk making cars out of sponge , banning all drivers except me , the ' safer ' driving is the more risks people take .
a compulsory re-test every 5 years would be a better plan , tackling the real issue - the people who drive !
gnome , uk the only suggestion which i can see being as dangerous as the current situation is a go slow car .
whilst not advocating speeding on a general basis -lrb- although let 's face it , most of us do it if only by a couple of miles an hour -rrb- , there are times when it is vital for safety to be able to get out of someone else 's way , for which it may be necessary to speed for a brief moment .
without the ability to do this , i would certainly have been in a number of accidents in my time which were totally unrelated to my own driving .
rebecca , uk is 71mph any more dangerous than 69mph on a motorway ?
the concentration by the authorities and pressure groups on absolute speeds , instead of appropriate speed is a waste of time .
how many speed cameras do we need to reduce the fatalities on the road to 0 ?
if you concentrate solely on speed , the most cost-effective solution surely would be to bring back the red flag act of the 1800s , when all horseless carriages were required to be preceded by a man walking in front with a red flag .
fortunately the maximum speed under this system is about 3 to 5 mph , so no one would ever get killed on the road again , but the country would grind to a halt .
mike wicks , uk simple a driving test for bike riders .
bikes are great kids toys for off road use .
if they are going to be used on road the rider should either hold , or be escorted by someone holding , a driving licence .
this would save 500 kids a year with very little cost .

in the latest move , the uk government announced this week it would be banning the use of mobile phones while driving .
below is a selection of other suggestions to improve road safety , drawn from various sources .
bbc news online would also like to hear your views by filling out the form below .
head bands would drivers wear these ?
many of the most serious road crashes result in head injuries .
they may not look too fashionable , but these head bands have been identified as one way of reducing the human impact of car accidents .
leading research in this area is the road accident research unit at the university of adelaide , in australia .
its tests have already shown headbands would reduce injuries from frontal car crashes , and research is continuing on other types of crash .
essentially the bands are crash helmets which have been scaled down to look less bulky .
it may be hard to imagine people wearing them - but many people opposed wearing seat belts when they were introduced .
go-slow cars cars could stop their own drivers from speeding experts at the university of leeds are working on a car equipped with a speed limiter which makes it impossible to break the legal limit .
professor of transport safety , oliver carsten , said : " we believe this kind of technology can contribute to road safety .
" if all drivers kept to the speed limit , deaths on the road -lrb- in the uk -rrb- would fall by 37 % , over 1,200 each year . "
the system has been dubbed intelligent speed adaptation .
death markers black markers signify deaths and red indicate serious injuries an idea used in various countries where the risk of crashes increases on long stretches of road .
black markers -lrb- usually small wooden posts -rrb- are installed at locations where fatal accidents have occurred .
they may be slightly morbid , but these markers , which feature small crosses at the top , are sobering reminder of how dangerous driving can be .
they also serve to highlight corners or stretches of road which may be more hazardous than they appear .
additional red markers indicate sites of crashes which resulted in serious injuries .
design and roadside objects road design is crucial many vehicle deaths would be avoided if authorities paid closer attention to removing or fencing off roadside objects , such as dangerous trees and posts .
collisions with trees kill 1,600 people a year in germany , 800 in france and more than 200 in britain .
general design of roads is also important , with some research suggesting poor design contributes to 33 % of crashes .
refresher courses middle-aged men are getting back on the road a concern raised by the aa is the number of middle-aged men " rediscovering their youth " by getting back on their motorcycles .
it can sometimes be too late when they discover the road environment has changed over the last 20 to 30 years .
many would benefit from refresher courses to hone their skills , which may have diminished over the years and must be adapted to modern road conditions .
hitting home cars can be fragile machines many people do not fully comprehend the horror of car crashes , and thus do not drive accordingly .
numerous advertisements have used shocking images of accidents in the hope of reforming attitudes .
some say this could be taken a step further by occasionally putting badly damaged and burnt out vehicles at the roadside .
it would surely be a stark reminder of how fragile a car can be when travelling at speed .
lower speed limits is 40mph too fast ?
it seems obvious , but few people realise the difference made by slower driving .
not only are you less likely to suffer serious injuries , but there is less chance of the accident happening in the first place .
research in areas where the speed limit is 60km / h -lrb- just under 40mph -rrb- has shown the chance of crashing could be reduced by as much as 40 % if the limit was lowered by just 10km / h .
however suggestions of lowering speed limits often encounter resistance from motorists who are in a hurry to get where they are going .
drink driving drunk drivers can be lethal alcohol is still a major cause of car crashes .
the royal society for the prevention of accidents says the allowable amount of alcohol should be lowered from 80mg to 50mg .
furthermore , it wants police empowered to test drivers randomly .
" they should be able to test anywhere at any time , " a spokesman said .
a selection of views from bbc news online readers : clear , logical road direction signs , well in advance of junctions would reduce accidents where people brake sharply because they have nearly missed a turn .
a lot more thinking needs to go into how direction signs are laid out , located and lead the driver confidently to their destination .
eric woodcock , united kingdom tail-gating is at least as dangerous as speeding , but seems to be completely unenforced .
also the comments other people have made here hardly mention it .
why is there such a blind spot about safe distances ?
it would be quite easy to put a forward radar in cars to warn about being too close , perhaps even to enforce a minimum distance , along similar lines to a speed governor .
stephen burke , england i think those head bands are a bad idea .
people will not want to be seen dead in those so will speed through towns in order not to be seen .
come on honestly is that the best they can come up with henry , england manufacturers still do not do enough to stop vehicles from being stolen .
many crimes , not only " joy riding " use stolen cars .
the public are put at great danger by this crime .
enormous police and victims resources are absorbed by the effects and results of stolen cars .
vehicles can be manufactured so that the need to put extra steering locks on them becomes redundant .
alternatively legislation should be brought in so that vehicle security systems are far more difficult to defeat .
scott , yorkshire roads should all be marked every 100 metres with the speed limit .
all speed cameras should have the speed limit painted on them .
half the time you do n't know what the speed limit is on uk roads - a cynical attempt to catch more motorists out ?
rooster , uk " occasionally putting badly damaged and burnt out vehicles at the roadside " - anybody who has ever lived in an inner city area will be well aware that this occurs frequently and does nothing to help road safety !
lee i agree with the comment about sight tests .
as well as doing a breath test at the scene of any incident police officers should also be required to check somebody 's eye sight .
many people do n't realise their eyesight is getting worse as it happens so slow .
i 've seen a number of people have very near misses , who subsequently go for an eye test to find out they need glasses at least for driving , and been amazed at what they were missing as regards things happening around them .
zippy , uk it 's driver psychology which needs to be addressed ahead of any other life-saving devices jessica , uk the revenue collected from " speed cameras " should be used to improve the general standard and safety of the actual roads .
placing cameras on awkward bends and corners is not the answer .
make the roads straight and fence off trees .
or even cut down trees .
at the moment revenue is just another form of taxation .
shaun grimes , uk the telling fact is in the chart : six deaths per hundred thousand people per year .
the figure is miniscule .
do we really need all the inconvenience of the road safety industry for this tiny risk ?
simon richardson , uk many contributors mention the physical distraction of smoking at the wheel .
there seems to be a reluctance to realise that although cigarettes are legal , nicotine is a highly addictive narcotic which often causes symptoms of aggressive behavior .
the smoke also reduces blood oxygen levels and increases levels of carbon monoxide in the blood , which is not conducive to clear thinking .
it seems strange that whilst alcohol is blamed for so much , being " high " off cigarettes is considered " normal " .
mike , uk encourage people to use their cars less .
invest in the public transport infrastructure .
use bicyles for short trips .
allan wishart , uk it 's driver psychology which needs to be addressed ahead of any other life-saving devices .
until people get it into their thick heads that speeding is unacceptable , then you 'll never reduce the number of fatalities on our roads .
it 's the " i 'm bigger and better and faster and more important than you " attitude which is so destructive .
jessica , uk zero mg of alcohol .
no smoking in cars , especially when the driver is trying to locate the dying embers that have fallen between the seats at 80mph on the m1 .
no phones -lrb- soon to be law thankfully -rrb- .
i do n't think shock tactics work .
people invariably believe it wo n't happen to them - just ask a smoker if they fear their own mortality .
without question swift and deterrent punishment to match the offence , including lifetime bans will get their attention .
why do we pander to these lunatics who threaten us and our children everyday ?
simon , london , uk touching as these memorials are , they are not as effective a means of saving lives on the highways as are driving more slowly and lawfully tetman callis , usa road safety would be improved by encouraging better driving standards not lowering speeds to ridiculously low levels which induce boredom and reduce concentration .
some would have the return of a man with red flag walking in front of the vehicle !
equal effort should also go into the quality of car maintenance - a special stringent mot test should be introduced for cars over 8 years old with a view to reducing the nation 's stock of bangers .
bill finch , scotland all of the above ideas will most likely reduce accidents , injuries and death .
there are two other areas that should be addressed .
1 .
a comprehensive driving test -lrb- road and classroom -rrb- that needs to retaken every 10 years , and passed or you loose your driving license .
2 .
giving the police enough resources and incentive to effectively and fairly enforced the current road rules .
these two actions are required in the uk , australia and the us .
counties i have lived , worked and driven in over the last 13 years .
ronald spiers usa , usa i work outdoors with children / students in a rural area .
thirty years ago , more than 95 % of drivers would slow down noticeably or even stop if we were walking in single file along the edge of a narrow road .
these days the proportion of arrogant and aggressive drivers -lrb- mainly men -rrb- speeding past even young children on the same road , leaving just inches to spare , has risen to more than a quarter .
bob burn , wales here in new mexico , there is a long-standing tradition of friends and family erecting roadside crosses along the sides of roads where loved ones have died in automobile accidents .
touching as these memorials are , they are not as effective a means of saving lives on the highways as are driving more slowly and lawfully -lrb- people in new mexico are notorious speeders and runners of stop lights -rrb- , paying attention , and driving sober .
tetman callis , usa the seatbelt was a revelation for some but a huge step forward .
i would like to see more , effective measures for in car safety such as harness type seatbelts that race car drivers wear .
in fact , legal measures should be implemented to take safety innovations from the race-track where safety is a primary concern and translate them into the family vehicle arena .
brett jackson , us ban buses and taxi s from speeding .
it seems that they are above the law in the uk and they too are responsible for a massive number of road deaths / injuries .
ban smoking while driving - lighting up is really dangerous and does detract attention from the road .
ban young men from owning white nova 's n benson , uk two words : slow down ! !
jill , northern ireland it is the appalling standard of driving in this country that needs addressing-inappropriate speed for the conditions can mean that 20mph is too fast .
at the same time too slow a speed can also cause serious accidents-overtaking traffic at 2-3mph more than their speed in the 3rd lane of a motorway is a common cause of tailbacks & subsequent frustration .
the problem is that drivers are not taught " situational awareness " -something that motorcyclists have to develop in order to survive , as do military pilots .
speed cameras are not the answer , as they are incapable of recording hgv 's exceeding their limit -lrb- 56mph -rrb- , by 20mph & yet they will result in prosecution for a driver doing 90mph at 3am on the m6 in cumbria when there is nothing else on the motorway .
mike sterland , uk where can i buy one ?
i 'd rather live than worry about fashion peter , uk some of the suggestions in this article are already in place in new zealand .
" death markers " in the form of white wooden crosses can be seen at the sides of many roads although i believe that these crosses are placed by relatives of people killed in road traffic accidents .
" shock " adverts regularly appear on nz tv at peak viewing times .
they are usually quite graphic and hard hitting .
" random " breath testing is commonplace .
it may not be regarded as random as the police stop all vehicles passing through the check point .
sadly however there are still too many accidents .
an apparent lack of basic driving skills and excessive speed seem to be the main causes .
peter , new zealand lower speed limits , head bands -lrb- where can i buy one ?
i 'd rather live than worry about fashion -rrb- , death markers are all excellent ideas .
driving would be less ' fun ' , and slower , but so what ?
i 'd rather get to my destination ten minutes later than arrive thirty years early in the next world .
peter , uk there appears to be an increase in speed cameras , and a decrease in police patrols .
clearly , the speed cameras aim only to catch speeding motorists -lrb- and , of course , are a great revenue generator -rrb- .
meanwhile , other offences are committed , such as dangerous driving , and are not detected .
we need to see more police patrols .
sean , uk the uk is increasingly becoming the country of excessive restrictions on it 's residents .
from roadside cameras to increasing limitations on daily life , people do not appreciate how much their freedoms are being eroded .
educate but not legislate - if people do n't want to wear a seatbelt so be it - their choice .
time for nanny to leave the citizens to make choices for themselves - glad i left it all behind .
james , usa speeding may very well contributing factor , but is n't driving slow as well ?
i drive 25,000 miles a year and everyday i see car moving at 30-35 mph in a 60 speed limit , this causes frustration among drivers and will encourage them to overtake in places which are not safe .
if a driver is not comfortable doing 60 in a 60 they are obviously not confident and therefore should not be on the road , then again these slow coaches are the same ones who do not slow down when entering a built up 30mph area ! !
you know who you are ! !
aled , uk the government should consider school safety zones where speed limits are reduced still further , extra speed humps are employed , and extra fencing used .
a colour coded scheme -lrb- yellow is used in france -rrb- would also highlight the danger area to motorists .
entry into the zone should be clearly indicated e.g.
' warning , you are entering a school safety zone ' .
james , france maybe a radical solution is to make all occupant safety aids on cars illegal david clift , uk soft cars - instead of hard brittle sharp heavy ponty cars why not make cars from soft but durable foam ?
they would be lighter and more likely to bounce in a collision .
of course this would require replacing all vehicles on the road with rubbery cars in a fairly short time frame , but imagine the jobs that would be created .
mark s , brit in the usa the headband / minimal crash helmet idea is good .
as a recreational downhill skier i have become used to wearing a ski helmet and while this wo n't be able to prevent all damage , it could help .
likewise the headband idea might help and also help users think , " i am not indestructible " . sally deutschmann , canada prohibit by law all insurance that covers damage to vehicles one 's own and others - drivers would be very much more cautious .
john clark , dominican republic why are technological solutions always sought to human problems ?
better training , testing and enforcement of the existing laws would reduce the number of accidents .
mick sheppard , uk i feel everyone should be made to take a motorcycle cbt -lrb- compulsory basic training -rrb- .
i believe this would remove any false sense of security they may have when in a car , and also increase their awareness when on the road ..
gary hutton , spain maybe we are looking at this the wrong way , there is a lot of effort put into making car 's safer for their occupants , this leads to drivers feeling that if they crash then they will walk away uninjured .
maybe a radical solution is to make all occupant safety aids on cars illegal ! !
then maybe you would think twice before breaking the speed limit or driving too close to the car in front .
just an idea .
david clift , uk here is a suggestion for stopping people driving while chatting away on their mobile phone .
simply stop calls being transferred between area cells .
our motorways seem to have phone masts every 10m so they would n't even get a " hello " in before being cut off .
however they could always stop and make their call if its important .
jenny , uk get a big off road vehicle and then your most likely to come off best in a crash with another vehicle .
andrew , oxford lower speed limits , especially on country lanes would be a good idea .
its insane to allow motorist to do 60mph -lrb- and many will be doing 70mph or more -rrb- on winding , narrow , bumpy lanes , where around the next bend there could be a tractor , horse rider , cyclist or walker , plus probably another car approaching at 60mph , resulting in a 120mph collision .
lower speed limits , and an intelligent speed control system could prevent thousands of accidents and lives .
i guarantee most motorists would oppose this , as it would spoil their fun and would out-vote their victims to-be and victims relatives , if there was ever a vote on it .
mark humphries , uk getting stuck behind someone driving far beneath the speed limit because they think they 're being safe is going to frustrate other drivers and is very likely to make a person do something foolish or risky sim , uk / usa i believe the " go-slow " concept is a good idea , but something should be done to encourage people to purchase such automobiles .
i feel a tax credit or some type of financial incentive would be needed to encourage people to buy such vehicles .
higher speeds result in a higher level of fatal accidents ; unfortunately many are ignorant of this .
steve , usa how about going too slow being dangerous ?
getting stuck behind someone driving far beneath the speed limit because they think they 're being safe is going to frustrate other drivers and is very likely to make a person do something foolish or risky .
how about having speed restrictions timed ?
some people prefer driving at night when there 's less traffic on the roads and yet are still restricted to speed limits .
speed should be appropriate to circumstances .
sim , uk / usa it would be nice if people actually wore the seatbelts in their cars - the amount of cars i see in the town where i live in essex not wearing their belts is alarming ; especially when you consider that -lrb- 1 -rrb- most of the drivers were either extremely young or not even born when wearing seatbelts in the uk became law and -lrb- 2 -rrb- the cars being driven are not always new enough to have airbags .
personally , i 'm in favour of drivers not wearing seatbelts who are involved in accidents having their insurance voided - and having to pay for any nhs treatment .
it may sound harsh , but quite often these people have children in the back of the car and are just selfish .
catriona , uk i think that the use of signs to show where fatal or serious accidents have occurred is one of the best measures for stating just how dangerous the roads are .
when i was younger i remember seeing signs which were black spots for places of danger .
well worth considering again .
lisa fahy , england why is it assumed that all people are genetically pre-disposed to being good at driving ?
i think that people who do n't pass their test within 5 attempts should n't be allowed on the road. matt , uk i think there should be a reactions test before you are allowed to drive or rid a motorbike .
dan , uk i welcome any of these ideas if it helps save lives .
my dad was killed in a road accident in 1998 , and it never stops seeming so stupid that someone could be killed while on a cycle path , just because the path was not wide enough for two bikes to cross !
elizabeth warn , albania it 's not only blokes who ride big motorcycles , us ladies do too .
it seems to cause a lot of male car drivers extreme angst to see a lady rider on a big , powerful bike .
so much so in fact that it appears to be a direct challenge to their penis size , and they do their best to cut us up , swerve in front of us and make extravagant hand gestures .
shouting obscenities out of car windows when the sisters pass by is a favourite too .
i suggest making it law to oblige all women bikers to dress like men when on a bike , fake beards , hide it all away jackets and a mighty morphin plastic ranger attitude to the road .
us ladies want to be real men too ! ! !
louisa morgan , uk people drive fast because they are impatient -lrb- more so in the south east of england -rrb- .
people get impatient because they know their car is capable of going faster , especially if stuck behind a slower vehicle .
if all vehicles were restricted to the legal speed limit , there would be no impatience and no speeding .
in theory anyway !
lee , uk i think that all motorists should be made to do a refresher course every 10 years monique denton , uk i am an advanced motorcyclist and have practised as a specialist injury solicitor for over 18 years .
there are two main causes of road accidents that could be reduced relatively cheaply ; -lrb- 1 -rrb- it should be illegal to drive any motor vehicle on a public road having consumed any alcohol at all- there is no logical argument for allowing any consumption of a known inhibitor when driving -lrb- 2 -rrb- all drivers should be subject to compulsory re-test every 10 years up to the age of 50 and every 5 years thereafter .
it is insane that drivers who passed their test 40 years ago can still drive in today 's environment without retesting of their abilities .
mike clarke , england the driving test is too easy .
what is now called the advanced test should be the standard .
then the people operating cars would be able to drive properly and i 'm sure the number of accidents would drop .
increasing the difficulty of obtaining a licence means the threat of having it taken away becomes more serious .
james begent , england stopping distance , stopping distance , stopping distance .
last week i drove along a wet crowded motorway at 65mph , in the leftmost lane , keeping a good distance behind the car in front of me .
and all i could see in my rear-view mirror was the radiator grille of the huge lorry driving about a foot behind me .
people like that should be prosecuted for attempted murder .
but you never hear about that sort of bad driving - what you get are stories about ambulance drivers speeding on empty dry roads while trying to save lives - and being prosecuted for their trouble .
can we be grown-up about it and attack inappropriate speed rather than absolute speeding ?
peter , england i like the head band protection -lrb- do they come in child sizes too ? -rrb- , the speed limiters on vehicles and random breath tests .
i think that all motorists should be made to do a refresher course every 10 years .
i would also like to see compulsory lights and reflective wear for cyclists and motorcyclists monique denton , uk i think all cars should be equipped with reflective vests , so that when cars break down at the roadside , the passengers of the car become clearly visible on the roadside .
far too many people are killed on the hard shoulder each year in the uk and something needs to be done about it .
perhaps they should be supplied as standard with all knew cars ?
caroline walton , uk some cars make a noise when the seatbelt is not plugged in and have proper seatbelts in the middle backseat. both of these features would be great if made compulsory .
emma , uk i recall reading about a proposal for a simple change to cars to save lives - the change was to replace the drivers air bag with a big spike .
the idea is that when drivers can see the danger that they are in if they do not drive carefully , they pay attention and drive very carefully indeed .
martin , uk another idea might be to raise the age at which drivers can learn to drive .
the number of ' ' boy racers " on the road must be a contributory factor to the incidents of speed and carnage on the road -lrb- and probably road rage , too , not to mention noise pollution from the massive sound systems many have - if a mobile ' phone is deemed dangerous what about a stereo booming out 100 + watts of sound ?
surely such levels of sound must be distracting to the point of danger . -rrb- andrew , england i think there is an over emphasis on road safety in this country .
the roads are safer than houses .
more people are now killed in accidents in their home each year than on the roads .
more than 4,000 people are killed annually in the home compared to 3,600 on the roads .
one of the safest places you can be is locked up in a padded cell but would you want to live your life that way ?
colin smith , uk to rebecca : yes it is sometimes vital to get out of someone 's way .
that 's what your brakes are for - speeding is never a solution top danger on the roads .
and to b essada : how would a " driving test " for bikes " save 500 kids per year ? "
that 's more than ten times the annual child pedal cyclist fatality rate .
the real barrier to improved road safety is our refusal to take responsibility .
for the most parts these are not " accidents , " over 90 % are crashes resulting from negligence on the part of at least one road user .
pay more attention to the road and less to trying to shave five seconds off your journey .
guy chapman , uk i think smoking at the wheel is more dangerous than using a mobile phone .
you have to take both hands off the wheel to light it , and if you drop it a burning cigarette will land in your lap - very likely to be distracting !
lisa , scotland maybe we need to concentrate on educating pedestrians on how to use crossings and not automatically say that drivers are evil denzil pemberthy , uk " collisions with trees kill 1,600 people a year in germany , 800 in france and more than 200 in britain " look at the figures !
i think that britain already has some of the world 's safest roads , none of the suggestions would help to make us any safer -lrb- unless we were all banned from driving -rrb- .
as a driver it really annoys me how it seems that anything is the drivers fault .
for instance the kill your speed , not a child campaign , if the child had n't walked out from in front of another car he would n't have been hit in the first place .
maybe we need to concentrate on educating pedestrians on how to use crossings and not automatically say that drivers are evil .
denzil pemberthy , uk i like the indian solution : signs by the road - " do n't drive silly , enjoy the valley " and other little poems .
cute but totally ineffective of course .
delhi also has a large sign showing the daily death and serious injury stats for the city .
averages 4 of each per day .
carrie , uk i think that everyone should be required to take part in a refresher course every 10 to 15 years .
i ca n't think of one person i know over forty who would pass their driving test if they re-took it now .
roz , germany anything that makes people less tunnel visioned when they enter their car ca n't hurt .
may i suggest that in place of the air bag on the steering a large spike is put there instead .
it will certainly make people go slower know that they could be kebabed if they had to reduce their speed quickly .
lucy , uk speeding is viewed by many as the be all and end all of road safety and seems as a consequence to be the only target when it comes to road safety .
as a regular motorway driver i see far more accidents caused by people driving too close to the car in front .
would n't speed camera technology be better employed capturing this rather than targeting someone on what may very well be an empty road .
a simple survey of passing cars still reveals a significant percentage not wearing seatbelts .
tim k , uk better road markings , higher quality tarmac that can reduce ' spray ' on the roads , making visibility better and safer for all .
george williams , uk after seeing the ' the uk 's worst driver ' tv program , i think that anyone caught in an accident should have to take a mini driving test , if they pass , no problem , if they perform ' acceptably ' , they should have their fault pointed out , perhaps made to retake this test , if they fail .. they should lose their licence completely .
all accidents are caused by bad driving - whether going to fast for the conditions , or simply poor judgement. by making drivers take a test , it could be used as a means of ensuring only good drivers get to drive .
andy , uk in england 14 % of the driving population fail to meet the eyesight requirements for driving , which i believe are amongst the laxest in europe .
why do n't the police take any action against such dangerous drivers ?
drivers should be required to take annual eyesight tests , particularly older drivers .
andy gambles , england all cars should be fitted with a breathalyser tube which must be blown into to start the car .
if you fail the test the car wo n't start .
simple ! !
bill robertson , scotland my idea is that no-one should be allowed to drive a car before they have learned how to ride a motor bike and ridden one for two years .
this will only increase their road awareness and make the realise that even in a car they are vulnerable to bad drivers .
russell , london , uk is 71mph any more dangerous than 69mph on a motorway ?
mike wicks , uk making cars out of sponge , banning all drivers except me , the ' safer ' driving is the more risks people take .
a compulsory re-test every 5 years would be a better plan , tackling the real issue - the people who drive !
gnome , uk the only suggestion which i can see being as dangerous as the current situation is a go slow car .
whilst not advocating speeding on a general basis -lrb- although let 's face it , most of us do it if only by a couple of miles an hour -rrb- , there are times when it is vital for safety to be able to get out of someone else 's way , for which it may be necessary to speed for a brief moment .
without the ability to do this , i would certainly have been in a number of accidents in my time which were totally unrelated to my own driving .
rebecca , uk is 71mph any more dangerous than 69mph on a motorway ?
the concentration by the authorities and pressure groups on absolute speeds , instead of appropriate speed is a waste of time .
how many speed cameras do we need to reduce the fatalities on the road to 0 ?
if you concentrate solely on speed , the most cost-effective solution surely would be to bring back the red flag act of the 1800s , when all horseless carriages were required to be preceded by a man walking in front with a red flag .
fortunately the maximum speed under this system is about 3 to 5 mph , so no one would ever get killed on the road again , but the country would grind to a halt .
mike wicks , uk simple a driving test for bike riders .
bikes are great kids toys for off road use .
if they are going to be used on road the rider should either hold , or be escorted by someone holding , a driving licence .
this would save 500 kids a year with very little cost .

the new opportunities fund -lrb- nof -rrb- has awarded £ 1.5m to expand schemes offering childcare places for children , parents and carers .
bryan slater , the county 's director of education , said : " this announcement - and the money it means for norfolk - will offer not only great opportunities for childcare schemes starting up or wishing to expand , but also offer individuals a chance to start their own businesses . "

but its deeply split decisions reflect a wide cultural divide in american society .
very few states still ban homosexual intercourse officially the last case decided by the court this year overturns a texas law that makes sodomy illegal between gay couples , but not married couples , on the grounds that there is no compelling state interest in regulating the private acts of individuals .
in a split 6-3 decision , it also reversed the supreme court 's own ruling of 18 years ago in the last decade , public opinion has shifted on this issue , with a narrow majority now supporting such a change in the law .
the decision is likely to make illegal the laws in the 13 states that still regulate sodomy , and provide an important assurance for the 600,000 openly gay households in the country .
the court has taken sides in the culture war justice antonin scalia according to the lawyer for the plaintiffs , harvard law professor lawrence tribe , it could also have broader implications in preventing discrimination against gays because of disapproval of their sexual conduct .
but the decision infuriated conservative church groups , who vowed to fight the ruling- and the conservative members of the court .
deeply divided in a stinging dissent , justice antonin scalia said that " the court has taken sides in the culture war , departing from its role assuring as neutral observer that the democratic rules of engagement are observed . "
he warned that the ruling would open the way for the court to legalise gay marriage , and said that it should be up to the people through legislation , not the courts , to regulate matters of moral conduct .
and justice scalia warned that the judgement also lead to renewed questions about the wisdom of roe v. wade , the landmark decision that allowed women the right to have abortions .
it is yet another example of how in the past few years the court has become a lightening rod for the fierce debates over social issues that are deeply splitting the country .
and with some justices contemplating retirement , it has already led to political advertisements over the choice of a successor , which is up to the president , with the advice and consent of the senate .
conservative shift the supreme court is the third arm of the government in the us , and its decisions - on such issues as abortion rights , birth control , and school integration - often have more influence on the lives of individual citizens than actions by the president or congress .
civil rights campaigners protested outside the supreme court in recent years , the mood of the court has grown more conservative , as it sought to limit the rights it granted in previous decades to crime suspects , free speech advocates and minority groups .
but the battle has been fierce , with many judgements decided by a single vote .
in the most important case of the session , the supreme court upheld by 5-4 the right of universities to use race as a factor in admission , upholding the broad thrust of its last ruling on the issue in 1978 .
but it ruled against one of the programmes used by the university of michigan to increase minority enrolment .
and the court made it clear that any affirmative action programmes have to be limited in time and scope .
diversity - especially to widen the recruitment of elites - is still seen as important goal in the united states .
state v individual but in other cases , the court reduced the rights of individuals and increased the power of the government .
by a narrow majority , it upheld a federal law that requires libraries to regulate access to the internet for children by installing filters on computers providing that service .
it has previously overruled two earlier proposals to regulate child pornography on the grounds that it would restrict free speech .
in this case , two justices who supported the restriction said that it would only be constitutional if adults could ask the library to turn off the filters .
and in other important cases , it upheld the right of states to imprison people for life if they committed three crimes , even if some were petty crimes ; and to restrict access to public housing projects by making the streets off-limits to trespassers .
the court also upheld the right of the president to negotiate foreign treaties , overturning another california law that sought to give additional rights of disclosure to the families of holocaust victims who may have had an insurance policy that they were never able to cash in .
swing vote the court 's dilemma on many of these issues echoes the political divisions within the united states , which now follow cultural rather than economic lines .
the culturally conservative , who oppose abortion and gun control , are hoping that president bush will be able to appoint new more conservative justices to the court if he wins a second term .
that could be particularly important over the issue of abortion , on which the court did not rule this term , but which has been supported by a narrow majority .
it had been expected that one or two justices - including the key swing vote in the abortion and affirmative action cases , sandra day o 'connor - might retire this term .
however , it now appears they are staying on - not least to hear a crucial appeal early in the next supreme court term over the constitutionality of a new campaign reform finance law designed to reduce the influence of money on the political process .
in an unrelated case , the court this term upheld the principle that congress can regulate the amount of money companies can give to candidates .
but there are strong free speech objections to the new law , which seeks to limit campaign advertising by pressure groups .
any decision overthrowing the new law , which came into effect just after the november 2002 congressional elections , could have a huge effect on the 2004 presidential election .

the lobbying commission is looking into whether simmons spent more than $ 2,000 -lrb- £ 1,200 -rrb- to influence state officials .
anyone spending above this amount to lobby the state government must register with the commission and make financial disclosures .
simmons is founder of def jam records and head of rush artist management , which manages top-selling rap acts such as ll cool j , run-dmc and public enemy .
he is part of a coalition working to convince new york 's state legislature to relax tough 1970s drugs laws .
the laws , enacted in 1973 by republican governor nelson rockefeller , carry sentences of 15 years to life for anyone convicted of selling or possessing small amounts of drugs such as cocaine or heroin .
lobbying commission executive director david grandeau said : " the commission is investigating russell simmons and other folks to see if they engaged in lobbying without properly registering with the state and documenting their spending . "
the commission is also investigating whether simmons gave a gift of a free helicopter ride to secretary of state randy daniels last week , mr grandeau said .
state officials are not allowed to accept gifts worth more than $ 75 -lrb- £ 45 -rrb- .

for several years in the 1990s , radio dj and tv presenter chris evans was the uk 's most popular and successful media star .
after finding fame on channel 4 's big breakfast , he went on to host shows on bbc radio 1 and virgin radio - the latter he liked so much that he bought the station in 1997 .
but he lost his controlling stake in virgin when he sold his ginger media company to scottish media group -lrb- smg -rrb- in a £ 220m deal three years later .
after getting used to being his own boss , he could not accept his new status as an employee , smg told london 's high court during the protracted hearing .
bobby hain , an executive who became mr evans ' boss , said : " he seemed unable to have a proper presenter / programme director relationship with either myself or -lsb- programme director -rsb- paul jackson . "
evans admitted in court that he was often hung over as he presented his show , even drinking on air on one programme .
" i have done most of my shows hung over .
it was my normal working zone , " he said .
he would not do what virgin radio 's management reasonably required him to do as a presenter of a national radio breakfast show geoffrey vos qc representing smg but the station said it had to put up with his behaviour because he was their top dj and as they did not want to run the risk of him walking out .
smg also accused evans of bringing the station into disrepute with his " destructive " behaviour , effectively costing it £ 20m through lost revenue and audiences .
evans ' lawyers tried to argue that evans raised audience figures when he joined in 1997 but they had already begun to decline by 1998 .
in june 2001 , evans took a week off work , claiming to be ill .
but he was photographed on several occasions out with his wife billie piper at the pub and supermarket .
despite the fact that he was their biggest name , smg finally lost patience and evans was sacked .
crying although virgin did not believe evans was ill , evans ' gp said the star was " chronically stressed " during this period .
evans could not stop crying and kept repeating the phrase " do n't get rid of me because i have not done anything wrong " , according to dr john gayner .
virgin said they sacked him because he had breached his contract , not just over his absence - alluding to other unknown reasons .
the cost of being fired was more than just facing the dole queue but the loss of millions of pounds worth of shares .
and the indomitable evans was not going to take it lying down , and launched legal action that wound up at london 's high court .
' public ' breach evans alleged he had been unfairly dismissed and that smg withheld £ 8.6m in shares he said were rightfully his .
but smg countersued , saying evans breached his contract in a " highly public manner " and claimed unspecified damages .
smg maintained it was fully within its rights to sack evans because of his behaviour .
geoffrey vos qc , representing smg , told the court : " by his conduct , mr evans made it 100 % clear by june 28 2001 , the date of his dismissal , that he would not do what virgin radio 's management reasonably required him to do as a presenter of a national radio breakfast show . "
evans remains an entrepreneur after the virgin sacking , and has produced the girls and boys and live with ... shows for channel 4 and five .
but they have not found the success he enjoyed during his heyday .

for several years in the 1990s , radio dj and tv presenter chris evans was the uk 's most popular and successful media star .
after finding fame on channel 4 's big breakfast , he went on to host shows on bbc radio 1 and virgin radio - the latter he liked so much that he bought the station in 1997 .
but he lost his controlling stake in virgin when he sold his ginger media company to scottish media group -lrb- smg -rrb- in a £ 220m deal three years later .
after getting used to being his own boss , he could not accept his new status as an employee , smg told london 's high court during the protracted hearing .
bobby hain , an executive who became mr evans ' boss , said : " he seemed unable to have a proper presenter / programme director relationship with either myself or -lsb- programme director -rsb- paul jackson . "
evans admitted in court that he was often hung over as he presented his show , even drinking on air on one programme .
" i have done most of my shows hung over .
it was my normal working zone , " he said .
he would not do what virgin radio 's management reasonably required him to do as a presenter of a national radio breakfast show geoffrey vos qc representing smg but the station said it had to put up with his behaviour because he was their top dj and as they did not want to run the risk of him walking out .
smg also accused evans of bringing the station into disrepute with his " destructive " behaviour , effectively costing it £ 20m through lost revenue and audiences .
evans ' lawyers tried to argue that evans raised audience figures when he joined in 1997 but they had already begun to decline by 1998 .
in june 2001 , evans took a week off work , claiming to be ill .
but he was photographed on several occasions out with his wife billie piper at the pub and supermarket .
despite the fact that he was their biggest name , smg finally lost patience and evans was sacked .
crying although virgin did not believe evans was ill , evans ' gp said the star was " chronically stressed " during this period .

mr gardam told staff at the london channel 's headquarters on wednesday he would leave his job at the end of 2003 .
mr gardam said he was stepping down for " personal reasons " and because he wanted to do something new .
" i am announcing it now because i want to ensure a smooth succession , " mr gardam said .
" it leaves me free to consider various options without it causing uncertainty here .
" i will have been director of programmes and television for five years this autumn , and this has always been the maximum time i thought it sensible to do the job .
i now want to do something new . "
in his time at channel 4 , mr gardam - who is also director of programmes - has overseen the introduction of some of its biggest hits , including big brother , faking it and peter kay 's phoenix nights .
his replacement will be appointed later this year and kevin lygo , director of programmes at five -lrb- channel 5 -rrb- , is considered a strong candidate .
he worked for channel 4 for three years as head of arts and entertainment before moving to five .
mr gardam 's career has seen him move in the other direction , as he was five 's director of programmes before going to channel 4 .
he was recruited by michael jackson , the channel 's then chief executive .
mr jackson was succeeded by mark thompson .
the loss of mr gardam - a former head of the bbc 's weekly news programmes - will be a seen as a blow for the channel by many in the television industry .
under his leadership , many of the channel 's entertainment programmes have become some of the uk 's most popular programmes .
programmes such as satirical news show brass eye are also considered by many critics as some of the most innovative in recent years .
mr gardam also turned channel 4 news into a seven-day bulletin and outbid the bbc and five for the simpsons in 2002 .
however , mr gardam and mr thompson have also been accused of lowering standards at the channel with the introduction of several so-called " reality tv " shows .
earlier this month , mr gardam called for an end to the bbc 's monopoly over the licence-fee income .
he called for national lottery-style funding to help terrestrial broadcasters compete with the corporation .
