program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.07.2003 german press review : wafer thin film of human dignity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the u.s. may have destroyed terrorist structures , but not terrorism itself .
tuesday ’ s german newspapers commented on the continuing violence in iraq , the tentative steps towards peace in the middle east and allegations of police brutality in a trial of a german law student accused on murder . the rheinische post wrote the united states is a country of growing military strength but its reputation in the world is deteriorating .
the americans are hardly facing what they would term a worthy opponent , but across the globe they have become a target for terrorists and guerrillas , the paper stated .
u.s. experts suspect that not iraqis but foreigners are behind the attacks on u.s. troops .
" the three letters ‘ usa ’ generate ill feeling that not infrequently turns into violence .
in afghanistan , the u.s. may have destroyed terrorist structures , but it has not destroyed terrorism , " the paper concluded .
the westfälische anzeiger was optimistic that in spite of all reservations and in the face of some skepticism , it appeared that progress is being made in the middle east peace process .
israel 's prime minister ariel sharon appears to be edging towards compromise , the paper wrote .
it wrote , " the old hard-liner is making some surprisingly diplomatic noises .
rather less surprising is that he is making concessions ahead of his meeting with u.s. president george w. bush .
contrary to their efforts in iraq , the bush administration is displaying some dexterity in dealing with this conflict . "
the paper suggested the palestinians would be well advised to use this to advance the cause of peace .
the sluggish german economy received a welcome boost on monday when a widely-watched industrial barometer showed growing confidence in a recovery this year .
the ifo institute , germany 's best-known economic think-tank , said that its business climate index rose for the third month in succession , moving up to 89.2 points in july from 88.8 points .
the westdeutsche zeitung cautioned about reading too much into the statistics .
there are largely psychological factors at work , it said , and therefore it would be fatal for the german government to lean back and celebrate its tentative steps towards reform as the opening phase of sustained economic recovery .
" hopes for the german economy rise " is the banner headline in the financial times deutschland .
citing the ifo institute , the paper ’ s editorial commented that all of a sudden the german economy is showing signs of life .
the ft then listed what it describes as the relatively good news - the euro slipping against the dollar , the weakening of the union ’ s ability to defend industry-wide agreements after the failure of the ig metall strike in the east and a slight fall in the unemployment rate .
the paper breathed a sigh of relief that germany ’ s ability to halt the bad economic news is justified ; but warned that excitement about the country 's glowing economic potential would be irrational .
increase in german business confidence was however not the main domestic story in the german papers , it was a gruesome murder case .
in frankfurt on monday , law student magnus gäfgen was sentenced to life imprisonment for the kidnapping and murder of jakob von metzler , the eleven-year-old heir to a private banking firm .
the nürnberger nachrichten noted that the defense lawyer for the student had been predicting that his client could be released within three years .
why , the paper asked .
he is speculating that a higher court could declare the investigative proceedings in the run-up to the trial to be null and void because the police threatened to torture gäfgen before they knew his victim was dead .
" but these two aspects of the case , dubious police tactics and the guilt of the accused , should be kept quite separate from one another , " the paper commented .
a german law student who kidnapped and murdered an 11-year-old heir to a private banking firm was sentenced to life imprisonment on monday .
the case stirred controversy after the frankfurt police admitted that they had threatened to use physical force , in other words , torture , to get the suspected murder to reveal the whereabouts of the kidnapped boy , jakob metzler .
the kölner stadtanzeiger made the point that the current debate in germany about relaxing the ban on torture was not triggered by terrorist violence , but by a crime punishable under the conventional penal code .
" it is therefore all the more important we continue to press for the upholding of the ban on torture .
this debate has shown how easily prepared we are to shed the principles of the rule of law , " the paper argued and added , " the protective film under which we keep human dignity safeguarded as a cherished possession has proven itself to be wafer thin .

after a disastrous two years for the german tourism industry , officials are now expressing cautious optimism that the worst has passed .
but the once-thriving industry is still struggling to get back on its feet . the last two years have not been good ones for the travel industry in germany . accustomed to near constant growth , the tourism business has watched its turnover plummet in the face of a whole series of events that kept travellers at home .
the industry was first sent reeling after the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 .
then further terrorist attacks in bali and tunisia , the outbreak of the pulmonary disease sars , and the war in iraq acted like body blows to an industry that was already watching the bottom drop out . but several of germany 's large tour operators are saying a turnaround could be at hand as people slowly begin packing their bags and travelling again .
while none will call the current situation rosy , industry leaders are adding a dash of optimism to their business prognoses . " we 've seen a pickup in our bookings for a good ten weeks , " volker böttcher , managing director of germany 's largest travel concern tui , told reporters in hanover , adding that numbers since may were up from the previous year and that sales volumes were increasing at a healthy rate . despite the new optimism , the tui chief emphasized that the company was far from where it wanted to be .
" of course , we 're not satisfied , since we 're not going to be able to completely make up for last year 's losses this year , " he said . improving , but not good germany 's other major travel operators find themselves in similar situations .
thomas cook , europe 's number two travel company after tui , reported that despite the improving business it would still have to count on significant losses for 2003 , even though stefan pichler , thomas cook 's president , said they would not be as severe as the € 123 million -lrb- $ 142 million -rrb- the company lost in fiscal year 2001/2002 . despite an upturn in bookings since the end of the war in iraq , stefan pichler , thomas cook 's president , said he was counting on a depressed travel market for 2003 overall .

the domestic travel industry looks no different .

more than a third of hoteliers and 42 percent of restaurateurs expect losses this year .

a new toll system goes in effect on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles next month .
the system is the world 's first to use satellite technology to record trucks ' highway mileage and automatically charge tolls . the control bridges are already in place and on-board computers are being frantically installed in trucks throughout germany and beyond .
trucking companies and traffic experts are carefully counting down the days until august 31 , when trucks weighing over 12 tons will be required to pay a per-kilometer charge when they drive on germany 's autobahns . tolls based on distance traveled have long been considered for heavy trucks , since the income could be used to fund rising highway maintenance costs .
the sticking point has been how to institute a workable system without having to construct legions of toll booths along germany 's highways . riding to the rescue is satellite technology , which will work in tandem with small on-board computers installed in heavy trucks that function as drive-along toll station attendants , registering how far the truck has driven along a toll road , calculating the cost and sending it back to a central computer for later billing . satellite positioning under the new system , before starting off , drivers will turn on computers called on-board units -lrb- obu -rrb- which have been provided to them by the toll company .
the activation establishes a linkup with a global positioning satellite in earth 's orbit .
the continuous satellite connection enables the obu to know at all times where the truck is . with the help of street atlas programmed into its memory , the obu begins charging between nine and fourteen cents for every kilometer the truck drives on the highway , depending on the vehicle 's number of axles and emission class .
as soon as the vehicle leaves the highway , the on-board computer automatically stops calculating toll charges . every 100 kilometers , the computer sends an electronic message to a calculation center and vehicle owners are invoiced every month based on the data received . catching the cheaters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 300 " control bridges " -lrb- photo -rrb- now in place along german highways have been equipped with lasers which scan heavy vehicles that pass under them .
the lasers recognize vehicles that are obligated to pay tolls by scanning their outlines .
if the bridge sensors do n't receive a signal from the on-board computer , either because it is not turned on or the driver has n't installed one , a camera takes a picture of the vehicle 's license plate . in addition to the bridges , some 300 cars equipped with the same sensor technology will prowl the highways looking for trucks not following the rules .
toll violators can be charged up to € 20,000 -lrb- $ 23,000 -rrb- . the new german toll system is the first in the world to use satellite technology to monitor traffic .
unlike other systems in place , for example those which use electronic tags to register tolls , the german version does n't require radio beacons along the side of the road to collect information .
traffic planners also avoided the construction of toll stations , which they feared would further tie up germany 's already overburdened autobahn network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the € 500 obu is being provided free of charge by the toll collect , the consortium behind the new system .
however , the installation costs have to be covered by the truck drivers themselves .
installation is not mandatory , but those driving obu-less will be required to stipulate their routes in advance and " buy " them at special terminals being set up at gas stations and truck stops . it 's estimated that there will be some 200,000 toll transactions daily on germany 's 12,000 kilometers of highway , all of which could bring in some € 2.8 billion -lrb- $ 3.2 billion -rrb- a year . foreseeing the glitches as with all new technology , there are concerns that bugs in the system could result in trucking disruptions at the beginning .
the satellite tracking systems and control bridges have passed repeated checks .
the primary concern now is that there will not be enough time to install on-board computers in every truck that wants one .
in order to meet the august 31 start date , some 5,000 obus need to be installed every day .
but according to germany 's freight traffic association , only one percent of heavy trucks actually have appointments to have the units installed . on august 15 , an independent commission investigating the toll system 's introduction will report to germany 's department of transportation whether or not the program can begin as scheduled . " i want to see the program succeed from the beginning , and not start in chaos , " said transportation minister manfred stolpe . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german truck toll runs into eu roadblocks the european commission is scrutinizing berlin ’ s plan to impose a road toll on trucks using german autobahns amid its own proposals to standardize road toll charges throughout the eu . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a new toll system goes in effect on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles next month .
the system is the world 's first to use satellite technology to record trucks ' highway mileage and automatically charge tolls . the control bridges are already in place and on-board computers are being frantically installed in trucks throughout germany and beyond .
trucking companies and traffic experts are carefully counting down the days until august 31 , when trucks weighing over 12 tons will be required to pay a per-kilometer charge when they drive on germany 's autobahns . tolls based on distance traveled have long been considered for heavy trucks , since the income could be used to fund rising highway maintenance costs .
the sticking point has been how to institute a workable system without having to construct legions of toll booths along germany 's highways . riding to the rescue is satellite technology , which will work in tandem with small on-board computers installed in heavy trucks that function as drive-along toll station attendants , registering how far the truck has driven along a toll road , calculating the cost and sending it back to a central computer for later billing . satellite positioning under the new system , before starting off , drivers will turn on computers called on-board units -lrb- obu -rrb- which have been provided to them by the toll company .
the activation establishes a linkup with a global positioning satellite in earth 's orbit .
the continuous satellite connection enables the obu to know at all times where the truck is . with the help of street atlas programmed into its memory , the obu begins charging between nine and fourteen cents for every kilometer the truck drives on the highway , depending on the vehicle 's number of axles and emission class .
as soon as the vehicle leaves the highway , the on-board computer automatically stops calculating toll charges . every 100 kilometers , the computer sends an electronic message to a calculation center and vehicle owners are invoiced every month based on the data received . catching the cheaters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 300 " control bridges " -lrb- photo -rrb- now in place along german highways have been equipped with lasers which scan heavy vehicles that pass under them .

if the bridge sensors do n't receive a signal from the on-board computer , either because it is not turned on or the driver has n't installed one , a camera takes a picture of the vehicle 's license plate . in addition to the bridges , some 300 cars equipped with the same sensor technology will prowl the highways looking for trucks not following the rules .
toll violators can be charged up to € 20,000 -lrb- $ 23,000 -rrb- . the new german toll system is the first in the world to use satellite technology to monitor traffic .
unlike other systems in place , for example those which use electronic tags to register tolls , the german version does n't require radio beacons along the side of the road to collect information .

police threatened to torture a law student declared guilty of killing the 11-year-old son of a banker 's family .
his lawyer says germany 's highest court will overturn the conviction due to the torture threat . a controversial trial came to an end in frankfurt on monday when 28-year-old magnus gäfgen was pronounced guilty of abduction , murder and blackmail .
the law student was sentenced to life in prison for murdering 11-year-old jakob von metzler , the son of a prominent frankfurt banking family .
but the fact that local police squeezed a confession out of gäfgen by threatening to torture him was irrelevant , judge hans bachl told the court . " with the threat of torture the police did grave damage to the rule of law of this country , " bachl said in his concluding statement .
" their guilt , however , has nothing to do with gäfgen 's guilt . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 11-year-old jakob von metzler gäfgen kidnapped jakob von metzler -lrb- photo -rrb- on sept .
27 , 2002 , as the boy was on his way home from school .
the same day he suffocated metzler , he demanded € 1 million from the metzler family for the boy 's release , which they paid .
the police , who had been observing gäfgen for days , arrested him at the frankfurt airport .
while interrogating gäfgen , deputy police president wolfgang daschner threatened to have a martial arts expert hurt the suspect if he did n't reveal where metzler was being held .
gäfgen then told the police where he had hid the child , who was already dead at the time . public controversy the disclosure in late january that daschner had threatened to manhandle gäfgen opened up a public debate about police employing torture , which is illegal in germany and can be punished with up to ten years in prison .
daschner and another policeman were temporarily suspended .
an investigation into the allegations has not yet been completed . on the first day of the trial against gäfgen , in april , the court drew a line under the affair and declared all gäfgen 's previous statements " null and void . "
two days later gäfgen again issued a confession , this time one that the court could accept without the taint of having been forced under the threat of torture . not over yet but gäfgen 's lawyer , hans ulrich endres , said the court 's actions had not resolved the matter .
in his address to the court , he called on it not to highlight the gravity of gäfgen 's crime because of the torture threat .
endres said the court should thus signal to police that they were obliged to observe the letter of the law . judge bachl stressed that the police 's behavior could not minimize gäfgen 's crime .
gäfgen would have most likely been declared guilty of murder even if he had not repeated his confession , the judge said . defense lawyer endres has indicated the matter will not yet be laid to rest .
shortly before the verdict was pronounced he said he would appeal to germany 's highest court , the constitutional court in karlsruhe , to overturn the decision .
" if karlsruhe concedes my point , magnus will be free in three years and he will be entitled to compensation for wrongful imprisonment , " endres told the newsmagazine focus . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : wafer thin film of human dignity tuesday ’ s german newspapers commented on the continuing violence in iraq , the tentative steps towards peace in the middle east and allegations of police brutality in a trial of a german law student accused on murder .

after a disastrous two years for the german tourism industry , officials are now expressing cautious optimism that the worst has passed .
but the once-thriving industry is still struggling to get back on its feet . the last two years have not been good ones for the travel industry in germany . accustomed to near constant growth , the tourism business has watched its turnover plummet in the face of a whole series of events that kept travellers at home .
the industry was first sent reeling after the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 .
then further terrorist attacks in bali and tunisia , the outbreak of the pulmonary disease sars , and the war in iraq acted like body blows to an industry that was already watching the bottom drop out . but several of germany 's large tour operators are saying a turnaround could be at hand as people slowly begin packing their bags and travelling again .
while none will call the current situation rosy , industry leaders are adding a dash of optimism to their business prognoses . " we 've seen a pickup in our bookings for a good ten weeks , " volker böttcher , managing director of germany 's largest travel concern tui , told reporters in hanover , adding that numbers since may were up from the previous year and that sales volumes were increasing at a healthy rate . despite the new optimism , the tui chief emphasized that the company was far from where it wanted to be .
" of course , we 're not satisfied , since we 're not going to be able to completely make up for last year 's losses this year , " he said . improving , but not good germany 's other major travel operators find themselves in similar situations .
thomas cook , europe 's number two travel company after tui , reported that despite the improving business it would still have to count on significant losses for 2003 , even though stefan pichler , thomas cook 's president , said they would not be as severe as the € 123 million -lrb- $ 142 million -rrb- the company lost in fiscal year 2001/2002 . despite an upturn in bookings since the end of the war in iraq , stefan pichler , thomas cook 's president , said he was counting on a depressed travel market for 2003 overall . " right now the industry is at the level it was in 1998 , " he told reporters . pichler has his sights set on 2004 , when he said could the industry could see a substantial pickup in the number of people travelling , from 2.5 to 3 percent . most tour operators seem to have written off summer 2003 entirely .
the domestic travel industry looks no different .
a new report out by the german chambers of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- shows there is still a good deal of pessimism among german restaurant and hotel owners about overall profits this year .
more than a third of hoteliers and 42 percent of restaurateurs expect losses this year . " the combination of the poor economy as well as difficult discussions about taxes and reforms means that the consumers do n't feel like spending on vacations and leisure activities , " said martin wansleben , head of the dihk . winter strategy to lure people back to vacation destinations , tour operators are planning to drastically sink prices this winter season .
germany 's travel giants like tui , neckermann and its are lowering tour package prices by more than ten percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the large operators are also hoping to stem the tide of last-minute vacations , whose popularity has boomed over the past two years .
this year alone , the number of last-minute bookings rose by 70 percent .
these vacation packages , reserved sometimes just days in advance , are less expensive than other options , but earn travel companies little in profit . " you ca n't offer somebody one or two weeks at a high-quality hotel for € 299 or less and think you can make money off of it , " said tui 's böttcher .
" such offers are going to ruin our company sooner or later . " both tui and thomas cook plan on reducing the number of last-minute offers , but at the same time enticing travellers with better incentives to book early .
tui said it will offer customers who plan their vacations in advance savings of up to 25 percent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans opt to stay home amid global uncertainty as u.s.-led military action against iraq continues , the german tourism industry is bracing itself for the effects of a nation turned travel shy .

an exhibition on the disbanded terrorist group red army faction has german politicians up in arms .
despite the organizers ' denials , they say the show is distasteful and will glorify the notorious german guerillas . an exhibition that has n't yet opened its doors or even gotten past the planning stage has sparked outrage and protest in germany .
at the heart of the controversy is the internationally-renowned berlin exhibition hall kunst-werke that has been developing a project focused on the now defunct german terrorist group red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- . the show was initially meant to be called " raf , the myth , " and that seems to be part of the problem .
critics , who include leading politicians like german interior minister otto schily , a former lawyer for raf member gudrun ensslin , have said they fear the exhibition will glorify the terrorist group . " it 's a scandal " " the exhibition should be cancelled without any ifs or buts , " oppostion christian democratic union secretary-general laurenz meyer announced on friday in berlin .
he said it was incomprehensible why the people responsible for the project had not been sensitized to the topic .
the raf was not about " ideals , but about terror and the murder of innocents . " his party colleague rupert scholz condemned the exhibition in even sharper tones .
" an exhibition like the one apparently initiated here is absolutely unacceptable .
in reality , it is a scandal , " he told a radio station . ruthless campaign of killings the red army faction , which had its roots in the radical leftist student movement of the late 1960s , carried out a campaign of killings , robberies and bomb attacks from 1971 to 1993 in germany with the aim of destroying a society they condemned as imperialist and capitalist .
the move starkly polarized west german society still struggling to reconcile its liberal democratic aspirations with its nazi past . leading figures of the extremist group such as andreas baader and ulrike meinhof attracted widespread sympathy from many young people critical of western consumer society and equally trenchant condemnation from an older generation stunned by their ruthless violence . at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businesmen were killed in raf attacks . outrage over the planned exhibition first surfaced when the tabloid bild reported that the berlin senate planned a " scandalous exhibition about the raf " which would be financed with € 100,000 -lrb- $ 125,000 -rrb- in federal funds .
bild said relatives of the raf 's victims had appealed to chancellor gerhard schröder to prevent the exhibition from promoting the myth that already surrounds the group and glorifying it . now the federal center for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- and the hamburg institute for social research , advisors to the exhibition , have said they will only cooperate with the organizers if they meet certain conditions , including consulting with the relatives . an absurd debate but organizers of the exhibition are nonplussed by the furore sparked by it . " i find the debate rather absurd , " the vice president of parliament , antje vollmer , who has been advising the organizers said on thursday .
" throughout the whole process i never had an inkling of a feeling that something could go wrong . " " the project aims to do just what we 're accused of : to allow a historically-grounded assessment of the raf that counteracts glorification and mythologization , " klaus biesenbach , the exhibition 's artistic director told the german news agency dpa . he said pop culture and the media had dealt with the raf in an ambiguous and at times uncritical manner in recent years . the public commotion suggests that it is very important to do this review of a horrible chapter -lrb- of germany 's history -rrb- , said biesenbach . in any case , the controversy has resulted in at least one change : though originally planned for november , it will not open until november 2004 so organizers will have time to consult with the victim 's relatives and figure out how to deal with such a sensitive issue . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german terrorist 's brain will join her body the brain of ulrike meinhof , which has sat in a container with formaldehyde for 26 years following scientific research , will be buried along with her body in a berlin cemetery .

an exhibition on the disbanded terrorist group red army faction has german politicians up in arms .
despite the organizers ' denials , they say the show is distasteful and will glorify the notorious german guerillas . an exhibition that has n't yet opened its doors or even gotten past the planning stage has sparked outrage and protest in germany .
at the heart of the controversy is the internationally-renowned berlin exhibition hall kunst-werke that has been developing a project focused on the now defunct german terrorist group red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- . the show was initially meant to be called " raf , the myth , " and that seems to be part of the problem .
critics , who include leading politicians like german interior minister otto schily , a former lawyer for raf member gudrun ensslin , have said they fear the exhibition will glorify the terrorist group . " it 's a scandal " " the exhibition should be cancelled without any ifs or buts , " oppostion christian democratic union secretary-general laurenz meyer announced on friday in berlin .
he said it was incomprehensible why the people responsible for the project had not been sensitized to the topic .
the raf was not about " ideals , but about terror and the murder of innocents . " his party colleague rupert scholz condemned the exhibition in even sharper tones .
" an exhibition like the one apparently initiated here is absolutely unacceptable .
in reality , it is a scandal , " he told a radio station . ruthless campaign of killings the red army faction , which had its roots in the radical leftist student movement of the late 1960s , carried out a campaign of killings , robberies and bomb attacks from 1971 to 1993 in germany with the aim of destroying a society they condemned as imperialist and capitalist .
the move starkly polarized west german society still struggling to reconcile its liberal democratic aspirations with its nazi past . leading figures of the extremist group such as andreas baader and ulrike meinhof attracted widespread sympathy from many young people critical of western consumer society and equally trenchant condemnation from an older generation stunned by their ruthless violence . at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businesmen were killed in raf attacks . outrage over the planned exhibition first surfaced when the tabloid bild reported that the berlin senate planned a " scandalous exhibition about the raf " which would be financed with € 100,000 -lrb- $ 125,000 -rrb- in federal funds .
bild said relatives of the raf 's victims had appealed to chancellor gerhard schröder to prevent the exhibition from promoting the myth that already surrounds the group and glorifying it . now the federal center for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- and the hamburg institute for social research , advisors to the exhibition , have said they will only cooperate with the organizers if they meet certain conditions , including consulting with the relatives . an absurd debate but organizers of the exhibition are nonplussed by the furore sparked by it . " i find the debate rather absurd , " the vice president of parliament , antje vollmer , who has been advising the organizers said on thursday .
" throughout the whole process i never had an inkling of a feeling that something could go wrong . " " the project aims to do just what we 're accused of : to allow a historically-grounded assessment of the raf that counteracts glorification and mythologization , " klaus biesenbach , the exhibition 's artistic director told the german news agency dpa . he said pop culture and the media had dealt with the raf in an ambiguous and at times uncritical manner in recent years . the public commotion suggests that it is very important to do this review of a horrible chapter -lrb- of germany 's history -rrb- , said biesenbach . in any case , the controversy has resulted in at least one change : though originally planned for november , it will not open until november 2004 so organizers will have time to consult with the victim 's relatives and figure out how to deal with such a sensitive issue . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german terrorist 's brain will join her body the brain of ulrike meinhof , which has sat in a container with formaldehyde for 26 years following scientific research , will be buried along with her body in a berlin cemetery .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.07.2003 big brother on the highway großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no more free ride for trucks on german autobahns .
a new toll system goes in effect on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles next month .
the system is the world 's first to use satellite technology to record trucks ' highway mileage and automatically charge tolls . the control bridges are already in place and on-board computers are being frantically installed in trucks throughout germany and beyond .
trucking companies and traffic experts are carefully counting down the days until august 31 , when trucks weighing over 12 tons will be required to pay a per-kilometer charge when they drive on germany 's autobahns . tolls based on distance traveled have long been considered for heavy trucks , since the income could be used to fund rising highway maintenance costs .
the sticking point has been how to institute a workable system without having to construct legions of toll booths along germany 's highways . riding to the rescue is satellite technology , which will work in tandem with small on-board computers installed in heavy trucks that function as drive-along toll station attendants , registering how far the truck has driven along a toll road , calculating the cost and sending it back to a central computer for later billing . satellite positioning under the new system , before starting off , drivers will turn on computers called on-board units -lrb- obu -rrb- which have been provided to them by the toll company .
the activation establishes a linkup with a global positioning satellite in earth 's orbit .
the continuous satellite connection enables the obu to know at all times where the truck is . with the help of street atlas programmed into its memory , the obu begins charging between nine and fourteen cents for every kilometer the truck drives on the highway , depending on the vehicle 's number of axles and emission class .
as soon as the vehicle leaves the highway , the on-board computer automatically stops calculating toll charges . every 100 kilometers , the computer sends an electronic message to a calculation center and vehicle owners are invoiced every month based on the data received . catching the cheaters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 300 " control bridges " -lrb- photo -rrb- now in place along german highways have been equipped with lasers which scan heavy vehicles that pass under them .
the lasers recognize vehicles that are obligated to pay tolls by scanning their outlines .
if the bridge sensors do n't receive a signal from the on-board computer , either because it is not turned on or the driver has n't installed one , a camera takes a picture of the vehicle 's license plate . in addition to the bridges , some 300 cars equipped with the same sensor technology will prowl the highways looking for trucks not following the rules .
toll violators can be charged up to € 20,000 -lrb- $ 23,000 -rrb- . the new german toll system is the first in the world to use satellite technology to monitor traffic .
unlike other systems in place , for example those which use electronic tags to register tolls , the german version does n't require radio beacons along the side of the road to collect information .
traffic planners also avoided the construction of toll stations , which they feared would further tie up germany 's already overburdened autobahn network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the € 500 obu is being provided free of charge by the toll collect , the consortium behind the new system .
however , the installation costs have to be covered by the truck drivers themselves .
installation is not mandatory , but those driving obu-less will be required to stipulate their routes in advance and " buy " them at special terminals being set up at gas stations and truck stops . it 's estimated that there will be some 200,000 toll transactions daily on germany 's 12,000 kilometers of highway , all of which could bring in some € 2.8 billion -lrb- $ 3.2 billion -rrb- a year . foreseeing the glitches as with all new technology , there are concerns that bugs in the system could result in trucking disruptions at the beginning .
the satellite tracking systems and control bridges have passed repeated checks .
the primary concern now is that there will not be enough time to install on-board computers in every truck that wants one .
in order to meet the august 31 start date , some 5,000 obus need to be installed every day .
but according to germany 's freight traffic association , only one percent of heavy trucks actually have appointments to have the units installed . on august 15 , an independent commission investigating the toll system 's introduction will report to germany 's department of transportation whether or not the program can begin as scheduled . " i want to see the program succeed from the beginning , and not start in chaos , " said transportation minister manfred stolpe . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german truck toll runs into eu roadblocks the european commission is scrutinizing berlin ’ s plan to impose a road toll on trucks using german autobahns amid its own proposals to standardize road toll charges throughout the eu . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

police threatened to torture a law student declared guilty of killing the 11-year-old son of a banker 's family .
his lawyer says germany 's highest court will overturn the conviction due to the torture threat . a controversial trial came to an end in frankfurt on monday when 28-year-old magnus gäfgen was pronounced guilty of abduction , murder and blackmail .
the law student was sentenced to life in prison for murdering 11-year-old jakob von metzler , the son of a prominent frankfurt banking family .
but the fact that local police squeezed a confession out of gäfgen by threatening to torture him was irrelevant , judge hans bachl told the court . " with the threat of torture the police did grave damage to the rule of law of this country , " bachl said in his concluding statement .
" their guilt , however , has nothing to do with gäfgen 's guilt . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 11-year-old jakob von metzler gäfgen kidnapped jakob von metzler -lrb- photo -rrb- on sept .
27 , 2002 , as the boy was on his way home from school .
the same day he suffocated metzler , he demanded € 1 million from the metzler family for the boy 's release , which they paid .
the police , who had been observing gäfgen for days , arrested him at the frankfurt airport .
while interrogating gäfgen , deputy police president wolfgang daschner threatened to have a martial arts expert hurt the suspect if he did n't reveal where metzler was being held .
gäfgen then told the police where he had hid the child , who was already dead at the time . public controversy the disclosure in late january that daschner had threatened to manhandle gäfgen opened up a public debate about police employing torture , which is illegal in germany and can be punished with up to ten years in prison .
daschner and another policeman were temporarily suspended .
an investigation into the allegations has not yet been completed . on the first day of the trial against gäfgen , in april , the court drew a line under the affair and declared all gäfgen 's previous statements " null and void . "
two days later gäfgen again issued a confession , this time one that the court could accept without the taint of having been forced under the threat of torture . not over yet but gäfgen 's lawyer , hans ulrich endres , said the court 's actions had not resolved the matter .
in his address to the court , he called on it not to highlight the gravity of gäfgen 's crime because of the torture threat .
endres said the court should thus signal to police that they were obliged to observe the letter of the law . judge bachl stressed that the police 's behavior could not minimize gäfgen 's crime .
gäfgen would have most likely been declared guilty of murder even if he had not repeated his confession , the judge said . defense lawyer endres has indicated the matter will not yet be laid to rest .
shortly before the verdict was pronounced he said he would appeal to germany 's highest court , the constitutional court in karlsruhe , to overturn the decision .

police threatened to torture a law student declared guilty of killing the 11-year-old son of a banker 's family .
his lawyer says germany 's highest court will overturn the conviction due to the torture threat . a controversial trial came to an end in frankfurt on monday when 28-year-old magnus gäfgen was pronounced guilty of abduction , murder and blackmail .
the law student was sentenced to life in prison for murdering 11-year-old jakob von metzler , the son of a prominent frankfurt banking family .
but the fact that local police squeezed a confession out of gäfgen by threatening to torture him was irrelevant , judge hans bachl told the court . " with the threat of torture the police did grave damage to the rule of law of this country , " bachl said in his concluding statement .
" their guilt , however , has nothing to do with gäfgen 's guilt . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 11-year-old jakob von metzler gäfgen kidnapped jakob von metzler -lrb- photo -rrb- on sept .
27 , 2002 , as the boy was on his way home from school .
the same day he suffocated metzler , he demanded € 1 million from the metzler family for the boy 's release , which they paid .
the police , who had been observing gäfgen for days , arrested him at the frankfurt airport .
while interrogating gäfgen , deputy police president wolfgang daschner threatened to have a martial arts expert hurt the suspect if he did n't reveal where metzler was being held .
gäfgen then told the police where he had hid the child , who was already dead at the time . public controversy the disclosure in late january that daschner had threatened to manhandle gäfgen opened up a public debate about police employing torture , which is illegal in germany and can be punished with up to ten years in prison .
daschner and another policeman were temporarily suspended .
an investigation into the allegations has not yet been completed . on the first day of the trial against gäfgen , in april , the court drew a line under the affair and declared all gäfgen 's previous statements " null and void . "
two days later gäfgen again issued a confession , this time one that the court could accept without the taint of having been forced under the threat of torture . not over yet but gäfgen 's lawyer , hans ulrich endres , said the court 's actions had not resolved the matter .
in his address to the court , he called on it not to highlight the gravity of gäfgen 's crime because of the torture threat .
endres said the court should thus signal to police that they were obliged to observe the letter of the law . judge bachl stressed that the police 's behavior could not minimize gäfgen 's crime .
gäfgen would have most likely been declared guilty of murder even if he had not repeated his confession , the judge said . defense lawyer endres has indicated the matter will not yet be laid to rest .
shortly before the verdict was pronounced he said he would appeal to germany 's highest court , the constitutional court in karlsruhe , to overturn the decision .
" if karlsruhe concedes my point , magnus will be free in three years and he will be entitled to compensation for wrongful imprisonment , " endres told the newsmagazine focus . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : wafer thin film of human dignity tuesday ’ s german newspapers commented on the continuing violence in iraq , the tentative steps towards peace in the middle east and allegations of police brutality in a trial of a german law student accused on murder .

an exhibition on the disbanded terrorist group red army faction has german politicians up in arms .
despite the organizers ' denials , they say the show is distasteful and will glorify the notorious german guerillas . an exhibition that has n't yet opened its doors or even gotten past the planning stage has sparked outrage and protest in germany .
at the heart of the controversy is the internationally-renowned berlin exhibition hall kunst-werke that has been developing a project focused on the now defunct german terrorist group red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- . the show was initially meant to be called " raf , the myth , " and that seems to be part of the problem .
critics , who include leading politicians like german interior minister otto schily , a former lawyer for raf member gudrun ensslin , have said they fear the exhibition will glorify the terrorist group . " it 's a scandal " " the exhibition should be cancelled without any ifs or buts , " oppostion christian democratic union secretary-general laurenz meyer announced on friday in berlin .
he said it was incomprehensible why the people responsible for the project had not been sensitized to the topic .
the raf was not about " ideals , but about terror and the murder of innocents . " his party colleague rupert scholz condemned the exhibition in even sharper tones .
" an exhibition like the one apparently initiated here is absolutely unacceptable .
in reality , it is a scandal , " he told a radio station . ruthless campaign of killings the red army faction , which had its roots in the radical leftist student movement of the late 1960s , carried out a campaign of killings , robberies and bomb attacks from 1971 to 1993 in germany with the aim of destroying a society they condemned as imperialist and capitalist .
the move starkly polarized west german society still struggling to reconcile its liberal democratic aspirations with its nazi past . leading figures of the extremist group such as andreas baader and ulrike meinhof attracted widespread sympathy from many young people critical of western consumer society and equally trenchant condemnation from an older generation stunned by their ruthless violence . at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businesmen were killed in raf attacks . outrage over the planned exhibition first surfaced when the tabloid bild reported that the berlin senate planned a " scandalous exhibition about the raf " which would be financed with € 100,000 -lrb- $ 125,000 -rrb- in federal funds .
bild said relatives of the raf 's victims had appealed to chancellor gerhard schröder to prevent the exhibition from promoting the myth that already surrounds the group and glorifying it . now the federal center for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- and the hamburg institute for social research , advisors to the exhibition , have said they will only cooperate with the organizers if they meet certain conditions , including consulting with the relatives . an absurd debate but organizers of the exhibition are nonplussed by the furore sparked by it . " i find the debate rather absurd , " the vice president of parliament , antje vollmer , who has been advising the organizers said on thursday .
" throughout the whole process i never had an inkling of a feeling that something could go wrong . " " the project aims to do just what we 're accused of : to allow a historically-grounded assessment of the raf that counteracts glorification and mythologization , " klaus biesenbach , the exhibition 's artistic director told the german news agency dpa . he said pop culture and the media had dealt with the raf in an ambiguous and at times uncritical manner in recent years . the public commotion suggests that it is very important to do this review of a horrible chapter -lrb- of germany 's history -rrb- , said biesenbach . in any case , the controversy has resulted in at least one change : though originally planned for november , it will not open until november 2004 so organizers will have time to consult with the victim 's relatives and figure out how to deal with such a sensitive issue . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german terrorist 's brain will join her body the brain of ulrike meinhof , which has sat in a container with formaldehyde for 26 years following scientific research , will be buried along with her body in a berlin cemetery .

tuesday ’ s german newspapers commented on the continuing violence in iraq , the tentative steps towards peace in the middle east and allegations of police brutality in a trial of a german law student accused on murder . the rheinische post wrote the united states is a country of growing military strength but its reputation in the world is deteriorating .
the americans are hardly facing what they would term a worthy opponent , but across the globe they have become a target for terrorists and guerrillas , the paper stated .
u.s. experts suspect that not iraqis but foreigners are behind the attacks on u.s. troops .
" the three letters ‘ usa ’ generate ill feeling that not infrequently turns into violence .
in afghanistan , the u.s. may have destroyed terrorist structures , but it has not destroyed terrorism , " the paper concluded .
the westfälische anzeiger was optimistic that in spite of all reservations and in the face of some skepticism , it appeared that progress is being made in the middle east peace process .
israel 's prime minister ariel sharon appears to be edging towards compromise , the paper wrote .
it wrote , " the old hard-liner is making some surprisingly diplomatic noises .
rather less surprising is that he is making concessions ahead of his meeting with u.s. president george w. bush .
contrary to their efforts in iraq , the bush administration is displaying some dexterity in dealing with this conflict . "
the paper suggested the palestinians would be well advised to use this to advance the cause of peace .
the sluggish german economy received a welcome boost on monday when a widely-watched industrial barometer showed growing confidence in a recovery this year .
the ifo institute , germany 's best-known economic think-tank , said that its business climate index rose for the third month in succession , moving up to 89.2 points in july from 88.8 points .
the westdeutsche zeitung cautioned about reading too much into the statistics .
there are largely psychological factors at work , it said , and therefore it would be fatal for the german government to lean back and celebrate its tentative steps towards reform as the opening phase of sustained economic recovery .
" hopes for the german economy rise " is the banner headline in the financial times deutschland .
citing the ifo institute , the paper ’ s editorial commented that all of a sudden the german economy is showing signs of life .
the ft then listed what it describes as the relatively good news - the euro slipping against the dollar , the weakening of the union ’ s ability to defend industry-wide agreements after the failure of the ig metall strike in the east and a slight fall in the unemployment rate .
the paper breathed a sigh of relief that germany ’ s ability to halt the bad economic news is justified ; but warned that excitement about the country 's glowing economic potential would be irrational .
increase in german business confidence was however not the main domestic story in the german papers , it was a gruesome murder case .
in frankfurt on monday , law student magnus gäfgen was sentenced to life imprisonment for the kidnapping and murder of jakob von metzler , the eleven-year-old heir to a private banking firm .
the nürnberger nachrichten noted that the defense lawyer for the student had been predicting that his client could be released within three years .
why , the paper asked .
he is speculating that a higher court could declare the investigative proceedings in the run-up to the trial to be null and void because the police threatened to torture gäfgen before they knew his victim was dead .
" but these two aspects of the case , dubious police tactics and the guilt of the accused , should be kept quite separate from one another , " the paper commented .
a german law student who kidnapped and murdered an 11-year-old heir to a private banking firm was sentenced to life imprisonment on monday .
the case stirred controversy after the frankfurt police admitted that they had threatened to use physical force , in other words , torture , to get the suspected murder to reveal the whereabouts of the kidnapped boy , jakob metzler .
the kölner stadtanzeiger made the point that the current debate in germany about relaxing the ban on torture was not triggered by terrorist violence , but by a crime punishable under the conventional penal code .
" it is therefore all the more important we continue to press for the upholding of the ban on torture .
this debate has shown how easily prepared we are to shed the principles of the rule of law , " the paper argued and added , " the protective film under which we keep human dignity safeguarded as a cherished possession has proven itself to be wafer thin .

a new toll system goes in effect on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles next month .
the system is the world 's first to use satellite technology to record trucks ' highway mileage and automatically charge tolls . the control bridges are already in place and on-board computers are being frantically installed in trucks throughout germany and beyond .
trucking companies and traffic experts are carefully counting down the days until august 31 , when trucks weighing over 12 tons will be required to pay a per-kilometer charge when they drive on germany 's autobahns . tolls based on distance traveled have long been considered for heavy trucks , since the income could be used to fund rising highway maintenance costs .
the sticking point has been how to institute a workable system without having to construct legions of toll booths along germany 's highways . riding to the rescue is satellite technology , which will work in tandem with small on-board computers installed in heavy trucks that function as drive-along toll station attendants , registering how far the truck has driven along a toll road , calculating the cost and sending it back to a central computer for later billing . satellite positioning under the new system , before starting off , drivers will turn on computers called on-board units -lrb- obu -rrb- which have been provided to them by the toll company .
the activation establishes a linkup with a global positioning satellite in earth 's orbit .
the continuous satellite connection enables the obu to know at all times where the truck is . with the help of street atlas programmed into its memory , the obu begins charging between nine and fourteen cents for every kilometer the truck drives on the highway , depending on the vehicle 's number of axles and emission class .
as soon as the vehicle leaves the highway , the on-board computer automatically stops calculating toll charges . every 100 kilometers , the computer sends an electronic message to a calculation center and vehicle owners are invoiced every month based on the data received . catching the cheaters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 300 " control bridges " -lrb- photo -rrb- now in place along german highways have been equipped with lasers which scan heavy vehicles that pass under them .
the lasers recognize vehicles that are obligated to pay tolls by scanning their outlines .
if the bridge sensors do n't receive a signal from the on-board computer , either because it is not turned on or the driver has n't installed one , a camera takes a picture of the vehicle 's license plate . in addition to the bridges , some 300 cars equipped with the same sensor technology will prowl the highways looking for trucks not following the rules .
toll violators can be charged up to € 20,000 -lrb- $ 23,000 -rrb- . the new german toll system is the first in the world to use satellite technology to monitor traffic .
unlike other systems in place , for example those which use electronic tags to register tolls , the german version does n't require radio beacons along the side of the road to collect information .
traffic planners also avoided the construction of toll stations , which they feared would further tie up germany 's already overburdened autobahn network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the € 500 obu is being provided free of charge by the toll collect , the consortium behind the new system .
however , the installation costs have to be covered by the truck drivers themselves .
installation is not mandatory , but those driving obu-less will be required to stipulate their routes in advance and " buy " them at special terminals being set up at gas stations and truck stops . it 's estimated that there will be some 200,000 toll transactions daily on germany 's 12,000 kilometers of highway , all of which could bring in some € 2.8 billion -lrb- $ 3.2 billion -rrb- a year . foreseeing the glitches as with all new technology , there are concerns that bugs in the system could result in trucking disruptions at the beginning .
the satellite tracking systems and control bridges have passed repeated checks .
the primary concern now is that there will not be enough time to install on-board computers in every truck that wants one .
in order to meet the august 31 start date , some 5,000 obus need to be installed every day .
but according to germany 's freight traffic association , only one percent of heavy trucks actually have appointments to have the units installed . on august 15 , an independent commission investigating the toll system 's introduction will report to germany 's department of transportation whether or not the program can begin as scheduled .

police threatened to torture a law student declared guilty of killing the 11-year-old son of a banker 's family .
his lawyer says germany 's highest court will overturn the conviction due to the torture threat . a controversial trial came to an end in frankfurt on monday when 28-year-old magnus gäfgen was pronounced guilty of abduction , murder and blackmail .
the law student was sentenced to life in prison for murdering 11-year-old jakob von metzler , the son of a prominent frankfurt banking family .
but the fact that local police squeezed a confession out of gäfgen by threatening to torture him was irrelevant , judge hans bachl told the court . " with the threat of torture the police did grave damage to the rule of law of this country , " bachl said in his concluding statement .
" their guilt , however , has nothing to do with gäfgen 's guilt . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 11-year-old jakob von metzler gäfgen kidnapped jakob von metzler -lrb- photo -rrb- on sept .
27 , 2002 , as the boy was on his way home from school .
the same day he suffocated metzler , he demanded € 1 million from the metzler family for the boy 's release , which they paid .
the police , who had been observing gäfgen for days , arrested him at the frankfurt airport .
while interrogating gäfgen , deputy police president wolfgang daschner threatened to have a martial arts expert hurt the suspect if he did n't reveal where metzler was being held .
gäfgen then told the police where he had hid the child , who was already dead at the time . public controversy the disclosure in late january that daschner had threatened to manhandle gäfgen opened up a public debate about police employing torture , which is illegal in germany and can be punished with up to ten years in prison .
daschner and another policeman were temporarily suspended .
an investigation into the allegations has not yet been completed . on the first day of the trial against gäfgen , in april , the court drew a line under the affair and declared all gäfgen 's previous statements " null and void . "
two days later gäfgen again issued a confession , this time one that the court could accept without the taint of having been forced under the threat of torture . not over yet but gäfgen 's lawyer , hans ulrich endres , said the court 's actions had not resolved the matter .
in his address to the court , he called on it not to highlight the gravity of gäfgen 's crime because of the torture threat .
endres said the court should thus signal to police that they were obliged to observe the letter of the law . judge bachl stressed that the police 's behavior could not minimize gäfgen 's crime .
gäfgen would have most likely been declared guilty of murder even if he had not repeated his confession , the judge said . defense lawyer endres has indicated the matter will not yet be laid to rest .
shortly before the verdict was pronounced he said he would appeal to germany 's highest court , the constitutional court in karlsruhe , to overturn the decision .
" if karlsruhe concedes my point , magnus will be free in three years and he will be entitled to compensation for wrongful imprisonment , " endres told the newsmagazine focus . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : wafer thin film of human dignity tuesday ’ s german newspapers commented on the continuing violence in iraq , the tentative steps towards peace in the middle east and allegations of police brutality in a trial of a german law student accused on murder .

after a disastrous two years for the german tourism industry , officials are now expressing cautious optimism that the worst has passed .
but the once-thriving industry is still struggling to get back on its feet . the last two years have not been good ones for the travel industry in germany . accustomed to near constant growth , the tourism business has watched its turnover plummet in the face of a whole series of events that kept travellers at home .
the industry was first sent reeling after the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 .
then further terrorist attacks in bali and tunisia , the outbreak of the pulmonary disease sars , and the war in iraq acted like body blows to an industry that was already watching the bottom drop out . but several of germany 's large tour operators are saying a turnaround could be at hand as people slowly begin packing their bags and travelling again .
while none will call the current situation rosy , industry leaders are adding a dash of optimism to their business prognoses . " we 've seen a pickup in our bookings for a good ten weeks , " volker böttcher , managing director of germany 's largest travel concern tui , told reporters in hanover , adding that numbers since may were up from the previous year and that sales volumes were increasing at a healthy rate . despite the new optimism , the tui chief emphasized that the company was far from where it wanted to be .
" of course , we 're not satisfied , since we 're not going to be able to completely make up for last year 's losses this year , " he said . improving , but not good germany 's other major travel operators find themselves in similar situations .
thomas cook , europe 's number two travel company after tui , reported that despite the improving business it would still have to count on significant losses for 2003 , even though stefan pichler , thomas cook 's president , said they would not be as severe as the € 123 million -lrb- $ 142 million -rrb- the company lost in fiscal year 2001/2002 . despite an upturn in bookings since the end of the war in iraq , stefan pichler , thomas cook 's president , said he was counting on a depressed travel market for 2003 overall . " right now the industry is at the level it was in 1998 , " he told reporters . pichler has his sights set on 2004 , when he said could the industry could see a substantial pickup in the number of people travelling , from 2.5 to 3 percent . most tour operators seem to have written off summer 2003 entirely .
the domestic travel industry looks no different .
a new report out by the german chambers of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- shows there is still a good deal of pessimism among german restaurant and hotel owners about overall profits this year .
more than a third of hoteliers and 42 percent of restaurateurs expect losses this year . " the combination of the poor economy as well as difficult discussions about taxes and reforms means that the consumers do n't feel like spending on vacations and leisure activities , " said martin wansleben , head of the dihk . winter strategy to lure people back to vacation destinations , tour operators are planning to drastically sink prices this winter season .
germany 's travel giants like tui , neckermann and its are lowering tour package prices by more than ten percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the large operators are also hoping to stem the tide of last-minute vacations , whose popularity has boomed over the past two years .
this year alone , the number of last-minute bookings rose by 70 percent .
these vacation packages , reserved sometimes just days in advance , are less expensive than other options , but earn travel companies little in profit . " you ca n't offer somebody one or two weeks at a high-quality hotel for € 299 or less and think you can make money off of it , " said tui 's böttcher .
" such offers are going to ruin our company sooner or later . " both tui and thomas cook plan on reducing the number of last-minute offers , but at the same time enticing travellers with better incentives to book early .
tui said it will offer customers who plan their vacations in advance savings of up to 25 percent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans opt to stay home amid global uncertainty as u.s.-led military action against iraq continues , the german tourism industry is bracing itself for the effects of a nation turned travel shy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.07.2003 big brother on the highway großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no more free ride for trucks on german autobahns .
a new toll system goes in effect on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles next month .
the system is the world 's first to use satellite technology to record trucks ' highway mileage and automatically charge tolls . the control bridges are already in place and on-board computers are being frantically installed in trucks throughout germany and beyond .
trucking companies and traffic experts are carefully counting down the days until august 31 , when trucks weighing over 12 tons will be required to pay a per-kilometer charge when they drive on germany 's autobahns . tolls based on distance traveled have long been considered for heavy trucks , since the income could be used to fund rising highway maintenance costs .
the sticking point has been how to institute a workable system without having to construct legions of toll booths along germany 's highways . riding to the rescue is satellite technology , which will work in tandem with small on-board computers installed in heavy trucks that function as drive-along toll station attendants , registering how far the truck has driven along a toll road , calculating the cost and sending it back to a central computer for later billing . satellite positioning under the new system , before starting off , drivers will turn on computers called on-board units -lrb- obu -rrb- which have been provided to them by the toll company .
the activation establishes a linkup with a global positioning satellite in earth 's orbit .
the continuous satellite connection enables the obu to know at all times where the truck is . with the help of street atlas programmed into its memory , the obu begins charging between nine and fourteen cents for every kilometer the truck drives on the highway , depending on the vehicle 's number of axles and emission class .
as soon as the vehicle leaves the highway , the on-board computer automatically stops calculating toll charges . every 100 kilometers , the computer sends an electronic message to a calculation center and vehicle owners are invoiced every month based on the data received . catching the cheaters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 300 " control bridges " -lrb- photo -rrb- now in place along german highways have been equipped with lasers which scan heavy vehicles that pass under them .
the lasers recognize vehicles that are obligated to pay tolls by scanning their outlines .
if the bridge sensors do n't receive a signal from the on-board computer , either because it is not turned on or the driver has n't installed one , a camera takes a picture of the vehicle 's license plate . in addition to the bridges , some 300 cars equipped with the same sensor technology will prowl the highways looking for trucks not following the rules .
toll violators can be charged up to € 20,000 -lrb- $ 23,000 -rrb- . the new german toll system is the first in the world to use satellite technology to monitor traffic .
unlike other systems in place , for example those which use electronic tags to register tolls , the german version does n't require radio beacons along the side of the road to collect information .
traffic planners also avoided the construction of toll stations , which they feared would further tie up germany 's already overburdened autobahn network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the € 500 obu is being provided free of charge by the toll collect , the consortium behind the new system .
however , the installation costs have to be covered by the truck drivers themselves .
installation is not mandatory , but those driving obu-less will be required to stipulate their routes in advance and " buy " them at special terminals being set up at gas stations and truck stops . it 's estimated that there will be some 200,000 toll transactions daily on germany 's 12,000 kilometers of highway , all of which could bring in some € 2.8 billion -lrb- $ 3.2 billion -rrb- a year . foreseeing the glitches as with all new technology , there are concerns that bugs in the system could result in trucking disruptions at the beginning .
the satellite tracking systems and control bridges have passed repeated checks .
the primary concern now is that there will not be enough time to install on-board computers in every truck that wants one .
in order to meet the august 31 start date , some 5,000 obus need to be installed every day .
but according to germany 's freight traffic association , only one percent of heavy trucks actually have appointments to have the units installed . on august 15 , an independent commission investigating the toll system 's introduction will report to germany 's department of transportation whether or not the program can begin as scheduled . " i want to see the program succeed from the beginning , and not start in chaos , " said transportation minister manfred stolpe . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german truck toll runs into eu roadblocks the european commission is scrutinizing berlin ’ s plan to impose a road toll on trucks using german autobahns amid its own proposals to standardize road toll charges throughout the eu .

after a disastrous two years for the german tourism industry , officials are now expressing cautious optimism that the worst has passed .
but the once-thriving industry is still struggling to get back on its feet . the last two years have not been good ones for the travel industry in germany . accustomed to near constant growth , the tourism business has watched its turnover plummet in the face of a whole series of events that kept travellers at home .
the industry was first sent reeling after the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 .
then further terrorist attacks in bali and tunisia , the outbreak of the pulmonary disease sars , and the war in iraq acted like body blows to an industry that was already watching the bottom drop out . but several of germany 's large tour operators are saying a turnaround could be at hand as people slowly begin packing their bags and travelling again .
while none will call the current situation rosy , industry leaders are adding a dash of optimism to their business prognoses . " we 've seen a pickup in our bookings for a good ten weeks , " volker böttcher , managing director of germany 's largest travel concern tui , told reporters in hanover , adding that numbers since may were up from the previous year and that sales volumes were increasing at a healthy rate . despite the new optimism , the tui chief emphasized that the company was far from where it wanted to be .
" of course , we 're not satisfied , since we 're not going to be able to completely make up for last year 's losses this year , " he said . improving , but not good germany 's other major travel operators find themselves in similar situations .
thomas cook , europe 's number two travel company after tui , reported that despite the improving business it would still have to count on significant losses for 2003 , even though stefan pichler , thomas cook 's president , said they would not be as severe as the € 123 million -lrb- $ 142 million -rrb- the company lost in fiscal year 2001/2002 . despite an upturn in bookings since the end of the war in iraq , stefan pichler , thomas cook 's president , said he was counting on a depressed travel market for 2003 overall . " right now the industry is at the level it was in 1998 , " he told reporters . pichler has his sights set on 2004 , when he said could the industry could see a substantial pickup in the number of people travelling , from 2.5 to 3 percent . most tour operators seem to have written off summer 2003 entirely .
the domestic travel industry looks no different .
a new report out by the german chambers of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- shows there is still a good deal of pessimism among german restaurant and hotel owners about overall profits this year .
more than a third of hoteliers and 42 percent of restaurateurs expect losses this year . " the combination of the poor economy as well as difficult discussions about taxes and reforms means that the consumers do n't feel like spending on vacations and leisure activities , " said martin wansleben , head of the dihk . winter strategy to lure people back to vacation destinations , tour operators are planning to drastically sink prices this winter season .
germany 's travel giants like tui , neckermann and its are lowering tour package prices by more than ten percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the large operators are also hoping to stem the tide of last-minute vacations , whose popularity has boomed over the past two years .
this year alone , the number of last-minute bookings rose by 70 percent .
these vacation packages , reserved sometimes just days in advance , are less expensive than other options , but earn travel companies little in profit . " you ca n't offer somebody one or two weeks at a high-quality hotel for € 299 or less and think you can make money off of it , " said tui 's böttcher .
" such offers are going to ruin our company sooner or later . " both tui and thomas cook plan on reducing the number of last-minute offers , but at the same time enticing travellers with better incentives to book early .
tui said it will offer customers who plan their vacations in advance savings of up to 25 percent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans opt to stay home amid global uncertainty as u.s.-led military action against iraq continues , the german tourism industry is bracing itself for the effects of a nation turned travel shy .

police threatened to torture a law student declared guilty of killing the 11-year-old son of a banker 's family .
his lawyer says germany 's highest court will overturn the conviction due to the torture threat . a controversial trial came to an end in frankfurt on monday when 28-year-old magnus gäfgen was pronounced guilty of abduction , murder and blackmail .
the law student was sentenced to life in prison for murdering 11-year-old jakob von metzler , the son of a prominent frankfurt banking family .
but the fact that local police squeezed a confession out of gäfgen by threatening to torture him was irrelevant , judge hans bachl told the court . " with the threat of torture the police did grave damage to the rule of law of this country , " bachl said in his concluding statement .
" their guilt , however , has nothing to do with gäfgen 's guilt . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 11-year-old jakob von metzler gäfgen kidnapped jakob von metzler -lrb- photo -rrb- on sept .
27 , 2002 , as the boy was on his way home from school .
the same day he suffocated metzler , he demanded € 1 million from the metzler family for the boy 's release , which they paid .
the police , who had been observing gäfgen for days , arrested him at the frankfurt airport .
while interrogating gäfgen , deputy police president wolfgang daschner threatened to have a martial arts expert hurt the suspect if he did n't reveal where metzler was being held .
gäfgen then told the police where he had hid the child , who was already dead at the time . public controversy the disclosure in late january that daschner had threatened to manhandle gäfgen opened up a public debate about police employing torture , which is illegal in germany and can be punished with up to ten years in prison .
daschner and another policeman were temporarily suspended .
an investigation into the allegations has not yet been completed . on the first day of the trial against gäfgen , in april , the court drew a line under the affair and declared all gäfgen 's previous statements " null and void . "
two days later gäfgen again issued a confession , this time one that the court could accept without the taint of having been forced under the threat of torture . not over yet but gäfgen 's lawyer , hans ulrich endres , said the court 's actions had not resolved the matter .
in his address to the court , he called on it not to highlight the gravity of gäfgen 's crime because of the torture threat .
endres said the court should thus signal to police that they were obliged to observe the letter of the law . judge bachl stressed that the police 's behavior could not minimize gäfgen 's crime .
gäfgen would have most likely been declared guilty of murder even if he had not repeated his confession , the judge said . defense lawyer endres has indicated the matter will not yet be laid to rest .
shortly before the verdict was pronounced he said he would appeal to germany 's highest court , the constitutional court in karlsruhe , to overturn the decision .

an exhibition on the disbanded terrorist group red army faction has german politicians up in arms .
despite the organizers ' denials , they say the show is distasteful and will glorify the notorious german guerillas . an exhibition that has n't yet opened its doors or even gotten past the planning stage has sparked outrage and protest in germany .
at the heart of the controversy is the internationally-renowned berlin exhibition hall kunst-werke that has been developing a project focused on the now defunct german terrorist group red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- . the show was initially meant to be called " raf , the myth , " and that seems to be part of the problem .
critics , who include leading politicians like german interior minister otto schily , a former lawyer for raf member gudrun ensslin , have said they fear the exhibition will glorify the terrorist group . " it 's a scandal " " the exhibition should be cancelled without any ifs or buts , " oppostion christian democratic union secretary-general laurenz meyer announced on friday in berlin .
he said it was incomprehensible why the people responsible for the project had not been sensitized to the topic .
the raf was not about " ideals , but about terror and the murder of innocents . " his party colleague rupert scholz condemned the exhibition in even sharper tones .
" an exhibition like the one apparently initiated here is absolutely unacceptable .
in reality , it is a scandal , " he told a radio station . ruthless campaign of killings the red army faction , which had its roots in the radical leftist student movement of the late 1960s , carried out a campaign of killings , robberies and bomb attacks from 1971 to 1993 in germany with the aim of destroying a society they condemned as imperialist and capitalist .
the move starkly polarized west german society still struggling to reconcile its liberal democratic aspirations with its nazi past . leading figures of the extremist group such as andreas baader and ulrike meinhof attracted widespread sympathy from many young people critical of western consumer society and equally trenchant condemnation from an older generation stunned by their ruthless violence . at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businesmen were killed in raf attacks . outrage over the planned exhibition first surfaced when the tabloid bild reported that the berlin senate planned a " scandalous exhibition about the raf " which would be financed with € 100,000 -lrb- $ 125,000 -rrb- in federal funds .
bild said relatives of the raf 's victims had appealed to chancellor gerhard schröder to prevent the exhibition from promoting the myth that already surrounds the group and glorifying it . now the federal center for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- and the hamburg institute for social research , advisors to the exhibition , have said they will only cooperate with the organizers if they meet certain conditions , including consulting with the relatives . an absurd debate but organizers of the exhibition are nonplussed by the furore sparked by it . " i find the debate rather absurd , " the vice president of parliament , antje vollmer , who has been advising the organizers said on thursday .
" throughout the whole process i never had an inkling of a feeling that something could go wrong . " " the project aims to do just what we 're accused of : to allow a historically-grounded assessment of the raf that counteracts glorification and mythologization , " klaus biesenbach , the exhibition 's artistic director told the german news agency dpa . he said pop culture and the media had dealt with the raf in an ambiguous and at times uncritical manner in recent years . the public commotion suggests that it is very important to do this review of a horrible chapter -lrb- of germany 's history -rrb- , said biesenbach . in any case , the controversy has resulted in at least one change : though originally planned for november , it will not open until november 2004 so organizers will have time to consult with the victim 's relatives and figure out how to deal with such a sensitive issue . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german terrorist 's brain will join her body the brain of ulrike meinhof , which has sat in a container with formaldehyde for 26 years following scientific research , will be buried along with her body in a berlin cemetery .

tuesday ’ s german newspapers commented on the continuing violence in iraq , the tentative steps towards peace in the middle east and allegations of police brutality in a trial of a german law student accused on murder . the rheinische post wrote the united states is a country of growing military strength but its reputation in the world is deteriorating .
the americans are hardly facing what they would term a worthy opponent , but across the globe they have become a target for terrorists and guerrillas , the paper stated .
u.s. experts suspect that not iraqis but foreigners are behind the attacks on u.s. troops .
" the three letters ‘ usa ’ generate ill feeling that not infrequently turns into violence .
in afghanistan , the u.s. may have destroyed terrorist structures , but it has not destroyed terrorism , " the paper concluded .
the westfälische anzeiger was optimistic that in spite of all reservations and in the face of some skepticism , it appeared that progress is being made in the middle east peace process .
israel 's prime minister ariel sharon appears to be edging towards compromise , the paper wrote .
it wrote , " the old hard-liner is making some surprisingly diplomatic noises .
rather less surprising is that he is making concessions ahead of his meeting with u.s. president george w. bush .
contrary to their efforts in iraq , the bush administration is displaying some dexterity in dealing with this conflict . "
the paper suggested the palestinians would be well advised to use this to advance the cause of peace .
the sluggish german economy received a welcome boost on monday when a widely-watched industrial barometer showed growing confidence in a recovery this year .
the ifo institute , germany 's best-known economic think-tank , said that its business climate index rose for the third month in succession , moving up to 89.2 points in july from 88.8 points .
the westdeutsche zeitung cautioned about reading too much into the statistics .
there are largely psychological factors at work , it said , and therefore it would be fatal for the german government to lean back and celebrate its tentative steps towards reform as the opening phase of sustained economic recovery .
" hopes for the german economy rise " is the banner headline in the financial times deutschland .
citing the ifo institute , the paper ’ s editorial commented that all of a sudden the german economy is showing signs of life .
the ft then listed what it describes as the relatively good news - the euro slipping against the dollar , the weakening of the union ’ s ability to defend industry-wide agreements after the failure of the ig metall strike in the east and a slight fall in the unemployment rate .
the paper breathed a sigh of relief that germany ’ s ability to halt the bad economic news is justified ; but warned that excitement about the country 's glowing economic potential would be irrational .
increase in german business confidence was however not the main domestic story in the german papers , it was a gruesome murder case .
in frankfurt on monday , law student magnus gäfgen was sentenced to life imprisonment for the kidnapping and murder of jakob von metzler , the eleven-year-old heir to a private banking firm .
the nürnberger nachrichten noted that the defense lawyer for the student had been predicting that his client could be released within three years .
why , the paper asked .
he is speculating that a higher court could declare the investigative proceedings in the run-up to the trial to be null and void because the police threatened to torture gäfgen before they knew his victim was dead .
" but these two aspects of the case , dubious police tactics and the guilt of the accused , should be kept quite separate from one another , " the paper commented .
a german law student who kidnapped and murdered an 11-year-old heir to a private banking firm was sentenced to life imprisonment on monday .
the case stirred controversy after the frankfurt police admitted that they had threatened to use physical force , in other words , torture , to get the suspected murder to reveal the whereabouts of the kidnapped boy , jakob metzler .
the kölner stadtanzeiger made the point that the current debate in germany about relaxing the ban on torture was not triggered by terrorist violence , but by a crime punishable under the conventional penal code .
" it is therefore all the more important we continue to press for the upholding of the ban on torture .
this debate has shown how easily prepared we are to shed the principles of the rule of law , " the paper argued and added , " the protective film under which we keep human dignity safeguarded as a cherished possession has proven itself to be wafer thin .

a new toll system goes in effect on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles next month .
the system is the world 's first to use satellite technology to record trucks ' highway mileage and automatically charge tolls . the control bridges are already in place and on-board computers are being frantically installed in trucks throughout germany and beyond .
trucking companies and traffic experts are carefully counting down the days until august 31 , when trucks weighing over 12 tons will be required to pay a per-kilometer charge when they drive on germany 's autobahns . tolls based on distance traveled have long been considered for heavy trucks , since the income could be used to fund rising highway maintenance costs .
the sticking point has been how to institute a workable system without having to construct legions of toll booths along germany 's highways . riding to the rescue is satellite technology , which will work in tandem with small on-board computers installed in heavy trucks that function as drive-along toll station attendants , registering how far the truck has driven along a toll road , calculating the cost and sending it back to a central computer for later billing . satellite positioning under the new system , before starting off , drivers will turn on computers called on-board units -lrb- obu -rrb- which have been provided to them by the toll company .
the activation establishes a linkup with a global positioning satellite in earth 's orbit .
the continuous satellite connection enables the obu to know at all times where the truck is . with the help of street atlas programmed into its memory , the obu begins charging between nine and fourteen cents for every kilometer the truck drives on the highway , depending on the vehicle 's number of axles and emission class .
as soon as the vehicle leaves the highway , the on-board computer automatically stops calculating toll charges . every 100 kilometers , the computer sends an electronic message to a calculation center and vehicle owners are invoiced every month based on the data received . catching the cheaters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 300 " control bridges " -lrb- photo -rrb- now in place along german highways have been equipped with lasers which scan heavy vehicles that pass under them .
the lasers recognize vehicles that are obligated to pay tolls by scanning their outlines .
if the bridge sensors do n't receive a signal from the on-board computer , either because it is not turned on or the driver has n't installed one , a camera takes a picture of the vehicle 's license plate . in addition to the bridges , some 300 cars equipped with the same sensor technology will prowl the highways looking for trucks not following the rules .
toll violators can be charged up to € 20,000 -lrb- $ 23,000 -rrb- . the new german toll system is the first in the world to use satellite technology to monitor traffic .
unlike other systems in place , for example those which use electronic tags to register tolls , the german version does n't require radio beacons along the side of the road to collect information .
traffic planners also avoided the construction of toll stations , which they feared would further tie up germany 's already overburdened autobahn network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the € 500 obu is being provided free of charge by the toll collect , the consortium behind the new system .
however , the installation costs have to be covered by the truck drivers themselves .
installation is not mandatory , but those driving obu-less will be required to stipulate their routes in advance and " buy " them at special terminals being set up at gas stations and truck stops . it 's estimated that there will be some 200,000 toll transactions daily on germany 's 12,000 kilometers of highway , all of which could bring in some € 2.8 billion -lrb- $ 3.2 billion -rrb- a year . foreseeing the glitches as with all new technology , there are concerns that bugs in the system could result in trucking disruptions at the beginning .
the satellite tracking systems and control bridges have passed repeated checks .
the primary concern now is that there will not be enough time to install on-board computers in every truck that wants one .
in order to meet the august 31 start date , some 5,000 obus need to be installed every day .
but according to germany 's freight traffic association , only one percent of heavy trucks actually have appointments to have the units installed . on august 15 , an independent commission investigating the toll system 's introduction will report to germany 's department of transportation whether or not the program can begin as scheduled .

police threatened to torture a law student declared guilty of killing the 11-year-old son of a banker 's family .
his lawyer says germany 's highest court will overturn the conviction due to the torture threat . a controversial trial came to an end in frankfurt on monday when 28-year-old magnus gäfgen was pronounced guilty of abduction , murder and blackmail .
the law student was sentenced to life in prison for murdering 11-year-old jakob von metzler , the son of a prominent frankfurt banking family .
but the fact that local police squeezed a confession out of gäfgen by threatening to torture him was irrelevant , judge hans bachl told the court . " with the threat of torture the police did grave damage to the rule of law of this country , " bachl said in his concluding statement .

the same day he suffocated metzler , he demanded € 1 million from the metzler family for the boy 's release , which they paid .
the police , who had been observing gäfgen for days , arrested him at the frankfurt airport .
while interrogating gäfgen , deputy police president wolfgang daschner threatened to have a martial arts expert hurt the suspect if he did n't reveal where metzler was being held .
gäfgen then told the police where he had hid the child , who was already dead at the time . public controversy the disclosure in late january that daschner had threatened to manhandle gäfgen opened up a public debate about police employing torture , which is illegal in germany and can be punished with up to ten years in prison .
daschner and another policeman were temporarily suspended .
an investigation into the allegations has not yet been completed . on the first day of the trial against gäfgen , in april , the court drew a line under the affair and declared all gäfgen 's previous statements " null and void . "
two days later gäfgen again issued a confession , this time one that the court could accept without the taint of having been forced under the threat of torture . not over yet but gäfgen 's lawyer , hans ulrich endres , said the court 's actions had not resolved the matter .
in his address to the court , he called on it not to highlight the gravity of gäfgen 's crime because of the torture threat .
endres said the court should thus signal to police that they were obliged to observe the letter of the law . judge bachl stressed that the police 's behavior could not minimize gäfgen 's crime .
gäfgen would have most likely been declared guilty of murder even if he had not repeated his confession , the judge said . defense lawyer endres has indicated the matter will not yet be laid to rest .
shortly before the verdict was pronounced he said he would appeal to germany 's highest court , the constitutional court in karlsruhe , to overturn the decision .

after a disastrous two years for the german tourism industry , officials are now expressing cautious optimism that the worst has passed .
but the once-thriving industry is still struggling to get back on its feet . the last two years have not been good ones for the travel industry in germany . accustomed to near constant growth , the tourism business has watched its turnover plummet in the face of a whole series of events that kept travellers at home .
the industry was first sent reeling after the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 .
then further terrorist attacks in bali and tunisia , the outbreak of the pulmonary disease sars , and the war in iraq acted like body blows to an industry that was already watching the bottom drop out . but several of germany 's large tour operators are saying a turnaround could be at hand as people slowly begin packing their bags and travelling again .
while none will call the current situation rosy , industry leaders are adding a dash of optimism to their business prognoses . " we 've seen a pickup in our bookings for a good ten weeks , " volker böttcher , managing director of germany 's largest travel concern tui , told reporters in hanover , adding that numbers since may were up from the previous year and that sales volumes were increasing at a healthy rate . despite the new optimism , the tui chief emphasized that the company was far from where it wanted to be .
" of course , we 're not satisfied , since we 're not going to be able to completely make up for last year 's losses this year , " he said . improving , but not good germany 's other major travel operators find themselves in similar situations .

" right now the industry is at the level it was in 1998 , " he told reporters . pichler has his sights set on 2004 , when he said could the industry could see a substantial pickup in the number of people travelling , from 2.5 to 3 percent . most tour operators seem to have written off summer 2003 entirely .

a new report out by the german chambers of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- shows there is still a good deal of pessimism among german restaurant and hotel owners about overall profits this year .
more than a third of hoteliers and 42 percent of restaurateurs expect losses this year . " the combination of the poor economy as well as difficult discussions about taxes and reforms means that the consumers do n't feel like spending on vacations and leisure activities , " said martin wansleben , head of the dihk . winter strategy to lure people back to vacation destinations , tour operators are planning to drastically sink prices this winter season .
germany 's travel giants like tui , neckermann and its are lowering tour package prices by more than ten percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the large operators are also hoping to stem the tide of last-minute vacations , whose popularity has boomed over the past two years .
this year alone , the number of last-minute bookings rose by 70 percent .

" you ca n't offer somebody one or two weeks at a high-quality hotel for € 299 or less and think you can make money off of it , " said tui 's böttcher .
" such offers are going to ruin our company sooner or later . " both tui and thomas cook plan on reducing the number of last-minute offers , but at the same time enticing travellers with better incentives to book early .

an exhibition on the disbanded terrorist group red army faction has german politicians up in arms .
despite the organizers ' denials , they say the show is distasteful and will glorify the notorious german guerillas . an exhibition that has n't yet opened its doors or even gotten past the planning stage has sparked outrage and protest in germany .
at the heart of the controversy is the internationally-renowned berlin exhibition hall kunst-werke that has been developing a project focused on the now defunct german terrorist group red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- . the show was initially meant to be called " raf , the myth , " and that seems to be part of the problem .
critics , who include leading politicians like german interior minister otto schily , a former lawyer for raf member gudrun ensslin , have said they fear the exhibition will glorify the terrorist group . " it 's a scandal " " the exhibition should be cancelled without any ifs or buts , " oppostion christian democratic union secretary-general laurenz meyer announced on friday in berlin .
he said it was incomprehensible why the people responsible for the project had not been sensitized to the topic .
the raf was not about " ideals , but about terror and the murder of innocents . " his party colleague rupert scholz condemned the exhibition in even sharper tones .
" an exhibition like the one apparently initiated here is absolutely unacceptable .
in reality , it is a scandal , " he told a radio station . ruthless campaign of killings the red army faction , which had its roots in the radical leftist student movement of the late 1960s , carried out a campaign of killings , robberies and bomb attacks from 1971 to 1993 in germany with the aim of destroying a society they condemned as imperialist and capitalist .
the move starkly polarized west german society still struggling to reconcile its liberal democratic aspirations with its nazi past . leading figures of the extremist group such as andreas baader and ulrike meinhof attracted widespread sympathy from many young people critical of western consumer society and equally trenchant condemnation from an older generation stunned by their ruthless violence . at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businesmen were killed in raf attacks . outrage over the planned exhibition first surfaced when the tabloid bild reported that the berlin senate planned a " scandalous exhibition about the raf " which would be financed with € 100,000 -lrb- $ 125,000 -rrb- in federal funds .
bild said relatives of the raf 's victims had appealed to chancellor gerhard schröder to prevent the exhibition from promoting the myth that already surrounds the group and glorifying it . now the federal center for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- and the hamburg institute for social research , advisors to the exhibition , have said they will only cooperate with the organizers if they meet certain conditions , including consulting with the relatives . an absurd debate but organizers of the exhibition are nonplussed by the furore sparked by it . " i find the debate rather absurd , " the vice president of parliament , antje vollmer , who has been advising the organizers said on thursday .
" throughout the whole process i never had an inkling of a feeling that something could go wrong . " " the project aims to do just what we 're accused of : to allow a historically-grounded assessment of the raf that counteracts glorification and mythologization , " klaus biesenbach , the exhibition 's artistic director told the german news agency dpa . he said pop culture and the media had dealt with the raf in an ambiguous and at times uncritical manner in recent years . the public commotion suggests that it is very important to do this review of a horrible chapter -lrb- of germany 's history -rrb- , said biesenbach . in any case , the controversy has resulted in at least one change : though originally planned for november , it will not open until november 2004 so organizers will have time to consult with the victim 's relatives and figure out how to deal with such a sensitive issue . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german terrorist 's brain will join her body the brain of ulrike meinhof , which has sat in a container with formaldehyde for 26 years following scientific research , will be buried along with her body in a berlin cemetery .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.07.2003 planned german terror exhibition triggers outrage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf killed at least 30 people including head of the german employers federation hans-martin schleyer .
an exhibition on the disbanded terrorist group red army faction has german politicians up in arms .
despite the organizers ' denials , they say the show is distasteful and will glorify the notorious german guerillas . an exhibition that has n't yet opened its doors or even gotten past the planning stage has sparked outrage and protest in germany .
at the heart of the controversy is the internationally-renowned berlin exhibition hall kunst-werke that has been developing a project focused on the now defunct german terrorist group red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- . the show was initially meant to be called " raf , the myth , " and that seems to be part of the problem .
critics , who include leading politicians like german interior minister otto schily , a former lawyer for raf member gudrun ensslin , have said they fear the exhibition will glorify the terrorist group . " it 's a scandal " " the exhibition should be cancelled without any ifs or buts , " oppostion christian democratic union secretary-general laurenz meyer announced on friday in berlin .
he said it was incomprehensible why the people responsible for the project had not been sensitized to the topic .
the raf was not about " ideals , but about terror and the murder of innocents . " his party colleague rupert scholz condemned the exhibition in even sharper tones .
" an exhibition like the one apparently initiated here is absolutely unacceptable .
in reality , it is a scandal , " he told a radio station . ruthless campaign of killings the red army faction , which had its roots in the radical leftist student movement of the late 1960s , carried out a campaign of killings , robberies and bomb attacks from 1971 to 1993 in germany with the aim of destroying a society they condemned as imperialist and capitalist .
the move starkly polarized west german society still struggling to reconcile its liberal democratic aspirations with its nazi past . leading figures of the extremist group such as andreas baader and ulrike meinhof attracted widespread sympathy from many young people critical of western consumer society and equally trenchant condemnation from an older generation stunned by their ruthless violence . at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businesmen were killed in raf attacks . outrage over the planned exhibition first surfaced when the tabloid bild reported that the berlin senate planned a " scandalous exhibition about the raf " which would be financed with € 100,000 -lrb- $ 125,000 -rrb- in federal funds .
bild said relatives of the raf 's victims had appealed to chancellor gerhard schröder to prevent the exhibition from promoting the myth that already surrounds the group and glorifying it . now the federal center for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- and the hamburg institute for social research , advisors to the exhibition , have said they will only cooperate with the organizers if they meet certain conditions , including consulting with the relatives . an absurd debate but organizers of the exhibition are nonplussed by the furore sparked by it . " i find the debate rather absurd , " the vice president of parliament , antje vollmer , who has been advising the organizers said on thursday .
" throughout the whole process i never had an inkling of a feeling that something could go wrong . " " the project aims to do just what we 're accused of : to allow a historically-grounded assessment of the raf that counteracts glorification and mythologization , " klaus biesenbach , the exhibition 's artistic director told the german news agency dpa . he said pop culture and the media had dealt with the raf in an ambiguous and at times uncritical manner in recent years . the public commotion suggests that it is very important to do this review of a horrible chapter -lrb- of germany 's history -rrb- , said biesenbach . in any case , the controversy has resulted in at least one change : though originally planned for november , it will not open until november 2004 so organizers will have time to consult with the victim 's relatives and figure out how to deal with such a sensitive issue . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german terrorist 's brain will join her body the brain of ulrike meinhof , which has sat in a container with formaldehyde for 26 years following scientific research , will be buried along with her body in a berlin cemetery .

a new toll system goes in effect on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles next month .
the system is the world 's first to use satellite technology to record trucks ' highway mileage and automatically charge tolls . the control bridges are already in place and on-board computers are being frantically installed in trucks throughout germany and beyond .
trucking companies and traffic experts are carefully counting down the days until august 31 , when trucks weighing over 12 tons will be required to pay a per-kilometer charge when they drive on germany 's autobahns . tolls based on distance traveled have long been considered for heavy trucks , since the income could be used to fund rising highway maintenance costs .
the sticking point has been how to institute a workable system without having to construct legions of toll booths along germany 's highways . riding to the rescue is satellite technology , which will work in tandem with small on-board computers installed in heavy trucks that function as drive-along toll station attendants , registering how far the truck has driven along a toll road , calculating the cost and sending it back to a central computer for later billing . satellite positioning under the new system , before starting off , drivers will turn on computers called on-board units -lrb- obu -rrb- which have been provided to them by the toll company .
the activation establishes a linkup with a global positioning satellite in earth 's orbit .
the continuous satellite connection enables the obu to know at all times where the truck is . with the help of street atlas programmed into its memory , the obu begins charging between nine and fourteen cents for every kilometer the truck drives on the highway , depending on the vehicle 's number of axles and emission class .
as soon as the vehicle leaves the highway , the on-board computer automatically stops calculating toll charges . every 100 kilometers , the computer sends an electronic message to a calculation center and vehicle owners are invoiced every month based on the data received . catching the cheaters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 300 " control bridges " -lrb- photo -rrb- now in place along german highways have been equipped with lasers which scan heavy vehicles that pass under them .
the lasers recognize vehicles that are obligated to pay tolls by scanning their outlines .
if the bridge sensors do n't receive a signal from the on-board computer , either because it is not turned on or the driver has n't installed one , a camera takes a picture of the vehicle 's license plate . in addition to the bridges , some 300 cars equipped with the same sensor technology will prowl the highways looking for trucks not following the rules .
toll violators can be charged up to € 20,000 -lrb- $ 23,000 -rrb- . the new german toll system is the first in the world to use satellite technology to monitor traffic .
unlike other systems in place , for example those which use electronic tags to register tolls , the german version does n't require radio beacons along the side of the road to collect information .
traffic planners also avoided the construction of toll stations , which they feared would further tie up germany 's already overburdened autobahn network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the € 500 obu is being provided free of charge by the toll collect , the consortium behind the new system .
however , the installation costs have to be covered by the truck drivers themselves .
installation is not mandatory , but those driving obu-less will be required to stipulate their routes in advance and " buy " them at special terminals being set up at gas stations and truck stops . it 's estimated that there will be some 200,000 toll transactions daily on germany 's 12,000 kilometers of highway , all of which could bring in some € 2.8 billion -lrb- $ 3.2 billion -rrb- a year . foreseeing the glitches as with all new technology , there are concerns that bugs in the system could result in trucking disruptions at the beginning .
the satellite tracking systems and control bridges have passed repeated checks .
the primary concern now is that there will not be enough time to install on-board computers in every truck that wants one .
in order to meet the august 31 start date , some 5,000 obus need to be installed every day .
but according to germany 's freight traffic association , only one percent of heavy trucks actually have appointments to have the units installed . on august 15 , an independent commission investigating the toll system 's introduction will report to germany 's department of transportation whether or not the program can begin as scheduled .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.07.2003 german press review : wafer thin film of human dignity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the u.s. may have destroyed terrorist structures , but not terrorism itself .
tuesday ’ s german newspapers commented on the continuing violence in iraq , the tentative steps towards peace in the middle east and allegations of police brutality in a trial of a german law student accused on murder . the rheinische post wrote the united states is a country of growing military strength but its reputation in the world is deteriorating .
the americans are hardly facing what they would term a worthy opponent , but across the globe they have become a target for terrorists and guerrillas , the paper stated .
u.s. experts suspect that not iraqis but foreigners are behind the attacks on u.s. troops .
" the three letters ‘ usa ’ generate ill feeling that not infrequently turns into violence .
in afghanistan , the u.s. may have destroyed terrorist structures , but it has not destroyed terrorism , " the paper concluded .
the westfälische anzeiger was optimistic that in spite of all reservations and in the face of some skepticism , it appeared that progress is being made in the middle east peace process .
israel 's prime minister ariel sharon appears to be edging towards compromise , the paper wrote .
it wrote , " the old hard-liner is making some surprisingly diplomatic noises .
rather less surprising is that he is making concessions ahead of his meeting with u.s. president george w. bush .
contrary to their efforts in iraq , the bush administration is displaying some dexterity in dealing with this conflict . "
the paper suggested the palestinians would be well advised to use this to advance the cause of peace .
the sluggish german economy received a welcome boost on monday when a widely-watched industrial barometer showed growing confidence in a recovery this year .
the ifo institute , germany 's best-known economic think-tank , said that its business climate index rose for the third month in succession , moving up to 89.2 points in july from 88.8 points .
the westdeutsche zeitung cautioned about reading too much into the statistics .
there are largely psychological factors at work , it said , and therefore it would be fatal for the german government to lean back and celebrate its tentative steps towards reform as the opening phase of sustained economic recovery .
" hopes for the german economy rise " is the banner headline in the financial times deutschland .
citing the ifo institute , the paper ’ s editorial commented that all of a sudden the german economy is showing signs of life .
the ft then listed what it describes as the relatively good news - the euro slipping against the dollar , the weakening of the union ’ s ability to defend industry-wide agreements after the failure of the ig metall strike in the east and a slight fall in the unemployment rate .
the paper breathed a sigh of relief that germany ’ s ability to halt the bad economic news is justified ; but warned that excitement about the country 's glowing economic potential would be irrational .
increase in german business confidence was however not the main domestic story in the german papers , it was a gruesome murder case .
in frankfurt on monday , law student magnus gäfgen was sentenced to life imprisonment for the kidnapping and murder of jakob von metzler , the eleven-year-old heir to a private banking firm .
the nürnberger nachrichten noted that the defense lawyer for the student had been predicting that his client could be released within three years .
why , the paper asked .
he is speculating that a higher court could declare the investigative proceedings in the run-up to the trial to be null and void because the police threatened to torture gäfgen before they knew his victim was dead .
" but these two aspects of the case , dubious police tactics and the guilt of the accused , should be kept quite separate from one another , " the paper commented .
a german law student who kidnapped and murdered an 11-year-old heir to a private banking firm was sentenced to life imprisonment on monday .
the case stirred controversy after the frankfurt police admitted that they had threatened to use physical force , in other words , torture , to get the suspected murder to reveal the whereabouts of the kidnapped boy , jakob metzler .
the kölner stadtanzeiger made the point that the current debate in germany about relaxing the ban on torture was not triggered by terrorist violence , but by a crime punishable under the conventional penal code .
" it is therefore all the more important we continue to press for the upholding of the ban on torture .
this debate has shown how easily prepared we are to shed the principles of the rule of law , " the paper argued and added , " the protective film under which we keep human dignity safeguarded as a cherished possession has proven itself to be wafer thin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.07.2003 big brother on the highway großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no more free ride for trucks on german autobahns .
a new toll system goes in effect on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles next month .
the system is the world 's first to use satellite technology to record trucks ' highway mileage and automatically charge tolls . the control bridges are already in place and on-board computers are being frantically installed in trucks throughout germany and beyond .
trucking companies and traffic experts are carefully counting down the days until august 31 , when trucks weighing over 12 tons will be required to pay a per-kilometer charge when they drive on germany 's autobahns . tolls based on distance traveled have long been considered for heavy trucks , since the income could be used to fund rising highway maintenance costs .
the sticking point has been how to institute a workable system without having to construct legions of toll booths along germany 's highways . riding to the rescue is satellite technology , which will work in tandem with small on-board computers installed in heavy trucks that function as drive-along toll station attendants , registering how far the truck has driven along a toll road , calculating the cost and sending it back to a central computer for later billing . satellite positioning under the new system , before starting off , drivers will turn on computers called on-board units -lrb- obu -rrb- which have been provided to them by the toll company .
the activation establishes a linkup with a global positioning satellite in earth 's orbit .
the continuous satellite connection enables the obu to know at all times where the truck is . with the help of street atlas programmed into its memory , the obu begins charging between nine and fourteen cents for every kilometer the truck drives on the highway , depending on the vehicle 's number of axles and emission class .
as soon as the vehicle leaves the highway , the on-board computer automatically stops calculating toll charges . every 100 kilometers , the computer sends an electronic message to a calculation center and vehicle owners are invoiced every month based on the data received . catching the cheaters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 300 " control bridges " -lrb- photo -rrb- now in place along german highways have been equipped with lasers which scan heavy vehicles that pass under them .
the lasers recognize vehicles that are obligated to pay tolls by scanning their outlines .
if the bridge sensors do n't receive a signal from the on-board computer , either because it is not turned on or the driver has n't installed one , a camera takes a picture of the vehicle 's license plate . in addition to the bridges , some 300 cars equipped with the same sensor technology will prowl the highways looking for trucks not following the rules .
toll violators can be charged up to € 20,000 -lrb- $ 23,000 -rrb- . the new german toll system is the first in the world to use satellite technology to monitor traffic .
unlike other systems in place , for example those which use electronic tags to register tolls , the german version does n't require radio beacons along the side of the road to collect information .
traffic planners also avoided the construction of toll stations , which they feared would further tie up germany 's already overburdened autobahn network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the € 500 obu is being provided free of charge by the toll collect , the consortium behind the new system .
however , the installation costs have to be covered by the truck drivers themselves .
installation is not mandatory , but those driving obu-less will be required to stipulate their routes in advance and " buy " them at special terminals being set up at gas stations and truck stops . it 's estimated that there will be some 200,000 toll transactions daily on germany 's 12,000 kilometers of highway , all of which could bring in some € 2.8 billion -lrb- $ 3.2 billion -rrb- a year . foreseeing the glitches as with all new technology , there are concerns that bugs in the system could result in trucking disruptions at the beginning .
the satellite tracking systems and control bridges have passed repeated checks .
the primary concern now is that there will not be enough time to install on-board computers in every truck that wants one .
in order to meet the august 31 start date , some 5,000 obus need to be installed every day .
but according to germany 's freight traffic association , only one percent of heavy trucks actually have appointments to have the units installed . on august 15 , an independent commission investigating the toll system 's introduction will report to germany 's department of transportation whether or not the program can begin as scheduled . " i want to see the program succeed from the beginning , and not start in chaos , " said transportation minister manfred stolpe . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german truck toll runs into eu roadblocks the european commission is scrutinizing berlin ’ s plan to impose a road toll on trucks using german autobahns amid its own proposals to standardize road toll charges throughout the eu .

tuesday ’ s german newspapers commented on the continuing violence in iraq , the tentative steps towards peace in the middle east and allegations of police brutality in a trial of a german law student accused on murder . the rheinische post wrote the united states is a country of growing military strength but its reputation in the world is deteriorating .
the americans are hardly facing what they would term a worthy opponent , but across the globe they have become a target for terrorists and guerrillas , the paper stated .
u.s. experts suspect that not iraqis but foreigners are behind the attacks on u.s. troops .
" the three letters ‘ usa ’ generate ill feeling that not infrequently turns into violence .
in afghanistan , the u.s. may have destroyed terrorist structures , but it has not destroyed terrorism , " the paper concluded .
the westfälische anzeiger was optimistic that in spite of all reservations and in the face of some skepticism , it appeared that progress is being made in the middle east peace process .
israel 's prime minister ariel sharon appears to be edging towards compromise , the paper wrote .
it wrote , " the old hard-liner is making some surprisingly diplomatic noises .
rather less surprising is that he is making concessions ahead of his meeting with u.s. president george w. bush .
contrary to their efforts in iraq , the bush administration is displaying some dexterity in dealing with this conflict . "
the paper suggested the palestinians would be well advised to use this to advance the cause of peace .
the sluggish german economy received a welcome boost on monday when a widely-watched industrial barometer showed growing confidence in a recovery this year .
the ifo institute , germany 's best-known economic think-tank , said that its business climate index rose for the third month in succession , moving up to 89.2 points in july from 88.8 points .
the westdeutsche zeitung cautioned about reading too much into the statistics .
there are largely psychological factors at work , it said , and therefore it would be fatal for the german government to lean back and celebrate its tentative steps towards reform as the opening phase of sustained economic recovery .
" hopes for the german economy rise " is the banner headline in the financial times deutschland .
citing the ifo institute , the paper ’ s editorial commented that all of a sudden the german economy is showing signs of life .
the ft then listed what it describes as the relatively good news - the euro slipping against the dollar , the weakening of the union ’ s ability to defend industry-wide agreements after the failure of the ig metall strike in the east and a slight fall in the unemployment rate .
the paper breathed a sigh of relief that germany ’ s ability to halt the bad economic news is justified ; but warned that excitement about the country 's glowing economic potential would be irrational .
increase in german business confidence was however not the main domestic story in the german papers , it was a gruesome murder case .
in frankfurt on monday , law student magnus gäfgen was sentenced to life imprisonment for the kidnapping and murder of jakob von metzler , the eleven-year-old heir to a private banking firm .
the nürnberger nachrichten noted that the defense lawyer for the student had been predicting that his client could be released within three years .
why , the paper asked .
he is speculating that a higher court could declare the investigative proceedings in the run-up to the trial to be null and void because the police threatened to torture gäfgen before they knew his victim was dead .
" but these two aspects of the case , dubious police tactics and the guilt of the accused , should be kept quite separate from one another , " the paper commented .
a german law student who kidnapped and murdered an 11-year-old heir to a private banking firm was sentenced to life imprisonment on monday .
the case stirred controversy after the frankfurt police admitted that they had threatened to use physical force , in other words , torture , to get the suspected murder to reveal the whereabouts of the kidnapped boy , jakob metzler .
the kölner stadtanzeiger made the point that the current debate in germany about relaxing the ban on torture was not triggered by terrorist violence , but by a crime punishable under the conventional penal code .
" it is therefore all the more important we continue to press for the upholding of the ban on torture .

after a disastrous two years for the german tourism industry , officials are now expressing cautious optimism that the worst has passed .
but the once-thriving industry is still struggling to get back on its feet . the last two years have not been good ones for the travel industry in germany . accustomed to near constant growth , the tourism business has watched its turnover plummet in the face of a whole series of events that kept travellers at home .
the industry was first sent reeling after the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 .
then further terrorist attacks in bali and tunisia , the outbreak of the pulmonary disease sars , and the war in iraq acted like body blows to an industry that was already watching the bottom drop out . but several of germany 's large tour operators are saying a turnaround could be at hand as people slowly begin packing their bags and travelling again .
while none will call the current situation rosy , industry leaders are adding a dash of optimism to their business prognoses . " we 've seen a pickup in our bookings for a good ten weeks , " volker böttcher , managing director of germany 's largest travel concern tui , told reporters in hanover , adding that numbers since may were up from the previous year and that sales volumes were increasing at a healthy rate . despite the new optimism , the tui chief emphasized that the company was far from where it wanted to be .
" of course , we 're not satisfied , since we 're not going to be able to completely make up for last year 's losses this year , " he said . improving , but not good germany 's other major travel operators find themselves in similar situations .
thomas cook , europe 's number two travel company after tui , reported that despite the improving business it would still have to count on significant losses for 2003 , even though stefan pichler , thomas cook 's president , said they would not be as severe as the € 123 million -lrb- $ 142 million -rrb- the company lost in fiscal year 2001/2002 . despite an upturn in bookings since the end of the war in iraq , stefan pichler , thomas cook 's president , said he was counting on a depressed travel market for 2003 overall . " right now the industry is at the level it was in 1998 , " he told reporters . pichler has his sights set on 2004 , when he said could the industry could see a substantial pickup in the number of people travelling , from 2.5 to 3 percent . most tour operators seem to have written off summer 2003 entirely .

police threatened to torture a law student declared guilty of killing the 11-year-old son of a banker 's family .
his lawyer says germany 's highest court will overturn the conviction due to the torture threat . a controversial trial came to an end in frankfurt on monday when 28-year-old magnus gäfgen was pronounced guilty of abduction , murder and blackmail .
the law student was sentenced to life in prison for murdering 11-year-old jakob von metzler , the son of a prominent frankfurt banking family .
but the fact that local police squeezed a confession out of gäfgen by threatening to torture him was irrelevant , judge hans bachl told the court . " with the threat of torture the police did grave damage to the rule of law of this country , " bachl said in his concluding statement .
" their guilt , however , has nothing to do with gäfgen 's guilt . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 11-year-old jakob von metzler gäfgen kidnapped jakob von metzler -lrb- photo -rrb- on sept .
27 , 2002 , as the boy was on his way home from school .
the same day he suffocated metzler , he demanded € 1 million from the metzler family for the boy 's release , which they paid .
the police , who had been observing gäfgen for days , arrested him at the frankfurt airport .
while interrogating gäfgen , deputy police president wolfgang daschner threatened to have a martial arts expert hurt the suspect if he did n't reveal where metzler was being held .
gäfgen then told the police where he had hid the child , who was already dead at the time . public controversy the disclosure in late january that daschner had threatened to manhandle gäfgen opened up a public debate about police employing torture , which is illegal in germany and can be punished with up to ten years in prison .
daschner and another policeman were temporarily suspended .
an investigation into the allegations has not yet been completed . on the first day of the trial against gäfgen , in april , the court drew a line under the affair and declared all gäfgen 's previous statements " null and void . "
two days later gäfgen again issued a confession , this time one that the court could accept without the taint of having been forced under the threat of torture . not over yet but gäfgen 's lawyer , hans ulrich endres , said the court 's actions had not resolved the matter .
in his address to the court , he called on it not to highlight the gravity of gäfgen 's crime because of the torture threat .
endres said the court should thus signal to police that they were obliged to observe the letter of the law . judge bachl stressed that the police 's behavior could not minimize gäfgen 's crime .
gäfgen would have most likely been declared guilty of murder even if he had not repeated his confession , the judge said . defense lawyer endres has indicated the matter will not yet be laid to rest .
shortly before the verdict was pronounced he said he would appeal to germany 's highest court , the constitutional court in karlsruhe , to overturn the decision .
" if karlsruhe concedes my point , magnus will be free in three years and he will be entitled to compensation for wrongful imprisonment , " endres told the newsmagazine focus . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : wafer thin film of human dignity tuesday ’ s german newspapers commented on the continuing violence in iraq , the tentative steps towards peace in the middle east and allegations of police brutality in a trial of a german law student accused on murder .

an exhibition on the disbanded terrorist group red army faction has german politicians up in arms .
despite the organizers ' denials , they say the show is distasteful and will glorify the notorious german guerillas . an exhibition that has n't yet opened its doors or even gotten past the planning stage has sparked outrage and protest in germany .
at the heart of the controversy is the internationally-renowned berlin exhibition hall kunst-werke that has been developing a project focused on the now defunct german terrorist group red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- . the show was initially meant to be called " raf , the myth , " and that seems to be part of the problem .
critics , who include leading politicians like german interior minister otto schily , a former lawyer for raf member gudrun ensslin , have said they fear the exhibition will glorify the terrorist group . " it 's a scandal " " the exhibition should be cancelled without any ifs or buts , " oppostion christian democratic union secretary-general laurenz meyer announced on friday in berlin .
he said it was incomprehensible why the people responsible for the project had not been sensitized to the topic .
the raf was not about " ideals , but about terror and the murder of innocents . " his party colleague rupert scholz condemned the exhibition in even sharper tones .
" an exhibition like the one apparently initiated here is absolutely unacceptable .
in reality , it is a scandal , " he told a radio station . ruthless campaign of killings the red army faction , which had its roots in the radical leftist student movement of the late 1960s , carried out a campaign of killings , robberies and bomb attacks from 1971 to 1993 in germany with the aim of destroying a society they condemned as imperialist and capitalist .
the move starkly polarized west german society still struggling to reconcile its liberal democratic aspirations with its nazi past . leading figures of the extremist group such as andreas baader and ulrike meinhof attracted widespread sympathy from many young people critical of western consumer society and equally trenchant condemnation from an older generation stunned by their ruthless violence . at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businesmen were killed in raf attacks . outrage over the planned exhibition first surfaced when the tabloid bild reported that the berlin senate planned a " scandalous exhibition about the raf " which would be financed with € 100,000 -lrb- $ 125,000 -rrb- in federal funds .
bild said relatives of the raf 's victims had appealed to chancellor gerhard schröder to prevent the exhibition from promoting the myth that already surrounds the group and glorifying it . now the federal center for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- and the hamburg institute for social research , advisors to the exhibition , have said they will only cooperate with the organizers if they meet certain conditions , including consulting with the relatives . an absurd debate but organizers of the exhibition are nonplussed by the furore sparked by it . " i find the debate rather absurd , " the vice president of parliament , antje vollmer , who has been advising the organizers said on thursday .

an exhibition on the disbanded terrorist group red army faction has german politicians up in arms .
despite the organizers ' denials , they say the show is distasteful and will glorify the notorious german guerillas . an exhibition that has n't yet opened its doors or even gotten past the planning stage has sparked outrage and protest in germany .
at the heart of the controversy is the internationally-renowned berlin exhibition hall kunst-werke that has been developing a project focused on the now defunct german terrorist group red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- . the show was initially meant to be called " raf , the myth , " and that seems to be part of the problem .
critics , who include leading politicians like german interior minister otto schily , a former lawyer for raf member gudrun ensslin , have said they fear the exhibition will glorify the terrorist group . " it 's a scandal " " the exhibition should be cancelled without any ifs or buts , " oppostion christian democratic union secretary-general laurenz meyer announced on friday in berlin .
he said it was incomprehensible why the people responsible for the project had not been sensitized to the topic .
the raf was not about " ideals , but about terror and the murder of innocents . " his party colleague rupert scholz condemned the exhibition in even sharper tones .
" an exhibition like the one apparently initiated here is absolutely unacceptable .
in reality , it is a scandal , " he told a radio station . ruthless campaign of killings the red army faction , which had its roots in the radical leftist student movement of the late 1960s , carried out a campaign of killings , robberies and bomb attacks from 1971 to 1993 in germany with the aim of destroying a society they condemned as imperialist and capitalist .
the move starkly polarized west german society still struggling to reconcile its liberal democratic aspirations with its nazi past . leading figures of the extremist group such as andreas baader and ulrike meinhof attracted widespread sympathy from many young people critical of western consumer society and equally trenchant condemnation from an older generation stunned by their ruthless violence . at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businesmen were killed in raf attacks . outrage over the planned exhibition first surfaced when the tabloid bild reported that the berlin senate planned a " scandalous exhibition about the raf " which would be financed with € 100,000 -lrb- $ 125,000 -rrb- in federal funds .
bild said relatives of the raf 's victims had appealed to chancellor gerhard schröder to prevent the exhibition from promoting the myth that already surrounds the group and glorifying it . now the federal center for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- and the hamburg institute for social research , advisors to the exhibition , have said they will only cooperate with the organizers if they meet certain conditions , including consulting with the relatives . an absurd debate but organizers of the exhibition are nonplussed by the furore sparked by it .

police threatened to torture a law student declared guilty of killing the 11-year-old son of a banker 's family .
his lawyer says germany 's highest court will overturn the conviction due to the torture threat . a controversial trial came to an end in frankfurt on monday when 28-year-old magnus gäfgen was pronounced guilty of abduction , murder and blackmail .
the law student was sentenced to life in prison for murdering 11-year-old jakob von metzler , the son of a prominent frankfurt banking family .
but the fact that local police squeezed a confession out of gäfgen by threatening to torture him was irrelevant , judge hans bachl told the court . " with the threat of torture the police did grave damage to the rule of law of this country , " bachl said in his concluding statement .
" their guilt , however , has nothing to do with gäfgen 's guilt . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 11-year-old jakob von metzler gäfgen kidnapped jakob von metzler -lrb- photo -rrb- on sept .
27 , 2002 , as the boy was on his way home from school .
the same day he suffocated metzler , he demanded € 1 million from the metzler family for the boy 's release , which they paid .
the police , who had been observing gäfgen for days , arrested him at the frankfurt airport .
while interrogating gäfgen , deputy police president wolfgang daschner threatened to have a martial arts expert hurt the suspect if he did n't reveal where metzler was being held .
gäfgen then told the police where he had hid the child , who was already dead at the time . public controversy the disclosure in late january that daschner had threatened to manhandle gäfgen opened up a public debate about police employing torture , which is illegal in germany and can be punished with up to ten years in prison .
daschner and another policeman were temporarily suspended .
an investigation into the allegations has not yet been completed . on the first day of the trial against gäfgen , in april , the court drew a line under the affair and declared all gäfgen 's previous statements " null and void . "
two days later gäfgen again issued a confession , this time one that the court could accept without the taint of having been forced under the threat of torture . not over yet but gäfgen 's lawyer , hans ulrich endres , said the court 's actions had not resolved the matter .
in his address to the court , he called on it not to highlight the gravity of gäfgen 's crime because of the torture threat .
endres said the court should thus signal to police that they were obliged to observe the letter of the law . judge bachl stressed that the police 's behavior could not minimize gäfgen 's crime .
gäfgen would have most likely been declared guilty of murder even if he had not repeated his confession , the judge said . defense lawyer endres has indicated the matter will not yet be laid to rest .
shortly before the verdict was pronounced he said he would appeal to germany 's highest court , the constitutional court in karlsruhe , to overturn the decision .

police threatened to torture a law student declared guilty of killing the 11-year-old son of a banker 's family .
his lawyer says germany 's highest court will overturn the conviction due to the torture threat . a controversial trial came to an end in frankfurt on monday when 28-year-old magnus gäfgen was pronounced guilty of abduction , murder and blackmail .
the law student was sentenced to life in prison for murdering 11-year-old jakob von metzler , the son of a prominent frankfurt banking family .
but the fact that local police squeezed a confession out of gäfgen by threatening to torture him was irrelevant , judge hans bachl told the court . " with the threat of torture the police did grave damage to the rule of law of this country , " bachl said in his concluding statement .

the same day he suffocated metzler , he demanded € 1 million from the metzler family for the boy 's release , which they paid .
the police , who had been observing gäfgen for days , arrested him at the frankfurt airport .
while interrogating gäfgen , deputy police president wolfgang daschner threatened to have a martial arts expert hurt the suspect if he did n't reveal where metzler was being held .
gäfgen then told the police where he had hid the child , who was already dead at the time . public controversy the disclosure in late january that daschner had threatened to manhandle gäfgen opened up a public debate about police employing torture , which is illegal in germany and can be punished with up to ten years in prison .
daschner and another policeman were temporarily suspended .
an investigation into the allegations has not yet been completed . on the first day of the trial against gäfgen , in april , the court drew a line under the affair and declared all gäfgen 's previous statements " null and void . "
two days later gäfgen again issued a confession , this time one that the court could accept without the taint of having been forced under the threat of torture . not over yet but gäfgen 's lawyer , hans ulrich endres , said the court 's actions had not resolved the matter .
in his address to the court , he called on it not to highlight the gravity of gäfgen 's crime because of the torture threat .
endres said the court should thus signal to police that they were obliged to observe the letter of the law . judge bachl stressed that the police 's behavior could not minimize gäfgen 's crime .
gäfgen would have most likely been declared guilty of murder even if he had not repeated his confession , the judge said . defense lawyer endres has indicated the matter will not yet be laid to rest .
shortly before the verdict was pronounced he said he would appeal to germany 's highest court , the constitutional court in karlsruhe , to overturn the decision .

a new toll system goes in effect on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles next month .
the system is the world 's first to use satellite technology to record trucks ' highway mileage and automatically charge tolls . the control bridges are already in place and on-board computers are being frantically installed in trucks throughout germany and beyond .
trucking companies and traffic experts are carefully counting down the days until august 31 , when trucks weighing over 12 tons will be required to pay a per-kilometer charge when they drive on germany 's autobahns . tolls based on distance traveled have long been considered for heavy trucks , since the income could be used to fund rising highway maintenance costs .
the sticking point has been how to institute a workable system without having to construct legions of toll booths along germany 's highways . riding to the rescue is satellite technology , which will work in tandem with small on-board computers installed in heavy trucks that function as drive-along toll station attendants , registering how far the truck has driven along a toll road , calculating the cost and sending it back to a central computer for later billing . satellite positioning under the new system , before starting off , drivers will turn on computers called on-board units -lrb- obu -rrb- which have been provided to them by the toll company .
the activation establishes a linkup with a global positioning satellite in earth 's orbit .
the continuous satellite connection enables the obu to know at all times where the truck is . with the help of street atlas programmed into its memory , the obu begins charging between nine and fourteen cents for every kilometer the truck drives on the highway , depending on the vehicle 's number of axles and emission class .
as soon as the vehicle leaves the highway , the on-board computer automatically stops calculating toll charges . every 100 kilometers , the computer sends an electronic message to a calculation center and vehicle owners are invoiced every month based on the data received . catching the cheaters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 300 " control bridges " -lrb- photo -rrb- now in place along german highways have been equipped with lasers which scan heavy vehicles that pass under them .
the lasers recognize vehicles that are obligated to pay tolls by scanning their outlines .
if the bridge sensors do n't receive a signal from the on-board computer , either because it is not turned on or the driver has n't installed one , a camera takes a picture of the vehicle 's license plate . in addition to the bridges , some 300 cars equipped with the same sensor technology will prowl the highways looking for trucks not following the rules .
toll violators can be charged up to € 20,000 -lrb- $ 23,000 -rrb- . the new german toll system is the first in the world to use satellite technology to monitor traffic .
unlike other systems in place , for example those which use electronic tags to register tolls , the german version does n't require radio beacons along the side of the road to collect information .
traffic planners also avoided the construction of toll stations , which they feared would further tie up germany 's already overburdened autobahn network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the € 500 obu is being provided free of charge by the toll collect , the consortium behind the new system .
however , the installation costs have to be covered by the truck drivers themselves .
installation is not mandatory , but those driving obu-less will be required to stipulate their routes in advance and " buy " them at special terminals being set up at gas stations and truck stops . it 's estimated that there will be some 200,000 toll transactions daily on germany 's 12,000 kilometers of highway , all of which could bring in some € 2.8 billion -lrb- $ 3.2 billion -rrb- a year . foreseeing the glitches as with all new technology , there are concerns that bugs in the system could result in trucking disruptions at the beginning .
the satellite tracking systems and control bridges have passed repeated checks .
the primary concern now is that there will not be enough time to install on-board computers in every truck that wants one .
in order to meet the august 31 start date , some 5,000 obus need to be installed every day .
but according to germany 's freight traffic association , only one percent of heavy trucks actually have appointments to have the units installed . on august 15 , an independent commission investigating the toll system 's introduction will report to germany 's department of transportation whether or not the program can begin as scheduled .

a new toll system goes in effect on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles next month .
the system is the world 's first to use satellite technology to record trucks ' highway mileage and automatically charge tolls . the control bridges are already in place and on-board computers are being frantically installed in trucks throughout germany and beyond .
trucking companies and traffic experts are carefully counting down the days until august 31 , when trucks weighing over 12 tons will be required to pay a per-kilometer charge when they drive on germany 's autobahns . tolls based on distance traveled have long been considered for heavy trucks , since the income could be used to fund rising highway maintenance costs .
the sticking point has been how to institute a workable system without having to construct legions of toll booths along germany 's highways . riding to the rescue is satellite technology , which will work in tandem with small on-board computers installed in heavy trucks that function as drive-along toll station attendants , registering how far the truck has driven along a toll road , calculating the cost and sending it back to a central computer for later billing . satellite positioning under the new system , before starting off , drivers will turn on computers called on-board units -lrb- obu -rrb- which have been provided to them by the toll company .
the activation establishes a linkup with a global positioning satellite in earth 's orbit .
the continuous satellite connection enables the obu to know at all times where the truck is . with the help of street atlas programmed into its memory , the obu begins charging between nine and fourteen cents for every kilometer the truck drives on the highway , depending on the vehicle 's number of axles and emission class .
as soon as the vehicle leaves the highway , the on-board computer automatically stops calculating toll charges . every 100 kilometers , the computer sends an electronic message to a calculation center and vehicle owners are invoiced every month based on the data received . catching the cheaters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 300 " control bridges " -lrb- photo -rrb- now in place along german highways have been equipped with lasers which scan heavy vehicles that pass under them .
the lasers recognize vehicles that are obligated to pay tolls by scanning their outlines .
if the bridge sensors do n't receive a signal from the on-board computer , either because it is not turned on or the driver has n't installed one , a camera takes a picture of the vehicle 's license plate . in addition to the bridges , some 300 cars equipped with the same sensor technology will prowl the highways looking for trucks not following the rules .
toll violators can be charged up to € 20,000 -lrb- $ 23,000 -rrb- . the new german toll system is the first in the world to use satellite technology to monitor traffic .
unlike other systems in place , for example those which use electronic tags to register tolls , the german version does n't require radio beacons along the side of the road to collect information .
traffic planners also avoided the construction of toll stations , which they feared would further tie up germany 's already overburdened autobahn network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the € 500 obu is being provided free of charge by the toll collect , the consortium behind the new system .
however , the installation costs have to be covered by the truck drivers themselves .
installation is not mandatory , but those driving obu-less will be required to stipulate their routes in advance and " buy " them at special terminals being set up at gas stations and truck stops . it 's estimated that there will be some 200,000 toll transactions daily on germany 's 12,000 kilometers of highway , all of which could bring in some € 2.8 billion -lrb- $ 3.2 billion -rrb- a year . foreseeing the glitches as with all new technology , there are concerns that bugs in the system could result in trucking disruptions at the beginning .
the satellite tracking systems and control bridges have passed repeated checks .

tuesday ’ s german newspapers commented on the continuing violence in iraq , the tentative steps towards peace in the middle east and allegations of police brutality in a trial of a german law student accused on murder . the rheinische post wrote the united states is a country of growing military strength but its reputation in the world is deteriorating .
the americans are hardly facing what they would term a worthy opponent , but across the globe they have become a target for terrorists and guerrillas , the paper stated .
u.s. experts suspect that not iraqis but foreigners are behind the attacks on u.s. troops .
" the three letters ‘ usa ’ generate ill feeling that not infrequently turns into violence .
in afghanistan , the u.s. may have destroyed terrorist structures , but it has not destroyed terrorism , " the paper concluded .
the westfälische anzeiger was optimistic that in spite of all reservations and in the face of some skepticism , it appeared that progress is being made in the middle east peace process .
israel 's prime minister ariel sharon appears to be edging towards compromise , the paper wrote .
it wrote , " the old hard-liner is making some surprisingly diplomatic noises .
rather less surprising is that he is making concessions ahead of his meeting with u.s. president george w. bush .
contrary to their efforts in iraq , the bush administration is displaying some dexterity in dealing with this conflict . "
the paper suggested the palestinians would be well advised to use this to advance the cause of peace .
the sluggish german economy received a welcome boost on monday when a widely-watched industrial barometer showed growing confidence in a recovery this year .
the ifo institute , germany 's best-known economic think-tank , said that its business climate index rose for the third month in succession , moving up to 89.2 points in july from 88.8 points .
the westdeutsche zeitung cautioned about reading too much into the statistics .
there are largely psychological factors at work , it said , and therefore it would be fatal for the german government to lean back and celebrate its tentative steps towards reform as the opening phase of sustained economic recovery .
" hopes for the german economy rise " is the banner headline in the financial times deutschland .
citing the ifo institute , the paper ’ s editorial commented that all of a sudden the german economy is showing signs of life .
the ft then listed what it describes as the relatively good news - the euro slipping against the dollar , the weakening of the union ’ s ability to defend industry-wide agreements after the failure of the ig metall strike in the east and a slight fall in the unemployment rate .
the paper breathed a sigh of relief that germany ’ s ability to halt the bad economic news is justified ; but warned that excitement about the country 's glowing economic potential would be irrational .
increase in german business confidence was however not the main domestic story in the german papers , it was a gruesome murder case .
in frankfurt on monday , law student magnus gäfgen was sentenced to life imprisonment for the kidnapping and murder of jakob von metzler , the eleven-year-old heir to a private banking firm .
the nürnberger nachrichten noted that the defense lawyer for the student had been predicting that his client could be released within three years .
why , the paper asked .
he is speculating that a higher court could declare the investigative proceedings in the run-up to the trial to be null and void because the police threatened to torture gäfgen before they knew his victim was dead .
" but these two aspects of the case , dubious police tactics and the guilt of the accused , should be kept quite separate from one another , " the paper commented .
a german law student who kidnapped and murdered an 11-year-old heir to a private banking firm was sentenced to life imprisonment on monday .
the case stirred controversy after the frankfurt police admitted that they had threatened to use physical force , in other words , torture , to get the suspected murder to reveal the whereabouts of the kidnapped boy , jakob metzler .
the kölner stadtanzeiger made the point that the current debate in germany about relaxing the ban on torture was not triggered by terrorist violence , but by a crime punishable under the conventional penal code .
" it is therefore all the more important we continue to press for the upholding of the ban on torture .
this debate has shown how easily prepared we are to shed the principles of the rule of law , " the paper argued and added , " the protective film under which we keep human dignity safeguarded as a cherished possession has proven itself to be wafer thin .

police threatened to torture a law student declared guilty of killing the 11-year-old son of a banker 's family .
his lawyer says germany 's highest court will overturn the conviction due to the torture threat . a controversial trial came to an end in frankfurt on monday when 28-year-old magnus gäfgen was pronounced guilty of abduction , murder and blackmail .
the law student was sentenced to life in prison for murdering 11-year-old jakob von metzler , the son of a prominent frankfurt banking family .
but the fact that local police squeezed a confession out of gäfgen by threatening to torture him was irrelevant , judge hans bachl told the court . " with the threat of torture the police did grave damage to the rule of law of this country , " bachl said in his concluding statement .
" their guilt , however , has nothing to do with gäfgen 's guilt . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 11-year-old jakob von metzler gäfgen kidnapped jakob von metzler -lrb- photo -rrb- on sept .
27 , 2002 , as the boy was on his way home from school .
the same day he suffocated metzler , he demanded € 1 million from the metzler family for the boy 's release , which they paid .
the police , who had been observing gäfgen for days , arrested him at the frankfurt airport .
while interrogating gäfgen , deputy police president wolfgang daschner threatened to have a martial arts expert hurt the suspect if he did n't reveal where metzler was being held .
gäfgen then told the police where he had hid the child , who was already dead at the time . public controversy the disclosure in late january that daschner had threatened to manhandle gäfgen opened up a public debate about police employing torture , which is illegal in germany and can be punished with up to ten years in prison .
daschner and another policeman were temporarily suspended .
an investigation into the allegations has not yet been completed . on the first day of the trial against gäfgen , in april , the court drew a line under the affair and declared all gäfgen 's previous statements " null and void . "
two days later gäfgen again issued a confession , this time one that the court could accept without the taint of having been forced under the threat of torture . not over yet but gäfgen 's lawyer , hans ulrich endres , said the court 's actions had not resolved the matter .
in his address to the court , he called on it not to highlight the gravity of gäfgen 's crime because of the torture threat .
endres said the court should thus signal to police that they were obliged to observe the letter of the law . judge bachl stressed that the police 's behavior could not minimize gäfgen 's crime .
gäfgen would have most likely been declared guilty of murder even if he had not repeated his confession , the judge said . defense lawyer endres has indicated the matter will not yet be laid to rest .
shortly before the verdict was pronounced he said he would appeal to germany 's highest court , the constitutional court in karlsruhe , to overturn the decision .
" if karlsruhe concedes my point , magnus will be free in three years and he will be entitled to compensation for wrongful imprisonment , " endres told the newsmagazine focus . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : wafer thin film of human dignity tuesday ’ s german newspapers commented on the continuing violence in iraq , the tentative steps towards peace in the middle east and allegations of police brutality in a trial of a german law student accused on murder .

tuesday ’ s german newspapers commented on the continuing violence in iraq , the tentative steps towards peace in the middle east and allegations of police brutality in a trial of a german law student accused on murder . the rheinische post wrote the united states is a country of growing military strength but its reputation in the world is deteriorating .
the americans are hardly facing what they would term a worthy opponent , but across the globe they have become a target for terrorists and guerrillas , the paper stated .
u.s. experts suspect that not iraqis but foreigners are behind the attacks on u.s. troops .
" the three letters ‘ usa ’ generate ill feeling that not infrequently turns into violence .
in afghanistan , the u.s. may have destroyed terrorist structures , but it has not destroyed terrorism , " the paper concluded .
the westfälische anzeiger was optimistic that in spite of all reservations and in the face of some skepticism , it appeared that progress is being made in the middle east peace process .
israel 's prime minister ariel sharon appears to be edging towards compromise , the paper wrote .
it wrote , " the old hard-liner is making some surprisingly diplomatic noises .
rather less surprising is that he is making concessions ahead of his meeting with u.s. president george w. bush .
contrary to their efforts in iraq , the bush administration is displaying some dexterity in dealing with this conflict . "
the paper suggested the palestinians would be well advised to use this to advance the cause of peace .
the sluggish german economy received a welcome boost on monday when a widely-watched industrial barometer showed growing confidence in a recovery this year .
the ifo institute , germany 's best-known economic think-tank , said that its business climate index rose for the third month in succession , moving up to 89.2 points in july from 88.8 points .
the westdeutsche zeitung cautioned about reading too much into the statistics .
there are largely psychological factors at work , it said , and therefore it would be fatal for the german government to lean back and celebrate its tentative steps towards reform as the opening phase of sustained economic recovery .
" hopes for the german economy rise " is the banner headline in the financial times deutschland .
citing the ifo institute , the paper ’ s editorial commented that all of a sudden the german economy is showing signs of life .
the ft then listed what it describes as the relatively good news - the euro slipping against the dollar , the weakening of the union ’ s ability to defend industry-wide agreements after the failure of the ig metall strike in the east and a slight fall in the unemployment rate .
the paper breathed a sigh of relief that germany ’ s ability to halt the bad economic news is justified ; but warned that excitement about the country 's glowing economic potential would be irrational .
increase in german business confidence was however not the main domestic story in the german papers , it was a gruesome murder case .
in frankfurt on monday , law student magnus gäfgen was sentenced to life imprisonment for the kidnapping and murder of jakob von metzler , the eleven-year-old heir to a private banking firm .
the nürnberger nachrichten noted that the defense lawyer for the student had been predicting that his client could be released within three years .

an exhibition on the disbanded terrorist group red army faction has german politicians up in arms .
despite the organizers ' denials , they say the show is distasteful and will glorify the notorious german guerillas . an exhibition that has n't yet opened its doors or even gotten past the planning stage has sparked outrage and protest in germany .
at the heart of the controversy is the internationally-renowned berlin exhibition hall kunst-werke that has been developing a project focused on the now defunct german terrorist group red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- . the show was initially meant to be called " raf , the myth , " and that seems to be part of the problem .
critics , who include leading politicians like german interior minister otto schily , a former lawyer for raf member gudrun ensslin , have said they fear the exhibition will glorify the terrorist group . " it 's a scandal " " the exhibition should be cancelled without any ifs or buts , " oppostion christian democratic union secretary-general laurenz meyer announced on friday in berlin .
he said it was incomprehensible why the people responsible for the project had not been sensitized to the topic .
the raf was not about " ideals , but about terror and the murder of innocents . " his party colleague rupert scholz condemned the exhibition in even sharper tones .
" an exhibition like the one apparently initiated here is absolutely unacceptable .
in reality , it is a scandal , " he told a radio station . ruthless campaign of killings the red army faction , which had its roots in the radical leftist student movement of the late 1960s , carried out a campaign of killings , robberies and bomb attacks from 1971 to 1993 in germany with the aim of destroying a society they condemned as imperialist and capitalist .
the move starkly polarized west german society still struggling to reconcile its liberal democratic aspirations with its nazi past . leading figures of the extremist group such as andreas baader and ulrike meinhof attracted widespread sympathy from many young people critical of western consumer society and equally trenchant condemnation from an older generation stunned by their ruthless violence . at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businesmen were killed in raf attacks . outrage over the planned exhibition first surfaced when the tabloid bild reported that the berlin senate planned a " scandalous exhibition about the raf " which would be financed with € 100,000 -lrb- $ 125,000 -rrb- in federal funds .
bild said relatives of the raf 's victims had appealed to chancellor gerhard schröder to prevent the exhibition from promoting the myth that already surrounds the group and glorifying it . now the federal center for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- and the hamburg institute for social research , advisors to the exhibition , have said they will only cooperate with the organizers if they meet certain conditions , including consulting with the relatives . an absurd debate but organizers of the exhibition are nonplussed by the furore sparked by it . " i find the debate rather absurd , " the vice president of parliament , antje vollmer , who has been advising the organizers said on thursday .
" throughout the whole process i never had an inkling of a feeling that something could go wrong . " " the project aims to do just what we 're accused of : to allow a historically-grounded assessment of the raf that counteracts glorification and mythologization , " klaus biesenbach , the exhibition 's artistic director told the german news agency dpa . he said pop culture and the media had dealt with the raf in an ambiguous and at times uncritical manner in recent years . the public commotion suggests that it is very important to do this review of a horrible chapter -lrb- of germany 's history -rrb- , said biesenbach . in any case , the controversy has resulted in at least one change : though originally planned for november , it will not open until november 2004 so organizers will have time to consult with the victim 's relatives and figure out how to deal with such a sensitive issue . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german terrorist 's brain will join her body the brain of ulrike meinhof , which has sat in a container with formaldehyde for 26 years following scientific research , will be buried along with her body in a berlin cemetery .

an exhibition on the disbanded terrorist group red army faction has german politicians up in arms .
despite the organizers ' denials , they say the show is distasteful and will glorify the notorious german guerillas . an exhibition that has n't yet opened its doors or even gotten past the planning stage has sparked outrage and protest in germany .
at the heart of the controversy is the internationally-renowned berlin exhibition hall kunst-werke that has been developing a project focused on the now defunct german terrorist group red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- . the show was initially meant to be called " raf , the myth , " and that seems to be part of the problem .
critics , who include leading politicians like german interior minister otto schily , a former lawyer for raf member gudrun ensslin , have said they fear the exhibition will glorify the terrorist group . " it 's a scandal " " the exhibition should be cancelled without any ifs or buts , " oppostion christian democratic union secretary-general laurenz meyer announced on friday in berlin .
he said it was incomprehensible why the people responsible for the project had not been sensitized to the topic .
the raf was not about " ideals , but about terror and the murder of innocents . " his party colleague rupert scholz condemned the exhibition in even sharper tones .
" an exhibition like the one apparently initiated here is absolutely unacceptable .
in reality , it is a scandal , " he told a radio station . ruthless campaign of killings the red army faction , which had its roots in the radical leftist student movement of the late 1960s , carried out a campaign of killings , robberies and bomb attacks from 1971 to 1993 in germany with the aim of destroying a society they condemned as imperialist and capitalist .
the move starkly polarized west german society still struggling to reconcile its liberal democratic aspirations with its nazi past . leading figures of the extremist group such as andreas baader and ulrike meinhof attracted widespread sympathy from many young people critical of western consumer society and equally trenchant condemnation from an older generation stunned by their ruthless violence . at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businesmen were killed in raf attacks . outrage over the planned exhibition first surfaced when the tabloid bild reported that the berlin senate planned a " scandalous exhibition about the raf " which would be financed with € 100,000 -lrb- $ 125,000 -rrb- in federal funds .
bild said relatives of the raf 's victims had appealed to chancellor gerhard schröder to prevent the exhibition from promoting the myth that already surrounds the group and glorifying it . now the federal center for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- and the hamburg institute for social research , advisors to the exhibition , have said they will only cooperate with the organizers if they meet certain conditions , including consulting with the relatives . an absurd debate but organizers of the exhibition are nonplussed by the furore sparked by it .

a new toll system goes in effect on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles next month .
the system is the world 's first to use satellite technology to record trucks ' highway mileage and automatically charge tolls . the control bridges are already in place and on-board computers are being frantically installed in trucks throughout germany and beyond .
trucking companies and traffic experts are carefully counting down the days until august 31 , when trucks weighing over 12 tons will be required to pay a per-kilometer charge when they drive on germany 's autobahns . tolls based on distance traveled have long been considered for heavy trucks , since the income could be used to fund rising highway maintenance costs .
the sticking point has been how to institute a workable system without having to construct legions of toll booths along germany 's highways . riding to the rescue is satellite technology , which will work in tandem with small on-board computers installed in heavy trucks that function as drive-along toll station attendants , registering how far the truck has driven along a toll road , calculating the cost and sending it back to a central computer for later billing . satellite positioning under the new system , before starting off , drivers will turn on computers called on-board units -lrb- obu -rrb- which have been provided to them by the toll company .
the activation establishes a linkup with a global positioning satellite in earth 's orbit .
the continuous satellite connection enables the obu to know at all times where the truck is . with the help of street atlas programmed into its memory , the obu begins charging between nine and fourteen cents for every kilometer the truck drives on the highway , depending on the vehicle 's number of axles and emission class .
as soon as the vehicle leaves the highway , the on-board computer automatically stops calculating toll charges . every 100 kilometers , the computer sends an electronic message to a calculation center and vehicle owners are invoiced every month based on the data received . catching the cheaters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 300 " control bridges " -lrb- photo -rrb- now in place along german highways have been equipped with lasers which scan heavy vehicles that pass under them .
the lasers recognize vehicles that are obligated to pay tolls by scanning their outlines .
if the bridge sensors do n't receive a signal from the on-board computer , either because it is not turned on or the driver has n't installed one , a camera takes a picture of the vehicle 's license plate . in addition to the bridges , some 300 cars equipped with the same sensor technology will prowl the highways looking for trucks not following the rules .
toll violators can be charged up to € 20,000 -lrb- $ 23,000 -rrb- . the new german toll system is the first in the world to use satellite technology to monitor traffic .
unlike other systems in place , for example those which use electronic tags to register tolls , the german version does n't require radio beacons along the side of the road to collect information .
traffic planners also avoided the construction of toll stations , which they feared would further tie up germany 's already overburdened autobahn network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the € 500 obu is being provided free of charge by the toll collect , the consortium behind the new system .
however , the installation costs have to be covered by the truck drivers themselves .
installation is not mandatory , but those driving obu-less will be required to stipulate their routes in advance and " buy " them at special terminals being set up at gas stations and truck stops . it 's estimated that there will be some 200,000 toll transactions daily on germany 's 12,000 kilometers of highway , all of which could bring in some € 2.8 billion -lrb- $ 3.2 billion -rrb- a year . foreseeing the glitches as with all new technology , there are concerns that bugs in the system could result in trucking disruptions at the beginning .
the satellite tracking systems and control bridges have passed repeated checks .
the primary concern now is that there will not be enough time to install on-board computers in every truck that wants one .
in order to meet the august 31 start date , some 5,000 obus need to be installed every day .
but according to germany 's freight traffic association , only one percent of heavy trucks actually have appointments to have the units installed . on august 15 , an independent commission investigating the toll system 's introduction will report to germany 's department of transportation whether or not the program can begin as scheduled .

a new toll system goes in effect on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles next month .
the system is the world 's first to use satellite technology to record trucks ' highway mileage and automatically charge tolls . the control bridges are already in place and on-board computers are being frantically installed in trucks throughout germany and beyond .
trucking companies and traffic experts are carefully counting down the days until august 31 , when trucks weighing over 12 tons will be required to pay a per-kilometer charge when they drive on germany 's autobahns . tolls based on distance traveled have long been considered for heavy trucks , since the income could be used to fund rising highway maintenance costs .
the sticking point has been how to institute a workable system without having to construct legions of toll booths along germany 's highways . riding to the rescue is satellite technology , which will work in tandem with small on-board computers installed in heavy trucks that function as drive-along toll station attendants , registering how far the truck has driven along a toll road , calculating the cost and sending it back to a central computer for later billing . satellite positioning under the new system , before starting off , drivers will turn on computers called on-board units -lrb- obu -rrb- which have been provided to them by the toll company .
the activation establishes a linkup with a global positioning satellite in earth 's orbit .
the continuous satellite connection enables the obu to know at all times where the truck is . with the help of street atlas programmed into its memory , the obu begins charging between nine and fourteen cents for every kilometer the truck drives on the highway , depending on the vehicle 's number of axles and emission class .
as soon as the vehicle leaves the highway , the on-board computer automatically stops calculating toll charges . every 100 kilometers , the computer sends an electronic message to a calculation center and vehicle owners are invoiced every month based on the data received . catching the cheaters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 300 " control bridges " -lrb- photo -rrb- now in place along german highways have been equipped with lasers which scan heavy vehicles that pass under them .
the lasers recognize vehicles that are obligated to pay tolls by scanning their outlines .
if the bridge sensors do n't receive a signal from the on-board computer , either because it is not turned on or the driver has n't installed one , a camera takes a picture of the vehicle 's license plate . in addition to the bridges , some 300 cars equipped with the same sensor technology will prowl the highways looking for trucks not following the rules .
toll violators can be charged up to € 20,000 -lrb- $ 23,000 -rrb- . the new german toll system is the first in the world to use satellite technology to monitor traffic .
unlike other systems in place , for example those which use electronic tags to register tolls , the german version does n't require radio beacons along the side of the road to collect information .
traffic planners also avoided the construction of toll stations , which they feared would further tie up germany 's already overburdened autobahn network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the € 500 obu is being provided free of charge by the toll collect , the consortium behind the new system .
however , the installation costs have to be covered by the truck drivers themselves .
installation is not mandatory , but those driving obu-less will be required to stipulate their routes in advance and " buy " them at special terminals being set up at gas stations and truck stops . it 's estimated that there will be some 200,000 toll transactions daily on germany 's 12,000 kilometers of highway , all of which could bring in some € 2.8 billion -lrb- $ 3.2 billion -rrb- a year . foreseeing the glitches as with all new technology , there are concerns that bugs in the system could result in trucking disruptions at the beginning .

after a disastrous two years for the german tourism industry , officials are now expressing cautious optimism that the worst has passed .
but the once-thriving industry is still struggling to get back on its feet . the last two years have not been good ones for the travel industry in germany . accustomed to near constant growth , the tourism business has watched its turnover plummet in the face of a whole series of events that kept travellers at home .
the industry was first sent reeling after the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 .
then further terrorist attacks in bali and tunisia , the outbreak of the pulmonary disease sars , and the war in iraq acted like body blows to an industry that was already watching the bottom drop out . but several of germany 's large tour operators are saying a turnaround could be at hand as people slowly begin packing their bags and travelling again .
while none will call the current situation rosy , industry leaders are adding a dash of optimism to their business prognoses . " we 've seen a pickup in our bookings for a good ten weeks , " volker böttcher , managing director of germany 's largest travel concern tui , told reporters in hanover , adding that numbers since may were up from the previous year and that sales volumes were increasing at a healthy rate . despite the new optimism , the tui chief emphasized that the company was far from where it wanted to be .
" of course , we 're not satisfied , since we 're not going to be able to completely make up for last year 's losses this year , " he said . improving , but not good germany 's other major travel operators find themselves in similar situations .
thomas cook , europe 's number two travel company after tui , reported that despite the improving business it would still have to count on significant losses for 2003 , even though stefan pichler , thomas cook 's president , said they would not be as severe as the € 123 million -lrb- $ 142 million -rrb- the company lost in fiscal year 2001/2002 . despite an upturn in bookings since the end of the war in iraq , stefan pichler , thomas cook 's president , said he was counting on a depressed travel market for 2003 overall . " right now the industry is at the level it was in 1998 , " he told reporters . pichler has his sights set on 2004 , when he said could the industry could see a substantial pickup in the number of people travelling , from 2.5 to 3 percent . most tour operators seem to have written off summer 2003 entirely .
the domestic travel industry looks no different .
a new report out by the german chambers of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- shows there is still a good deal of pessimism among german restaurant and hotel owners about overall profits this year .
more than a third of hoteliers and 42 percent of restaurateurs expect losses this year . " the combination of the poor economy as well as difficult discussions about taxes and reforms means that the consumers do n't feel like spending on vacations and leisure activities , " said martin wansleben , head of the dihk . winter strategy to lure people back to vacation destinations , tour operators are planning to drastically sink prices this winter season .

this year alone , the number of last-minute bookings rose by 70 percent .
these vacation packages , reserved sometimes just days in advance , are less expensive than other options , but earn travel companies little in profit . " you ca n't offer somebody one or two weeks at a high-quality hotel for € 299 or less and think you can make money off of it , " said tui 's böttcher .
" such offers are going to ruin our company sooner or later . " both tui and thomas cook plan on reducing the number of last-minute offers , but at the same time enticing travellers with better incentives to book early .

after a disastrous two years for the german tourism industry , officials are now expressing cautious optimism that the worst has passed .
but the once-thriving industry is still struggling to get back on its feet . the last two years have not been good ones for the travel industry in germany . accustomed to near constant growth , the tourism business has watched its turnover plummet in the face of a whole series of events that kept travellers at home .
the industry was first sent reeling after the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 .
then further terrorist attacks in bali and tunisia , the outbreak of the pulmonary disease sars , and the war in iraq acted like body blows to an industry that was already watching the bottom drop out . but several of germany 's large tour operators are saying a turnaround could be at hand as people slowly begin packing their bags and travelling again .
while none will call the current situation rosy , industry leaders are adding a dash of optimism to their business prognoses . " we 've seen a pickup in our bookings for a good ten weeks , " volker böttcher , managing director of germany 's largest travel concern tui , told reporters in hanover , adding that numbers since may were up from the previous year and that sales volumes were increasing at a healthy rate . despite the new optimism , the tui chief emphasized that the company was far from where it wanted to be .
" of course , we 're not satisfied , since we 're not going to be able to completely make up for last year 's losses this year , " he said . improving , but not good germany 's other major travel operators find themselves in similar situations .
thomas cook , europe 's number two travel company after tui , reported that despite the improving business it would still have to count on significant losses for 2003 , even though stefan pichler , thomas cook 's president , said they would not be as severe as the € 123 million -lrb- $ 142 million -rrb- the company lost in fiscal year 2001/2002 . despite an upturn in bookings since the end of the war in iraq , stefan pichler , thomas cook 's president , said he was counting on a depressed travel market for 2003 overall . " right now the industry is at the level it was in 1998 , " he told reporters . pichler has his sights set on 2004 , when he said could the industry could see a substantial pickup in the number of people travelling , from 2.5 to 3 percent . most tour operators seem to have written off summer 2003 entirely .

a new toll system goes in effect on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles next month .
the system is the world 's first to use satellite technology to record trucks ' highway mileage and automatically charge tolls . the control bridges are already in place and on-board computers are being frantically installed in trucks throughout germany and beyond .
trucking companies and traffic experts are carefully counting down the days until august 31 , when trucks weighing over 12 tons will be required to pay a per-kilometer charge when they drive on germany 's autobahns . tolls based on distance traveled have long been considered for heavy trucks , since the income could be used to fund rising highway maintenance costs .
the sticking point has been how to institute a workable system without having to construct legions of toll booths along germany 's highways . riding to the rescue is satellite technology , which will work in tandem with small on-board computers installed in heavy trucks that function as drive-along toll station attendants , registering how far the truck has driven along a toll road , calculating the cost and sending it back to a central computer for later billing . satellite positioning under the new system , before starting off , drivers will turn on computers called on-board units -lrb- obu -rrb- which have been provided to them by the toll company .
the activation establishes a linkup with a global positioning satellite in earth 's orbit .
the continuous satellite connection enables the obu to know at all times where the truck is . with the help of street atlas programmed into its memory , the obu begins charging between nine and fourteen cents for every kilometer the truck drives on the highway , depending on the vehicle 's number of axles and emission class .
as soon as the vehicle leaves the highway , the on-board computer automatically stops calculating toll charges . every 100 kilometers , the computer sends an electronic message to a calculation center and vehicle owners are invoiced every month based on the data received . catching the cheaters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 300 " control bridges " -lrb- photo -rrb- now in place along german highways have been equipped with lasers which scan heavy vehicles that pass under them .
the lasers recognize vehicles that are obligated to pay tolls by scanning their outlines .
if the bridge sensors do n't receive a signal from the on-board computer , either because it is not turned on or the driver has n't installed one , a camera takes a picture of the vehicle 's license plate . in addition to the bridges , some 300 cars equipped with the same sensor technology will prowl the highways looking for trucks not following the rules .
toll violators can be charged up to € 20,000 -lrb- $ 23,000 -rrb- . the new german toll system is the first in the world to use satellite technology to monitor traffic .
unlike other systems in place , for example those which use electronic tags to register tolls , the german version does n't require radio beacons along the side of the road to collect information .
traffic planners also avoided the construction of toll stations , which they feared would further tie up germany 's already overburdened autobahn network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the € 500 obu is being provided free of charge by the toll collect , the consortium behind the new system .
however , the installation costs have to be covered by the truck drivers themselves .
installation is not mandatory , but those driving obu-less will be required to stipulate their routes in advance and " buy " them at special terminals being set up at gas stations and truck stops . it 's estimated that there will be some 200,000 toll transactions daily on germany 's 12,000 kilometers of highway , all of which could bring in some € 2.8 billion -lrb- $ 3.2 billion -rrb- a year . foreseeing the glitches as with all new technology , there are concerns that bugs in the system could result in trucking disruptions at the beginning .
the satellite tracking systems and control bridges have passed repeated checks .
the primary concern now is that there will not be enough time to install on-board computers in every truck that wants one .
in order to meet the august 31 start date , some 5,000 obus need to be installed every day .
but according to germany 's freight traffic association , only one percent of heavy trucks actually have appointments to have the units installed . on august 15 , an independent commission investigating the toll system 's introduction will report to germany 's department of transportation whether or not the program can begin as scheduled . " i want to see the program succeed from the beginning , and not start in chaos , " said transportation minister manfred stolpe . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german truck toll runs into eu roadblocks the european commission is scrutinizing berlin ’ s plan to impose a road toll on trucks using german autobahns amid its own proposals to standardize road toll charges throughout the eu .

the two banks , jp morgan chase and citigroup , stood accused by the us financial watchdog , the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- , of helping enron cover up its financial weakness " each institution helped enron mislead its investors by characterising what were essentially loan proceeds as cash from operating activities , " the sec said .
also on monday , the bankruptcy examiner working on enron 's restructuring filed a report on monday saying a $ 5bn claim by six banks including both jp morgan and citigroup on the stricken company might might be pushed to the back of the queue .
in a report to the bankruptcy court , the examiner said he had evidence that the banks were well aware they were lending money for " wrongful conduct " which would cheat investors .
manhattan case jp morgan chase is to pay the sec $ 135m , while citigroup agreed a settlement of $ 120m - although that figure includes $ 19m to settle a case involving another energy firm caught manipulating energy markets , dynergy .
both banks have also agreed to pay at least $ 25m each to settle a separate investigation by the manhattan district attorney , robert morgenthau .
in both cases , the settlement is dwarfed by the banks ' net worth and earnings .
jp morgan 's most recent three-monthly profits were $ 1.83bn , while citigroup 's amounted to $ 4.3bn.
shares in both rose following the announcement .
neither bank has admitted any wrongdoing and their acceptance of the sec 's settlement terms did not involve any admission of guilt .
sec enforcement chief stephen cutler said firms violated federal laws if they knew " or had reason to know " that they were helping a company mislead its investors .
landmark scandal enron filed for bankruptcy protection in late 2001 to gain protection from its creditors after admitting to a huge hole in its accounts .
enron turned out to be the first of a wave of similar accounting fraud cases which shattered investor confidence and sent stock markets nosediving downwards last year .
the sec said money from the settlement would go mostly to the victims of enron 's fraud .
however , enron 's creditors will only receive a portion of what they were owed under proposals the firm presented to the bankruptcy court .

the two banks , jp morgan chase and citigroup , stood accused by the us financial watchdog , the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- , of helping enron cover up its financial weakness " each institution helped enron mislead its investors by characterising what were essentially loan proceeds as cash from operating activities , " the sec said .
also on monday , the bankruptcy examiner working on enron 's restructuring filed a report on monday saying a $ 5bn claim by six banks including both jp morgan and citigroup on the stricken company might might be pushed to the back of the queue .
in a report to the bankruptcy court , the examiner said he had evidence that the banks were well aware they were lending money for " wrongful conduct " which would cheat investors .
manhattan case jp morgan chase is to pay the sec $ 135m , while citigroup agreed a settlement of $ 120m - although that figure includes $ 19m to settle a case involving another energy firm caught manipulating energy markets , dynergy .
both banks have also agreed to pay at least $ 25m each to settle a separate investigation by the manhattan district attorney , robert morgenthau .
in both cases , the settlement is dwarfed by the banks ' net worth and earnings .
jp morgan 's most recent three-monthly profits were $ 1.83bn , while citigroup 's amounted to $ 4.3bn.
shares in both rose following the announcement .
neither bank has admitted any wrongdoing and their acceptance of the sec 's settlement terms did not involve any admission of guilt .
sec enforcement chief stephen cutler said firms violated federal laws if they knew " or had reason to know " that they were helping a company mislead its investors .
landmark scandal enron filed for bankruptcy protection in late 2001 to gain protection from its creditors after admitting to a huge hole in its accounts .
enron turned out to be the first of a wave of similar accounting fraud cases which shattered investor confidence and sent stock markets nosediving downwards last year .

the nhs board agreed on tuesday to concentrate consultant-led services in paisley .
the move , along with the creation of midwife-led units in greenock and alexandria , was recommended after a group conducted a review of the area 's services .
public health director dr lesley wilkie , who chaired the group , said the aim was to ensure that the care on offer meets women 's needs .
" over the past two to three years , the falling birth numbers within argyll and clyde have combined with a number of other developments resulting in recruitment difficulties , particularly for junior paediatric medical staff , " she said .
" training requirements for junior doctors means that our smaller units are not providing enough of a range of cases for doctors to practice and maintain their skills .
redisign services " implementation of the european working time directive and the new deal for junior doctors has meant the need to employ more staff to cover on call rotas . "
dr wilkie said this had left the board unable to guarantee that it could sustain the existing pattern of services .
" we have become increasingly worried about compromising safety for women and their babies , hence the need for this review to decide how best to redesign services to ensure that we maintain a high quality , safe and , as far as possible , accessible service for women , " she said . "
midwives in argyll and clyde are currently undergoing extensive training to enhance their skills " dr lesley wilkie the vision being recommended to the board was centred on the expansion of community maternity units while still providing access to specialist services for women who need them .
" one-to-one midwifery care should be the norm for all women during pregnancy , labour and childbirth , " said dr wilkie .
" we need to realise the full potential of our midwives . "
the group produced its recommendations after a consultation exercise which included open forums , discussions with professional and voluntary groups and market research .
a community maternity unit is led and managed by midwives , occasionally with gp involvement .
it offers a range of services , including day care , early pregnancy assessment and a birthing unit for normal pregnancies .
not suitable however , epidurals must be carried out at a consultant-led unit , which will handle those births where there is deemed to be a risk .
dr wilkie said that , on average , 55 % of women would be eligible to give birth in community maternity units .
they are not suitable for mothers-to-be with a medical condition , such as diabetes , or those who have experienced problems during a previous pregnancy .
it is predicted that between 10 % and 20 % of women will have to be transferred to a consultant-led unit during labour , with the need for an epidural being the most common reason . "
one-to-one midwifery care should be the norm for all women during pregnancy , labour and childbirth " dr lesley wilkie " midwives in argyll and clyde are currently undergoing extensive training to enhance their skills , " said dr wilkie .
" where the mother requires transfer to a consultant-led unit , emergency care would be given by the midwife and transport arranged as appropriate .
" the midwife would go in the ambulance with the mother to the consultant led unit . "
concerns have been voiced about the impact of the closure of a consultant-led unit in greenock on other services at the town 's inverclyde royal hospital .
dr wilkie accepted that the proposals would have an effect on paediatrics , gynaecology , anaesthetics , accident and emergency and the ambulance service .
wider review " the intensive care unit for newborn babies will be located on the same site as the consultant-led unit , " she said .
" the wider impact on paediatrics will , however , be assessed as part of the overall redesign process .
" the impact on anaesthetics accident and emergency and gynaecology services is being assessed as part of a wider review of health care services within argyll and clyde .
" we are currently working with the ambulance service to identify numbers of ambulances and paramedics required under each of the options .
additional training has already started to enhance the skill of paramedic staff . "

the food commission said billions of dollars a year were spent globally on marketing foods high in sugar , salt and fat .
the adverts , mainly on television and sometimes targeted at children as young as two , were eclipsing any messages given to children about healthy eating , it said .
kath dalmeny from the commission told bbc news : " unfortunately the kinds of foods that attract the biggest advertising budgets are the fattiest , and sugariest , and saltiest .
" those are just the things that children should be eating less of , not more of ...
" these are the ones that are advertised on children 's television , to children , saying these are great exciting , fun things that will improve your performance . "
she said parents could not necessarily be blamed because they had no way of telling from the adverts that some cereals , for instance , were 40 or 50 % sugar .
junk food and sugary drinks are supported by enormous advertising budgets that dwarf any attempt to educate children about healthy diets food commission the commission urged the world health organisation to consider banning adverts for " energy-dense , low-nutrient " food aimed at children .
it said the marketing of such food and drink in schools should be outlawed .
all tv adverts for food should be pre-vetted , it said .
there should be publicly-funded incentives for food companies to improve the nutritional content of their products .
the commission also expressed alarm at the way advertising was being aimed at children with techniques such as websites and link-ups with films .
food industry fights back but the food industry said its adverts were responsible .
the food and drink federation , a trade body representing manufacturers in the uk , said : " uk food and drink manufacturers take a very responsible view of their relationships with children .
" there are already strict codes of practice governing advertising .

nine of the rare birds have been raised at a secret location in dumfries and galloway by conservationists who are trying to restore the area 's red kite population .
rspb scotland and scottish natural heritage are backing the dumfries and galloway red kite project , which has already succeeded in rearing the first chick in the area for more than 100 years .
the kites were transported from wild nests in northern scotland and the chilterns in the hope that they will make their own nests in dumfries and galloway , once home to a thriving kite population .
the birds are protected by law , but have fallen victim to illegal poisoning which conservationists claim is linked to shooting parties .
this is the first time that red kites have bred in dumfries and galloway since 1870 kevin duffy project officer this is the first time that red kites have bred in dumfries and galloway since 1870 .
five red kites which were released in the first two years of the project have been found poisoned .
red kite project officer kevin duffy said : " this is the first time that red kites have bred in dumfries and galloway since 1870 and we can really start to feel that all the hard work and co-operation between the partner organisations and local landowners is beginning to pay off .
" red kites are spectacular birds and they are already beginning to draw visitors into the area . "
mr duffy added that a galloway kite trail aimed at luring tourists to the area was due to open in september .
rspb scotland 's area manager for dumfries and galloway , chris rollie , said : " bringing our native wildlife back to where it belongs is a big challenge , but the reward is the reaction of people from all walks of life . "

the government , led by president luis inacio lula da silva since his stunning election victory last year , has confounded doomsayers who predicted his leftwing workers party would send investors running for the exits .
instead , the real - brazil 's currency - is up 22 % on the year , while the bovespa stock market has also shot upwards .
but recent strikes opposing a badly-needed shakeup of the massive public pension system , and growing disputes with the landless workers ' movement -lrb- movimento dos trabalhadores rurais sem terra , or mst -rrb- sent both currency and markets down on monday .
the falls came as an international monetary fund mission visited the capital brasilia , to discuss whether brazil wants - or needs - to keep drawing on a $ 30bn loan negotiated by the previous government last september and intended to stabilise the economy .
honeymoon the troubles are the first real sign of a bump in the road for president da silva .
thus far the economic picture has presented a sharp turnaround from the run on the real and the dive on the stock market that preceded his election .
the promise to the imf of a 4.25 % budget surplus before interest payments on brazil 's $ 250bn debt has been easily met , and interest rates are on the way down - albeit from sky-high levels approaching 30 % - in the hope of reinvigorating investment and avoiding recession .
but now things are looking slightly stickier .
a powerful coalition of officials and judges is looking to block the pension reforms , aimed at chopping back on a system that gives senior public servants massive pensions even if they continue to work while private sector employees get a pittance .
land reform meanwhile , the organisations representing landless and homesless workers - long-time allies of the workers ' party - are stepping up their activities .
on the one hand , the mtst - a body representing urban workers housed in the brutal shanty towns or favelas - has occupied plants left idle by german car firm volkswagen in sao paulo , brazil 's southern commercial capital .
at the same time , the rural mst is turning up the heat on the country 's 27,000 large landowners , whose tight control over arable land is widely blamed for the grinding poverty afflicting a majority of brazilians .
the mst 's leader last week called for " battle " against landowners , a prospect that scared the governors of brazil 's poorest region , the north-east .
governor wilma de faria from rio grande do norte state called the situation a " powder-keg " , while neighbouring ceara 's lucio alcantara said the government had been taken by surprise by the strength of feeling .
the workers ' party 's commitment to land reform was one of the most popular parts of its platform in last year 's election , but even its backers worry that progress has been too slow - and that too little has been done to enforce dialogue , rather than violence .

the government , led by president luis inacio lula da silva since his stunning election victory last year , has confounded doomsayers who predicted his leftwing workers party would send investors running for the exits .
instead , the real - brazil 's currency - is up 22 % on the year , while the bovespa stock market has also shot upwards .
but recent strikes opposing a badly-needed shakeup of the massive public pension system , and growing disputes with the landless workers ' movement -lrb- movimento dos trabalhadores rurais sem terra , or mst -rrb- sent both currency and markets down on monday .
the falls came as an international monetary fund mission visited the capital brasilia , to discuss whether brazil wants - or needs - to keep drawing on a $ 30bn loan negotiated by the previous government last september and intended to stabilise the economy .
honeymoon the troubles are the first real sign of a bump in the road for president da silva .
thus far the economic picture has presented a sharp turnaround from the run on the real and the dive on the stock market that preceded his election .
the promise to the imf of a 4.25 % budget surplus before interest payments on brazil 's $ 250bn debt has been easily met , and interest rates are on the way down - albeit from sky-high levels approaching 30 % - in the hope of reinvigorating investment and avoiding recession .
brazil 's markets have been pleasantly surprised by lula but now things are looking slightly stickier .
a powerful coalition of officials and judges is looking to block the pension reforms , aimed at chopping back on a system that gives senior public servants massive pensions even if they continue to work while private sector employees get a pittance .
land reform meanwhile , the organisations representing landless and homesless workers - long-time allies of the workers ' party - are stepping up their activities .
on the one hand , the mtst - a body representing urban workers housed in the brutal shanty towns or favelas - has occupied plants left idle by german car firm volkswagen in sao paulo , brazil 's southern commercial capital .
at the same time , the rural mst is turning up the heat on the country 's 27,000 large landowners , whose tight control over arable land is widely blamed for the grinding poverty afflicting a majority of brazilians .
the mst 's leader last week called for " battle " against landowners , a prospect that scared the governors of brazil 's poorest region , the north-east .
governor wilma de faria from rio grande do norte state called the situation a " powder-keg " , while neighbouring ceara 's lucio alcantara said the government had been taken by surprise by the strength of feeling .
the workers ' party 's commitment to land reform was one of the most popular parts of its platform in last year 's election , but even its backers worry that progress has been too slow - and that too little has been done to enforce dialogue , rather than violence .

in a highly unusual move , north wales chief constable richard brunstrom called a news conference to hit back at 71-year-old bill shaw .
mr shaw had said his prosecution for doing 39mph in a 30mph zone was unfair , and ended his 50-year clean driving record .
but police produced video footage which they said showed mr shaw had not been speeding to overtake a tractor , as he had claimed .
mr shaw , of llangollen , had pleaded guilty three weeks ago to speeding in flintshire in the hope that magistrates would reject the case .

richard brunstrom shows the video footage to journalists magistrates fined him £ 60 , with £ 30 costs and three penalty points , and said they had " every sympathy " with him .
but magistrates ' chairman kathleen cottle said their hands were tied and had to follow guidelines .
mr brunstrom has now accused mr shaw of giving a misleading account .
video of the moment when he was caught in his bmw was shown at the news conference , and reporters were handed 31 photographs of the sequence .
mr brunstrom told bbc radio wales that mr shaw had touched a nerve .
" i 'm extremely disappointed by the irresponsible attitude of somebody in mr shaw 's position , " he said .
he said speeding was anti-social , dangerous and affected lives , and the spot where mr shaw was caught was where a young pedestrian had been killed .

but he had no regrets about the attack .

mr brunstrom said anti-speeding was " most certainly " a personal crusade for him .
there were 13 people alive in north wales alone who would otherwise have died last year .
" the danger of course of being engaged on a crusade is that you lose context and you become fixated on one objective and of course i must make sure that does n't happen to me . "
when mr shaw was told later about the criticism , he said the chief constable must be desperate to make such a fuss over such a trivial case .
he said mr brunstrom had placed his own interpretation on events .
mr shaw was upset that the chief constable suggested he was driving dangerously , when he said he obviously was not .

but the strengthening euro spells trouble ahead , the firm admitted , as it downgraded expectations of its sales for the full year .
the first half had already produced a significant difference between the real increase in sales - 1.7 % - and the like-for-like increase taking currency changes and the shifting pattern of its business into account , which was 3.9 % .
now france telecom has said its full-year revenues will be up 3-5 % on the like-for-like basis , whereas before it was promising a real 3.5 % boost .
wireless help as in previous periods , mobile phone arm orange provided a sizable sales boost , and france telecom was keen to point to solid gains in revenue per user everywhere outside france itself .
operating profits at orange were up 68 % to 2.1bn euros , while sales rose 6.9 % to 8.6bn euros and the subscriber base expanded by 1.3 million to 45.6 million customers .
similarly , the wanadoo internet operation saw breakneck growth as the company increased its sales of adsl broadband data connections .
but the traditional fixed-line side of the business continued to drag on the group as a whole , with sales within france falling almost 5 % from 2002 to 2003 and corporate network sales outside france down almost 20 % - largely due to the euro 's negative effect .
new look france telecom is still trying to manage the massive debt burden it built up during its 1990s buying spree - one effect of which was to drive investors away last year , triggering a 62.5 % slide in its stock price .
this year , following promises of a root-and-branch restructuring programme dubbed top , the shares are back up by 45 % .
analysts remain sceptical , however , so france telecom laid out a range of savings to try to bring them around .
it is promising to concentrate on organic growth , rather than acquisitions as it did before , trumpeting " reductions in corporate lifestyle such as streamlining business travel and ... sponsorship " .
it has also remodelled management and sales teams to make them more responsive , a long-levelled criticism being the company 's bureaucratic tendencies .
