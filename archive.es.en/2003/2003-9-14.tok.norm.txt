the call by the national society for the prevention of cruelty to children -lrb- nspcc -rrb- comes in its response to the newly published green paper , which proposes a range of new measures in the wake of the victoria climbie inquiry .
the nspcc said it was " disappointed " the government had not proposed tightening the law governing family relationships and had failed to impose a legal duty on parents to promote their children 's well-being , as exists in scotland .
children that are n't disciplined become muggers and crack dealers bill hibberd , parent organisation it is urging ministers to use new legislation to remove the legal defence of " reasonable chastisement " - which enables parents to smack their children without fear of prosecution for assault .
" the nspcc believes that if society is serious about wanting to reduce the number of children who are severely abused then it must create a culture in which children are respected and treated as equal citizens with rights of their own , not as adjuncts of their parents , " the charity said .
however it did say the green paper , every child matters , represented the " most significant opportunity for children in a generation " .
parents ' rights campigners argue adults should be allowed to discipline their children with smacking .
bill hibberd , director of the parent organisation , said children suffered if their parents failed to discipline them when necessary .
identity numbers sometimes a " tap " on the bottom was the answer , he said .
" children that are n't disciplined become muggers and crack dealers .
" they are the ones running around the streets because mummy and daddy did n't want to tell them off , " he said .
" the parent organisation does n't want to see any child abused , nor do we want to see all children lacking discipline .
" we say that a short , sharp smack on the bottom for a child who is being unreasonable is not unreasonable chastisement . "
unless these -lrb- privacy -rrb- rights are protected there is a risk that children will not access services nspcc in its response to the green paper , the nspcc also warns that moves to improve information sharing on children at risk of abuse could encourage some of the most vulnerable to " disappear " from the system .
the government has proposed creating a record of every child , which could be shared between local authorities , police and social services .
to improve tracking and sharing of information between child care services , all children be given an identity number .
' far-reaching reform ' but the nspcc said this had to be balanced against children 's privacy .
" unless these rights are protected there is a risk that children will not access services , both for fear of losing these rights and concern about the consequences of doing so . "
the green paper , currently out for consultation , includes proposals for the creation of an independent children 's commissioner , who would act as a " champion " for young people .
prime minister tony blair said the changes would be " the most far-reaching reform of children 's services for 30 years " .
the idea of a children 's commissioner post for england was supported by lord laming in his report into the death of victoria climbie .
victoria died in north london in 2000 , after prolonged neglect and cruelty by her carers .
lord laming 's report said that she had been seen by various professionals who did not share information and failed to save her .
wales already has a children 's commissioner , and scotland and northern ireland are about to appoint commissioners .

the call by the national society for the prevention of cruelty to children -lrb- nspcc -rrb- comes in its response to the newly published green paper , which proposes a range of new measures in the wake of the victoria climbie inquiry .
the nspcc said it was " disappointed " the government had not proposed tightening the law governing family relationships and had failed to impose a legal duty on parents to promote their children 's well-being , as exists in scotland .

" children that are n't disciplined become muggers and crack dealers .
" they are the ones running around the streets because mummy and daddy did n't want to tell them off , " he said .
" the parent organisation does n't want to see any child abused , nor do we want to see all children lacking discipline .
" we say that a short , sharp smack on the bottom for a child who is being unreasonable is not unreasonable chastisement . "
unless these -lrb- privacy -rrb- rights are protected there is a risk that children will not access services nspcc in its response to the green paper , the nspcc also warns that moves to improve information sharing on children at risk of abuse could encourage some of the most vulnerable to " disappear " from the system .
the government has proposed creating a record of every child , which could be shared between local authorities , police and social services .
to improve tracking and sharing of information between child care services , all children be given an identity number .
' far-reaching reform ' but the nspcc said this had to be balanced against children 's privacy .
" unless these rights are protected there is a risk that children will not access services , both for fear of losing these rights and concern about the consequences of doing so . "
the green paper , currently out for consultation , includes proposals for the creation of an independent children 's commissioner , who would act as a " champion " for young people .
prime minister tony blair said the changes would be " the most far-reaching reform of children 's services for 30 years " .
the idea of a children 's commissioner post for england was supported by lord laming in his report into the death of victoria climbie .
victoria died in north london in 2000 , after prolonged neglect and cruelty by her carers .
lord laming 's report said that she had been seen by various professionals who did not share information and failed to save her .
wales already has a children 's commissioner , and scotland and northern ireland are about to appoint commissioners .
