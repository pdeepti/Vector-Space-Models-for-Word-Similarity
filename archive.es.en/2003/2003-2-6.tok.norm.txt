boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 06.02.2003 powell fails to change german opposition on iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumsfeld sees strange bedfellows for chancellor schröder : cuba 's fidel castro and libya 's moammar gadhafi .
as germany renewed its opposition to war against iraq after powell 's speech , u.s. defense secretary , rumsfeld directed a new dart at it , saying germany , libya and cuba are the only countries not helping american efforts . germany 's leaders , having listened attentively to u.s. secretary of state colin powell 's arguments against the iraqi leadership at the u.n. security council , said on thursday that they remained unconvinced that the government should change its opposition to any war against iraq .
the spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder said the government " welcomed " the extensive information presented by powell on wednesday .
" germany is just as concerned as others about the indications that iraq continues to possess weapons of mass destruction , " béla anda said in an statement .
together with the majority of security council members , germany demands that the presented facts be handed over to the u.n. weapons inspectors to be verified , he said .
anda stressed that the inspectors needed the " required time and necessary measures " for their work .
" the german government will continue with all of its powers to speak for a peaceful settlement of the conflict , " anda said .
opposition presses schröder but members of germany 's opposition parties expressed renewed disagreement with schröder and his pledge to have a german vote against any resolution in the u.n. security council that authorized a war on iraq .
" the german chancellor was the only one to jump the gun and isolate the country , " said angela merkel , the chairwoman of germany 's biggest opposition party , the christian democratic union .
" i think this self-imposed isolation is wrong because it does not serve germany 's interests . "
powell 's calm , factual presentation on wednesday was accompanied by another blast of harsh anti-german rhetoric from defense minister donald rumsfeld .
referring to a possible coalition that would join a war on iraq , rumsfeld told a house committee : " then , there are three or four countries that have said they wo n't do anything .
i believe libya , cuba and germany are ones that have indicated they wo n't help in any respect . "
even though rumsfeld said the germans were not helping , they are actually providing support .
germany is assigning 2,600 soldiers to guard 95 u.s. bases and facilities within the country , and schröder has promised the americans that they could use these bases to conduct any war .
the u.s. ambassador in berlin , daniel coats , attempted to tone down rumsfeld 's statements , which came two weeks after he said germany and france belonged to the " old europe " .
in an interview with the daily newspaper berliner zeitung , coats said the defense secretary was not speaking for the u.s. government .
but coats said the german government , together with france , had weakened the pressure on saddam hussein .
" what an irony : the two countries that had persistently pressured the u.s. to refrain from using violence became active in a manner which makes the use of military force more likely , " he said .
" this is extremely frustrating . "
more time for inspectors sought chancellor gerhard schröder and france 's president jacques chirac demanded more time for the u.n. weapons inspectors shortly before chief inspector hans blix presented his report at the end of january .
according to coats , germany should be worried about the consequences .
" serious doubts have arisen in the american public whether germany is still a dependable partner , " he said .
" this harms our relations and it certainly harms germany . "
he added that this could also have economic repercussions .
" there is always the possibility that behavior in other areas could also influence economic relations . "
angelika beer , the co-leader of the greens party , played down rumsfeld 's comments .
" i do n't take them so seriously , " said beer , whose party is the junior coalition partner in the german government .
additional dialogue urged but she said the comments indicated that both countries needed to intensify their dialogue .
" the more critical a relationship is , the more important a dialogue is , " she told the news agency reuters .
during his presentation , powell urged security council members to demand more forcefully that baghdad quickly provide evidence about its weapons programs .
but the 15-member council remains sharply divided over rushing to war .
while the united states and britain said time was fast running out for iraq to fully cooperate with u.n. inspectors , france , russia , china and many other council members called for continued inspections and a peaceful resolution of the crisis .
powell 's anxiously awaited presentation to the security council used newly declassified intelligence , including satellite photos and radio intercepts , to support the u.s. case that iraq has defied all demands that it disarm and has links to al-qaida and other terrorist groups .
he warned that iraq 's weapons of mass destruction threaten the world and urged the council to move against saddam or face " irrelevance .

on wednesday , the american chamber of commerce in germany issued a report showing that u.s. companies are the greatest single investor in germany and that there are currently no signs tensions between berlin and washington has had any impact on business ties .
" the german-american economic relationship is very deep and very good , " said chamber of commerce president fred irwin .

11 attacks . hamburg - as his trial entered its final phase wednesday , mounir el motassadeq stared back at prosecutors in a hamburg court as they repeated the evidence against him , sometimes shaking his head , sometimes smiling in disbelief .
portraying him as an integral and reliable member of the hamburg-based terrorist cell behind the sept .
11 hijiackings and terror attacks in new york and washington holding similar extremist beliefs , german federal prosecutors ended their closing arguments with the request that motassadeq be sentenced to 15 years in prison .
motassadeq , who is accused of managing financial transactions for members of the terror cell , has maintained that his efforts were no more than favors typical among muslims .
he denies knowing anything about what suspected sept .
11 mastermind mohammed atta and his group were planning .
but the plaintiffs in the case have painted an altogether different picture .
three federal prosecutors and three lawyers for the 21 american co-plaintiffs in the case before hamburg 's higher regional court gave closing arguments before the seven judges who will decide motassadeq 's fate .
defense attorneys are scheduled to give their arguments next wednesday .
the 28-year-old moroccan student is charged with accessory to murder in more than 3,000 cases for the sept .
11 attacks .
he also faces charges of membership in a terrorist organization , which chief judge albrecht menz said tuesday could be reduced to support of a terrorist organization , which can carry a five-year sentence .
" one of the muscles " in his closing statement , co-plaintiff lawyer ulrich von jeinsen said motasssadeq was , if not the arm , then at least " one of the muscles without which the arm would n't have functioned . "
for four months , the prosecution has sought to piece together witness testimony and law enforcement investigation reports to prove how deeply motassedeq was involved with the terrorist group .
on wednesday , they took more than four hours to outline his journey from moroccan student at hamburg 's harburg technical university in 1993 to a close and trusted friend of the hamburg cell of hijackers in the months leading up to sept .
11 .
" the small pieces , unto themselves , might not appear to be much , " said chief prosecutor walter hemberger .
" but together they form a mosaic that proves the guilt and full awareness of the accused . "
hemberger added : " the defendant decided to sacrifice himself to an ideology that despises humanity , he was closely integrated into atta 's group . "
hemberger accused motassadeq of attempting to " veil " the truth about his role in the attacks and called on him to come clean .
" mr. el motassadeq , " he said , " you still have the chance to change the outcome in your favor if you give a complete confession . "
prosecutors say he covered terrorists ' tracks the prosecution paid special attention to motassadeq 's connection to marwan al-shehhi , who flew united airlines flight 175 into the south tower of the world trade center .
motassadeq had power of attorney over al-shehhi 's account at dresdner bank in hamburg .
prosecutors say he used it to cover the tracks of al-shehhi while the united arab emirates native finalized plans in afghanistan for the attacks and learned to fly at a school in florida .
while he was gone , motassadeq paid al-shehhi 's bills and his tuition fees for the summer 2000 semester at harburg technical .
he also approved a € 2,550 -lrb- $ 2,753 -rrb- wire transfer that paid for al-shehhi 's flight school fees .
" the accused , " said hemberger , was " the treasurer , " while atta and the other members of the group were away .
the prosecution also recounted the testimony of witnesses who described the " radicalization " of members of the hamburg group , including motassadeq .
he began to identify with the anti-american , anti-semitic beliefs of the others and supported violent means to battle against the united states and israel , said prosecutors .
in summer 2000 , he traveled to afghanistan and took part in the same al qaeda training camps attended by other members of the hamburg cell .
" motassadeq was permanently integrated into the group , " said matthias krauss , one of three federal prosecutors trying the case .
defense attorneys will argue the exact opposite next week .
they are expected to make the case that motassadeq , who was taken into custody shortly after sept .
11 , did n't make any attempt to leave germany because he was innocent and knew nothing of the plans for the attacks .
motassadeq 's lawyers have bemoaned the absence of statements made by two hamburg cell members they believe would clear their client .
the statements were made by ramzi binalshibh , who is currently in u.s. custody after his arrest in pakistan , and mohammed haydar zammar , who is allegedly being held in a syrian jail .
motassadeq 's attorneys repeatedly sought to secure the documents as evidence in the trial , but germany 's interior ministry and its foreign intelligence agency , the bundesnachrichtendienst , have refused to turn them over to the court .

he began to identify with the anti-american , anti-semitic beliefs of the others and supported violent means to battle against the united states and israel , said prosecutors .
in summer 2000 , he traveled to afghanistan and took part in the same al qaeda training camps attended by other members of the hamburg cell .
" motassadeq was permanently integrated into the group , " said matthias krauss , one of three federal prosecutors trying the case .
defense attorneys will argue the exact opposite next week .
they are expected to make the case that motassadeq , who was taken into custody shortly after sept .

motassadeq 's lawyers have bemoaned the absence of statements made by two hamburg cell members they believe would clear their client .
the statements were made by ramzi binalshibh , who is currently in u.s. custody after his arrest in pakistan , and mohammed haydar zammar , who is allegedly being held in a syrian jail .
motassadeq 's attorneys repeatedly sought to secure the documents as evidence in the trial , but germany 's interior ministry and its foreign intelligence agency , the bundesnachrichtendienst , have refused to turn them over to the court .

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 06.02.2003 powell fails to change german opposition on iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumsfeld sees strange bedfellows for chancellor schröder : cuba 's fidel castro and libya 's moammar gadhafi .
as germany renewed its opposition to war against iraq after powell 's speech , u.s. defense secretary , rumsfeld directed a new dart at it , saying germany , libya and cuba are the only countries not helping american efforts . germany 's leaders , having listened attentively to u.s. secretary of state colin powell 's arguments against the iraqi leadership at the u.n. security council , said on thursday that they remained unconvinced that the government should change its opposition to any war against iraq .
the spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder said the government " welcomed " the extensive information presented by powell on wednesday .
" germany is just as concerned as others about the indications that iraq continues to possess weapons of mass destruction , " béla anda said in an statement .
together with the majority of security council members , germany demands that the presented facts be handed over to the u.n. weapons inspectors to be verified , he said .
anda stressed that the inspectors needed the " required time and necessary measures " for their work .
" the german government will continue with all of its powers to speak for a peaceful settlement of the conflict , " anda said .
opposition presses schröder but members of germany 's opposition parties expressed renewed disagreement with schröder and his pledge to have a german vote against any resolution in the u.n. security council that authorized a war on iraq .
" the german chancellor was the only one to jump the gun and isolate the country , " said angela merkel , the chairwoman of germany 's biggest opposition party , the christian democratic union .
" i think this self-imposed isolation is wrong because it does not serve germany 's interests . "
powell 's calm , factual presentation on wednesday was accompanied by another blast of harsh anti-german rhetoric from defense minister donald rumsfeld .
referring to a possible coalition that would join a war on iraq , rumsfeld told a house committee : " then , there are three or four countries that have said they wo n't do anything .
i believe libya , cuba and germany are ones that have indicated they wo n't help in any respect . "
even though rumsfeld said the germans were not helping , they are actually providing support .
germany is assigning 2,600 soldiers to guard 95 u.s. bases and facilities within the country , and schröder has promised the americans that they could use these bases to conduct any war .
the u.s. ambassador in berlin , daniel coats , attempted to tone down rumsfeld 's statements , which came two weeks after he said germany and france belonged to the " old europe " .
in an interview with the daily newspaper berliner zeitung , coats said the defense secretary was not speaking for the u.s. government .
but coats said the german government , together with france , had weakened the pressure on saddam hussein .
" what an irony : the two countries that had persistently pressured the u.s. to refrain from using violence became active in a manner which makes the use of military force more likely , " he said .
" this is extremely frustrating . "
more time for inspectors sought chancellor gerhard schröder and france 's president jacques chirac demanded more time for the u.n. weapons inspectors shortly before chief inspector hans blix presented his report at the end of january .
according to coats , germany should be worried about the consequences .
" serious doubts have arisen in the american public whether germany is still a dependable partner , " he said .
" this harms our relations and it certainly harms germany . "
he added that this could also have economic repercussions .
" there is always the possibility that behavior in other areas could also influence economic relations . "
angelika beer , the co-leader of the greens party , played down rumsfeld 's comments .
" i do n't take them so seriously , " said beer , whose party is the junior coalition partner in the german government .
additional dialogue urged but she said the comments indicated that both countries needed to intensify their dialogue .
" the more critical a relationship is , the more important a dialogue is , " she told the news agency reuters .
during his presentation , powell urged security council members to demand more forcefully that baghdad quickly provide evidence about its weapons programs .
but the 15-member council remains sharply divided over rushing to war .
while the united states and britain said time was fast running out for iraq to fully cooperate with u.n. inspectors , france , russia , china and many other council members called for continued inspections and a peaceful resolution of the crisis .
powell 's anxiously awaited presentation to the security council used newly declassified intelligence , including satellite photos and radio intercepts , to support the u.s. case that iraq has defied all demands that it disarm and has links to al-qaida and other terrorist groups .
he warned that iraq 's weapons of mass destruction threaten the world and urged the council to move against saddam or face " irrelevance .

11 attacks . hamburg - as his trial entered its final phase wednesday , mounir el motassadeq stared back at prosecutors in a hamburg court as they repeated the evidence against him , sometimes shaking his head , sometimes smiling in disbelief .
portraying him as an integral and reliable member of the hamburg-based terrorist cell behind the sept .
11 hijiackings and terror attacks in new york and washington holding similar extremist beliefs , german federal prosecutors ended their closing arguments with the request that motassadeq be sentenced to 15 years in prison .
motassadeq , who is accused of managing financial transactions for members of the terror cell , has maintained that his efforts were no more than favors typical among muslims .
he denies knowing anything about what suspected sept .
11 mastermind mohammed atta and his group were planning .
but the plaintiffs in the case have painted an altogether different picture .
three federal prosecutors and three lawyers for the 21 american co-plaintiffs in the case before hamburg 's higher regional court gave closing arguments before the seven judges who will decide motassadeq 's fate .
defense attorneys are scheduled to give their arguments next wednesday .
the 28-year-old moroccan student is charged with accessory to murder in more than 3,000 cases for the sept .
11 attacks .
he also faces charges of membership in a terrorist organization , which chief judge albrecht menz said tuesday could be reduced to support of a terrorist organization , which can carry a five-year sentence .
" one of the muscles " in his closing statement , co-plaintiff lawyer ulrich von jeinsen said motasssadeq was , if not the arm , then at least " one of the muscles without which the arm would n't have functioned . "
for four months , the prosecution has sought to piece together witness testimony and law enforcement investigation reports to prove how deeply motassedeq was involved with the terrorist group .
on wednesday , they took more than four hours to outline his journey from moroccan student at hamburg 's harburg technical university in 1993 to a close and trusted friend of the hamburg cell of hijackers in the months leading up to sept .
11 .
" the small pieces , unto themselves , might not appear to be much , " said chief prosecutor walter hemberger .
" but together they form a mosaic that proves the guilt and full awareness of the accused . "
hemberger added : " the defendant decided to sacrifice himself to an ideology that despises humanity , he was closely integrated into atta 's group . "
hemberger accused motassadeq of attempting to " veil " the truth about his role in the attacks and called on him to come clean .
" mr. el motassadeq , " he said , " you still have the chance to change the outcome in your favor if you give a complete confession . "
prosecutors say he covered terrorists ' tracks the prosecution paid special attention to motassadeq 's connection to marwan al-shehhi , who flew united airlines flight 175 into the south tower of the world trade center .
motassadeq had power of attorney over al-shehhi 's account at dresdner bank in hamburg .
prosecutors say he used it to cover the tracks of al-shehhi while the united arab emirates native finalized plans in afghanistan for the attacks and learned to fly at a school in florida .
while he was gone , motassadeq paid al-shehhi 's bills and his tuition fees for the summer 2000 semester at harburg technical .

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 06.02.2003 powell fails to change german opposition on iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumsfeld sees strange bedfellows for chancellor schröder : cuba 's fidel castro and libya 's moammar gadhafi .
as germany renewed its opposition to war against iraq after powell 's speech , u.s. defense secretary , rumsfeld directed a new dart at it , saying germany , libya and cuba are the only countries not helping american efforts . germany 's leaders , having listened attentively to u.s. secretary of state colin powell 's arguments against the iraqi leadership at the u.n. security council , said on thursday that they remained unconvinced that the government should change its opposition to any war against iraq .
the spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder said the government " welcomed " the extensive information presented by powell on wednesday .
" germany is just as concerned as others about the indications that iraq continues to possess weapons of mass destruction , " béla anda said in an statement .
together with the majority of security council members , germany demands that the presented facts be handed over to the u.n. weapons inspectors to be verified , he said .
anda stressed that the inspectors needed the " required time and necessary measures " for their work .
" the german government will continue with all of its powers to speak for a peaceful settlement of the conflict , " anda said .
opposition presses schröder but members of germany 's opposition parties expressed renewed disagreement with schröder and his pledge to have a german vote against any resolution in the u.n. security council that authorized a war on iraq .
" the german chancellor was the only one to jump the gun and isolate the country , " said angela merkel , the chairwoman of germany 's biggest opposition party , the christian democratic union .
" i think this self-imposed isolation is wrong because it does not serve germany 's interests . "
powell 's calm , factual presentation on wednesday was accompanied by another blast of harsh anti-german rhetoric from defense minister donald rumsfeld .
referring to a possible coalition that would join a war on iraq , rumsfeld told a house committee : " then , there are three or four countries that have said they wo n't do anything .
i believe libya , cuba and germany are ones that have indicated they wo n't help in any respect . "
even though rumsfeld said the germans were not helping , they are actually providing support .
germany is assigning 2,600 soldiers to guard 95 u.s. bases and facilities within the country , and schröder has promised the americans that they could use these bases to conduct any war .
the u.s. ambassador in berlin , daniel coats , attempted to tone down rumsfeld 's statements , which came two weeks after he said germany and france belonged to the " old europe " .
in an interview with the daily newspaper berliner zeitung , coats said the defense secretary was not speaking for the u.s. government .
but coats said the german government , together with france , had weakened the pressure on saddam hussein .
" what an irony : the two countries that had persistently pressured the u.s. to refrain from using violence became active in a manner which makes the use of military force more likely , " he said .
" this is extremely frustrating . "
more time for inspectors sought chancellor gerhard schröder and france 's president jacques chirac demanded more time for the u.n. weapons inspectors shortly before chief inspector hans blix presented his report at the end of january .
according to coats , germany should be worried about the consequences .
" serious doubts have arisen in the american public whether germany is still a dependable partner , " he said .
" this harms our relations and it certainly harms germany . "
he added that this could also have economic repercussions .
" there is always the possibility that behavior in other areas could also influence economic relations . "
angelika beer , the co-leader of the greens party , played down rumsfeld 's comments .
" i do n't take them so seriously , " said beer , whose party is the junior coalition partner in the german government .
additional dialogue urged but she said the comments indicated that both countries needed to intensify their dialogue .
" the more critical a relationship is , the more important a dialogue is , " she told the news agency reuters .
during his presentation , powell urged security council members to demand more forcefully that baghdad quickly provide evidence about its weapons programs .
but the 15-member council remains sharply divided over rushing to war .
while the united states and britain said time was fast running out for iraq to fully cooperate with u.n. inspectors , france , russia , china and many other council members called for continued inspections and a peaceful resolution of the crisis .
powell 's anxiously awaited presentation to the security council used newly declassified intelligence , including satellite photos and radio intercepts , to support the u.s. case that iraq has defied all demands that it disarm and has links to al-qaida and other terrorist groups .
he warned that iraq 's weapons of mass destruction threaten the world and urged the council to move against saddam or face " irrelevance .

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 06.02.2003 powell fails to change german opposition on iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumsfeld sees strange bedfellows for chancellor schröder : cuba 's fidel castro and libya 's moammar gadhafi .
as germany renewed its opposition to war against iraq after powell 's speech , u.s. defense secretary , rumsfeld directed a new dart at it , saying germany , libya and cuba are the only countries not helping american efforts . germany 's leaders , having listened attentively to u.s. secretary of state colin powell 's arguments against the iraqi leadership at the u.n. security council , said on thursday that they remained unconvinced that the government should change its opposition to any war against iraq .
the spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder said the government " welcomed " the extensive information presented by powell on wednesday .
" germany is just as concerned as others about the indications that iraq continues to possess weapons of mass destruction , " béla anda said in an statement .
together with the majority of security council members , germany demands that the presented facts be handed over to the u.n. weapons inspectors to be verified , he said .
anda stressed that the inspectors needed the " required time and necessary measures " for their work .
" the german government will continue with all of its powers to speak for a peaceful settlement of the conflict , " anda said .
opposition presses schröder but members of germany 's opposition parties expressed renewed disagreement with schröder and his pledge to have a german vote against any resolution in the u.n. security council that authorized a war on iraq .
" the german chancellor was the only one to jump the gun and isolate the country , " said angela merkel , the chairwoman of germany 's biggest opposition party , the christian democratic union .
" i think this self-imposed isolation is wrong because it does not serve germany 's interests . "
powell 's calm , factual presentation on wednesday was accompanied by another blast of harsh anti-german rhetoric from defense minister donald rumsfeld .
referring to a possible coalition that would join a war on iraq , rumsfeld told a house committee : " then , there are three or four countries that have said they wo n't do anything .
i believe libya , cuba and germany are ones that have indicated they wo n't help in any respect . "
even though rumsfeld said the germans were not helping , they are actually providing support .
germany is assigning 2,600 soldiers to guard 95 u.s. bases and facilities within the country , and schröder has promised the americans that they could use these bases to conduct any war .
the u.s. ambassador in berlin , daniel coats , attempted to tone down rumsfeld 's statements , which came two weeks after he said germany and france belonged to the " old europe " .
in an interview with the daily newspaper berliner zeitung , coats said the defense secretary was not speaking for the u.s. government .
but coats said the german government , together with france , had weakened the pressure on saddam hussein .
" what an irony : the two countries that had persistently pressured the u.s. to refrain from using violence became active in a manner which makes the use of military force more likely , " he said .
" this is extremely frustrating . "
more time for inspectors sought chancellor gerhard schröder and france 's president jacques chirac demanded more time for the u.n. weapons inspectors shortly before chief inspector hans blix presented his report at the end of january .
according to coats , germany should be worried about the consequences .
" serious doubts have arisen in the american public whether germany is still a dependable partner , " he said .
" this harms our relations and it certainly harms germany . "
he added that this could also have economic repercussions .
" there is always the possibility that behavior in other areas could also influence economic relations . "
angelika beer , the co-leader of the greens party , played down rumsfeld 's comments .
" i do n't take them so seriously , " said beer , whose party is the junior coalition partner in the german government .
additional dialogue urged but she said the comments indicated that both countries needed to intensify their dialogue .
" the more critical a relationship is , the more important a dialogue is , " she told the news agency reuters .
during his presentation , powell urged security council members to demand more forcefully that baghdad quickly provide evidence about its weapons programs .
but the 15-member council remains sharply divided over rushing to war .
while the united states and britain said time was fast running out for iraq to fully cooperate with u.n. inspectors , france , russia , china and many other council members called for continued inspections and a peaceful resolution of the crisis .
powell 's anxiously awaited presentation to the security council used newly declassified intelligence , including satellite photos and radio intercepts , to support the u.s. case that iraq has defied all demands that it disarm and has links to al-qaida and other terrorist groups .
he warned that iraq 's weapons of mass destruction threaten the world and urged the council to move against saddam or face " irrelevance .

11 attacks . hamburg - as his trial entered its final phase wednesday , mounir el motassadeq stared back at prosecutors in a hamburg court as they repeated the evidence against him , sometimes shaking his head , sometimes smiling in disbelief .
portraying him as an integral and reliable member of the hamburg-based terrorist cell behind the sept .
11 hijiackings and terror attacks in new york and washington holding similar extremist beliefs , german federal prosecutors ended their closing arguments with the request that motassadeq be sentenced to 15 years in prison .
motassadeq , who is accused of managing financial transactions for members of the terror cell , has maintained that his efforts were no more than favors typical among muslims .
he denies knowing anything about what suspected sept .
11 mastermind mohammed atta and his group were planning .
but the plaintiffs in the case have painted an altogether different picture .
three federal prosecutors and three lawyers for the 21 american co-plaintiffs in the case before hamburg 's higher regional court gave closing arguments before the seven judges who will decide motassadeq 's fate .
defense attorneys are scheduled to give their arguments next wednesday .
the 28-year-old moroccan student is charged with accessory to murder in more than 3,000 cases for the sept .
11 attacks .
he also faces charges of membership in a terrorist organization , which chief judge albrecht menz said tuesday could be reduced to support of a terrorist organization , which can carry a five-year sentence .
" one of the muscles " in his closing statement , co-plaintiff lawyer ulrich von jeinsen said motasssadeq was , if not the arm , then at least " one of the muscles without which the arm would n't have functioned . "
for four months , the prosecution has sought to piece together witness testimony and law enforcement investigation reports to prove how deeply motassedeq was involved with the terrorist group .
on wednesday , they took more than four hours to outline his journey from moroccan student at hamburg 's harburg technical university in 1993 to a close and trusted friend of the hamburg cell of hijackers in the months leading up to sept .
11 .
" the small pieces , unto themselves , might not appear to be much , " said chief prosecutor walter hemberger .
" but together they form a mosaic that proves the guilt and full awareness of the accused . "
hemberger added : " the defendant decided to sacrifice himself to an ideology that despises humanity , he was closely integrated into atta 's group . "
hemberger accused motassadeq of attempting to " veil " the truth about his role in the attacks and called on him to come clean .
" mr. el motassadeq , " he said , " you still have the chance to change the outcome in your favor if you give a complete confession . "
prosecutors say he covered terrorists ' tracks the prosecution paid special attention to motassadeq 's connection to marwan al-shehhi , who flew united airlines flight 175 into the south tower of the world trade center .
motassadeq had power of attorney over al-shehhi 's account at dresdner bank in hamburg .
prosecutors say he used it to cover the tracks of al-shehhi while the united arab emirates native finalized plans in afghanistan for the attacks and learned to fly at a school in florida .
while he was gone , motassadeq paid al-shehhi 's bills and his tuition fees for the summer 2000 semester at harburg technical .
he also approved a € 2,550 -lrb- $ 2,753 -rrb- wire transfer that paid for al-shehhi 's flight school fees .
" the accused , " said hemberger , was " the treasurer , " while atta and the other members of the group were away .
the prosecution also recounted the testimony of witnesses who described the " radicalization " of members of the hamburg group , including motassadeq .
he began to identify with the anti-american , anti-semitic beliefs of the others and supported violent means to battle against the united states and israel , said prosecutors .
in summer 2000 , he traveled to afghanistan and took part in the same al qaeda training camps attended by other members of the hamburg cell .
" motassadeq was permanently integrated into the group , " said matthias krauss , one of three federal prosecutors trying the case .
defense attorneys will argue the exact opposite next week .
they are expected to make the case that motassadeq , who was taken into custody shortly after sept .
11 , did n't make any attempt to leave germany because he was innocent and knew nothing of the plans for the attacks .
motassadeq 's lawyers have bemoaned the absence of statements made by two hamburg cell members they believe would clear their client .
the statements were made by ramzi binalshibh , who is currently in u.s. custody after his arrest in pakistan , and mohammed haydar zammar , who is allegedly being held in a syrian jail .
motassadeq 's attorneys repeatedly sought to secure the documents as evidence in the trial , but germany 's interior ministry and its foreign intelligence agency , the bundesnachrichtendienst , have refused to turn them over to the court .

prosecutors say he covered terrorists ' tracks the prosecution paid special attention to motassadeq 's connection to marwan al-shehhi , who flew united airlines flight 175 into the south tower of the world trade center .
motassadeq had power of attorney over al-shehhi 's account at dresdner bank in hamburg .
prosecutors say he used it to cover the tracks of al-shehhi while the united arab emirates native finalized plans in afghanistan for the attacks and learned to fly at a school in florida .

he also approved a € 2,550 -lrb- $ 2,753 -rrb- wire transfer that paid for al-shehhi 's flight school fees .
" the accused , " said hemberger , was " the treasurer , " while atta and the other members of the group were away .
the prosecution also recounted the testimony of witnesses who described the " radicalization " of members of the hamburg group , including motassadeq .
he began to identify with the anti-american , anti-semitic beliefs of the others and supported violent means to battle against the united states and israel , said prosecutors .
in summer 2000 , he traveled to afghanistan and took part in the same al qaeda training camps attended by other members of the hamburg cell .
" motassadeq was permanently integrated into the group , " said matthias krauss , one of three federal prosecutors trying the case .

11 attacks . hamburg - as his trial entered its final phase wednesday , mounir el motassadeq stared back at prosecutors in a hamburg court as they repeated the evidence against him , sometimes shaking his head , sometimes smiling in disbelief .
portraying him as an integral and reliable member of the hamburg-based terrorist cell behind the sept .
11 hijiackings and terror attacks in new york and washington holding similar extremist beliefs , german federal prosecutors ended their closing arguments with the request that motassadeq be sentenced to 15 years in prison .
motassadeq , who is accused of managing financial transactions for members of the terror cell , has maintained that his efforts were no more than favors typical among muslims .
he denies knowing anything about what suspected sept .
11 mastermind mohammed atta and his group were planning .
but the plaintiffs in the case have painted an altogether different picture .
three federal prosecutors and three lawyers for the 21 american co-plaintiffs in the case before hamburg 's higher regional court gave closing arguments before the seven judges who will decide motassadeq 's fate .
defense attorneys are scheduled to give their arguments next wednesday .
the 28-year-old moroccan student is charged with accessory to murder in more than 3,000 cases for the sept .
11 attacks .
he also faces charges of membership in a terrorist organization , which chief judge albrecht menz said tuesday could be reduced to support of a terrorist organization , which can carry a five-year sentence .
" one of the muscles " in his closing statement , co-plaintiff lawyer ulrich von jeinsen said motasssadeq was , if not the arm , then at least " one of the muscles without which the arm would n't have functioned . "
for four months , the prosecution has sought to piece together witness testimony and law enforcement investigation reports to prove how deeply motassedeq was involved with the terrorist group .
on wednesday , they took more than four hours to outline his journey from moroccan student at hamburg 's harburg technical university in 1993 to a close and trusted friend of the hamburg cell of hijackers in the months leading up to sept .
11 .
" the small pieces , unto themselves , might not appear to be much , " said chief prosecutor walter hemberger .
" but together they form a mosaic that proves the guilt and full awareness of the accused . "
hemberger added : " the defendant decided to sacrifice himself to an ideology that despises humanity , he was closely integrated into atta 's group . "
hemberger accused motassadeq of attempting to " veil " the truth about his role in the attacks and called on him to come clean .

on wednesday , the american chamber of commerce in germany issued a report showing that u.s. companies are the greatest single investor in germany and that there are currently no signs tensions between berlin and washington has had any impact on business ties .
" the german-american economic relationship is very deep and very good , " said chamber of commerce president fred irwin .
" there have always been tensions , but in economic terms , it 's always been ' business as usual . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the following day , germany 's federal commissioner for foreign investment , hilmar kopper -lrb- photo -rrb- , concurred , saying there was no evidence the berlin-washington political tangle has made had any impact on trade .
" in no way have i seen any indication that the discord has crossed over into the thoughts of investors , " he said .
nonetheless , kopper , who also serves as chairmen of daimlerchrysler 's supervisory board , said he is forecasting direct foreign investment in germany will drop by 50 percent this year to a total of € 20 billion due to the weak global economy .
a hardening relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald rumsfeld meanwhile , german businesses fear that political discord between u.s. president george w. bush and schröder 's government could begin to adversely affect the economic transatlantic relationship .
the head of the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade , anton börner , admonished schröder 's government thursday to do everything it can to end the diplomatic crisis .
if the animosities continue to grow , he cautioned , bilateral trade between the u.s. and germany could fall by as much as 10 percent and reduce economic growth in germany by 0.3 percent .
" more and more german companies are starting to feel the hardening of the relationship and are concerned about their business commitments , " in the u.s. , he warned .
" any development that speeds up the erosion -lrb- of the relationship -rrb- needs to be avoided . "
u.s. companies in germany twice as profitable the american chamber of commerce report , conducted in cooperation with the consulting firm droege , offered a rosier account of german-american business ties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel the report found that close to 1,800 subsidiaries of american companies in germany employ about 800,000 people and pull in revenues of around € 540 billion -lrb- $ 585 billion -rrb- .
of the subsidiaries surveyed , 38 percent said their germany revenues accounted for more than 10 percent of their mother company 's worldwide sales .
on average , the american companies also said they enjoyed market shares of about 22 percent in their respective sectors .
according to the latest figures , compiled in 1999 , u.s. companies have invested more than € 40 billion in germany .
tax hikes worse than rumsfeld rift ?
still , irwin warned that the current tax plans the german government has on the table could be more devastating for u.s.-german business relations than schröder 's iraq position .
" the most important issue facing investors is not the political tensions , but the investment climate , " irwin said .
" the problem here is a lack of any real tax policy , " he explained .
" without reforms , we ca n't move forward , " he said in response to current plans by the government to reduce the levels of write-offs for losses .

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 06.02.2003 powell fails to change german opposition on iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumsfeld sees strange bedfellows for chancellor schröder : cuba 's fidel castro and libya 's moammar gadhafi .
as germany renewed its opposition to war against iraq after powell 's speech , u.s. defense secretary , rumsfeld directed a new dart at it , saying germany , libya and cuba are the only countries not helping american efforts . germany 's leaders , having listened attentively to u.s. secretary of state colin powell 's arguments against the iraqi leadership at the u.n. security council , said on thursday that they remained unconvinced that the government should change its opposition to any war against iraq .
the spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder said the government " welcomed " the extensive information presented by powell on wednesday .
" germany is just as concerned as others about the indications that iraq continues to possess weapons of mass destruction , " béla anda said in an statement .
together with the majority of security council members , germany demands that the presented facts be handed over to the u.n. weapons inspectors to be verified , he said .
anda stressed that the inspectors needed the " required time and necessary measures " for their work .
" the german government will continue with all of its powers to speak for a peaceful settlement of the conflict , " anda said .
opposition presses schröder but members of germany 's opposition parties expressed renewed disagreement with schröder and his pledge to have a german vote against any resolution in the u.n. security council that authorized a war on iraq .
" the german chancellor was the only one to jump the gun and isolate the country , " said angela merkel , the chairwoman of germany 's biggest opposition party , the christian democratic union .
" i think this self-imposed isolation is wrong because it does not serve germany 's interests . "
powell 's calm , factual presentation on wednesday was accompanied by another blast of harsh anti-german rhetoric from defense minister donald rumsfeld .
referring to a possible coalition that would join a war on iraq , rumsfeld told a house committee : " then , there are three or four countries that have said they wo n't do anything .
i believe libya , cuba and germany are ones that have indicated they wo n't help in any respect . "
even though rumsfeld said the germans were not helping , they are actually providing support .
germany is assigning 2,600 soldiers to guard 95 u.s. bases and facilities within the country , and schröder has promised the americans that they could use these bases to conduct any war .
the u.s. ambassador in berlin , daniel coats , attempted to tone down rumsfeld 's statements , which came two weeks after he said germany and france belonged to the " old europe " .
in an interview with the daily newspaper berliner zeitung , coats said the defense secretary was not speaking for the u.s. government .
but coats said the german government , together with france , had weakened the pressure on saddam hussein .
" what an irony : the two countries that had persistently pressured the u.s. to refrain from using violence became active in a manner which makes the use of military force more likely , " he said .
" this is extremely frustrating . "
more time for inspectors sought chancellor gerhard schröder and france 's president jacques chirac demanded more time for the u.n. weapons inspectors shortly before chief inspector hans blix presented his report at the end of january .
according to coats , germany should be worried about the consequences .
" serious doubts have arisen in the american public whether germany is still a dependable partner , " he said .
" this harms our relations and it certainly harms germany . "
he added that this could also have economic repercussions .
" there is always the possibility that behavior in other areas could also influence economic relations . "
angelika beer , the co-leader of the greens party , played down rumsfeld 's comments .
" i do n't take them so seriously , " said beer , whose party is the junior coalition partner in the german government .
additional dialogue urged but she said the comments indicated that both countries needed to intensify their dialogue .
" the more critical a relationship is , the more important a dialogue is , " she told the news agency reuters .
during his presentation , powell urged security council members to demand more forcefully that baghdad quickly provide evidence about its weapons programs .
but the 15-member council remains sharply divided over rushing to war .
while the united states and britain said time was fast running out for iraq to fully cooperate with u.n. inspectors , france , russia , china and many other council members called for continued inspections and a peaceful resolution of the crisis .
powell 's anxiously awaited presentation to the security council used newly declassified intelligence , including satellite photos and radio intercepts , to support the u.s. case that iraq has defied all demands that it disarm and has links to al-qaida and other terrorist groups .
he warned that iraq 's weapons of mass destruction threaten the world and urged the council to move against saddam or face " irrelevance .

powell 's anxiously awaited presentation to the security council used newly declassified intelligence , including satellite photos and radio intercepts , to support the u.s. case that iraq has defied all demands that it disarm and has links to al-qaida and other terrorist groups .
he warned that iraq 's weapons of mass destruction threaten the world and urged the council to move against saddam or face " irrelevance .

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 06.02.2003 powell fails to change german opposition on iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumsfeld sees strange bedfellows for chancellor schröder : cuba 's fidel castro and libya 's moammar gadhafi .
as germany renewed its opposition to war against iraq after powell 's speech , u.s. defense secretary , rumsfeld directed a new dart at it , saying germany , libya and cuba are the only countries not helping american efforts . germany 's leaders , having listened attentively to u.s. secretary of state colin powell 's arguments against the iraqi leadership at the u.n. security council , said on thursday that they remained unconvinced that the government should change its opposition to any war against iraq .
the spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder said the government " welcomed " the extensive information presented by powell on wednesday .
" germany is just as concerned as others about the indications that iraq continues to possess weapons of mass destruction , " béla anda said in an statement .
together with the majority of security council members , germany demands that the presented facts be handed over to the u.n. weapons inspectors to be verified , he said .
anda stressed that the inspectors needed the " required time and necessary measures " for their work .
" the german government will continue with all of its powers to speak for a peaceful settlement of the conflict , " anda said .
opposition presses schröder but members of germany 's opposition parties expressed renewed disagreement with schröder and his pledge to have a german vote against any resolution in the u.n. security council that authorized a war on iraq .
" the german chancellor was the only one to jump the gun and isolate the country , " said angela merkel , the chairwoman of germany 's biggest opposition party , the christian democratic union .
" i think this self-imposed isolation is wrong because it does not serve germany 's interests . "
powell 's calm , factual presentation on wednesday was accompanied by another blast of harsh anti-german rhetoric from defense minister donald rumsfeld .
referring to a possible coalition that would join a war on iraq , rumsfeld told a house committee : " then , there are three or four countries that have said they wo n't do anything .
i believe libya , cuba and germany are ones that have indicated they wo n't help in any respect . "
even though rumsfeld said the germans were not helping , they are actually providing support .
germany is assigning 2,600 soldiers to guard 95 u.s. bases and facilities within the country , and schröder has promised the americans that they could use these bases to conduct any war .
the u.s. ambassador in berlin , daniel coats , attempted to tone down rumsfeld 's statements , which came two weeks after he said germany and france belonged to the " old europe " .
in an interview with the daily newspaper berliner zeitung , coats said the defense secretary was not speaking for the u.s. government .
but coats said the german government , together with france , had weakened the pressure on saddam hussein .
" what an irony : the two countries that had persistently pressured the u.s. to refrain from using violence became active in a manner which makes the use of military force more likely , " he said .
" this is extremely frustrating . "
more time for inspectors sought chancellor gerhard schröder and france 's president jacques chirac demanded more time for the u.n. weapons inspectors shortly before chief inspector hans blix presented his report at the end of january .
according to coats , germany should be worried about the consequences .
" serious doubts have arisen in the american public whether germany is still a dependable partner , " he said .
" this harms our relations and it certainly harms germany . "
he added that this could also have economic repercussions .
" there is always the possibility that behavior in other areas could also influence economic relations . "
angelika beer , the co-leader of the greens party , played down rumsfeld 's comments .
" i do n't take them so seriously , " said beer , whose party is the junior coalition partner in the german government .
additional dialogue urged but she said the comments indicated that both countries needed to intensify their dialogue .
" the more critical a relationship is , the more important a dialogue is , " she told the news agency reuters .
during his presentation , powell urged security council members to demand more forcefully that baghdad quickly provide evidence about its weapons programs .
but the 15-member council remains sharply divided over rushing to war .
while the united states and britain said time was fast running out for iraq to fully cooperate with u.n. inspectors , france , russia , china and many other council members called for continued inspections and a peaceful resolution of the crisis .

in an interview with the daily newspaper berliner zeitung , coats said the defense secretary was not speaking for the u.s. government .
but coats said the german government , together with france , had weakened the pressure on saddam hussein .
" what an irony : the two countries that had persistently pressured the u.s. to refrain from using violence became active in a manner which makes the use of military force more likely , " he said .
" this is extremely frustrating . "
more time for inspectors sought chancellor gerhard schröder and france 's president jacques chirac demanded more time for the u.n. weapons inspectors shortly before chief inspector hans blix presented his report at the end of january .
according to coats , germany should be worried about the consequences .
" serious doubts have arisen in the american public whether germany is still a dependable partner , " he said .
" this harms our relations and it certainly harms germany . "
he added that this could also have economic repercussions .
" there is always the possibility that behavior in other areas could also influence economic relations . "
angelika beer , the co-leader of the greens party , played down rumsfeld 's comments .
" i do n't take them so seriously , " said beer , whose party is the junior coalition partner in the german government .
additional dialogue urged but she said the comments indicated that both countries needed to intensify their dialogue .
" the more critical a relationship is , the more important a dialogue is , " she told the news agency reuters .
during his presentation , powell urged security council members to demand more forcefully that baghdad quickly provide evidence about its weapons programs .
but the 15-member council remains sharply divided over rushing to war .
while the united states and britain said time was fast running out for iraq to fully cooperate with u.n. inspectors , france , russia , china and many other council members called for continued inspections and a peaceful resolution of the crisis .
powell 's anxiously awaited presentation to the security council used newly declassified intelligence , including satellite photos and radio intercepts , to support the u.s. case that iraq has defied all demands that it disarm and has links to al-qaida and other terrorist groups .
he warned that iraq 's weapons of mass destruction threaten the world and urged the council to move against saddam or face " irrelevance .

11 attacks . hamburg - as his trial entered its final phase wednesday , mounir el motassadeq stared back at prosecutors in a hamburg court as they repeated the evidence against him , sometimes shaking his head , sometimes smiling in disbelief .
portraying him as an integral and reliable member of the hamburg-based terrorist cell behind the sept .
11 hijiackings and terror attacks in new york and washington holding similar extremist beliefs , german federal prosecutors ended their closing arguments with the request that motassadeq be sentenced to 15 years in prison .
motassadeq , who is accused of managing financial transactions for members of the terror cell , has maintained that his efforts were no more than favors typical among muslims .
he denies knowing anything about what suspected sept .
11 mastermind mohammed atta and his group were planning .
but the plaintiffs in the case have painted an altogether different picture .
three federal prosecutors and three lawyers for the 21 american co-plaintiffs in the case before hamburg 's higher regional court gave closing arguments before the seven judges who will decide motassadeq 's fate .
defense attorneys are scheduled to give their arguments next wednesday .
the 28-year-old moroccan student is charged with accessory to murder in more than 3,000 cases for the sept .
11 attacks .
he also faces charges of membership in a terrorist organization , which chief judge albrecht menz said tuesday could be reduced to support of a terrorist organization , which can carry a five-year sentence .
" one of the muscles " in his closing statement , co-plaintiff lawyer ulrich von jeinsen said motasssadeq was , if not the arm , then at least " one of the muscles without which the arm would n't have functioned . "
for four months , the prosecution has sought to piece together witness testimony and law enforcement investigation reports to prove how deeply motassedeq was involved with the terrorist group .
on wednesday , they took more than four hours to outline his journey from moroccan student at hamburg 's harburg technical university in 1993 to a close and trusted friend of the hamburg cell of hijackers in the months leading up to sept .
11 .
" the small pieces , unto themselves , might not appear to be much , " said chief prosecutor walter hemberger .
" but together they form a mosaic that proves the guilt and full awareness of the accused . "
hemberger added : " the defendant decided to sacrifice himself to an ideology that despises humanity , he was closely integrated into atta 's group . "
hemberger accused motassadeq of attempting to " veil " the truth about his role in the attacks and called on him to come clean .
" mr. el motassadeq , " he said , " you still have the chance to change the outcome in your favor if you give a complete confession . "
prosecutors say he covered terrorists ' tracks the prosecution paid special attention to motassadeq 's connection to marwan al-shehhi , who flew united airlines flight 175 into the south tower of the world trade center .
motassadeq had power of attorney over al-shehhi 's account at dresdner bank in hamburg .
prosecutors say he used it to cover the tracks of al-shehhi while the united arab emirates native finalized plans in afghanistan for the attacks and learned to fly at a school in florida .
while he was gone , motassadeq paid al-shehhi 's bills and his tuition fees for the summer 2000 semester at harburg technical .
he also approved a € 2,550 -lrb- $ 2,753 -rrb- wire transfer that paid for al-shehhi 's flight school fees .
" the accused , " said hemberger , was " the treasurer , " while atta and the other members of the group were away .
the prosecution also recounted the testimony of witnesses who described the " radicalization " of members of the hamburg group , including motassadeq .
he began to identify with the anti-american , anti-semitic beliefs of the others and supported violent means to battle against the united states and israel , said prosecutors .
in summer 2000 , he traveled to afghanistan and took part in the same al qaeda training camps attended by other members of the hamburg cell .
" motassadeq was permanently integrated into the group , " said matthias krauss , one of three federal prosecutors trying the case .
defense attorneys will argue the exact opposite next week .
they are expected to make the case that motassadeq , who was taken into custody shortly after sept .
11 , did n't make any attempt to leave germany because he was innocent and knew nothing of the plans for the attacks .
motassadeq 's lawyers have bemoaned the absence of statements made by two hamburg cell members they believe would clear their client .
the statements were made by ramzi binalshibh , who is currently in u.s. custody after his arrest in pakistan , and mohammed haydar zammar , who is allegedly being held in a syrian jail .
motassadeq 's attorneys repeatedly sought to secure the documents as evidence in the trial , but germany 's interior ministry and its foreign intelligence agency , the bundesnachrichtendienst , have refused to turn them over to the court .

11 attacks . hamburg - as his trial entered its final phase wednesday , mounir el motassadeq stared back at prosecutors in a hamburg court as they repeated the evidence against him , sometimes shaking his head , sometimes smiling in disbelief .
portraying him as an integral and reliable member of the hamburg-based terrorist cell behind the sept .
11 hijiackings and terror attacks in new york and washington holding similar extremist beliefs , german federal prosecutors ended their closing arguments with the request that motassadeq be sentenced to 15 years in prison .
motassadeq , who is accused of managing financial transactions for members of the terror cell , has maintained that his efforts were no more than favors typical among muslims .
he denies knowing anything about what suspected sept .
11 mastermind mohammed atta and his group were planning .
but the plaintiffs in the case have painted an altogether different picture .
three federal prosecutors and three lawyers for the 21 american co-plaintiffs in the case before hamburg 's higher regional court gave closing arguments before the seven judges who will decide motassadeq 's fate .
defense attorneys are scheduled to give their arguments next wednesday .
the 28-year-old moroccan student is charged with accessory to murder in more than 3,000 cases for the sept .
11 attacks .
he also faces charges of membership in a terrorist organization , which chief judge albrecht menz said tuesday could be reduced to support of a terrorist organization , which can carry a five-year sentence .
" one of the muscles " in his closing statement , co-plaintiff lawyer ulrich von jeinsen said motasssadeq was , if not the arm , then at least " one of the muscles without which the arm would n't have functioned . "
for four months , the prosecution has sought to piece together witness testimony and law enforcement investigation reports to prove how deeply motassedeq was involved with the terrorist group .
on wednesday , they took more than four hours to outline his journey from moroccan student at hamburg 's harburg technical university in 1993 to a close and trusted friend of the hamburg cell of hijackers in the months leading up to sept .
11 .
" the small pieces , unto themselves , might not appear to be much , " said chief prosecutor walter hemberger .
" but together they form a mosaic that proves the guilt and full awareness of the accused . "
hemberger added : " the defendant decided to sacrifice himself to an ideology that despises humanity , he was closely integrated into atta 's group . "
hemberger accused motassadeq of attempting to " veil " the truth about his role in the attacks and called on him to come clean .
" mr. el motassadeq , " he said , " you still have the chance to change the outcome in your favor if you give a complete confession . "
prosecutors say he covered terrorists ' tracks the prosecution paid special attention to motassadeq 's connection to marwan al-shehhi , who flew united airlines flight 175 into the south tower of the world trade center .
motassadeq had power of attorney over al-shehhi 's account at dresdner bank in hamburg .
prosecutors say he used it to cover the tracks of al-shehhi while the united arab emirates native finalized plans in afghanistan for the attacks and learned to fly at a school in florida .
while he was gone , motassadeq paid al-shehhi 's bills and his tuition fees for the summer 2000 semester at harburg technical .
he also approved a € 2,550 -lrb- $ 2,753 -rrb- wire transfer that paid for al-shehhi 's flight school fees .
" the accused , " said hemberger , was " the treasurer , " while atta and the other members of the group were away .
the prosecution also recounted the testimony of witnesses who described the " radicalization " of members of the hamburg group , including motassadeq .
he began to identify with the anti-american , anti-semitic beliefs of the others and supported violent means to battle against the united states and israel , said prosecutors .
in summer 2000 , he traveled to afghanistan and took part in the same al qaeda training camps attended by other members of the hamburg cell .
" motassadeq was permanently integrated into the group , " said matthias krauss , one of three federal prosecutors trying the case .
defense attorneys will argue the exact opposite next week .
they are expected to make the case that motassadeq , who was taken into custody shortly after sept .
11 , did n't make any attempt to leave germany because he was innocent and knew nothing of the plans for the attacks .
motassadeq 's lawyers have bemoaned the absence of statements made by two hamburg cell members they believe would clear their client .
the statements were made by ramzi binalshibh , who is currently in u.s. custody after his arrest in pakistan , and mohammed haydar zammar , who is allegedly being held in a syrian jail .
motassadeq 's attorneys repeatedly sought to secure the documents as evidence in the trial , but germany 's interior ministry and its foreign intelligence agency , the bundesnachrichtendienst , have refused to turn them over to the court .
the agencies argue that doing so would compromise their investigative capabilities . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de families of 9/11 victims testify in hamburg trial 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 06.02.2003 powell fails to change german opposition on iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumsfeld sees strange bedfellows for chancellor schröder : cuba 's fidel castro and libya 's moammar gadhafi .
as germany renewed its opposition to war against iraq after powell 's speech , u.s. defense secretary , rumsfeld directed a new dart at it , saying germany , libya and cuba are the only countries not helping american efforts . germany 's leaders , having listened attentively to u.s. secretary of state colin powell 's arguments against the iraqi leadership at the u.n. security council , said on thursday that they remained unconvinced that the government should change its opposition to any war against iraq .
the spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder said the government " welcomed " the extensive information presented by powell on wednesday .
" germany is just as concerned as others about the indications that iraq continues to possess weapons of mass destruction , " béla anda said in an statement .
together with the majority of security council members , germany demands that the presented facts be handed over to the u.n. weapons inspectors to be verified , he said .
anda stressed that the inspectors needed the " required time and necessary measures " for their work .
" the german government will continue with all of its powers to speak for a peaceful settlement of the conflict , " anda said .
opposition presses schröder but members of germany 's opposition parties expressed renewed disagreement with schröder and his pledge to have a german vote against any resolution in the u.n. security council that authorized a war on iraq .
" the german chancellor was the only one to jump the gun and isolate the country , " said angela merkel , the chairwoman of germany 's biggest opposition party , the christian democratic union .
" i think this self-imposed isolation is wrong because it does not serve germany 's interests . "
powell 's calm , factual presentation on wednesday was accompanied by another blast of harsh anti-german rhetoric from defense minister donald rumsfeld .
referring to a possible coalition that would join a war on iraq , rumsfeld told a house committee : " then , there are three or four countries that have said they wo n't do anything .
i believe libya , cuba and germany are ones that have indicated they wo n't help in any respect . "
even though rumsfeld said the germans were not helping , they are actually providing support .
germany is assigning 2,600 soldiers to guard 95 u.s. bases and facilities within the country , and schröder has promised the americans that they could use these bases to conduct any war .
the u.s. ambassador in berlin , daniel coats , attempted to tone down rumsfeld 's statements , which came two weeks after he said germany and france belonged to the " old europe " .
in an interview with the daily newspaper berliner zeitung , coats said the defense secretary was not speaking for the u.s. government .
but coats said the german government , together with france , had weakened the pressure on saddam hussein .
" what an irony : the two countries that had persistently pressured the u.s. to refrain from using violence became active in a manner which makes the use of military force more likely , " he said .
" this is extremely frustrating . "
more time for inspectors sought chancellor gerhard schröder and france 's president jacques chirac demanded more time for the u.n. weapons inspectors shortly before chief inspector hans blix presented his report at the end of january .
according to coats , germany should be worried about the consequences .
" serious doubts have arisen in the american public whether germany is still a dependable partner , " he said .
" this harms our relations and it certainly harms germany . "
he added that this could also have economic repercussions .
" there is always the possibility that behavior in other areas could also influence economic relations . "
angelika beer , the co-leader of the greens party , played down rumsfeld 's comments .
" i do n't take them so seriously , " said beer , whose party is the junior coalition partner in the german government .
additional dialogue urged but she said the comments indicated that both countries needed to intensify their dialogue .
" the more critical a relationship is , the more important a dialogue is , " she told the news agency reuters .
during his presentation , powell urged security council members to demand more forcefully that baghdad quickly provide evidence about its weapons programs .
but the 15-member council remains sharply divided over rushing to war .
while the united states and britain said time was fast running out for iraq to fully cooperate with u.n. inspectors , france , russia , china and many other council members called for continued inspections and a peaceful resolution of the crisis .
powell 's anxiously awaited presentation to the security council used newly declassified intelligence , including satellite photos and radio intercepts , to support the u.s. case that iraq has defied all demands that it disarm and has links to al-qaida and other terrorist groups .
he warned that iraq 's weapons of mass destruction threaten the world and urged the council to move against saddam or face " irrelevance .

he also faces charges of membership in a terrorist organization , which chief judge albrecht menz said tuesday could be reduced to support of a terrorist organization , which can carry a five-year sentence .
" one of the muscles " in his closing statement , co-plaintiff lawyer ulrich von jeinsen said motasssadeq was , if not the arm , then at least " one of the muscles without which the arm would n't have functioned . "
for four months , the prosecution has sought to piece together witness testimony and law enforcement investigation reports to prove how deeply motassedeq was involved with the terrorist group .

11 attacks . hamburg - as his trial entered its final phase wednesday , mounir el motassadeq stared back at prosecutors in a hamburg court as they repeated the evidence against him , sometimes shaking his head , sometimes smiling in disbelief .
portraying him as an integral and reliable member of the hamburg-based terrorist cell behind the sept .
11 hijiackings and terror attacks in new york and washington holding similar extremist beliefs , german federal prosecutors ended their closing arguments with the request that motassadeq be sentenced to 15 years in prison .
motassadeq , who is accused of managing financial transactions for members of the terror cell , has maintained that his efforts were no more than favors typical among muslims .
he denies knowing anything about what suspected sept .
11 mastermind mohammed atta and his group were planning .
but the plaintiffs in the case have painted an altogether different picture .
three federal prosecutors and three lawyers for the 21 american co-plaintiffs in the case before hamburg 's higher regional court gave closing arguments before the seven judges who will decide motassadeq 's fate .
defense attorneys are scheduled to give their arguments next wednesday .
the 28-year-old moroccan student is charged with accessory to murder in more than 3,000 cases for the sept .
11 attacks .
he also faces charges of membership in a terrorist organization , which chief judge albrecht menz said tuesday could be reduced to support of a terrorist organization , which can carry a five-year sentence .
" one of the muscles " in his closing statement , co-plaintiff lawyer ulrich von jeinsen said motasssadeq was , if not the arm , then at least " one of the muscles without which the arm would n't have functioned . "
for four months , the prosecution has sought to piece together witness testimony and law enforcement investigation reports to prove how deeply motassedeq was involved with the terrorist group .
on wednesday , they took more than four hours to outline his journey from moroccan student at hamburg 's harburg technical university in 1993 to a close and trusted friend of the hamburg cell of hijackers in the months leading up to sept .

" the small pieces , unto themselves , might not appear to be much , " said chief prosecutor walter hemberger .
" but together they form a mosaic that proves the guilt and full awareness of the accused . "
hemberger added : " the defendant decided to sacrifice himself to an ideology that despises humanity , he was closely integrated into atta 's group . "
hemberger accused motassadeq of attempting to " veil " the truth about his role in the attacks and called on him to come clean .
" mr. el motassadeq , " he said , " you still have the chance to change the outcome in your favor if you give a complete confession . "

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 06.02.2003 powell fails to change german opposition on iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumsfeld sees strange bedfellows for chancellor schröder : cuba 's fidel castro and libya 's moammar gadhafi .
as germany renewed its opposition to war against iraq after powell 's speech , u.s. defense secretary , rumsfeld directed a new dart at it , saying germany , libya and cuba are the only countries not helping american efforts . germany 's leaders , having listened attentively to u.s. secretary of state colin powell 's arguments against the iraqi leadership at the u.n. security council , said on thursday that they remained unconvinced that the government should change its opposition to any war against iraq .
the spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder said the government " welcomed " the extensive information presented by powell on wednesday .
" germany is just as concerned as others about the indications that iraq continues to possess weapons of mass destruction , " béla anda said in an statement .
together with the majority of security council members , germany demands that the presented facts be handed over to the u.n. weapons inspectors to be verified , he said .
anda stressed that the inspectors needed the " required time and necessary measures " for their work .
" the german government will continue with all of its powers to speak for a peaceful settlement of the conflict , " anda said .
opposition presses schröder but members of germany 's opposition parties expressed renewed disagreement with schröder and his pledge to have a german vote against any resolution in the u.n. security council that authorized a war on iraq .
" the german chancellor was the only one to jump the gun and isolate the country , " said angela merkel , the chairwoman of germany 's biggest opposition party , the christian democratic union .
" i think this self-imposed isolation is wrong because it does not serve germany 's interests . "
powell 's calm , factual presentation on wednesday was accompanied by another blast of harsh anti-german rhetoric from defense minister donald rumsfeld .
referring to a possible coalition that would join a war on iraq , rumsfeld told a house committee : " then , there are three or four countries that have said they wo n't do anything .
i believe libya , cuba and germany are ones that have indicated they wo n't help in any respect . "
even though rumsfeld said the germans were not helping , they are actually providing support .
germany is assigning 2,600 soldiers to guard 95 u.s. bases and facilities within the country , and schröder has promised the americans that they could use these bases to conduct any war .
the u.s. ambassador in berlin , daniel coats , attempted to tone down rumsfeld 's statements , which came two weeks after he said germany and france belonged to the " old europe " .
in an interview with the daily newspaper berliner zeitung , coats said the defense secretary was not speaking for the u.s. government .
but coats said the german government , together with france , had weakened the pressure on saddam hussein .
" what an irony : the two countries that had persistently pressured the u.s. to refrain from using violence became active in a manner which makes the use of military force more likely , " he said .
" this is extremely frustrating . "
more time for inspectors sought chancellor gerhard schröder and france 's president jacques chirac demanded more time for the u.n. weapons inspectors shortly before chief inspector hans blix presented his report at the end of january .
according to coats , germany should be worried about the consequences .
" serious doubts have arisen in the american public whether germany is still a dependable partner , " he said .
" this harms our relations and it certainly harms germany . "
he added that this could also have economic repercussions .
" there is always the possibility that behavior in other areas could also influence economic relations . "
angelika beer , the co-leader of the greens party , played down rumsfeld 's comments .
" i do n't take them so seriously , " said beer , whose party is the junior coalition partner in the german government .
additional dialogue urged but she said the comments indicated that both countries needed to intensify their dialogue .
" the more critical a relationship is , the more important a dialogue is , " she told the news agency reuters .
during his presentation , powell urged security council members to demand more forcefully that baghdad quickly provide evidence about its weapons programs .
but the 15-member council remains sharply divided over rushing to war .
while the united states and britain said time was fast running out for iraq to fully cooperate with u.n. inspectors , france , russia , china and many other council members called for continued inspections and a peaceful resolution of the crisis .
powell 's anxiously awaited presentation to the security council used newly declassified intelligence , including satellite photos and radio intercepts , to support the u.s. case that iraq has defied all demands that it disarm and has links to al-qaida and other terrorist groups .
he warned that iraq 's weapons of mass destruction threaten the world and urged the council to move against saddam or face " irrelevance .

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 06.02.2003 powell fails to change german opposition on iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumsfeld sees strange bedfellows for chancellor schröder : cuba 's fidel castro and libya 's moammar gadhafi .
as germany renewed its opposition to war against iraq after powell 's speech , u.s. defense secretary , rumsfeld directed a new dart at it , saying germany , libya and cuba are the only countries not helping american efforts . germany 's leaders , having listened attentively to u.s. secretary of state colin powell 's arguments against the iraqi leadership at the u.n. security council , said on thursday that they remained unconvinced that the government should change its opposition to any war against iraq .
the spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder said the government " welcomed " the extensive information presented by powell on wednesday .
" germany is just as concerned as others about the indications that iraq continues to possess weapons of mass destruction , " béla anda said in an statement .
together with the majority of security council members , germany demands that the presented facts be handed over to the u.n. weapons inspectors to be verified , he said .
anda stressed that the inspectors needed the " required time and necessary measures " for their work .
" the german government will continue with all of its powers to speak for a peaceful settlement of the conflict , " anda said .
opposition presses schröder but members of germany 's opposition parties expressed renewed disagreement with schröder and his pledge to have a german vote against any resolution in the u.n. security council that authorized a war on iraq .
" the german chancellor was the only one to jump the gun and isolate the country , " said angela merkel , the chairwoman of germany 's biggest opposition party , the christian democratic union .
" i think this self-imposed isolation is wrong because it does not serve germany 's interests . "
powell 's calm , factual presentation on wednesday was accompanied by another blast of harsh anti-german rhetoric from defense minister donald rumsfeld .
referring to a possible coalition that would join a war on iraq , rumsfeld told a house committee : " then , there are three or four countries that have said they wo n't do anything .
i believe libya , cuba and germany are ones that have indicated they wo n't help in any respect . "
even though rumsfeld said the germans were not helping , they are actually providing support .
germany is assigning 2,600 soldiers to guard 95 u.s. bases and facilities within the country , and schröder has promised the americans that they could use these bases to conduct any war .
the u.s. ambassador in berlin , daniel coats , attempted to tone down rumsfeld 's statements , which came two weeks after he said germany and france belonged to the " old europe " .
in an interview with the daily newspaper berliner zeitung , coats said the defense secretary was not speaking for the u.s. government .
but coats said the german government , together with france , had weakened the pressure on saddam hussein .
" what an irony : the two countries that had persistently pressured the u.s. to refrain from using violence became active in a manner which makes the use of military force more likely , " he said .
" this is extremely frustrating . "
more time for inspectors sought chancellor gerhard schröder and france 's president jacques chirac demanded more time for the u.n. weapons inspectors shortly before chief inspector hans blix presented his report at the end of january .
according to coats , germany should be worried about the consequences .
" serious doubts have arisen in the american public whether germany is still a dependable partner , " he said .
" this harms our relations and it certainly harms germany . "
he added that this could also have economic repercussions .
" there is always the possibility that behavior in other areas could also influence economic relations . "
angelika beer , the co-leader of the greens party , played down rumsfeld 's comments .
" i do n't take them so seriously , " said beer , whose party is the junior coalition partner in the german government .
additional dialogue urged but she said the comments indicated that both countries needed to intensify their dialogue .
" the more critical a relationship is , the more important a dialogue is , " she told the news agency reuters .
during his presentation , powell urged security council members to demand more forcefully that baghdad quickly provide evidence about its weapons programs .
but the 15-member council remains sharply divided over rushing to war .
while the united states and britain said time was fast running out for iraq to fully cooperate with u.n. inspectors , france , russia , china and many other council members called for continued inspections and a peaceful resolution of the crisis .
powell 's anxiously awaited presentation to the security council used newly declassified intelligence , including satellite photos and radio intercepts , to support the u.s. case that iraq has defied all demands that it disarm and has links to al-qaida and other terrorist groups .
he warned that iraq 's weapons of mass destruction threaten the world and urged the council to move against saddam or face " irrelevance .

11 attacks . hamburg - as his trial entered its final phase wednesday , mounir el motassadeq stared back at prosecutors in a hamburg court as they repeated the evidence against him , sometimes shaking his head , sometimes smiling in disbelief .
portraying him as an integral and reliable member of the hamburg-based terrorist cell behind the sept .
11 hijiackings and terror attacks in new york and washington holding similar extremist beliefs , german federal prosecutors ended their closing arguments with the request that motassadeq be sentenced to 15 years in prison .
motassadeq , who is accused of managing financial transactions for members of the terror cell , has maintained that his efforts were no more than favors typical among muslims .
he denies knowing anything about what suspected sept .
11 mastermind mohammed atta and his group were planning .
but the plaintiffs in the case have painted an altogether different picture .
three federal prosecutors and three lawyers for the 21 american co-plaintiffs in the case before hamburg 's higher regional court gave closing arguments before the seven judges who will decide motassadeq 's fate .
defense attorneys are scheduled to give their arguments next wednesday .
the 28-year-old moroccan student is charged with accessory to murder in more than 3,000 cases for the sept .
11 attacks .
he also faces charges of membership in a terrorist organization , which chief judge albrecht menz said tuesday could be reduced to support of a terrorist organization , which can carry a five-year sentence .
" one of the muscles " in his closing statement , co-plaintiff lawyer ulrich von jeinsen said motasssadeq was , if not the arm , then at least " one of the muscles without which the arm would n't have functioned . "
for four months , the prosecution has sought to piece together witness testimony and law enforcement investigation reports to prove how deeply motassedeq was involved with the terrorist group .
on wednesday , they took more than four hours to outline his journey from moroccan student at hamburg 's harburg technical university in 1993 to a close and trusted friend of the hamburg cell of hijackers in the months leading up to sept .
11 .
" the small pieces , unto themselves , might not appear to be much , " said chief prosecutor walter hemberger .
" but together they form a mosaic that proves the guilt and full awareness of the accused . "
hemberger added : " the defendant decided to sacrifice himself to an ideology that despises humanity , he was closely integrated into atta 's group . "
hemberger accused motassadeq of attempting to " veil " the truth about his role in the attacks and called on him to come clean .
" mr. el motassadeq , " he said , " you still have the chance to change the outcome in your favor if you give a complete confession . "
prosecutors say he covered terrorists ' tracks the prosecution paid special attention to motassadeq 's connection to marwan al-shehhi , who flew united airlines flight 175 into the south tower of the world trade center .
motassadeq had power of attorney over al-shehhi 's account at dresdner bank in hamburg .
prosecutors say he used it to cover the tracks of al-shehhi while the united arab emirates native finalized plans in afghanistan for the attacks and learned to fly at a school in florida .
while he was gone , motassadeq paid al-shehhi 's bills and his tuition fees for the summer 2000 semester at harburg technical .
he also approved a € 2,550 -lrb- $ 2,753 -rrb- wire transfer that paid for al-shehhi 's flight school fees .
" the accused , " said hemberger , was " the treasurer , " while atta and the other members of the group were away .
the prosecution also recounted the testimony of witnesses who described the " radicalization " of members of the hamburg group , including motassadeq .
he began to identify with the anti-american , anti-semitic beliefs of the others and supported violent means to battle against the united states and israel , said prosecutors .
in summer 2000 , he traveled to afghanistan and took part in the same al qaeda training camps attended by other members of the hamburg cell .
" motassadeq was permanently integrated into the group , " said matthias krauss , one of three federal prosecutors trying the case .
defense attorneys will argue the exact opposite next week .
they are expected to make the case that motassadeq , who was taken into custody shortly after sept .
11 , did n't make any attempt to leave germany because he was innocent and knew nothing of the plans for the attacks .
motassadeq 's lawyers have bemoaned the absence of statements made by two hamburg cell members they believe would clear their client .
the statements were made by ramzi binalshibh , who is currently in u.s. custody after his arrest in pakistan , and mohammed haydar zammar , who is allegedly being held in a syrian jail .
motassadeq 's attorneys repeatedly sought to secure the documents as evidence in the trial , but germany 's interior ministry and its foreign intelligence agency , the bundesnachrichtendienst , have refused to turn them over to the court .

the 28-year-old moroccan student is charged with accessory to murder in more than 3,000 cases for the sept .
11 attacks .
he also faces charges of membership in a terrorist organization , which chief judge albrecht menz said tuesday could be reduced to support of a terrorist organization , which can carry a five-year sentence .
" one of the muscles " in his closing statement , co-plaintiff lawyer ulrich von jeinsen said motasssadeq was , if not the arm , then at least " one of the muscles without which the arm would n't have functioned . "
for four months , the prosecution has sought to piece together witness testimony and law enforcement investigation reports to prove how deeply motassedeq was involved with the terrorist group .
on wednesday , they took more than four hours to outline his journey from moroccan student at hamburg 's harburg technical university in 1993 to a close and trusted friend of the hamburg cell of hijackers in the months leading up to sept .
11 .
" the small pieces , unto themselves , might not appear to be much , " said chief prosecutor walter hemberger .
" but together they form a mosaic that proves the guilt and full awareness of the accused . "
hemberger added : " the defendant decided to sacrifice himself to an ideology that despises humanity , he was closely integrated into atta 's group . "
hemberger accused motassadeq of attempting to " veil " the truth about his role in the attacks and called on him to come clean .
" mr. el motassadeq , " he said , " you still have the chance to change the outcome in your favor if you give a complete confession . "
prosecutors say he covered terrorists ' tracks the prosecution paid special attention to motassadeq 's connection to marwan al-shehhi , who flew united airlines flight 175 into the south tower of the world trade center .
motassadeq had power of attorney over al-shehhi 's account at dresdner bank in hamburg .
prosecutors say he used it to cover the tracks of al-shehhi while the united arab emirates native finalized plans in afghanistan for the attacks and learned to fly at a school in florida .
while he was gone , motassadeq paid al-shehhi 's bills and his tuition fees for the summer 2000 semester at harburg technical .
he also approved a € 2,550 -lrb- $ 2,753 -rrb- wire transfer that paid for al-shehhi 's flight school fees .
" the accused , " said hemberger , was " the treasurer , " while atta and the other members of the group were away .
the prosecution also recounted the testimony of witnesses who described the " radicalization " of members of the hamburg group , including motassadeq .
he began to identify with the anti-american , anti-semitic beliefs of the others and supported violent means to battle against the united states and israel , said prosecutors .
in summer 2000 , he traveled to afghanistan and took part in the same al qaeda training camps attended by other members of the hamburg cell .
" motassadeq was permanently integrated into the group , " said matthias krauss , one of three federal prosecutors trying the case .
defense attorneys will argue the exact opposite next week .
they are expected to make the case that motassadeq , who was taken into custody shortly after sept .
11 , did n't make any attempt to leave germany because he was innocent and knew nothing of the plans for the attacks .
motassadeq 's lawyers have bemoaned the absence of statements made by two hamburg cell members they believe would clear their client .
the statements were made by ramzi binalshibh , who is currently in u.s. custody after his arrest in pakistan , and mohammed haydar zammar , who is allegedly being held in a syrian jail .
motassadeq 's attorneys repeatedly sought to secure the documents as evidence in the trial , but germany 's interior ministry and its foreign intelligence agency , the bundesnachrichtendienst , have refused to turn them over to the court .
the agencies argue that doing so would compromise their investigative capabilities . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de families of 9/11 victims testify in hamburg trial radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

as germany renewed its opposition to war against iraq after powell 's speech , u.s. defense secretary , rumsfeld directed a new dart at it , saying germany , libya and cuba are the only countries not helping american efforts . germany 's leaders , having listened attentively to u.s. secretary of state colin powell 's arguments against the iraqi leadership at the u.n. security council , said on thursday that they remained unconvinced that the government should change its opposition to any war against iraq .
the spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder said the government " welcomed " the extensive information presented by powell on wednesday .
" germany is just as concerned as others about the indications that iraq continues to possess weapons of mass destruction , " béla anda said in an statement .
together with the majority of security council members , germany demands that the presented facts be handed over to the u.n. weapons inspectors to be verified , he said .
anda stressed that the inspectors needed the " required time and necessary measures " for their work .
" the german government will continue with all of its powers to speak for a peaceful settlement of the conflict , " anda said .
opposition presses schröder but members of germany 's opposition parties expressed renewed disagreement with schröder and his pledge to have a german vote against any resolution in the u.n. security council that authorized a war on iraq .
" the german chancellor was the only one to jump the gun and isolate the country , " said angela merkel , the chairwoman of germany 's biggest opposition party , the christian democratic union .
" i think this self-imposed isolation is wrong because it does not serve germany 's interests . "
powell 's calm , factual presentation on wednesday was accompanied by another blast of harsh anti-german rhetoric from defense minister donald rumsfeld .
referring to a possible coalition that would join a war on iraq , rumsfeld told a house committee : " then , there are three or four countries that have said they wo n't do anything .
i believe libya , cuba and germany are ones that have indicated they wo n't help in any respect . "
even though rumsfeld said the germans were not helping , they are actually providing support .
germany is assigning 2,600 soldiers to guard 95 u.s. bases and facilities within the country , and schröder has promised the americans that they could use these bases to conduct any war .
the u.s. ambassador in berlin , daniel coats , attempted to tone down rumsfeld 's statements , which came two weeks after he said germany and france belonged to the " old europe " .
in an interview with the daily newspaper berliner zeitung , coats said the defense secretary was not speaking for the u.s. government .
but coats said the german government , together with france , had weakened the pressure on saddam hussein .
" what an irony : the two countries that had persistently pressured the u.s. to refrain from using violence became active in a manner which makes the use of military force more likely , " he said .
" this is extremely frustrating . "
more time for inspectors sought chancellor gerhard schröder and france 's president jacques chirac demanded more time for the u.n. weapons inspectors shortly before chief inspector hans blix presented his report at the end of january .
according to coats , germany should be worried about the consequences .
" serious doubts have arisen in the american public whether germany is still a dependable partner , " he said .
" this harms our relations and it certainly harms germany . "
he added that this could also have economic repercussions .
" there is always the possibility that behavior in other areas could also influence economic relations . "
angelika beer , the co-leader of the greens party , played down rumsfeld 's comments .
" i do n't take them so seriously , " said beer , whose party is the junior coalition partner in the german government .
additional dialogue urged but she said the comments indicated that both countries needed to intensify their dialogue .
" the more critical a relationship is , the more important a dialogue is , " she told the news agency reuters .
during his presentation , powell urged security council members to demand more forcefully that baghdad quickly provide evidence about its weapons programs .
but the 15-member council remains sharply divided over rushing to war .
while the united states and britain said time was fast running out for iraq to fully cooperate with u.n. inspectors , france , russia , china and many other council members called for continued inspections and a peaceful resolution of the crisis .
powell 's anxiously awaited presentation to the security council used newly declassified intelligence , including satellite photos and radio intercepts , to support the u.s. case that iraq has defied all demands that it disarm and has links to al-qaida and other terrorist groups .
he warned that iraq 's weapons of mass destruction threaten the world and urged the council to move against saddam or face " irrelevance .

11 attacks . hamburg - as his trial entered its final phase wednesday , mounir el motassadeq stared back at prosecutors in a hamburg court as they repeated the evidence against him , sometimes shaking his head , sometimes smiling in disbelief .
portraying him as an integral and reliable member of the hamburg-based terrorist cell behind the sept .
11 hijiackings and terror attacks in new york and washington holding similar extremist beliefs , german federal prosecutors ended their closing arguments with the request that motassadeq be sentenced to 15 years in prison .
motassadeq , who is accused of managing financial transactions for members of the terror cell , has maintained that his efforts were no more than favors typical among muslims .
he denies knowing anything about what suspected sept .
11 mastermind mohammed atta and his group were planning .
but the plaintiffs in the case have painted an altogether different picture .
three federal prosecutors and three lawyers for the 21 american co-plaintiffs in the case before hamburg 's higher regional court gave closing arguments before the seven judges who will decide motassadeq 's fate .
defense attorneys are scheduled to give their arguments next wednesday .
the 28-year-old moroccan student is charged with accessory to murder in more than 3,000 cases for the sept .
11 attacks .
he also faces charges of membership in a terrorist organization , which chief judge albrecht menz said tuesday could be reduced to support of a terrorist organization , which can carry a five-year sentence .
" one of the muscles " in his closing statement , co-plaintiff lawyer ulrich von jeinsen said motasssadeq was , if not the arm , then at least " one of the muscles without which the arm would n't have functioned . "
for four months , the prosecution has sought to piece together witness testimony and law enforcement investigation reports to prove how deeply motassedeq was involved with the terrorist group .
on wednesday , they took more than four hours to outline his journey from moroccan student at hamburg 's harburg technical university in 1993 to a close and trusted friend of the hamburg cell of hijackers in the months leading up to sept .
11 .
" the small pieces , unto themselves , might not appear to be much , " said chief prosecutor walter hemberger .
" but together they form a mosaic that proves the guilt and full awareness of the accused . "
hemberger added : " the defendant decided to sacrifice himself to an ideology that despises humanity , he was closely integrated into atta 's group . "
hemberger accused motassadeq of attempting to " veil " the truth about his role in the attacks and called on him to come clean .
" mr. el motassadeq , " he said , " you still have the chance to change the outcome in your favor if you give a complete confession . "
prosecutors say he covered terrorists ' tracks the prosecution paid special attention to motassadeq 's connection to marwan al-shehhi , who flew united airlines flight 175 into the south tower of the world trade center .
motassadeq had power of attorney over al-shehhi 's account at dresdner bank in hamburg .
prosecutors say he used it to cover the tracks of al-shehhi while the united arab emirates native finalized plans in afghanistan for the attacks and learned to fly at a school in florida .
while he was gone , motassadeq paid al-shehhi 's bills and his tuition fees for the summer 2000 semester at harburg technical .
he also approved a € 2,550 -lrb- $ 2,753 -rrb- wire transfer that paid for al-shehhi 's flight school fees .
" the accused , " said hemberger , was " the treasurer , " while atta and the other members of the group were away .
the prosecution also recounted the testimony of witnesses who described the " radicalization " of members of the hamburg group , including motassadeq .
he began to identify with the anti-american , anti-semitic beliefs of the others and supported violent means to battle against the united states and israel , said prosecutors .
in summer 2000 , he traveled to afghanistan and took part in the same al qaeda training camps attended by other members of the hamburg cell .
" motassadeq was permanently integrated into the group , " said matthias krauss , one of three federal prosecutors trying the case .
defense attorneys will argue the exact opposite next week .
they are expected to make the case that motassadeq , who was taken into custody shortly after sept .
11 , did n't make any attempt to leave germany because he was innocent and knew nothing of the plans for the attacks .
motassadeq 's lawyers have bemoaned the absence of statements made by two hamburg cell members they believe would clear their client .
the statements were made by ramzi binalshibh , who is currently in u.s. custody after his arrest in pakistan , and mohammed haydar zammar , who is allegedly being held in a syrian jail .
motassadeq 's attorneys repeatedly sought to secure the documents as evidence in the trial , but germany 's interior ministry and its foreign intelligence agency , the bundesnachrichtendienst , have refused to turn them over to the court .
the agencies argue that doing so would compromise their investigative capabilities . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de families of 9/11 victims testify in hamburg trial radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

prosecutors say he used it to cover the tracks of al-shehhi while the united arab emirates native finalized plans in afghanistan for the attacks and learned to fly at a school in florida .
while he was gone , motassadeq paid al-shehhi 's bills and his tuition fees for the summer 2000 semester at harburg technical .
he also approved a € 2,550 -lrb- $ 2,753 -rrb- wire transfer that paid for al-shehhi 's flight school fees .
" the accused , " said hemberger , was " the treasurer , " while atta and the other members of the group were away .
the prosecution also recounted the testimony of witnesses who described the " radicalization " of members of the hamburg group , including motassadeq .
he began to identify with the anti-american , anti-semitic beliefs of the others and supported violent means to battle against the united states and israel , said prosecutors .
in summer 2000 , he traveled to afghanistan and took part in the same al qaeda training camps attended by other members of the hamburg cell .
" motassadeq was permanently integrated into the group , " said matthias krauss , one of three federal prosecutors trying the case .
defense attorneys will argue the exact opposite next week .
they are expected to make the case that motassadeq , who was taken into custody shortly after sept .
11 , did n't make any attempt to leave germany because he was innocent and knew nothing of the plans for the attacks .
motassadeq 's lawyers have bemoaned the absence of statements made by two hamburg cell members they believe would clear their client .
the statements were made by ramzi binalshibh , who is currently in u.s. custody after his arrest in pakistan , and mohammed haydar zammar , who is allegedly being held in a syrian jail .
motassadeq 's attorneys repeatedly sought to secure the documents as evidence in the trial , but germany 's interior ministry and its foreign intelligence agency , the bundesnachrichtendienst , have refused to turn them over to the court .
the agencies argue that doing so would compromise their investigative capabilities . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de families of 9/11 victims testify in hamburg trial radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 06.02.2003 powell fails to change german opposition on iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumsfeld sees strange bedfellows for chancellor schröder : cuba 's fidel castro and libya 's moammar gadhafi .
as germany renewed its opposition to war against iraq after powell 's speech , u.s. defense secretary , rumsfeld directed a new dart at it , saying germany , libya and cuba are the only countries not helping american efforts . germany 's leaders , having listened attentively to u.s. secretary of state colin powell 's arguments against the iraqi leadership at the u.n. security council , said on thursday that they remained unconvinced that the government should change its opposition to any war against iraq .
the spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder said the government " welcomed " the extensive information presented by powell on wednesday .
" germany is just as concerned as others about the indications that iraq continues to possess weapons of mass destruction , " béla anda said in an statement .
together with the majority of security council members , germany demands that the presented facts be handed over to the u.n. weapons inspectors to be verified , he said .
anda stressed that the inspectors needed the " required time and necessary measures " for their work .
" the german government will continue with all of its powers to speak for a peaceful settlement of the conflict , " anda said .
opposition presses schröder but members of germany 's opposition parties expressed renewed disagreement with schröder and his pledge to have a german vote against any resolution in the u.n. security council that authorized a war on iraq .
" the german chancellor was the only one to jump the gun and isolate the country , " said angela merkel , the chairwoman of germany 's biggest opposition party , the christian democratic union .
" i think this self-imposed isolation is wrong because it does not serve germany 's interests . "
powell 's calm , factual presentation on wednesday was accompanied by another blast of harsh anti-german rhetoric from defense minister donald rumsfeld .
referring to a possible coalition that would join a war on iraq , rumsfeld told a house committee : " then , there are three or four countries that have said they wo n't do anything .
i believe libya , cuba and germany are ones that have indicated they wo n't help in any respect . "
even though rumsfeld said the germans were not helping , they are actually providing support .
germany is assigning 2,600 soldiers to guard 95 u.s. bases and facilities within the country , and schröder has promised the americans that they could use these bases to conduct any war .
the u.s. ambassador in berlin , daniel coats , attempted to tone down rumsfeld 's statements , which came two weeks after he said germany and france belonged to the " old europe " .
in an interview with the daily newspaper berliner zeitung , coats said the defense secretary was not speaking for the u.s. government .
but coats said the german government , together with france , had weakened the pressure on saddam hussein .
" what an irony : the two countries that had persistently pressured the u.s. to refrain from using violence became active in a manner which makes the use of military force more likely , " he said .
" this is extremely frustrating . "
more time for inspectors sought chancellor gerhard schröder and france 's president jacques chirac demanded more time for the u.n. weapons inspectors shortly before chief inspector hans blix presented his report at the end of january .
according to coats , germany should be worried about the consequences .
" serious doubts have arisen in the american public whether germany is still a dependable partner , " he said .
" this harms our relations and it certainly harms germany . "
he added that this could also have economic repercussions .
" there is always the possibility that behavior in other areas could also influence economic relations . "
angelika beer , the co-leader of the greens party , played down rumsfeld 's comments .
" i do n't take them so seriously , " said beer , whose party is the junior coalition partner in the german government .
additional dialogue urged but she said the comments indicated that both countries needed to intensify their dialogue .
" the more critical a relationship is , the more important a dialogue is , " she told the news agency reuters .
during his presentation , powell urged security council members to demand more forcefully that baghdad quickly provide evidence about its weapons programs .
but the 15-member council remains sharply divided over rushing to war .
while the united states and britain said time was fast running out for iraq to fully cooperate with u.n. inspectors , france , russia , china and many other council members called for continued inspections and a peaceful resolution of the crisis .
powell 's anxiously awaited presentation to the security council used newly declassified intelligence , including satellite photos and radio intercepts , to support the u.s. case that iraq has defied all demands that it disarm and has links to al-qaida and other terrorist groups .
he warned that iraq 's weapons of mass destruction threaten the world and urged the council to move against saddam or face " irrelevance .

on wednesday , the american chamber of commerce in germany issued a report showing that u.s. companies are the greatest single investor in germany and that there are currently no signs tensions between berlin and washington has had any impact on business ties .
" the german-american economic relationship is very deep and very good , " said chamber of commerce president fred irwin .
" there have always been tensions , but in economic terms , it 's always been ' business as usual . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the following day , germany 's federal commissioner for foreign investment , hilmar kopper -lrb- photo -rrb- , concurred , saying there was no evidence the berlin-washington political tangle has made had any impact on trade .
" in no way have i seen any indication that the discord has crossed over into the thoughts of investors , " he said .
nonetheless , kopper , who also serves as chairmen of daimlerchrysler 's supervisory board , said he is forecasting direct foreign investment in germany will drop by 50 percent this year to a total of € 20 billion due to the weak global economy .
a hardening relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald rumsfeld meanwhile , german businesses fear that political discord between u.s. president george w. bush and schröder 's government could begin to adversely affect the economic transatlantic relationship .
the head of the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade , anton börner , admonished schröder 's government thursday to do everything it can to end the diplomatic crisis .
if the animosities continue to grow , he cautioned , bilateral trade between the u.s. and germany could fall by as much as 10 percent and reduce economic growth in germany by 0.3 percent .
" more and more german companies are starting to feel the hardening of the relationship and are concerned about their business commitments , " in the u.s. , he warned .
" any development that speeds up the erosion -lrb- of the relationship -rrb- needs to be avoided . "
u.s. companies in germany twice as profitable the american chamber of commerce report , conducted in cooperation with the consulting firm droege , offered a rosier account of german-american business ties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel the report found that close to 1,800 subsidiaries of american companies in germany employ about 800,000 people and pull in revenues of around € 540 billion -lrb- $ 585 billion -rrb- .
of the subsidiaries surveyed , 38 percent said their germany revenues accounted for more than 10 percent of their mother company 's worldwide sales .
on average , the american companies also said they enjoyed market shares of about 22 percent in their respective sectors .
according to the latest figures , compiled in 1999 , u.s. companies have invested more than € 40 billion in germany .
tax hikes worse than rumsfeld rift ?
still , irwin warned that the current tax plans the german government has on the table could be more devastating for u.s.-german business relations than schröder 's iraq position .
" the most important issue facing investors is not the political tensions , but the investment climate , " irwin said .
" the problem here is a lack of any real tax policy , " he explained .

anda stressed that the inspectors needed the " required time and necessary measures " for their work .
" the german government will continue with all of its powers to speak for a peaceful settlement of the conflict , " anda said .
opposition presses schröder but members of germany 's opposition parties expressed renewed disagreement with schröder and his pledge to have a german vote against any resolution in the u.n. security council that authorized a war on iraq .
" the german chancellor was the only one to jump the gun and isolate the country , " said angela merkel , the chairwoman of germany 's biggest opposition party , the christian democratic union .
" i think this self-imposed isolation is wrong because it does not serve germany 's interests . "
powell 's calm , factual presentation on wednesday was accompanied by another blast of harsh anti-german rhetoric from defense minister donald rumsfeld .
referring to a possible coalition that would join a war on iraq , rumsfeld told a house committee : " then , there are three or four countries that have said they wo n't do anything .
i believe libya , cuba and germany are ones that have indicated they wo n't help in any respect . "
even though rumsfeld said the germans were not helping , they are actually providing support .
germany is assigning 2,600 soldiers to guard 95 u.s. bases and facilities within the country , and schröder has promised the americans that they could use these bases to conduct any war .
the u.s. ambassador in berlin , daniel coats , attempted to tone down rumsfeld 's statements , which came two weeks after he said germany and france belonged to the " old europe " .
in an interview with the daily newspaper berliner zeitung , coats said the defense secretary was not speaking for the u.s. government .
but coats said the german government , together with france , had weakened the pressure on saddam hussein .
" what an irony : the two countries that had persistently pressured the u.s. to refrain from using violence became active in a manner which makes the use of military force more likely , " he said .
" this is extremely frustrating . "
more time for inspectors sought chancellor gerhard schröder and france 's president jacques chirac demanded more time for the u.n. weapons inspectors shortly before chief inspector hans blix presented his report at the end of january .
according to coats , germany should be worried about the consequences .
" serious doubts have arisen in the american public whether germany is still a dependable partner , " he said .
" this harms our relations and it certainly harms germany . "
he added that this could also have economic repercussions .
" there is always the possibility that behavior in other areas could also influence economic relations . "
angelika beer , the co-leader of the greens party , played down rumsfeld 's comments .
" i do n't take them so seriously , " said beer , whose party is the junior coalition partner in the german government .
additional dialogue urged but she said the comments indicated that both countries needed to intensify their dialogue .
" the more critical a relationship is , the more important a dialogue is , " she told the news agency reuters .
during his presentation , powell urged security council members to demand more forcefully that baghdad quickly provide evidence about its weapons programs .
but the 15-member council remains sharply divided over rushing to war .
while the united states and britain said time was fast running out for iraq to fully cooperate with u.n. inspectors , france , russia , china and many other council members called for continued inspections and a peaceful resolution of the crisis .
powell 's anxiously awaited presentation to the security council used newly declassified intelligence , including satellite photos and radio intercepts , to support the u.s. case that iraq has defied all demands that it disarm and has links to al-qaida and other terrorist groups .
he warned that iraq 's weapons of mass destruction threaten the world and urged the council to move against saddam or face " irrelevance .

on wednesday , the american chamber of commerce in germany issued a report showing that u.s. companies are the greatest single investor in germany and that there are currently no signs tensions between berlin and washington has had any impact on business ties .
" the german-american economic relationship is very deep and very good , " said chamber of commerce president fred irwin .

11 attacks . hamburg - as his trial entered its final phase wednesday , mounir el motassadeq stared back at prosecutors in a hamburg court as they repeated the evidence against him , sometimes shaking his head , sometimes smiling in disbelief .
portraying him as an integral and reliable member of the hamburg-based terrorist cell behind the sept .
11 hijiackings and terror attacks in new york and washington holding similar extremist beliefs , german federal prosecutors ended their closing arguments with the request that motassadeq be sentenced to 15 years in prison .
motassadeq , who is accused of managing financial transactions for members of the terror cell , has maintained that his efforts were no more than favors typical among muslims .
he denies knowing anything about what suspected sept .
11 mastermind mohammed atta and his group were planning .
but the plaintiffs in the case have painted an altogether different picture .
three federal prosecutors and three lawyers for the 21 american co-plaintiffs in the case before hamburg 's higher regional court gave closing arguments before the seven judges who will decide motassadeq 's fate .
defense attorneys are scheduled to give their arguments next wednesday .
the 28-year-old moroccan student is charged with accessory to murder in more than 3,000 cases for the sept .
11 attacks .
he also faces charges of membership in a terrorist organization , which chief judge albrecht menz said tuesday could be reduced to support of a terrorist organization , which can carry a five-year sentence .
" one of the muscles " in his closing statement , co-plaintiff lawyer ulrich von jeinsen said motasssadeq was , if not the arm , then at least " one of the muscles without which the arm would n't have functioned . "
for four months , the prosecution has sought to piece together witness testimony and law enforcement investigation reports to prove how deeply motassedeq was involved with the terrorist group .
on wednesday , they took more than four hours to outline his journey from moroccan student at hamburg 's harburg technical university in 1993 to a close and trusted friend of the hamburg cell of hijackers in the months leading up to sept .
11 .
" the small pieces , unto themselves , might not appear to be much , " said chief prosecutor walter hemberger .
" but together they form a mosaic that proves the guilt and full awareness of the accused . "
hemberger added : " the defendant decided to sacrifice himself to an ideology that despises humanity , he was closely integrated into atta 's group . "
hemberger accused motassadeq of attempting to " veil " the truth about his role in the attacks and called on him to come clean .
" mr. el motassadeq , " he said , " you still have the chance to change the outcome in your favor if you give a complete confession . "
prosecutors say he covered terrorists ' tracks the prosecution paid special attention to motassadeq 's connection to marwan al-shehhi , who flew united airlines flight 175 into the south tower of the world trade center .
motassadeq had power of attorney over al-shehhi 's account at dresdner bank in hamburg .
prosecutors say he used it to cover the tracks of al-shehhi while the united arab emirates native finalized plans in afghanistan for the attacks and learned to fly at a school in florida .
while he was gone , motassadeq paid al-shehhi 's bills and his tuition fees for the summer 2000 semester at harburg technical .
he also approved a € 2,550 -lrb- $ 2,753 -rrb- wire transfer that paid for al-shehhi 's flight school fees .
" the accused , " said hemberger , was " the treasurer , " while atta and the other members of the group were away .
the prosecution also recounted the testimony of witnesses who described the " radicalization " of members of the hamburg group , including motassadeq .
he began to identify with the anti-american , anti-semitic beliefs of the others and supported violent means to battle against the united states and israel , said prosecutors .
in summer 2000 , he traveled to afghanistan and took part in the same al qaeda training camps attended by other members of the hamburg cell .
" motassadeq was permanently integrated into the group , " said matthias krauss , one of three federal prosecutors trying the case .
defense attorneys will argue the exact opposite next week .
they are expected to make the case that motassadeq , who was taken into custody shortly after sept .
11 , did n't make any attempt to leave germany because he was innocent and knew nothing of the plans for the attacks .
motassadeq 's lawyers have bemoaned the absence of statements made by two hamburg cell members they believe would clear their client .
the statements were made by ramzi binalshibh , who is currently in u.s. custody after his arrest in pakistan , and mohammed haydar zammar , who is allegedly being held in a syrian jail .
motassadeq 's attorneys repeatedly sought to secure the documents as evidence in the trial , but germany 's interior ministry and its foreign intelligence agency , the bundesnachrichtendienst , have refused to turn them over to the court .

for four months , the prosecution has sought to piece together witness testimony and law enforcement investigation reports to prove how deeply motassedeq was involved with the terrorist group .
on wednesday , they took more than four hours to outline his journey from moroccan student at hamburg 's harburg technical university in 1993 to a close and trusted friend of the hamburg cell of hijackers in the months leading up to sept .
11 .
" the small pieces , unto themselves , might not appear to be much , " said chief prosecutor walter hemberger .
" but together they form a mosaic that proves the guilt and full awareness of the accused . "
hemberger added : " the defendant decided to sacrifice himself to an ideology that despises humanity , he was closely integrated into atta 's group . "
hemberger accused motassadeq of attempting to " veil " the truth about his role in the attacks and called on him to come clean .
" mr. el motassadeq , " he said , " you still have the chance to change the outcome in your favor if you give a complete confession . "
prosecutors say he covered terrorists ' tracks the prosecution paid special attention to motassadeq 's connection to marwan al-shehhi , who flew united airlines flight 175 into the south tower of the world trade center .
motassadeq had power of attorney over al-shehhi 's account at dresdner bank in hamburg .
prosecutors say he used it to cover the tracks of al-shehhi while the united arab emirates native finalized plans in afghanistan for the attacks and learned to fly at a school in florida .
while he was gone , motassadeq paid al-shehhi 's bills and his tuition fees for the summer 2000 semester at harburg technical .
he also approved a € 2,550 -lrb- $ 2,753 -rrb- wire transfer that paid for al-shehhi 's flight school fees .
" the accused , " said hemberger , was " the treasurer , " while atta and the other members of the group were away .
the prosecution also recounted the testimony of witnesses who described the " radicalization " of members of the hamburg group , including motassadeq .
he began to identify with the anti-american , anti-semitic beliefs of the others and supported violent means to battle against the united states and israel , said prosecutors .
in summer 2000 , he traveled to afghanistan and took part in the same al qaeda training camps attended by other members of the hamburg cell .
" motassadeq was permanently integrated into the group , " said matthias krauss , one of three federal prosecutors trying the case .
defense attorneys will argue the exact opposite next week .
they are expected to make the case that motassadeq , who was taken into custody shortly after sept .
11 , did n't make any attempt to leave germany because he was innocent and knew nothing of the plans for the attacks .
motassadeq 's lawyers have bemoaned the absence of statements made by two hamburg cell members they believe would clear their client .
the statements were made by ramzi binalshibh , who is currently in u.s. custody after his arrest in pakistan , and mohammed haydar zammar , who is allegedly being held in a syrian jail .
motassadeq 's attorneys repeatedly sought to secure the documents as evidence in the trial , but germany 's interior ministry and its foreign intelligence agency , the bundesnachrichtendienst , have refused to turn them over to the court .
the agencies argue that doing so would compromise their investigative capabilities . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de families of 9/11 victims testify in hamburg trial 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

venezuelan president hugo chavez made the move as substantially reduced , two-month-old strike by opposition groups continues to drag on the economy .
" it 's a positive measure we are taking to defend our economic sovereignty , " he said .
the government fixed the exchange rate at 1,598 bolivars to the us dollar .
the venezuelan currency last traded at 1,853 to the dollar when the government halted trade on 22 january .
mr chavez said foreign debt payments and the import of basic foods and medicines would be a priority .
economic defence the country 's foreign reserves are in a strong position after mr chavez 's fourth year in office .
despite falling $ 1.23bn since the strike began on 2 december , venezuela still has $ 11.26bn , enough for 10 months of imports .
" we are willing to do anything to defend our reserves and economic stability from speculative attacks and capital flight , " said mr chavez .
currency traders have sold off the bolivar this year , sending it tumbling 24 % against the dollar until the government suspended trading .
mr chavez said oil production , which accounts a third of the economy and half of government revenues , has hit almost 2 million barrels per day , up from 150,000 in december .
before the strike , the world 's fifth largest oil exporter was producing 3.2 million barrels per day .
sacked workers from state-oil firm petroleos de venezuela -lrb- pdvsa -rrb- claim production is only 1.25 million .
currency rules under the new currency rules , foreign companies have to register with the government before they can repatriate profits overseas , mr chavez said .
he also said access to the international currency markets would be restricted for the strikers .
" not one dollar more to the coup mongers , " he said .
the central bank and a new regulator will control foreign exchange operations .
business groups and labour unions joined together to oust the democratically elected mr chavez by disrupting the economy , especially the oil sector .
but faced with bankruptcy , many businesses returned to work , breaking with the labour groups , many of whose members have been sacked during the dispute .

freezing temperatures and hoarding in case there is a war , causing a sharp fall in us stocks of heating oil , also supported the price .

in new york , gold ended down $ 2.70 at $ 377.20 an ounce after the london price retreated from its highest level since september 1996 , to close at $ 380.70 per ounce .
international support while many traders believed mr powell 's speech raised the likelihood of war against iraq , there were signs that the us was receiving greater international support for its position .

" this morning we tried to hire a diamond-tipped drill but were told there was none available , " said ron manners , chairman of croesus mining , australia 's third-ranking gold producer .

two-weeks ago crude hit a 26-month high of $ 35.20 per barrel .
the us dollar has remained unchanged , after edging up of four-year lows in new york following the speech , trading at 1.0783 against the euro at 0620 gmt from $ 1.0938 in london .

in new york , gold ended down $ 2.70 at $ 377.20 an ounce after the london price retreated from its highest level since september 1996 , to close at $ 380.70 per ounce .
international support while many traders believed mr powell 's speech raised the likelihood of war against iraq , there were signs that the us was receiving greater international support for its position .
" comments by powell , combined with a report from the european union that they would back action against iraq " were behind the dollar 's rally , said neil parker , strategist at royal bank of scotland . "
the market is drawing a conclusion that war is not too far away , which is better than constant worrying about when it 's going to be , or if it 's going to be " jason james , global strategist at hsbc shares in london staged a late rally , with a firm response by us stocks helping the ftse 100 index close up 2.5 % .
" the market is drawing a conclusion that war is not too far away , which is better than constant worrying about when it 's going to be , or if it 's going to be , " said jason james , global strategist at hsbc in london .

in the us , ed white , of boston-based money manager gannett welsh & kotler said mr powell 's speech was " positive for the financial markets initially " .
but he added : " if this war does n't turn out to be quick , surgical and successful , the market will probably go the other way . "
safe haven the price of gold has risen almost 9 % this year , boosting in turn the price of shares in gold firms , and sparking a run on mining equipment .
" this morning we tried to hire a diamond-tipped drill but were told there was none available , " said ron manners , chairman of croesus mining , australia 's third-ranking gold producer .

glen heavenor was inspired to act after noticing the poor brushing techniques of many of his patients .
the 50-year-old inventor claims his design increases control and cuts joint strain .
mr heavenor is now hoping to modify the easy-use handle for cutlery , razors , hairdryers and pens .
i knew instinctively when i came up with the design that i was on to something glen heavenor mr heavenor , whose daughter kate presents children 's tv on the bbc , has already seen his handle design used on prams , hairbrushes and pans .
" bending toothbrushes into different shapes is something you can do very easily because you can heat them up , " he said .
" i knew instinctively when i came up with the design that i was on to something .
" when i sanded that first design in the bathroom it was like giving birth to a toothbrush . "
the inventor said the technology , which he has patented under the name rotilt , increases control of objects and can cut joint strain .
lottery support the handle , which spirals and ends with a bump , follows the shape of bones in the forearms and reduces awkward movements .
although his toothbrush was initially rejected , the dentist said he was determined to try again after securing deals with mothercare for stroller handles and scots firm albyn for hairbrushes .
mr heavenor was given the cash after applying to the national endowment for science , technology and the arts -lrb- nesta -rrb- , a lottery-backed group to support inventors and artists , giving him an extra day off work to spend on new designs .
a spokesman for the group said : " hopefully , with our support , glen will be able to devote the necessary time to give the project every chance of success . "

the appearance of no less than four former army generals contesting the presidency in the 19 april elections is an indication that at a personal level at least , military men are still right at the forefront of power .
this perhaps comes as little surprise .
ex-army candidates olusegun obasanjo : military head of state -lrb- 1976-1979 -rrb- muhammadu buhari : military head of state -lrb- 1984-1985 -rrb- ike nwachukwu : foreign minister under military rule chukwuemeka odumegwua ojukwu : leader of break-away state of biafra -lrb- 1967-1970 -rrb- nigeria 's post-independence history has been dominated by the military .
apart from a brief period of civilian rule between 1979 and 1983 , a succession of military governments ruled nigeria from the mid-1960s right through until 1999 when a civilian government led by olusegun obasanjo , himself a former military head of state , was elected into office .
during this era dominated by the military , a small group of senior officers became both extremely wealthy and also very powerful in business and political circles .
it was also widely recognised to have been a time in which massive high-level corruption and economic mismanagement severely undermined the country 's development .
' transition ' nigerians frequently express their tolerance of the presence of former military officers in politics by considering it as a " transitional " phase .
what they mean by this is that over time , perhaps by the next election in 2007 , the generals will have moved aside to allow the younger politicians through to high office .
even that timescale seems optimistic .
for now , former military officers and their allies dominate politics not just at the level of the presidential candidates , but behind the scenes as well .
obasanjo 's backer few doubt the continuing influence nigeria 's longest serving military leader , general ibrahim babangida -lrb- 1985-1993 -rrb- , holds in the election process .
he is reputed to be one of nigeria 's best connected and wealthiest individuals in a country where money plays a central role in politics .
olusegun obasanjo 1937 : born in south-west ; a christian and a yoruba 1976-79 : military ruler 1995-98 : jailed by military regime 1999 : elected president click here for a full profile in 1999 he backed the obasanjo campaign both financially and by bringing his considerable influence to bear on northern political and business interests .
this was despite mr obasanjo 's origins as a southern , yoruba-speaking christian .
support from mr babangida , a northern muslim , is a powerful indication of the strength of military ties over regional and ethnic issues , as well as a measure of how necessary it was felt to have a former army man in power .
while it is less clear what role mr babangida is playing in the 2003 elections , his presence has been felt throughout the campaigning .
any mention of a meeting between one of the candidates and mr babangida brings a flurry of media interest .
he is believed to be financially backing at least one of the smaller parties , but no-one considers this much more than a vehicle for launching any future political ambitions he might have .
rivals mr obasanjo 's closest rival for the presidency muhammadu buhari -lrb- 1983-1985 -rrb- would certainly like to have mr babangida 's support .
but there is little evidence of this , despite both men being northern muslims .
muhammadu buhari military ruler of nigeria from 1984 to 1985 deposed in a coup poor human rights record seen as honest muslim from northern nigeria running mate is chuba okadigbo , from south-east click here for a full profile it can not have helped their personal relationship for mr buhari to have been overthrown by mr babangida in 1985 and then locked up by him .
all indications are that it suits mr babangida for mr obasanjo to win a second term of office , after which he will no doubt leave the pundits guessing whether he intends to stand for election himself in 2007 .
the other two military men in the race are ike nwachukwu , a former foreign minister during mr babangida 's rule , and emeka odumugwu-ojukwu .
for many nigerians , the name ojukwu is associated with just one thing - the attempted secession of eastern nigeria from the rest of the federation and the subsequent bloody and deeply divisive civil war of 1967-1970 .
then as now , mr ojukwu has no regrets about the war , seeing his role as one of saving the igbo-speaking people of nigeria from a brutal " genocide " by the country 's other ethnic groups .
he remembers the short-lived biafran nation fondly as a place of sanctuary for the igbo , not a break-away state as such .
this interpretation of history will do little to persuade nigeria 's non-igbo communities to vote for him .
nor is he likely to get sufficient support even within his own eastern nigeria .
this is one general for which time and nigeria has moved on , leaving him well behind in the shadows .
civilian democracy that leaves former general ike nwachukwu , along with two other non-military eastern candidates as possible flag-bearers for the igbos in the east .
although at this stage it is clear that no igbo president is likely to be elected at these forthcoming elections .
now that former vice-president alex ekwueme has lost the ruling party -lrb- pdp -rrb- nomination to mr obasanjo , the best chance for igbo representation in the presidency is mr buhari 's vice-presidential running mate , chuba okadigbo .
all this boils down to one inescapable conclusion .
the 2003 presidential campaign is being dominated if not by the military itself , then by men who made their names during military rule .
it will take many years yet for this " transitional " phase to end in a fully-fledged civilian democracy in which the backing of military men is no longer a significant factor in electoral victory . watch / listen on this story muhammadu buhari on bbc network africa " the anger has no credibility " civilian handover key stories generals ' election challenging poll olusegun obasanjo muhammadu buhari election issues sharia split corruption battle spiral of violence crime wave economic woes digital revolution oil wealth shuns needy background country profile timeline forum president obasanjo took your questions see also : 06 jan 03 -pipe- africa nigerian party backs obasanjo 02 jan 03 -pipe- africa nigerian leader sorry for army massacre 01 apr 02 -pipe- africa rights group slams nigeria over killings internet links : bbc network africa bbc focus on africa nigerian presidency nigeria.com the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top africa stories now : ebola outbreak confirmed in congo malawi minister reveals aids trauma kenyan president opens parliament dr congo rebels go on trial nigerian id scheme kicks off tunisian internet crackdown wild pigs threaten somali peace talks anti-french protests in ivory coast links to more africa stories are at the foot of the page .

the board of visitors pays tribute to the high standards of employees at the prison , but also highlights areas of concern .
the report describes the prison as " seriously understaffed " , and says pressure on the budget is having a significant impact on the services it provides .
despite more than 30 proven allegations of racial discrimination between prisoners , there are not enough resources to release a member of staff to train as a race relations officer .
' difficult job ' the board of visitors also cites several instances where a sikh minister had to be turned away from the prison , simply because nobody was available to escort him .
other services , such as one-to-one psychologist work and the gymnasium have also been affected by shortages .
however , the report says the prison is still a " safe place " with no suicides this year .
it also praises staff for doing a " difficult job with compassion " .

the board of visitors pays tribute to the high standards of employees at the prison , but also highlights areas of concern .
the report describes the prison as " seriously understaffed " , and says pressure on the budget is having a significant impact on the services it provides .
despite more than 30 proven allegations of racial discrimination between prisoners , there are not enough resources to release a member of staff to train as a race relations officer .
' difficult job ' the board of visitors also cites several instances where a sikh minister had to be turned away from the prison , simply because nobody was available to escort him .
other services , such as one-to-one psychologist work and the gymnasium have also been affected by shortages .
however , the report says the prison is still a " safe place " with no suicides this year .
it also praises staff for doing a " difficult job with compassion " .

the 100-year-old shipyard in woolston is due to close by the end of the year , with all building work moving to portsmouth .
bosses have offered what they say is a " very generous " offer to ease the move totalling £ 1.7m , including minibuses and petrol for the first year .
but the gmb union says that because many staff have walked to work for decades , the compensation package is insufficient .
the company has just won a new contract to build part of two new aircraft carriers , with bae systems , for the navy .
the work , which will be carried out in portsmouth , will guarantee jobs for 1,200 people for at least the next decade , and possibly the next 20 years .

the move puts it in direct competition with asian giant nintendo whose gameboy dominates the market for handheld games .
sega is signed up to provide titles for nokia 's n-gage machine .
the n-gage launch is part of a wider strategy by all handset makers to get consumers doing more with their phones .
battle drawn nokia first announced its plans for the n-gage in november last year .
at a press conference on wednesday , the company said it will be available during the fourth quarter of 2003 around the world , but a price has not been set .
although many of the latest phones have better games on board thanks to colour screens and fast processors , the n-gage will be for more dedicated fans .
games for the n-gage will be on memory cards that slot into the gadget .
sega is planning to release titles featuring its mascot sonic the hedgehog on the n-gage .
in launching the n-gage nokia is taking on nintendo which has sold more than 24 million gameboy advance units worldwide since its launch in march 2001 .
to compete with nintendo 's gameboy that sells for 130euro -lrb- £ 85 -rrb- , nokia will probably have to be prepared to make a loss on every n-gage sold .
according to figures from telecom one the nokia 7210 is currently the most popular games phone and it sells for more than twice the price of the gameboy on some uk networks .
a new dedicated device is likely to be even more expensive .
earlier this year nintendo launched the latest version of the gameboy advance , the sp , which sheaths the gadget in a sleek steel shell .
slow burn although more sophisticated games are appearing on handsets , it remains to be seen whether people will be willing to buy a more dedicated games playing machine .
nokia is hoping bluetooth short-range radio technology will prove a draw as it will let n-gage owners take each other on .
mobile phone firms and handset makers are keen to get people doing more with their phones and making greater use of data services such as games , sound and images .
games for phones are slowly catching on thanks to the emergence of phones like the nokia 7210 and 7650 , the sharp gx10 and services such as vodafone live which let people download titles .
telecom one reports that the number of phone games downloaded from its portal leapt by 250 % in january when compared to the same period in december .
newer phones can run download and run java games and sites such as midlet.org are springing up as clearing houses for these titles .
bbc micro fans can even relive the glory of classic title repton on their nokia 7650 phone thanks to game maker masabi .
