istanbul was shaken by deadly terror attacks on thursday that exploded in the banking quarter and in front of the british consulate .
the international fight against terror must be intensified . whoever is behind the istanbul attacks is likely to bomb the country even deeper into a conflict it has tried to keep itself out of in recent months : during the iraq war turkey was pained by the unreserved support of u.s. policies toward iraq that was demanded of it . the turkish refusal to allow the allies to use its territory for deploying their troops severely disturbed the american plan .

germany responded to the second set of bombings in istanbul with harsh words of condemnation .
but the attacks have also ignited a fresh round of debate on turkey ’ s bid to join the eu . quick to condemn thursday ’ s bombings in istanbul , german leaders across the political spectrum expressed their dismay and indignation that the turkish city on europe ’ s edge was again attacked by islamic terrorists .
german foreign policy experts regarded the blasts in downtown istanbul in front of the british consulate and the hsbc bank as yet another attempt by fundamentalists to sever ties between the western and muslim worlds .
gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats , told deutsche welle that the brutal attacks require a strong reaction from the civilized world .
" the terrorists are aiming to drive a wedge between the west and muslim countries , " he maintained , and added that the choice of turkey , a " key country " between europe and the islamic world , was deliberate for the series of attacks .
" the terrorists want to cut off the relationship between islam and the christian world , " weisskirchen said and targeted turkey because they want to send out a signal of fear to the muslims not to align themselves too closely with the west .
bolstering turkey ’ s bid for the eu it is precisely for this reason that many german politicians are arguing that it is more important than ever to support turkey 's democratization process and to aid it in its bid to join the european union as soon as possible .
social democrat interior minister otto schily told german public television zdf on thursday that germany needs to encourage dialogue between the eu and turkey with a view to giving turkey a " clear perspective " as to when and under which conditions it may join the european bloc in the future .
" our reaction to what has happened in istanbul can only be closer cooperation with turkey , " the minister said .
turkey imports threat to europe but the conservative opposition has jumped to a different conclusion in face of this week ’ s attacks .
christian democrat union deputy parliamentary leader wolfgang bosbach addressed the fears of many in his party when he said that turkish membership in the eu would place other member countries in greater danger than they already are .
" a quick eu accession for turkey would import the terror problem to europe , " bosbach was quoted in the passauer neue presse as saying .
the cdu member also said that a muslim-dominated country does not belong in a bloc supposedly based on christian values , an argument many in the conservative party endorse .
ingo friedrich , a senior member of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , has also criticized attempts to extend the eu beyond the bosporus .
" it would n't work , " he said , " because the european union would be overstretched endangering the entire project of achieving peace and stability in europe . "
friedrich , who is also a deputy speaker of the european parliament , added that a speedy inclusion " could even intensify terrorism in turkey because islamic extremists would feel that a key muslim country is forcibly alienated from the islamic world . "
other politicians , such as werner hoyer , foreign affairs spokesman for the neo-liberal free democrats , are convinced including turkey in the eu could provide a concrete example of mutually beneficial cooperation between the western and muslim worlds and could help put an end to the talk about a clash of civilizations .
" what we have to do is to make sure that turkey remains on the western track .

germany responded to the second set of bombings in istanbul with harsh words of condemnation .
but the attacks have also ignited a fresh round of debate on turkey ’ s bid to join the eu . quick to condemn thursday ’ s bombings in istanbul , german leaders across the political spectrum expressed their dismay and indignation that the turkish city on europe ’ s edge was again attacked by islamic terrorists .
german foreign policy experts regarded the blasts in downtown istanbul in front of the british consulate and the hsbc bank as yet another attempt by fundamentalists to sever ties between the western and muslim worlds .
gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats , told deutsche welle that the brutal attacks require a strong reaction from the civilized world .
" the terrorists are aiming to drive a wedge between the west and muslim countries , " he maintained , and added that the choice of turkey , a " key country " between europe and the islamic world , was deliberate for the series of attacks .
" the terrorists want to cut off the relationship between islam and the christian world , " weisskirchen said and targeted turkey because they want to send out a signal of fear to the muslims not to align themselves too closely with the west .
bolstering turkey ’ s bid for the eu it is precisely for this reason that many german politicians are arguing that it is more important than ever to support turkey 's democratization process and to aid it in its bid to join the european union as soon as possible .
social democrat interior minister otto schily told german public television zdf on thursday that germany needs to encourage dialogue between the eu and turkey with a view to giving turkey a " clear perspective " as to when and under which conditions it may join the european bloc in the future .
" our reaction to what has happened in istanbul can only be closer cooperation with turkey , " the minister said .
turkey imports threat to europe but the conservative opposition has jumped to a different conclusion in face of this week ’ s attacks .
christian democrat union deputy parliamentary leader wolfgang bosbach addressed the fears of many in his party when he said that turkish membership in the eu would place other member countries in greater danger than they already are .
" a quick eu accession for turkey would import the terror problem to europe , " bosbach was quoted in the passauer neue presse as saying .
the cdu member also said that a muslim-dominated country does not belong in a bloc supposedly based on christian values , an argument many in the conservative party endorse .
ingo friedrich , a senior member of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , has also criticized attempts to extend the eu beyond the bosporus .
" it would n't work , " he said , " because the european union would be overstretched endangering the entire project of achieving peace and stability in europe . "
friedrich , who is also a deputy speaker of the european parliament , added that a speedy inclusion " could even intensify terrorism in turkey because islamic extremists would feel that a key muslim country is forcibly alienated from the islamic world . "
other politicians , such as werner hoyer , foreign affairs spokesman for the neo-liberal free democrats , are convinced including turkey in the eu could provide a concrete example of mutually beneficial cooperation between the western and muslim worlds and could help put an end to the talk about a clash of civilizations .
" what we have to do is to make sure that turkey remains on the western track .
it would be a real strengthening of europe if turkey stays in the western boat and that it becomes a member of the european union , " hoyer said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : high stakes for turkey istanbul was shaken by deadly terror attacks on thursday that exploded in the banking quarter and in front of the british consulate .

chancellor gerhard schröder is in new york to promote business ties and attract greater u.s. investment .
the sales pitch ?
his planned package of reforms will get europe ’ s largest economy running smoothly again . throwing himself into the role of germany ’ s top salesman , chancellor gerhard schröder came to new york looking to strengthen u.s.-german business ties .
and as any good salesman would , he remained optimistic halfway through his short trip , despite a looming transatlantic trade war and soaring euro against the u.s. dollar . speaking at the the american institute for contemporary german studies , which was honoring citigroup chief sanford weill , schröder trumpeted his so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package of economic and welfare reforms as just what germany needed to stay competitive in the 21st century . “ we want to get our country in shape for the challenges of this decade , this century , in order to be an equal partner , ” schröder said before an audience of 500 business leaders .
“ we ’ ve realized after a period of being satisfied with ourselves that something has to change . ” schröder presented germany as on the verge of becoming a motor for reform in europe - something that could be a hard sale on either side of the atlantic , considering the country has been a drag on eu growth in recent years .
but with germany ’ s export-dependent economy growing only a meager 0.2 percent in the third quarter , schröder knows how important it is to bolster trade relations with germany ’ s second largest trading partner , the united states . amd picks dresden as if to underscore schröder ’ s case , u.s. semiconductor giant amd announced on thursday that it would build a $ 2.4 billion -lrb- € 2.0 billion -rrb- chip-making plant in the eastern city of dresden .
lured by generous government subsides , the facility will create around 1,000 jobs and will secure the state of saxony ’ s position as one of europe ’ s leading high-tech regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amd decision to pick dresden over east fishkill , new york and singapore will add to the estimated € 100 billion that u.s. investors have poured into germany .
realizing more u.s. investment could translate into more jobs for germany , which suffers chronically high unemployment , schröder will continue his business-boosting role during a lunch on friday with 17 leading u.s. executives . but the soaring euro , which has hit an all-time high against the u.s. dollar , could spoil the party for schröder and german companies , which fear the stronger currency will make their goods more expensive on world markets .
perhaps aware the euro could threaten germany ’ s export-led recovery , schröder addressed the issue in new york . “ both sides have an interest in advantageous exchange rates .
nobody has an interest in a weak dollar , ” said schröder , referring to the growing u.s. trade deficit , according to bloomberg news .

the attacks in istanbul drove the european markets down .
they bounced back friday morning , but fears linger that further attacks could unsettle investors and interfere with europe ’ s economic recovery . shortly after the news started pouring in that two british buildings had been the target of terrorist attacks in istanbul , stock markets in europe and across the world experienced a sharp dip on thursday .
the dramatic drop marked the second in just a few days , after the markets faltered similarly in the aftermath of last weekend 's bombings of two istanbul synagogues . before the latest round of terror , european markets had rallied over the summer , leading many to hope that an economic recovery was just around the corner .
but the events in istanbul have served as a reminder that al qaeda is far from defeated , and more attacks on so-called “ soft targets , ” like the hsbc headquarters in istanbul , may follow .
at the same time , the war in iraq has dragged on , and the security situation on the ground has continued to deteriorate .
all this has many wondering if further attacks and jittery markets will slow europe ’ s economic recovery .
experts are divided , but most paint a generally optimistic picture .
attacks could slow economic recovery almost immediately following the attacks on thursday , the effects were reflected in the european markets .
the eurotop 300 index of pan european blue chips was down 1.2 percent , the dj euro stoxx 1.5 percent and the frankfurt dax 1.7 percent .
on monday , following the attack on two synagogues over the weekend , the frankfurt dax suffered an even more extreme drop-off , tumbling 3.2 percent .
by friday morning , all markets had partially recovered .
among the many other factors investors now take into consideration , “ geo-political ” developments - as experts kindly term terrorist activities as well as political turbulence resulting from , say , a eu-u.s. trade war - are now considered among the most important .
but a debate persists over whether or not such developments , particularly of the terrorist variety , will spell trouble for europe ’ s economic recovery .
“ should we see a decline in confidence because of geo-political developments , that could be a problem for the economy , ” lorenzo condogno , an economist at the bank of america in london told dw-world .
“ that could actually undermine or slow down the economic recovery in europe .
most analysts stress the big picture others , however , downplay the temporary panic sparked by the attacks and emphasize the big picture , stressing that as long as other news - earnings reports and consumer confidence reports , for example - continues to be good , the recovery will remain on track .
“ these events will definitely have a temporary negative sentiment on equities and may even call into question the end of the year rally , ” hendrick garz , a european equity strategist at westlb panmure in düsseldorf told reuters .
“ but i have no doubt that we will see further equity gains if the economic news-flow continues to be positive next week , ” he added .
“ investors will definitely have these -lsb- security -rsb- topics in mind , but we are still far away from the point where they would really see this as an obstacle to investment . ”
garz is not the only expert to hold this opinion .
“ at the sort of level we are seeing , i don ’ t think it is going to disrupt the progression of the recovery - the fundamentals are very supportive , ” mike lenhoff , a chief strategist at brewin dolphin securities told reuters .
historically speaking , markets have always been sensitive to geo-political events .
u.s. markets dropped 2.93 percent after the japanese attacked pearl harbor and 2.89 percent after john f. kennedy 's assassination .
in europe , the various markets dropped between 5 and 10 percent following the attacks on september 11 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the attacks in istanbul drove the european markets down .
they bounced back friday morning , but fears linger that further attacks could unsettle investors and interfere with europe ’ s economic recovery . shortly after the news started pouring in that two british buildings had been the target of terrorist attacks in istanbul , stock markets in europe and across the world experienced a sharp dip on thursday .
the dramatic drop marked the second in just a few days , after the markets faltered similarly in the aftermath of last weekend 's bombings of two istanbul synagogues . before the latest round of terror , european markets had rallied over the summer , leading many to hope that an economic recovery was just around the corner .
but the events in istanbul have served as a reminder that al qaeda is far from defeated , and more attacks on so-called “ soft targets , ” like the hsbc headquarters in istanbul , may follow .
at the same time , the war in iraq has dragged on , and the security situation on the ground has continued to deteriorate .

istanbul was rocked by two explosions on thursday , only days after twin suicide bombings against jewish targets in the turkish city .
meanwhile , germany ’ s intelligence service warned islamic terrorism may be on the rise . at least 26 people have died and more than 400 were injured in the blasts , which damaged the british consulate and the headquarters of the hsbc bank in istanbul . the british consul was among the confirmed dead .
british foreign secretary jack straw said the explosions bore all the signs of attacks by the al qaeda islamic terrorist network . " it ’ s too early to say who carried out these attacks , but they have every hallmark of al qaeda , " straw told the british house of commons .
" a number of british and turkish and other people have died .
a number of the british consulate staff are still unaccounted for . " apparently the bombings against british targets were timed to coincide with u.s. president george bush 's visit to britain .
both bush and british prime minister tony blair condemned the attacks on thursday . " someone wants to convey a very clear message that will go out not only to britain but to the united states , " gustav lindstrom at the institute of security studies in paris told reuters .
" many people will read into this a connection with britain 's effort in iraq and its special relationship to the united states . " the bombings on thursday come less than a week after other deadly terrorist attacks in istanbul .
on saturday , two trucks packed with homemade explosives detonated outside the beit israel and neve shalom synagogues in istanbul , killing 26 people and wounding hundreds more . the head of germany ’ s intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- on wednesday warned the first attacks in istanbul showed international terrorism was on the rise again . european radicals being recruited speaking to germany ’ s ard television , bnd director august hanning also said that islamic radicals were currently being recruited from all over europe to join the fight against u.s.-led occupying forces in iraq .
he said that the increasing violence in iraq could also evolve into the kind of guerilla warfare endured by the former soviet union in afghanistan during the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : august hanning “ there are reports of recruiting going on in europe , especially in countries such as britain and bosnia , ” said hanning .
“ we also have evidence that islamic radicals living in germany have already left for iraq . ” on average , the coalition forces in iraq have to endure almost 30 attacks per day and hanning said there was evidence that some of these attacks are being professionally masterminded by members of osama bin laden ’ s al qaeda terrorist network . hanning said german intelligence still believes there was no link in pre-war iraq between the regime of saddam hussein and al qaeda , but added that the country was quickly becoming a focal point for the group ’ s jihad against western civilization .
in a statement issued from aboard a plane en route to the united states , german chancellor gerhard schröder condemned the bombings .
" the attacks do n't only target turkey and britain ... but also our form of state , society and living , our basic values like democracy , freedom and human rights .
thus , the attacks hurt us all . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de istanbul blasts trigger debate about eu membership germany responded to the second set of bombings in istanbul with harsh words of condemnation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.11.2003 opinion : high stakes for turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blasts in istanbul killed at least 27 people and injured over 400 .
istanbul was shaken by deadly terror attacks on thursday that exploded in the banking quarter and in front of the british consulate .
the international fight against terror must be intensified . whoever is behind the istanbul attacks is likely to bomb the country even deeper into a conflict it has tried to keep itself out of in recent months : during the iraq war turkey was pained by the unreserved support of u.s. policies toward iraq that was demanded of it . the turkish refusal to allow the allies to use its territory for deploying their troops severely disturbed the american plan .
and when ankara did finally offer troops to reinforce the allies , it quickly rescinded the offer out of consideration for iraqi sensitivities . consideration and reserve have been of no use to turkey .
it has become the scene of previously unknown terrorism , that strikes blindly and hits the innocent despite the fact that the actual targets are apparent : first jewish , now british facilities . sick logic and tomorrow ? in their sick logic , the people behind the attacks aim to drive a wedge between turkey and those who they deem responsible for the war in iraq - that is , americans , brits and israelis . that turkish pedestrians die vicariously , does nothing to disrupt the terrorists plan .
on the contrary , the terrorists reckon on " solidarity out of fear " turning the people 's ranks against their own government , which should discontinue all support for the united states and all cooperation with israel . but that is precisely what will not happen now .
the turkish government has been challenged by the attacks and it will not back down .
it was not prepared to in the course of the conflict with the pkk -lrb- kurdish paramilitary group -rrb- and the whole world appealed to ankara to give in .
why should it now yield when turkey has been bombed right in the middle of the anti-terror war stage and foreign countries demand pertinacity ?
there 's a lot at stake for turkey .
if it fails to position itself clearly and unambiguously against such terror , for example , skepticism and rejection of turkish rapprochement to the eu will grow , an understandable reaction perhaps , but nevertheless utterly wrong . europe 's latent terrorism europe is not threatened by a new terrorism from turkey , but rather the danger of terrorism is latently in existence in europe itself - and not just since september 11 .
volunteers from europe and from germany have supposedly gone to iraq to fight against the americans .
other like-minded people are sure to have remained in europe , and it would therefore be no surprise if bombs detonate there tomorrow . fanatics and fools are also among us .
it would be fatal to stonewall against turkey .
ankara needs the support of everyone who rejects terrorism .
that is the only way to insure that the istanbul murderers ' calculation does n't tally . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de istanbul hit by new series of explosions istanbul was rocked by two explosions on thursday , only days after twin suicide bombings against jewish targets in the turkish city .
meanwhile , germany ’ s intelligence service warned islamic terrorism may be on the rise .
-lrb- nov .
20 , 2003 -rrb- opinion : attacks prove turkey is part of europe the turkish government 's efforts to avoid the scope of international terrorism failed with the bombing of two synagogues .
but its commitment to european values and norms should be recognized in light of the tragedy -lrb- nov .

the attacks in istanbul drove the european markets down .
they bounced back friday morning , but fears linger that further attacks could unsettle investors and interfere with europe ’ s economic recovery . shortly after the news started pouring in that two british buildings had been the target of terrorist attacks in istanbul , stock markets in europe and across the world experienced a sharp dip on thursday .
the dramatic drop marked the second in just a few days , after the markets faltered similarly in the aftermath of last weekend 's bombings of two istanbul synagogues . before the latest round of terror , european markets had rallied over the summer , leading many to hope that an economic recovery was just around the corner .
but the events in istanbul have served as a reminder that al qaeda is far from defeated , and more attacks on so-called “ soft targets , ” like the hsbc headquarters in istanbul , may follow .
at the same time , the war in iraq has dragged on , and the security situation on the ground has continued to deteriorate .
all this has many wondering if further attacks and jittery markets will slow europe ’ s economic recovery .
experts are divided , but most paint a generally optimistic picture .
attacks could slow economic recovery almost immediately following the attacks on thursday , the effects were reflected in the european markets .
the eurotop 300 index of pan european blue chips was down 1.2 percent , the dj euro stoxx 1.5 percent and the frankfurt dax 1.7 percent .
on monday , following the attack on two synagogues over the weekend , the frankfurt dax suffered an even more extreme drop-off , tumbling 3.2 percent .
by friday morning , all markets had partially recovered .
among the many other factors investors now take into consideration , “ geo-political ” developments - as experts kindly term terrorist activities as well as political turbulence resulting from , say , a eu-u.s. trade war - are now considered among the most important .
but a debate persists over whether or not such developments , particularly of the terrorist variety , will spell trouble for europe ’ s economic recovery .
“ should we see a decline in confidence because of geo-political developments , that could be a problem for the economy , ” lorenzo condogno , an economist at the bank of america in london told dw-world .
“ that could actually undermine or slow down the economic recovery in europe .
most analysts stress the big picture others , however , downplay the temporary panic sparked by the attacks and emphasize the big picture , stressing that as long as other news - earnings reports and consumer confidence reports , for example - continues to be good , the recovery will remain on track .
“ these events will definitely have a temporary negative sentiment on equities and may even call into question the end of the year rally , ” hendrick garz , a european equity strategist at westlb panmure in düsseldorf told reuters .
“ but i have no doubt that we will see further equity gains if the economic news-flow continues to be positive next week , ” he added .
“ investors will definitely have these -lsb- security -rsb- topics in mind , but we are still far away from the point where they would really see this as an obstacle to investment . ”
garz is not the only expert to hold this opinion .
“ at the sort of level we are seeing , i don ’ t think it is going to disrupt the progression of the recovery - the fundamentals are very supportive , ” mike lenhoff , a chief strategist at brewin dolphin securities told reuters .

the attacks in istanbul drove the european markets down .
they bounced back friday morning , but fears linger that further attacks could unsettle investors and interfere with europe ’ s economic recovery . shortly after the news started pouring in that two british buildings had been the target of terrorist attacks in istanbul , stock markets in europe and across the world experienced a sharp dip on thursday .
the dramatic drop marked the second in just a few days , after the markets faltered similarly in the aftermath of last weekend 's bombings of two istanbul synagogues . before the latest round of terror , european markets had rallied over the summer , leading many to hope that an economic recovery was just around the corner .
but the events in istanbul have served as a reminder that al qaeda is far from defeated , and more attacks on so-called “ soft targets , ” like the hsbc headquarters in istanbul , may follow .
at the same time , the war in iraq has dragged on , and the security situation on the ground has continued to deteriorate .
all this has many wondering if further attacks and jittery markets will slow europe ’ s economic recovery .
experts are divided , but most paint a generally optimistic picture .
attacks could slow economic recovery almost immediately following the attacks on thursday , the effects were reflected in the european markets .
the eurotop 300 index of pan european blue chips was down 1.2 percent , the dj euro stoxx 1.5 percent and the frankfurt dax 1.7 percent .
on monday , following the attack on two synagogues over the weekend , the frankfurt dax suffered an even more extreme drop-off , tumbling 3.2 percent .
by friday morning , all markets had partially recovered .
among the many other factors investors now take into consideration , “ geo-political ” developments - as experts kindly term terrorist activities as well as political turbulence resulting from , say , a eu-u.s. trade war - are now considered among the most important .
but a debate persists over whether or not such developments , particularly of the terrorist variety , will spell trouble for europe ’ s economic recovery .
“ should we see a decline in confidence because of geo-political developments , that could be a problem for the economy , ” lorenzo condogno , an economist at the bank of america in london told dw-world .
“ that could actually undermine or slow down the economic recovery in europe .
most analysts stress the big picture others , however , downplay the temporary panic sparked by the attacks and emphasize the big picture , stressing that as long as other news - earnings reports and consumer confidence reports , for example - continues to be good , the recovery will remain on track .
“ these events will definitely have a temporary negative sentiment on equities and may even call into question the end of the year rally , ” hendrick garz , a european equity strategist at westlb panmure in düsseldorf told reuters .
“ but i have no doubt that we will see further equity gains if the economic news-flow continues to be positive next week , ” he added .
“ investors will definitely have these -lsb- security -rsb- topics in mind , but we are still far away from the point where they would really see this as an obstacle to investment . ”
garz is not the only expert to hold this opinion .
“ at the sort of level we are seeing , i don ’ t think it is going to disrupt the progression of the recovery - the fundamentals are very supportive , ” mike lenhoff , a chief strategist at brewin dolphin securities told reuters .
historically speaking , markets have always been sensitive to geo-political events .
u.s. markets dropped 2.93 percent after the japanese attacked pearl harbor and 2.89 percent after john f. kennedy 's assassination .
in europe , the various markets dropped between 5 and 10 percent following the attacks on september 11 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback the european economy : will more attacks slow down a recovery ? 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

“ we ’ ve realized after a period of being satisfied with ourselves that something has to change . ” schröder presented germany as on the verge of becoming a motor for reform in europe - something that could be a hard sale on either side of the atlantic , considering the country has been a drag on eu growth in recent years .

germany responded to the second set of bombings in istanbul with harsh words of condemnation .
but the attacks have also ignited a fresh round of debate on turkey ’ s bid to join the eu . quick to condemn thursday ’ s bombings in istanbul , german leaders across the political spectrum expressed their dismay and indignation that the turkish city on europe ’ s edge was again attacked by islamic terrorists .
german foreign policy experts regarded the blasts in downtown istanbul in front of the british consulate and the hsbc bank as yet another attempt by fundamentalists to sever ties between the western and muslim worlds .
gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats , told deutsche welle that the brutal attacks require a strong reaction from the civilized world .
" the terrorists are aiming to drive a wedge between the west and muslim countries , " he maintained , and added that the choice of turkey , a " key country " between europe and the islamic world , was deliberate for the series of attacks .
" the terrorists want to cut off the relationship between islam and the christian world , " weisskirchen said and targeted turkey because they want to send out a signal of fear to the muslims not to align themselves too closely with the west .
bolstering turkey ’ s bid for the eu it is precisely for this reason that many german politicians are arguing that it is more important than ever to support turkey 's democratization process and to aid it in its bid to join the european union as soon as possible .
social democrat interior minister otto schily told german public television zdf on thursday that germany needs to encourage dialogue between the eu and turkey with a view to giving turkey a " clear perspective " as to when and under which conditions it may join the european bloc in the future .
" our reaction to what has happened in istanbul can only be closer cooperation with turkey , " the minister said .
turkey imports threat to europe but the conservative opposition has jumped to a different conclusion in face of this week ’ s attacks .
christian democrat union deputy parliamentary leader wolfgang bosbach addressed the fears of many in his party when he said that turkish membership in the eu would place other member countries in greater danger than they already are .
" a quick eu accession for turkey would import the terror problem to europe , " bosbach was quoted in the passauer neue presse as saying .
the cdu member also said that a muslim-dominated country does not belong in a bloc supposedly based on christian values , an argument many in the conservative party endorse .
ingo friedrich , a senior member of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , has also criticized attempts to extend the eu beyond the bosporus .
" it would n't work , " he said , " because the european union would be overstretched endangering the entire project of achieving peace and stability in europe . "
friedrich , who is also a deputy speaker of the european parliament , added that a speedy inclusion " could even intensify terrorism in turkey because islamic extremists would feel that a key muslim country is forcibly alienated from the islamic world . "
other politicians , such as werner hoyer , foreign affairs spokesman for the neo-liberal free democrats , are convinced including turkey in the eu could provide a concrete example of mutually beneficial cooperation between the western and muslim worlds and could help put an end to the talk about a clash of civilizations .
" what we have to do is to make sure that turkey remains on the western track .
it would be a real strengthening of europe if turkey stays in the western boat and that it becomes a member of the european union , " hoyer said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : high stakes for turkey istanbul was shaken by deadly terror attacks on thursday that exploded in the banking quarter and in front of the british consulate .

but the attacks have also ignited a fresh round of debate on turkey ’ s bid to join the eu . quick to condemn thursday ’ s bombings in istanbul , german leaders across the political spectrum expressed their dismay and indignation that the turkish city on europe ’ s edge was again attacked by islamic terrorists .
german foreign policy experts regarded the blasts in downtown istanbul in front of the british consulate and the hsbc bank as yet another attempt by fundamentalists to sever ties between the western and muslim worlds .
gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats , told deutsche welle that the brutal attacks require a strong reaction from the civilized world .
" the terrorists are aiming to drive a wedge between the west and muslim countries , " he maintained , and added that the choice of turkey , a " key country " between europe and the islamic world , was deliberate for the series of attacks .
" the terrorists want to cut off the relationship between islam and the christian world , " weisskirchen said and targeted turkey because they want to send out a signal of fear to the muslims not to align themselves too closely with the west .
bolstering turkey ’ s bid for the eu it is precisely for this reason that many german politicians are arguing that it is more important than ever to support turkey 's democratization process and to aid it in its bid to join the european union as soon as possible .
social democrat interior minister otto schily told german public television zdf on thursday that germany needs to encourage dialogue between the eu and turkey with a view to giving turkey a " clear perspective " as to when and under which conditions it may join the european bloc in the future .
" our reaction to what has happened in istanbul can only be closer cooperation with turkey , " the minister said .
turkey imports threat to europe but the conservative opposition has jumped to a different conclusion in face of this week ’ s attacks .
christian democrat union deputy parliamentary leader wolfgang bosbach addressed the fears of many in his party when he said that turkish membership in the eu would place other member countries in greater danger than they already are .
" a quick eu accession for turkey would import the terror problem to europe , " bosbach was quoted in the passauer neue presse as saying .
the cdu member also said that a muslim-dominated country does not belong in a bloc supposedly based on christian values , an argument many in the conservative party endorse .
ingo friedrich , a senior member of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , has also criticized attempts to extend the eu beyond the bosporus .
" it would n't work , " he said , " because the european union would be overstretched endangering the entire project of achieving peace and stability in europe . "
friedrich , who is also a deputy speaker of the european parliament , added that a speedy inclusion " could even intensify terrorism in turkey because islamic extremists would feel that a key muslim country is forcibly alienated from the islamic world . "
other politicians , such as werner hoyer , foreign affairs spokesman for the neo-liberal free democrats , are convinced including turkey in the eu could provide a concrete example of mutually beneficial cooperation between the western and muslim worlds and could help put an end to the talk about a clash of civilizations .
" what we have to do is to make sure that turkey remains on the western track .
it would be a real strengthening of europe if turkey stays in the western boat and that it becomes a member of the european union , " hoyer said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : high stakes for turkey istanbul was shaken by deadly terror attacks on thursday that exploded in the banking quarter and in front of the british consulate .

istanbul was shaken by deadly terror attacks on thursday that exploded in the banking quarter and in front of the british consulate .
the international fight against terror must be intensified . whoever is behind the istanbul attacks is likely to bomb the country even deeper into a conflict it has tried to keep itself out of in recent months : during the iraq war turkey was pained by the unreserved support of u.s. policies toward iraq that was demanded of it . the turkish refusal to allow the allies to use its territory for deploying their troops severely disturbed the american plan .
and when ankara did finally offer troops to reinforce the allies , it quickly rescinded the offer out of consideration for iraqi sensitivities . consideration and reserve have been of no use to turkey .

istanbul was rocked by two explosions on thursday , only days after twin suicide bombings against jewish targets in the turkish city .
meanwhile , germany ’ s intelligence service warned islamic terrorism may be on the rise . at least 26 people have died and more than 400 were injured in the blasts , which damaged the british consulate and the headquarters of the hsbc bank in istanbul . the british consul was among the confirmed dead .
british foreign secretary jack straw said the explosions bore all the signs of attacks by the al qaeda islamic terrorist network . " it ’ s too early to say who carried out these attacks , but they have every hallmark of al qaeda , " straw told the british house of commons .
" a number of british and turkish and other people have died .
a number of the british consulate staff are still unaccounted for . " apparently the bombings against british targets were timed to coincide with u.s. president george bush 's visit to britain .
both bush and british prime minister tony blair condemned the attacks on thursday . " someone wants to convey a very clear message that will go out not only to britain but to the united states , " gustav lindstrom at the institute of security studies in paris told reuters .
" many people will read into this a connection with britain 's effort in iraq and its special relationship to the united states . " the bombings on thursday come less than a week after other deadly terrorist attacks in istanbul .
on saturday , two trucks packed with homemade explosives detonated outside the beit israel and neve shalom synagogues in istanbul , killing 26 people and wounding hundreds more . the head of germany ’ s intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- on wednesday warned the first attacks in istanbul showed international terrorism was on the rise again . european radicals being recruited speaking to germany ’ s ard television , bnd director august hanning also said that islamic radicals were currently being recruited from all over europe to join the fight against u.s.-led occupying forces in iraq .
he said that the increasing violence in iraq could also evolve into the kind of guerilla warfare endured by the former soviet union in afghanistan during the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : august hanning “ there are reports of recruiting going on in europe , especially in countries such as britain and bosnia , ” said hanning .
“ we also have evidence that islamic radicals living in germany have already left for iraq . ” on average , the coalition forces in iraq have to endure almost 30 attacks per day and hanning said there was evidence that some of these attacks are being professionally masterminded by members of osama bin laden ’ s al qaeda terrorist network . hanning said german intelligence still believes there was no link in pre-war iraq between the regime of saddam hussein and al qaeda , but added that the country was quickly becoming a focal point for the group ’ s jihad against western civilization .
in a statement issued from aboard a plane en route to the united states , german chancellor gerhard schröder condemned the bombings .

istanbul was shaken by deadly terror attacks on thursday that exploded in the banking quarter and in front of the british consulate .
the international fight against terror must be intensified . whoever is behind the istanbul attacks is likely to bomb the country even deeper into a conflict it has tried to keep itself out of in recent months : during the iraq war turkey was pained by the unreserved support of u.s. policies toward iraq that was demanded of it . the turkish refusal to allow the allies to use its territory for deploying their troops severely disturbed the american plan .
and when ankara did finally offer troops to reinforce the allies , it quickly rescinded the offer out of consideration for iraqi sensitivities . consideration and reserve have been of no use to turkey .
it has become the scene of previously unknown terrorism , that strikes blindly and hits the innocent despite the fact that the actual targets are apparent : first jewish , now british facilities . sick logic and tomorrow ? in their sick logic , the people behind the attacks aim to drive a wedge between turkey and those who they deem responsible for the war in iraq - that is , americans , brits and israelis . that turkish pedestrians die vicariously , does nothing to disrupt the terrorists plan .
on the contrary , the terrorists reckon on " solidarity out of fear " turning the people 's ranks against their own government , which should discontinue all support for the united states and all cooperation with israel . but that is precisely what will not happen now .
the turkish government has been challenged by the attacks and it will not back down .
it was not prepared to in the course of the conflict with the pkk -lrb- kurdish paramilitary group -rrb- and the whole world appealed to ankara to give in .
why should it now yield when turkey has been bombed right in the middle of the anti-terror war stage and foreign countries demand pertinacity ?
there 's a lot at stake for turkey .
if it fails to position itself clearly and unambiguously against such terror , for example , skepticism and rejection of turkish rapprochement to the eu will grow , an understandable reaction perhaps , but nevertheless utterly wrong . europe 's latent terrorism europe is not threatened by a new terrorism from turkey , but rather the danger of terrorism is latently in existence in europe itself - and not just since september 11 .
volunteers from europe and from germany have supposedly gone to iraq to fight against the americans .
other like-minded people are sure to have remained in europe , and it would therefore be no surprise if bombs detonate there tomorrow . fanatics and fools are also among us .
it would be fatal to stonewall against turkey .
ankara needs the support of everyone who rejects terrorism .
that is the only way to insure that the istanbul murderers ' calculation does n't tally . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de istanbul hit by new series of explosions istanbul was rocked by two explosions on thursday , only days after twin suicide bombings against jewish targets in the turkish city .

the attacks in istanbul drove the european markets down .
they bounced back friday morning , but fears linger that further attacks could unsettle investors and interfere with europe ’ s economic recovery . shortly after the news started pouring in that two british buildings had been the target of terrorist attacks in istanbul , stock markets in europe and across the world experienced a sharp dip on thursday .
the dramatic drop marked the second in just a few days , after the markets faltered similarly in the aftermath of last weekend 's bombings of two istanbul synagogues . before the latest round of terror , european markets had rallied over the summer , leading many to hope that an economic recovery was just around the corner .
but the events in istanbul have served as a reminder that al qaeda is far from defeated , and more attacks on so-called “ soft targets , ” like the hsbc headquarters in istanbul , may follow .
at the same time , the war in iraq has dragged on , and the security situation on the ground has continued to deteriorate .
all this has many wondering if further attacks and jittery markets will slow europe ’ s economic recovery .
experts are divided , but most paint a generally optimistic picture .
attacks could slow economic recovery almost immediately following the attacks on thursday , the effects were reflected in the european markets .
the eurotop 300 index of pan european blue chips was down 1.2 percent , the dj euro stoxx 1.5 percent and the frankfurt dax 1.7 percent .
on monday , following the attack on two synagogues over the weekend , the frankfurt dax suffered an even more extreme drop-off , tumbling 3.2 percent .
by friday morning , all markets had partially recovered .
among the many other factors investors now take into consideration , “ geo-political ” developments - as experts kindly term terrorist activities as well as political turbulence resulting from , say , a eu-u.s. trade war - are now considered among the most important .
but a debate persists over whether or not such developments , particularly of the terrorist variety , will spell trouble for europe ’ s economic recovery .
“ should we see a decline in confidence because of geo-political developments , that could be a problem for the economy , ” lorenzo condogno , an economist at the bank of america in london told dw-world .
“ that could actually undermine or slow down the economic recovery in europe .
most analysts stress the big picture others , however , downplay the temporary panic sparked by the attacks and emphasize the big picture , stressing that as long as other news - earnings reports and consumer confidence reports , for example - continues to be good , the recovery will remain on track .
“ these events will definitely have a temporary negative sentiment on equities and may even call into question the end of the year rally , ” hendrick garz , a european equity strategist at westlb panmure in düsseldorf told reuters .
“ but i have no doubt that we will see further equity gains if the economic news-flow continues to be positive next week , ” he added .
“ investors will definitely have these -lsb- security -rsb- topics in mind , but we are still far away from the point where they would really see this as an obstacle to investment . ”
garz is not the only expert to hold this opinion .
“ at the sort of level we are seeing , i don ’ t think it is going to disrupt the progression of the recovery - the fundamentals are very supportive , ” mike lenhoff , a chief strategist at brewin dolphin securities told reuters .
historically speaking , markets have always been sensitive to geo-political events .
u.s. markets dropped 2.93 percent after the japanese attacked pearl harbor and 2.89 percent after john f. kennedy 's assassination .
in europe , the various markets dropped between 5 and 10 percent following the attacks on september 11 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback the european economy : will more attacks slow down a recovery ? 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

germany responded to the second set of bombings in istanbul with harsh words of condemnation .
but the attacks have also ignited a fresh round of debate on turkey ’ s bid to join the eu . quick to condemn thursday ’ s bombings in istanbul , german leaders across the political spectrum expressed their dismay and indignation that the turkish city on europe ’ s edge was again attacked by islamic terrorists .
german foreign policy experts regarded the blasts in downtown istanbul in front of the british consulate and the hsbc bank as yet another attempt by fundamentalists to sever ties between the western and muslim worlds .
gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats , told deutsche welle that the brutal attacks require a strong reaction from the civilized world .
" the terrorists are aiming to drive a wedge between the west and muslim countries , " he maintained , and added that the choice of turkey , a " key country " between europe and the islamic world , was deliberate for the series of attacks .
" the terrorists want to cut off the relationship between islam and the christian world , " weisskirchen said and targeted turkey because they want to send out a signal of fear to the muslims not to align themselves too closely with the west .
bolstering turkey ’ s bid for the eu it is precisely for this reason that many german politicians are arguing that it is more important than ever to support turkey 's democratization process and to aid it in its bid to join the european union as soon as possible .
social democrat interior minister otto schily told german public television zdf on thursday that germany needs to encourage dialogue between the eu and turkey with a view to giving turkey a " clear perspective " as to when and under which conditions it may join the european bloc in the future .
" our reaction to what has happened in istanbul can only be closer cooperation with turkey , " the minister said .
turkey imports threat to europe but the conservative opposition has jumped to a different conclusion in face of this week ’ s attacks .
christian democrat union deputy parliamentary leader wolfgang bosbach addressed the fears of many in his party when he said that turkish membership in the eu would place other member countries in greater danger than they already are .
" a quick eu accession for turkey would import the terror problem to europe , " bosbach was quoted in the passauer neue presse as saying .
the cdu member also said that a muslim-dominated country does not belong in a bloc supposedly based on christian values , an argument many in the conservative party endorse .
ingo friedrich , a senior member of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , has also criticized attempts to extend the eu beyond the bosporus .
" it would n't work , " he said , " because the european union would be overstretched endangering the entire project of achieving peace and stability in europe . "
friedrich , who is also a deputy speaker of the european parliament , added that a speedy inclusion " could even intensify terrorism in turkey because islamic extremists would feel that a key muslim country is forcibly alienated from the islamic world . "
other politicians , such as werner hoyer , foreign affairs spokesman for the neo-liberal free democrats , are convinced including turkey in the eu could provide a concrete example of mutually beneficial cooperation between the western and muslim worlds and could help put an end to the talk about a clash of civilizations .
" what we have to do is to make sure that turkey remains on the western track .
it would be a real strengthening of europe if turkey stays in the western boat and that it becomes a member of the european union , " hoyer said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : high stakes for turkey istanbul was shaken by deadly terror attacks on thursday that exploded in the banking quarter and in front of the british consulate .

chancellor gerhard schröder is in new york to promote business ties and attract greater u.s. investment .
the sales pitch ?
his planned package of reforms will get europe ’ s largest economy running smoothly again . throwing himself into the role of germany ’ s top salesman , chancellor gerhard schröder came to new york looking to strengthen u.s.-german business ties .
and as any good salesman would , he remained optimistic halfway through his short trip , despite a looming transatlantic trade war and soaring euro against the u.s. dollar . speaking at the the american institute for contemporary german studies , which was honoring citigroup chief sanford weill , schröder trumpeted his so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package of economic and welfare reforms as just what germany needed to stay competitive in the 21st century . “ we want to get our country in shape for the challenges of this decade , this century , in order to be an equal partner , ” schröder said before an audience of 500 business leaders .
“ we ’ ve realized after a period of being satisfied with ourselves that something has to change . ” schröder presented germany as on the verge of becoming a motor for reform in europe - something that could be a hard sale on either side of the atlantic , considering the country has been a drag on eu growth in recent years .
but with germany ’ s export-dependent economy growing only a meager 0.2 percent in the third quarter , schröder knows how important it is to bolster trade relations with germany ’ s second largest trading partner , the united states . amd picks dresden as if to underscore schröder ’ s case , u.s. semiconductor giant amd announced on thursday that it would build a $ 2.4 billion -lrb- € 2.0 billion -rrb- chip-making plant in the eastern city of dresden .
lured by generous government subsides , the facility will create around 1,000 jobs and will secure the state of saxony ’ s position as one of europe ’ s leading high-tech regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amd decision to pick dresden over east fishkill , new york and singapore will add to the estimated € 100 billion that u.s. investors have poured into germany .
realizing more u.s. investment could translate into more jobs for germany , which suffers chronically high unemployment , schröder will continue his business-boosting role during a lunch on friday with 17 leading u.s. executives . but the soaring euro , which has hit an all-time high against the u.s. dollar , could spoil the party for schröder and german companies , which fear the stronger currency will make their goods more expensive on world markets .
perhaps aware the euro could threaten germany ’ s export-led recovery , schröder addressed the issue in new york . “ both sides have an interest in advantageous exchange rates .
nobody has an interest in a weak dollar , ” said schröder , referring to the growing u.s. trade deficit , according to bloomberg news .

istanbul was rocked by two explosions on thursday , only days after twin suicide bombings against jewish targets in the turkish city .
meanwhile , germany ’ s intelligence service warned islamic terrorism may be on the rise . at least 26 people have died and more than 400 were injured in the blasts , which damaged the british consulate and the headquarters of the hsbc bank in istanbul . the british consul was among the confirmed dead .
british foreign secretary jack straw said the explosions bore all the signs of attacks by the al qaeda islamic terrorist network . " it ’ s too early to say who carried out these attacks , but they have every hallmark of al qaeda , " straw told the british house of commons .
" a number of british and turkish and other people have died .
a number of the british consulate staff are still unaccounted for . " apparently the bombings against british targets were timed to coincide with u.s. president george bush 's visit to britain .
both bush and british prime minister tony blair condemned the attacks on thursday . " someone wants to convey a very clear message that will go out not only to britain but to the united states , " gustav lindstrom at the institute of security studies in paris told reuters .
" many people will read into this a connection with britain 's effort in iraq and its special relationship to the united states . " the bombings on thursday come less than a week after other deadly terrorist attacks in istanbul .
on saturday , two trucks packed with homemade explosives detonated outside the beit israel and neve shalom synagogues in istanbul , killing 26 people and wounding hundreds more . the head of germany ’ s intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- on wednesday warned the first attacks in istanbul showed international terrorism was on the rise again . european radicals being recruited speaking to germany ’ s ard television , bnd director august hanning also said that islamic radicals were currently being recruited from all over europe to join the fight against u.s.-led occupying forces in iraq .
he said that the increasing violence in iraq could also evolve into the kind of guerilla warfare endured by the former soviet union in afghanistan during the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : august hanning “ there are reports of recruiting going on in europe , especially in countries such as britain and bosnia , ” said hanning .
“ we also have evidence that islamic radicals living in germany have already left for iraq . ” on average , the coalition forces in iraq have to endure almost 30 attacks per day and hanning said there was evidence that some of these attacks are being professionally masterminded by members of osama bin laden ’ s al qaeda terrorist network . hanning said german intelligence still believes there was no link in pre-war iraq between the regime of saddam hussein and al qaeda , but added that the country was quickly becoming a focal point for the group ’ s jihad against western civilization .
in a statement issued from aboard a plane en route to the united states , german chancellor gerhard schröder condemned the bombings .
" the attacks do n't only target turkey and britain ... but also our form of state , society and living , our basic values like democracy , freedom and human rights .
thus , the attacks hurt us all . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de istanbul blasts trigger debate about eu membership germany responded to the second set of bombings in istanbul with harsh words of condemnation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.11.2003 opinion : high stakes for turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blasts in istanbul killed at least 27 people and injured over 400 .
istanbul was shaken by deadly terror attacks on thursday that exploded in the banking quarter and in front of the british consulate .
the international fight against terror must be intensified . whoever is behind the istanbul attacks is likely to bomb the country even deeper into a conflict it has tried to keep itself out of in recent months : during the iraq war turkey was pained by the unreserved support of u.s. policies toward iraq that was demanded of it . the turkish refusal to allow the allies to use its territory for deploying their troops severely disturbed the american plan .
and when ankara did finally offer troops to reinforce the allies , it quickly rescinded the offer out of consideration for iraqi sensitivities . consideration and reserve have been of no use to turkey .
it has become the scene of previously unknown terrorism , that strikes blindly and hits the innocent despite the fact that the actual targets are apparent : first jewish , now british facilities . sick logic and tomorrow ? in their sick logic , the people behind the attacks aim to drive a wedge between turkey and those who they deem responsible for the war in iraq - that is , americans , brits and israelis . that turkish pedestrians die vicariously , does nothing to disrupt the terrorists plan .
on the contrary , the terrorists reckon on " solidarity out of fear " turning the people 's ranks against their own government , which should discontinue all support for the united states and all cooperation with israel . but that is precisely what will not happen now .
the turkish government has been challenged by the attacks and it will not back down .
it was not prepared to in the course of the conflict with the pkk -lrb- kurdish paramilitary group -rrb- and the whole world appealed to ankara to give in .
why should it now yield when turkey has been bombed right in the middle of the anti-terror war stage and foreign countries demand pertinacity ?
there 's a lot at stake for turkey .
if it fails to position itself clearly and unambiguously against such terror , for example , skepticism and rejection of turkish rapprochement to the eu will grow , an understandable reaction perhaps , but nevertheless utterly wrong . europe 's latent terrorism europe is not threatened by a new terrorism from turkey , but rather the danger of terrorism is latently in existence in europe itself - and not just since september 11 .
volunteers from europe and from germany have supposedly gone to iraq to fight against the americans .
other like-minded people are sure to have remained in europe , and it would therefore be no surprise if bombs detonate there tomorrow . fanatics and fools are also among us .
it would be fatal to stonewall against turkey .
ankara needs the support of everyone who rejects terrorism .
that is the only way to insure that the istanbul murderers ' calculation does n't tally . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de istanbul hit by new series of explosions istanbul was rocked by two explosions on thursday , only days after twin suicide bombings against jewish targets in the turkish city .
meanwhile , germany ’ s intelligence service warned islamic terrorism may be on the rise .

istanbul was shaken by deadly terror attacks on thursday that exploded in the banking quarter and in front of the british consulate .
the international fight against terror must be intensified . whoever is behind the istanbul attacks is likely to bomb the country even deeper into a conflict it has tried to keep itself out of in recent months : during the iraq war turkey was pained by the unreserved support of u.s. policies toward iraq that was demanded of it . the turkish refusal to allow the allies to use its territory for deploying their troops severely disturbed the american plan .
and when ankara did finally offer troops to reinforce the allies , it quickly rescinded the offer out of consideration for iraqi sensitivities . consideration and reserve have been of no use to turkey .
it has become the scene of previously unknown terrorism , that strikes blindly and hits the innocent despite the fact that the actual targets are apparent : first jewish , now british facilities . sick logic and tomorrow ? in their sick logic , the people behind the attacks aim to drive a wedge between turkey and those who they deem responsible for the war in iraq - that is , americans , brits and israelis . that turkish pedestrians die vicariously , does nothing to disrupt the terrorists plan .

germany responded to the second set of bombings in istanbul with harsh words of condemnation .
but the attacks have also ignited a fresh round of debate on turkey ’ s bid to join the eu . quick to condemn thursday ’ s bombings in istanbul , german leaders across the political spectrum expressed their dismay and indignation that the turkish city on europe ’ s edge was again attacked by islamic terrorists .
german foreign policy experts regarded the blasts in downtown istanbul in front of the british consulate and the hsbc bank as yet another attempt by fundamentalists to sever ties between the western and muslim worlds .
gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats , told deutsche welle that the brutal attacks require a strong reaction from the civilized world .
" the terrorists are aiming to drive a wedge between the west and muslim countries , " he maintained , and added that the choice of turkey , a " key country " between europe and the islamic world , was deliberate for the series of attacks .
" the terrorists want to cut off the relationship between islam and the christian world , " weisskirchen said and targeted turkey because they want to send out a signal of fear to the muslims not to align themselves too closely with the west .
bolstering turkey ’ s bid for the eu it is precisely for this reason that many german politicians are arguing that it is more important than ever to support turkey 's democratization process and to aid it in its bid to join the european union as soon as possible .
social democrat interior minister otto schily told german public television zdf on thursday that germany needs to encourage dialogue between the eu and turkey with a view to giving turkey a " clear perspective " as to when and under which conditions it may join the european bloc in the future .
" our reaction to what has happened in istanbul can only be closer cooperation with turkey , " the minister said .
turkey imports threat to europe but the conservative opposition has jumped to a different conclusion in face of this week ’ s attacks .
christian democrat union deputy parliamentary leader wolfgang bosbach addressed the fears of many in his party when he said that turkish membership in the eu would place other member countries in greater danger than they already are .
" a quick eu accession for turkey would import the terror problem to europe , " bosbach was quoted in the passauer neue presse as saying .
the cdu member also said that a muslim-dominated country does not belong in a bloc supposedly based on christian values , an argument many in the conservative party endorse .
ingo friedrich , a senior member of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , has also criticized attempts to extend the eu beyond the bosporus .
" it would n't work , " he said , " because the european union would be overstretched endangering the entire project of achieving peace and stability in europe . "
friedrich , who is also a deputy speaker of the european parliament , added that a speedy inclusion " could even intensify terrorism in turkey because islamic extremists would feel that a key muslim country is forcibly alienated from the islamic world . "
other politicians , such as werner hoyer , foreign affairs spokesman for the neo-liberal free democrats , are convinced including turkey in the eu could provide a concrete example of mutually beneficial cooperation between the western and muslim worlds and could help put an end to the talk about a clash of civilizations .
" what we have to do is to make sure that turkey remains on the western track .
it would be a real strengthening of europe if turkey stays in the western boat and that it becomes a member of the european union , " hoyer said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : high stakes for turkey istanbul was shaken by deadly terror attacks on thursday that exploded in the banking quarter and in front of the british consulate .

germany responded to the second set of bombings in istanbul with harsh words of condemnation .
but the attacks have also ignited a fresh round of debate on turkey ’ s bid to join the eu . quick to condemn thursday ’ s bombings in istanbul , german leaders across the political spectrum expressed their dismay and indignation that the turkish city on europe ’ s edge was again attacked by islamic terrorists .
german foreign policy experts regarded the blasts in downtown istanbul in front of the british consulate and the hsbc bank as yet another attempt by fundamentalists to sever ties between the western and muslim worlds .
gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats , told deutsche welle that the brutal attacks require a strong reaction from the civilized world .
" the terrorists are aiming to drive a wedge between the west and muslim countries , " he maintained , and added that the choice of turkey , a " key country " between europe and the islamic world , was deliberate for the series of attacks .
" the terrorists want to cut off the relationship between islam and the christian world , " weisskirchen said and targeted turkey because they want to send out a signal of fear to the muslims not to align themselves too closely with the west .
bolstering turkey ’ s bid for the eu it is precisely for this reason that many german politicians are arguing that it is more important than ever to support turkey 's democratization process and to aid it in its bid to join the european union as soon as possible .
social democrat interior minister otto schily told german public television zdf on thursday that germany needs to encourage dialogue between the eu and turkey with a view to giving turkey a " clear perspective " as to when and under which conditions it may join the european bloc in the future .
" our reaction to what has happened in istanbul can only be closer cooperation with turkey , " the minister said .
turkey imports threat to europe but the conservative opposition has jumped to a different conclusion in face of this week ’ s attacks .
christian democrat union deputy parliamentary leader wolfgang bosbach addressed the fears of many in his party when he said that turkish membership in the eu would place other member countries in greater danger than they already are .
" a quick eu accession for turkey would import the terror problem to europe , " bosbach was quoted in the passauer neue presse as saying .
the cdu member also said that a muslim-dominated country does not belong in a bloc supposedly based on christian values , an argument many in the conservative party endorse .
ingo friedrich , a senior member of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , has also criticized attempts to extend the eu beyond the bosporus .
" it would n't work , " he said , " because the european union would be overstretched endangering the entire project of achieving peace and stability in europe . "
friedrich , who is also a deputy speaker of the european parliament , added that a speedy inclusion " could even intensify terrorism in turkey because islamic extremists would feel that a key muslim country is forcibly alienated from the islamic world . "
other politicians , such as werner hoyer , foreign affairs spokesman for the neo-liberal free democrats , are convinced including turkey in the eu could provide a concrete example of mutually beneficial cooperation between the western and muslim worlds and could help put an end to the talk about a clash of civilizations .
" what we have to do is to make sure that turkey remains on the western track .
it would be a real strengthening of europe if turkey stays in the western boat and that it becomes a member of the european union , " hoyer said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : high stakes for turkey istanbul was shaken by deadly terror attacks on thursday that exploded in the banking quarter and in front of the british consulate .

atomic energy regulators from europe and washington disagree on measures against iran for its potential development of nuclear arms .
talks will continue next week , after negotiators failed to find a compromise this week . the members of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the u.n. 's nuclear watchdog , are n't expected to pass a resolution on iran 's nuclear program until next week at the earliest .
instead , european and u.s. diplomats continue to struggle to reach a compromise , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei said friday . it will be " some time " until they come to an agreement , elbaradei said . the iaea governors meeting , which began on thursday , was originally meant to come to an end on friday .
but the 35-nation board of governors plans to meet again on wednesday , spokeswoman melissa fleming announced . the discord revolves around how strongly iran should be censured for its nuclear program .
a recent iaea report said that iran had not complied with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- over the past two decades .
but elbaradei 's report also said there was no evidence that tehran was conducting a secret nuclear weapons program . iran has admitted to failing to disclose uranium enrichment activities and plants . u.s. wants sanctions the united states says iran 's past actions regarding inspections of its nuclear program indicates it is working towards developing nuclear arms .
american officials say they want the iaea to find iran in breach of the npt , which would allow the u.n. security council to impose sanctions . britain , france and germany had first proposed a draft resolution that rebuked iran for " failures to meet safeguards obligations , " but praised the country for cooperating with the iaea .
the draft was rejected by washington , which said the wording was too mild . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian foreign minister kamal kharrazi -lrb- left -rrb- talks with german foreign minister joschka fischer during an official meeting in tehran in late october , 2003 .
the " big three " european countries had won key concessions from iran to cooperate with the iaea when its foreign ministers visited tehran in october .
now they fear the threat of sanctions could push iran to break the agreements that include permitting snap inspections and suspending uranium enrichment . big three under fire but they are also reaping criticism from their european allies .
according to reuters , diplomats from other european states have complained that britain , france and germany have designated themselves eu spokesmen , but they do n't represent the views of the entire bloc . iran denies that it is working on developing nuclear weapons , insisting its program is geared solely toward generating power and is civilian in nature . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu and us clash on iran nuclear question tuesday 's meeting between eu foreign ministers and u.s. secretary of state colin powell showed a spirit of reconciliation after the divisions over iraq .

atomic energy regulators from europe and washington disagree on measures against iran for its potential development of nuclear arms .
talks will continue next week , after negotiators failed to find a compromise this week . the members of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the u.n. 's nuclear watchdog , are n't expected to pass a resolution on iran 's nuclear program until next week at the earliest .
instead , european and u.s. diplomats continue to struggle to reach a compromise , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei said friday . it will be " some time " until they come to an agreement , elbaradei said . the iaea governors meeting , which began on thursday , was originally meant to come to an end on friday .
but the 35-nation board of governors plans to meet again on wednesday , spokeswoman melissa fleming announced . the discord revolves around how strongly iran should be censured for its nuclear program .
a recent iaea report said that iran had not complied with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- over the past two decades .
but elbaradei 's report also said there was no evidence that tehran was conducting a secret nuclear weapons program . iran has admitted to failing to disclose uranium enrichment activities and plants . u.s. wants sanctions the united states says iran 's past actions regarding inspections of its nuclear program indicates it is working towards developing nuclear arms .
american officials say they want the iaea to find iran in breach of the npt , which would allow the u.n. security council to impose sanctions . britain , france and germany had first proposed a draft resolution that rebuked iran for " failures to meet safeguards obligations , " but praised the country for cooperating with the iaea .
the draft was rejected by washington , which said the wording was too mild . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian foreign minister kamal kharrazi -lrb- left -rrb- talks with german foreign minister joschka fischer during an official meeting in tehran in late october , 2003 .

now they fear the threat of sanctions could push iran to break the agreements that include permitting snap inspections and suspending uranium enrichment . big three under fire but they are also reaping criticism from their european allies .
according to reuters , diplomats from other european states have complained that britain , france and germany have designated themselves eu spokesmen , but they do n't represent the views of the entire bloc . iran denies that it is working on developing nuclear weapons , insisting its program is geared solely toward generating power and is civilian in nature . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu and us clash on iran nuclear question tuesday 's meeting between eu foreign ministers and u.s. secretary of state colin powell showed a spirit of reconciliation after the divisions over iraq .

germany responded to the second set of bombings in istanbul with harsh words of condemnation .
but the attacks have also ignited a fresh round of debate on turkey ’ s bid to join the eu . quick to condemn thursday ’ s bombings in istanbul , german leaders across the political spectrum expressed their dismay and indignation that the turkish city on europe ’ s edge was again attacked by islamic terrorists .
german foreign policy experts regarded the blasts in downtown istanbul in front of the british consulate and the hsbc bank as yet another attempt by fundamentalists to sever ties between the western and muslim worlds .
gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats , told deutsche welle that the brutal attacks require a strong reaction from the civilized world .
" the terrorists are aiming to drive a wedge between the west and muslim countries , " he maintained , and added that the choice of turkey , a " key country " between europe and the islamic world , was deliberate for the series of attacks .
" the terrorists want to cut off the relationship between islam and the christian world , " weisskirchen said and targeted turkey because they want to send out a signal of fear to the muslims not to align themselves too closely with the west .
bolstering turkey ’ s bid for the eu it is precisely for this reason that many german politicians are arguing that it is more important than ever to support turkey 's democratization process and to aid it in its bid to join the european union as soon as possible .
social democrat interior minister otto schily told german public television zdf on thursday that germany needs to encourage dialogue between the eu and turkey with a view to giving turkey a " clear perspective " as to when and under which conditions it may join the european bloc in the future .
" our reaction to what has happened in istanbul can only be closer cooperation with turkey , " the minister said .
turkey imports threat to europe but the conservative opposition has jumped to a different conclusion in face of this week ’ s attacks .
christian democrat union deputy parliamentary leader wolfgang bosbach addressed the fears of many in his party when he said that turkish membership in the eu would place other member countries in greater danger than they already are .
" a quick eu accession for turkey would import the terror problem to europe , " bosbach was quoted in the passauer neue presse as saying .
the cdu member also said that a muslim-dominated country does not belong in a bloc supposedly based on christian values , an argument many in the conservative party endorse .
ingo friedrich , a senior member of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , has also criticized attempts to extend the eu beyond the bosporus .
" it would n't work , " he said , " because the european union would be overstretched endangering the entire project of achieving peace and stability in europe . "
friedrich , who is also a deputy speaker of the european parliament , added that a speedy inclusion " could even intensify terrorism in turkey because islamic extremists would feel that a key muslim country is forcibly alienated from the islamic world . "
other politicians , such as werner hoyer , foreign affairs spokesman for the neo-liberal free democrats , are convinced including turkey in the eu could provide a concrete example of mutually beneficial cooperation between the western and muslim worlds and could help put an end to the talk about a clash of civilizations .
" what we have to do is to make sure that turkey remains on the western track .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.11.2003 schröder sells economic reforms for u.s. investment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder presented citigroup chairman sanford weill with a leadership award .
chancellor gerhard schröder is in new york to promote business ties and attract greater u.s. investment .
the sales pitch ?
his planned package of reforms will get europe ’ s largest economy running smoothly again . throwing himself into the role of germany ’ s top salesman , chancellor gerhard schröder came to new york looking to strengthen u.s.-german business ties .
and as any good salesman would , he remained optimistic halfway through his short trip , despite a looming transatlantic trade war and soaring euro against the u.s. dollar . speaking at the the american institute for contemporary german studies , which was honoring citigroup chief sanford weill , schröder trumpeted his so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package of economic and welfare reforms as just what germany needed to stay competitive in the 21st century . “ we want to get our country in shape for the challenges of this decade , this century , in order to be an equal partner , ” schröder said before an audience of 500 business leaders .
“ we ’ ve realized after a period of being satisfied with ourselves that something has to change . ” schröder presented germany as on the verge of becoming a motor for reform in europe - something that could be a hard sale on either side of the atlantic , considering the country has been a drag on eu growth in recent years .
but with germany ’ s export-dependent economy growing only a meager 0.2 percent in the third quarter , schröder knows how important it is to bolster trade relations with germany ’ s second largest trading partner , the united states . amd picks dresden as if to underscore schröder ’ s case , u.s. semiconductor giant amd announced on thursday that it would build a $ 2.4 billion -lrb- € 2.0 billion -rrb- chip-making plant in the eastern city of dresden .
lured by generous government subsides , the facility will create around 1,000 jobs and will secure the state of saxony ’ s position as one of europe ’ s leading high-tech regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amd decision to pick dresden over east fishkill , new york and singapore will add to the estimated € 100 billion that u.s. investors have poured into germany .
realizing more u.s. investment could translate into more jobs for germany , which suffers chronically high unemployment , schröder will continue his business-boosting role during a lunch on friday with 17 leading u.s. executives . but the soaring euro , which has hit an all-time high against the u.s. dollar , could spoil the party for schröder and german companies , which fear the stronger currency will make their goods more expensive on world markets .

chancellor gerhard schröder is in new york to promote business ties and attract greater u.s. investment .
the sales pitch ?
his planned package of reforms will get europe ’ s largest economy running smoothly again . throwing himself into the role of germany ’ s top salesman , chancellor gerhard schröder came to new york looking to strengthen u.s.-german business ties .
and as any good salesman would , he remained optimistic halfway through his short trip , despite a looming transatlantic trade war and soaring euro against the u.s. dollar . speaking at the the american institute for contemporary german studies , which was honoring citigroup chief sanford weill , schröder trumpeted his so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package of economic and welfare reforms as just what germany needed to stay competitive in the 21st century . “ we want to get our country in shape for the challenges of this decade , this century , in order to be an equal partner , ” schröder said before an audience of 500 business leaders .
“ we ’ ve realized after a period of being satisfied with ourselves that something has to change . ” schröder presented germany as on the verge of becoming a motor for reform in europe - something that could be a hard sale on either side of the atlantic , considering the country has been a drag on eu growth in recent years .
but with germany ’ s export-dependent economy growing only a meager 0.2 percent in the third quarter , schröder knows how important it is to bolster trade relations with germany ’ s second largest trading partner , the united states . amd picks dresden as if to underscore schröder ’ s case , u.s. semiconductor giant amd announced on thursday that it would build a $ 2.4 billion -lrb- € 2.0 billion -rrb- chip-making plant in the eastern city of dresden .

realizing more u.s. investment could translate into more jobs for germany , which suffers chronically high unemployment , schröder will continue his business-boosting role during a lunch on friday with 17 leading u.s. executives . but the soaring euro , which has hit an all-time high against the u.s. dollar , could spoil the party for schröder and german companies , which fear the stronger currency will make their goods more expensive on world markets .

the attacks in istanbul drove the european markets down .
they bounced back friday morning , but fears linger that further attacks could unsettle investors and interfere with europe ’ s economic recovery . shortly after the news started pouring in that two british buildings had been the target of terrorist attacks in istanbul , stock markets in europe and across the world experienced a sharp dip on thursday .
the dramatic drop marked the second in just a few days , after the markets faltered similarly in the aftermath of last weekend 's bombings of two istanbul synagogues . before the latest round of terror , european markets had rallied over the summer , leading many to hope that an economic recovery was just around the corner .
but the events in istanbul have served as a reminder that al qaeda is far from defeated , and more attacks on so-called “ soft targets , ” like the hsbc headquarters in istanbul , may follow .
at the same time , the war in iraq has dragged on , and the security situation on the ground has continued to deteriorate .
all this has many wondering if further attacks and jittery markets will slow europe ’ s economic recovery .
experts are divided , but most paint a generally optimistic picture .
attacks could slow economic recovery almost immediately following the attacks on thursday , the effects were reflected in the european markets .
the eurotop 300 index of pan european blue chips was down 1.2 percent , the dj euro stoxx 1.5 percent and the frankfurt dax 1.7 percent .
on monday , following the attack on two synagogues over the weekend , the frankfurt dax suffered an even more extreme drop-off , tumbling 3.2 percent .
by friday morning , all markets had partially recovered .
among the many other factors investors now take into consideration , “ geo-political ” developments - as experts kindly term terrorist activities as well as political turbulence resulting from , say , a eu-u.s. trade war - are now considered among the most important .
but a debate persists over whether or not such developments , particularly of the terrorist variety , will spell trouble for europe ’ s economic recovery .
“ should we see a decline in confidence because of geo-political developments , that could be a problem for the economy , ” lorenzo condogno , an economist at the bank of america in london told dw-world .
“ that could actually undermine or slow down the economic recovery in europe .
most analysts stress the big picture others , however , downplay the temporary panic sparked by the attacks and emphasize the big picture , stressing that as long as other news - earnings reports and consumer confidence reports , for example - continues to be good , the recovery will remain on track .
“ these events will definitely have a temporary negative sentiment on equities and may even call into question the end of the year rally , ” hendrick garz , a european equity strategist at westlb panmure in düsseldorf told reuters .
“ but i have no doubt that we will see further equity gains if the economic news-flow continues to be positive next week , ” he added .
“ investors will definitely have these -lsb- security -rsb- topics in mind , but we are still far away from the point where they would really see this as an obstacle to investment . ”
garz is not the only expert to hold this opinion .

istanbul was rocked by two explosions on thursday , only days after twin suicide bombings against jewish targets in the turkish city .
meanwhile , germany ’ s intelligence service warned islamic terrorism may be on the rise . at least 26 people have died and more than 400 were injured in the blasts , which damaged the british consulate and the headquarters of the hsbc bank in istanbul . the british consul was among the confirmed dead .
british foreign secretary jack straw said the explosions bore all the signs of attacks by the al qaeda islamic terrorist network . " it ’ s too early to say who carried out these attacks , but they have every hallmark of al qaeda , " straw told the british house of commons .
" a number of british and turkish and other people have died .
a number of the british consulate staff are still unaccounted for . " apparently the bombings against british targets were timed to coincide with u.s. president george bush 's visit to britain .
both bush and british prime minister tony blair condemned the attacks on thursday . " someone wants to convey a very clear message that will go out not only to britain but to the united states , " gustav lindstrom at the institute of security studies in paris told reuters .
" many people will read into this a connection with britain 's effort in iraq and its special relationship to the united states . " the bombings on thursday come less than a week after other deadly terrorist attacks in istanbul .
on saturday , two trucks packed with homemade explosives detonated outside the beit israel and neve shalom synagogues in istanbul , killing 26 people and wounding hundreds more . the head of germany ’ s intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- on wednesday warned the first attacks in istanbul showed international terrorism was on the rise again . european radicals being recruited speaking to germany ’ s ard television , bnd director august hanning also said that islamic radicals were currently being recruited from all over europe to join the fight against u.s.-led occupying forces in iraq .
he said that the increasing violence in iraq could also evolve into the kind of guerilla warfare endured by the former soviet union in afghanistan during the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : august hanning “ there are reports of recruiting going on in europe , especially in countries such as britain and bosnia , ” said hanning .
“ we also have evidence that islamic radicals living in germany have already left for iraq . ” on average , the coalition forces in iraq have to endure almost 30 attacks per day and hanning said there was evidence that some of these attacks are being professionally masterminded by members of osama bin laden ’ s al qaeda terrorist network . hanning said german intelligence still believes there was no link in pre-war iraq between the regime of saddam hussein and al qaeda , but added that the country was quickly becoming a focal point for the group ’ s jihad against western civilization .
in a statement issued from aboard a plane en route to the united states , german chancellor gerhard schröder condemned the bombings .

istanbul was rocked by two explosions on thursday , only days after twin suicide bombings against jewish targets in the turkish city .
meanwhile , germany ’ s intelligence service warned islamic terrorism may be on the rise . at least 26 people have died and more than 400 were injured in the blasts , which damaged the british consulate and the headquarters of the hsbc bank in istanbul . the british consul was among the confirmed dead .
british foreign secretary jack straw said the explosions bore all the signs of attacks by the al qaeda islamic terrorist network . " it ’ s too early to say who carried out these attacks , but they have every hallmark of al qaeda , " straw told the british house of commons .
" a number of british and turkish and other people have died .
a number of the british consulate staff are still unaccounted for . " apparently the bombings against british targets were timed to coincide with u.s. president george bush 's visit to britain .
both bush and british prime minister tony blair condemned the attacks on thursday . " someone wants to convey a very clear message that will go out not only to britain but to the united states , " gustav lindstrom at the institute of security studies in paris told reuters .
" many people will read into this a connection with britain 's effort in iraq and its special relationship to the united states . " the bombings on thursday come less than a week after other deadly terrorist attacks in istanbul .
on saturday , two trucks packed with homemade explosives detonated outside the beit israel and neve shalom synagogues in istanbul , killing 26 people and wounding hundreds more . the head of germany ’ s intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- on wednesday warned the first attacks in istanbul showed international terrorism was on the rise again . european radicals being recruited speaking to germany ’ s ard television , bnd director august hanning also said that islamic radicals were currently being recruited from all over europe to join the fight against u.s.-led occupying forces in iraq .
he said that the increasing violence in iraq could also evolve into the kind of guerilla warfare endured by the former soviet union in afghanistan during the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : august hanning “ there are reports of recruiting going on in europe , especially in countries such as britain and bosnia , ” said hanning .
“ we also have evidence that islamic radicals living in germany have already left for iraq . ” on average , the coalition forces in iraq have to endure almost 30 attacks per day and hanning said there was evidence that some of these attacks are being professionally masterminded by members of osama bin laden ’ s al qaeda terrorist network . hanning said german intelligence still believes there was no link in pre-war iraq between the regime of saddam hussein and al qaeda , but added that the country was quickly becoming a focal point for the group ’ s jihad against western civilization .
in a statement issued from aboard a plane en route to the united states , german chancellor gerhard schröder condemned the bombings .

istanbul was shaken by deadly terror attacks on thursday that exploded in the banking quarter and in front of the british consulate .
the international fight against terror must be intensified . whoever is behind the istanbul attacks is likely to bomb the country even deeper into a conflict it has tried to keep itself out of in recent months : during the iraq war turkey was pained by the unreserved support of u.s. policies toward iraq that was demanded of it . the turkish refusal to allow the allies to use its territory for deploying their troops severely disturbed the american plan .
and when ankara did finally offer troops to reinforce the allies , it quickly rescinded the offer out of consideration for iraqi sensitivities . consideration and reserve have been of no use to turkey .
it has become the scene of previously unknown terrorism , that strikes blindly and hits the innocent despite the fact that the actual targets are apparent : first jewish , now british facilities . sick logic and tomorrow ? in their sick logic , the people behind the attacks aim to drive a wedge between turkey and those who they deem responsible for the war in iraq - that is , americans , brits and israelis . that turkish pedestrians die vicariously , does nothing to disrupt the terrorists plan .
on the contrary , the terrorists reckon on " solidarity out of fear " turning the people 's ranks against their own government , which should discontinue all support for the united states and all cooperation with israel . but that is precisely what will not happen now .

istanbul was rocked by two explosions on thursday , only days after twin suicide bombings against jewish targets in the turkish city .
meanwhile , germany ’ s intelligence service warned islamic terrorism may be on the rise . at least 26 people have died and more than 400 were injured in the blasts , which damaged the british consulate and the headquarters of the hsbc bank in istanbul . the british consul was among the confirmed dead .
british foreign secretary jack straw said the explosions bore all the signs of attacks by the al qaeda islamic terrorist network . " it ’ s too early to say who carried out these attacks , but they have every hallmark of al qaeda , " straw told the british house of commons .
" a number of british and turkish and other people have died .
a number of the british consulate staff are still unaccounted for . " apparently the bombings against british targets were timed to coincide with u.s. president george bush 's visit to britain .
both bush and british prime minister tony blair condemned the attacks on thursday . " someone wants to convey a very clear message that will go out not only to britain but to the united states , " gustav lindstrom at the institute of security studies in paris told reuters .
" many people will read into this a connection with britain 's effort in iraq and its special relationship to the united states . " the bombings on thursday come less than a week after other deadly terrorist attacks in istanbul .
on saturday , two trucks packed with homemade explosives detonated outside the beit israel and neve shalom synagogues in istanbul , killing 26 people and wounding hundreds more . the head of germany ’ s intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- on wednesday warned the first attacks in istanbul showed international terrorism was on the rise again . european radicals being recruited speaking to germany ’ s ard television , bnd director august hanning also said that islamic radicals were currently being recruited from all over europe to join the fight against u.s.-led occupying forces in iraq .
he said that the increasing violence in iraq could also evolve into the kind of guerilla warfare endured by the former soviet union in afghanistan during the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : august hanning “ there are reports of recruiting going on in europe , especially in countries such as britain and bosnia , ” said hanning .
“ we also have evidence that islamic radicals living in germany have already left for iraq . ” on average , the coalition forces in iraq have to endure almost 30 attacks per day and hanning said there was evidence that some of these attacks are being professionally masterminded by members of osama bin laden ’ s al qaeda terrorist network . hanning said german intelligence still believes there was no link in pre-war iraq between the regime of saddam hussein and al qaeda , but added that the country was quickly becoming a focal point for the group ’ s jihad against western civilization .
in a statement issued from aboard a plane en route to the united states , german chancellor gerhard schröder condemned the bombings .

istanbul was shaken by deadly terror attacks on thursday that exploded in the banking quarter and in front of the british consulate .
the international fight against terror must be intensified . whoever is behind the istanbul attacks is likely to bomb the country even deeper into a conflict it has tried to keep itself out of in recent months : during the iraq war turkey was pained by the unreserved support of u.s. policies toward iraq that was demanded of it . the turkish refusal to allow the allies to use its territory for deploying their troops severely disturbed the american plan .
and when ankara did finally offer troops to reinforce the allies , it quickly rescinded the offer out of consideration for iraqi sensitivities . consideration and reserve have been of no use to turkey .
it has become the scene of previously unknown terrorism , that strikes blindly and hits the innocent despite the fact that the actual targets are apparent : first jewish , now british facilities . sick logic and tomorrow ? in their sick logic , the people behind the attacks aim to drive a wedge between turkey and those who they deem responsible for the war in iraq - that is , americans , brits and israelis . that turkish pedestrians die vicariously , does nothing to disrupt the terrorists plan .
on the contrary , the terrorists reckon on " solidarity out of fear " turning the people 's ranks against their own government , which should discontinue all support for the united states and all cooperation with israel . but that is precisely what will not happen now .
the turkish government has been challenged by the attacks and it will not back down .
it was not prepared to in the course of the conflict with the pkk -lrb- kurdish paramilitary group -rrb- and the whole world appealed to ankara to give in .
why should it now yield when turkey has been bombed right in the middle of the anti-terror war stage and foreign countries demand pertinacity ?
there 's a lot at stake for turkey .
if it fails to position itself clearly and unambiguously against such terror , for example , skepticism and rejection of turkish rapprochement to the eu will grow , an understandable reaction perhaps , but nevertheless utterly wrong . europe 's latent terrorism europe is not threatened by a new terrorism from turkey , but rather the danger of terrorism is latently in existence in europe itself - and not just since september 11 .
volunteers from europe and from germany have supposedly gone to iraq to fight against the americans .
other like-minded people are sure to have remained in europe , and it would therefore be no surprise if bombs detonate there tomorrow . fanatics and fools are also among us .
it would be fatal to stonewall against turkey .
ankara needs the support of everyone who rejects terrorism .
that is the only way to insure that the istanbul murderers ' calculation does n't tally . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de istanbul hit by new series of explosions istanbul was rocked by two explosions on thursday , only days after twin suicide bombings against jewish targets in the turkish city .

he said that the increasing violence in iraq could also evolve into the kind of guerilla warfare endured by the former soviet union in afghanistan during the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : august hanning “ there are reports of recruiting going on in europe , especially in countries such as britain and bosnia , ” said hanning .
“ we also have evidence that islamic radicals living in germany have already left for iraq . ” on average , the coalition forces in iraq have to endure almost 30 attacks per day and hanning said there was evidence that some of these attacks are being professionally masterminded by members of osama bin laden ’ s al qaeda terrorist network . hanning said german intelligence still believes there was no link in pre-war iraq between the regime of saddam hussein and al qaeda , but added that the country was quickly becoming a focal point for the group ’ s jihad against western civilization .
in a statement issued from aboard a plane en route to the united states , german chancellor gerhard schröder condemned the bombings .

chancellor gerhard schröder is in new york to promote business ties and attract greater u.s. investment .
the sales pitch ?
his planned package of reforms will get europe ’ s largest economy running smoothly again . throwing himself into the role of germany ’ s top salesman , chancellor gerhard schröder came to new york looking to strengthen u.s.-german business ties .
and as any good salesman would , he remained optimistic halfway through his short trip , despite a looming transatlantic trade war and soaring euro against the u.s. dollar . speaking at the the american institute for contemporary german studies , which was honoring citigroup chief sanford weill , schröder trumpeted his so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package of economic and welfare reforms as just what germany needed to stay competitive in the 21st century . “ we want to get our country in shape for the challenges of this decade , this century , in order to be an equal partner , ” schröder said before an audience of 500 business leaders .
“ we ’ ve realized after a period of being satisfied with ourselves that something has to change . ” schröder presented germany as on the verge of becoming a motor for reform in europe - something that could be a hard sale on either side of the atlantic , considering the country has been a drag on eu growth in recent years .
but with germany ’ s export-dependent economy growing only a meager 0.2 percent in the third quarter , schröder knows how important it is to bolster trade relations with germany ’ s second largest trading partner , the united states . amd picks dresden as if to underscore schröder ’ s case , u.s. semiconductor giant amd announced on thursday that it would build a $ 2.4 billion -lrb- € 2.0 billion -rrb- chip-making plant in the eastern city of dresden .
lured by generous government subsides , the facility will create around 1,000 jobs and will secure the state of saxony ’ s position as one of europe ’ s leading high-tech regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amd decision to pick dresden over east fishkill , new york and singapore will add to the estimated € 100 billion that u.s. investors have poured into germany .
realizing more u.s. investment could translate into more jobs for germany , which suffers chronically high unemployment , schröder will continue his business-boosting role during a lunch on friday with 17 leading u.s. executives . but the soaring euro , which has hit an all-time high against the u.s. dollar , could spoil the party for schröder and german companies , which fear the stronger currency will make their goods more expensive on world markets .
perhaps aware the euro could threaten germany ’ s export-led recovery , schröder addressed the issue in new york . “ both sides have an interest in advantageous exchange rates .
nobody has an interest in a weak dollar , ” said schröder , referring to the growing u.s. trade deficit , according to bloomberg news .

germany responded to the second set of bombings in istanbul with harsh words of condemnation .
but the attacks have also ignited a fresh round of debate on turkey ’ s bid to join the eu . quick to condemn thursday ’ s bombings in istanbul , german leaders across the political spectrum expressed their dismay and indignation that the turkish city on europe ’ s edge was again attacked by islamic terrorists .
german foreign policy experts regarded the blasts in downtown istanbul in front of the british consulate and the hsbc bank as yet another attempt by fundamentalists to sever ties between the western and muslim worlds .
gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats , told deutsche welle that the brutal attacks require a strong reaction from the civilized world .
" the terrorists are aiming to drive a wedge between the west and muslim countries , " he maintained , and added that the choice of turkey , a " key country " between europe and the islamic world , was deliberate for the series of attacks .
" the terrorists want to cut off the relationship between islam and the christian world , " weisskirchen said and targeted turkey because they want to send out a signal of fear to the muslims not to align themselves too closely with the west .
bolstering turkey ’ s bid for the eu it is precisely for this reason that many german politicians are arguing that it is more important than ever to support turkey 's democratization process and to aid it in its bid to join the european union as soon as possible .
social democrat interior minister otto schily told german public television zdf on thursday that germany needs to encourage dialogue between the eu and turkey with a view to giving turkey a " clear perspective " as to when and under which conditions it may join the european bloc in the future .
" our reaction to what has happened in istanbul can only be closer cooperation with turkey , " the minister said .
turkey imports threat to europe but the conservative opposition has jumped to a different conclusion in face of this week ’ s attacks .
christian democrat union deputy parliamentary leader wolfgang bosbach addressed the fears of many in his party when he said that turkish membership in the eu would place other member countries in greater danger than they already are .
" a quick eu accession for turkey would import the terror problem to europe , " bosbach was quoted in the passauer neue presse as saying .
the cdu member also said that a muslim-dominated country does not belong in a bloc supposedly based on christian values , an argument many in the conservative party endorse .
ingo friedrich , a senior member of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , has also criticized attempts to extend the eu beyond the bosporus .
" it would n't work , " he said , " because the european union would be overstretched endangering the entire project of achieving peace and stability in europe . "
friedrich , who is also a deputy speaker of the european parliament , added that a speedy inclusion " could even intensify terrorism in turkey because islamic extremists would feel that a key muslim country is forcibly alienated from the islamic world . "
other politicians , such as werner hoyer , foreign affairs spokesman for the neo-liberal free democrats , are convinced including turkey in the eu could provide a concrete example of mutually beneficial cooperation between the western and muslim worlds and could help put an end to the talk about a clash of civilizations .
" what we have to do is to make sure that turkey remains on the western track .

germany responded to the second set of bombings in istanbul with harsh words of condemnation .
but the attacks have also ignited a fresh round of debate on turkey ’ s bid to join the eu . quick to condemn thursday ’ s bombings in istanbul , german leaders across the political spectrum expressed their dismay and indignation that the turkish city on europe ’ s edge was again attacked by islamic terrorists .
german foreign policy experts regarded the blasts in downtown istanbul in front of the british consulate and the hsbc bank as yet another attempt by fundamentalists to sever ties between the western and muslim worlds .
gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats , told deutsche welle that the brutal attacks require a strong reaction from the civilized world .
" the terrorists are aiming to drive a wedge between the west and muslim countries , " he maintained , and added that the choice of turkey , a " key country " between europe and the islamic world , was deliberate for the series of attacks .
" the terrorists want to cut off the relationship between islam and the christian world , " weisskirchen said and targeted turkey because they want to send out a signal of fear to the muslims not to align themselves too closely with the west .
bolstering turkey ’ s bid for the eu it is precisely for this reason that many german politicians are arguing that it is more important than ever to support turkey 's democratization process and to aid it in its bid to join the european union as soon as possible .
social democrat interior minister otto schily told german public television zdf on thursday that germany needs to encourage dialogue between the eu and turkey with a view to giving turkey a " clear perspective " as to when and under which conditions it may join the european bloc in the future .
" our reaction to what has happened in istanbul can only be closer cooperation with turkey , " the minister said .
turkey imports threat to europe but the conservative opposition has jumped to a different conclusion in face of this week ’ s attacks .
christian democrat union deputy parliamentary leader wolfgang bosbach addressed the fears of many in his party when he said that turkish membership in the eu would place other member countries in greater danger than they already are .
" a quick eu accession for turkey would import the terror problem to europe , " bosbach was quoted in the passauer neue presse as saying .
the cdu member also said that a muslim-dominated country does not belong in a bloc supposedly based on christian values , an argument many in the conservative party endorse .
ingo friedrich , a senior member of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , has also criticized attempts to extend the eu beyond the bosporus .
" it would n't work , " he said , " because the european union would be overstretched endangering the entire project of achieving peace and stability in europe . "
friedrich , who is also a deputy speaker of the european parliament , added that a speedy inclusion " could even intensify terrorism in turkey because islamic extremists would feel that a key muslim country is forcibly alienated from the islamic world . "
other politicians , such as werner hoyer , foreign affairs spokesman for the neo-liberal free democrats , are convinced including turkey in the eu could provide a concrete example of mutually beneficial cooperation between the western and muslim worlds and could help put an end to the talk about a clash of civilizations .
" what we have to do is to make sure that turkey remains on the western track .
it would be a real strengthening of europe if turkey stays in the western boat and that it becomes a member of the european union , " hoyer said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : high stakes for turkey istanbul was shaken by deadly terror attacks on thursday that exploded in the banking quarter and in front of the british consulate .

the attacks in istanbul drove the european markets down .
they bounced back friday morning , but fears linger that further attacks could unsettle investors and interfere with europe ’ s economic recovery . shortly after the news started pouring in that two british buildings had been the target of terrorist attacks in istanbul , stock markets in europe and across the world experienced a sharp dip on thursday .
the dramatic drop marked the second in just a few days , after the markets faltered similarly in the aftermath of last weekend 's bombings of two istanbul synagogues . before the latest round of terror , european markets had rallied over the summer , leading many to hope that an economic recovery was just around the corner .
but the events in istanbul have served as a reminder that al qaeda is far from defeated , and more attacks on so-called “ soft targets , ” like the hsbc headquarters in istanbul , may follow .
at the same time , the war in iraq has dragged on , and the security situation on the ground has continued to deteriorate .
all this has many wondering if further attacks and jittery markets will slow europe ’ s economic recovery .
experts are divided , but most paint a generally optimistic picture .
attacks could slow economic recovery almost immediately following the attacks on thursday , the effects were reflected in the european markets .
the eurotop 300 index of pan european blue chips was down 1.2 percent , the dj euro stoxx 1.5 percent and the frankfurt dax 1.7 percent .
on monday , following the attack on two synagogues over the weekend , the frankfurt dax suffered an even more extreme drop-off , tumbling 3.2 percent .
by friday morning , all markets had partially recovered .
among the many other factors investors now take into consideration , “ geo-political ” developments - as experts kindly term terrorist activities as well as political turbulence resulting from , say , a eu-u.s. trade war - are now considered among the most important .
but a debate persists over whether or not such developments , particularly of the terrorist variety , will spell trouble for europe ’ s economic recovery .
“ should we see a decline in confidence because of geo-political developments , that could be a problem for the economy , ” lorenzo condogno , an economist at the bank of america in london told dw-world .
“ that could actually undermine or slow down the economic recovery in europe .
most analysts stress the big picture others , however , downplay the temporary panic sparked by the attacks and emphasize the big picture , stressing that as long as other news - earnings reports and consumer confidence reports , for example - continues to be good , the recovery will remain on track .
“ these events will definitely have a temporary negative sentiment on equities and may even call into question the end of the year rally , ” hendrick garz , a european equity strategist at westlb panmure in düsseldorf told reuters .
“ but i have no doubt that we will see further equity gains if the economic news-flow continues to be positive next week , ” he added .
“ investors will definitely have these -lsb- security -rsb- topics in mind , but we are still far away from the point where they would really see this as an obstacle to investment . ”
garz is not the only expert to hold this opinion .
“ at the sort of level we are seeing , i don ’ t think it is going to disrupt the progression of the recovery - the fundamentals are very supportive , ” mike lenhoff , a chief strategist at brewin dolphin securities told reuters .
historically speaking , markets have always been sensitive to geo-political events .
u.s. markets dropped 2.93 percent after the japanese attacked pearl harbor and 2.89 percent after john f. kennedy 's assassination .

germany responded to the second set of bombings in istanbul with harsh words of condemnation .
but the attacks have also ignited a fresh round of debate on turkey ’ s bid to join the eu . quick to condemn thursday ’ s bombings in istanbul , german leaders across the political spectrum expressed their dismay and indignation that the turkish city on europe ’ s edge was again attacked by islamic terrorists .
german foreign policy experts regarded the blasts in downtown istanbul in front of the british consulate and the hsbc bank as yet another attempt by fundamentalists to sever ties between the western and muslim worlds .
gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats , told deutsche welle that the brutal attacks require a strong reaction from the civilized world .
" the terrorists are aiming to drive a wedge between the west and muslim countries , " he maintained , and added that the choice of turkey , a " key country " between europe and the islamic world , was deliberate for the series of attacks .
" the terrorists want to cut off the relationship between islam and the christian world , " weisskirchen said and targeted turkey because they want to send out a signal of fear to the muslims not to align themselves too closely with the west .
bolstering turkey ’ s bid for the eu it is precisely for this reason that many german politicians are arguing that it is more important than ever to support turkey 's democratization process and to aid it in its bid to join the european union as soon as possible .
social democrat interior minister otto schily told german public television zdf on thursday that germany needs to encourage dialogue between the eu and turkey with a view to giving turkey a " clear perspective " as to when and under which conditions it may join the european bloc in the future .
" our reaction to what has happened in istanbul can only be closer cooperation with turkey , " the minister said .
turkey imports threat to europe but the conservative opposition has jumped to a different conclusion in face of this week ’ s attacks .
christian democrat union deputy parliamentary leader wolfgang bosbach addressed the fears of many in his party when he said that turkish membership in the eu would place other member countries in greater danger than they already are .
" a quick eu accession for turkey would import the terror problem to europe , " bosbach was quoted in the passauer neue presse as saying .
the cdu member also said that a muslim-dominated country does not belong in a bloc supposedly based on christian values , an argument many in the conservative party endorse .
ingo friedrich , a senior member of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , has also criticized attempts to extend the eu beyond the bosporus .
" it would n't work , " he said , " because the european union would be overstretched endangering the entire project of achieving peace and stability in europe . "
friedrich , who is also a deputy speaker of the european parliament , added that a speedy inclusion " could even intensify terrorism in turkey because islamic extremists would feel that a key muslim country is forcibly alienated from the islamic world . "
other politicians , such as werner hoyer , foreign affairs spokesman for the neo-liberal free democrats , are convinced including turkey in the eu could provide a concrete example of mutually beneficial cooperation between the western and muslim worlds and could help put an end to the talk about a clash of civilizations .
" what we have to do is to make sure that turkey remains on the western track .
it would be a real strengthening of europe if turkey stays in the western boat and that it becomes a member of the european union , " hoyer said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : high stakes for turkey istanbul was shaken by deadly terror attacks on thursday that exploded in the banking quarter and in front of the british consulate .

the attacks in istanbul drove the european markets down .
they bounced back friday morning , but fears linger that further attacks could unsettle investors and interfere with europe ’ s economic recovery . shortly after the news started pouring in that two british buildings had been the target of terrorist attacks in istanbul , stock markets in europe and across the world experienced a sharp dip on thursday .
the dramatic drop marked the second in just a few days , after the markets faltered similarly in the aftermath of last weekend 's bombings of two istanbul synagogues . before the latest round of terror , european markets had rallied over the summer , leading many to hope that an economic recovery was just around the corner .
but the events in istanbul have served as a reminder that al qaeda is far from defeated , and more attacks on so-called “ soft targets , ” like the hsbc headquarters in istanbul , may follow .
at the same time , the war in iraq has dragged on , and the security situation on the ground has continued to deteriorate .
all this has many wondering if further attacks and jittery markets will slow europe ’ s economic recovery .
experts are divided , but most paint a generally optimistic picture .
attacks could slow economic recovery almost immediately following the attacks on thursday , the effects were reflected in the european markets .
the eurotop 300 index of pan european blue chips was down 1.2 percent , the dj euro stoxx 1.5 percent and the frankfurt dax 1.7 percent .
on monday , following the attack on two synagogues over the weekend , the frankfurt dax suffered an even more extreme drop-off , tumbling 3.2 percent .
by friday morning , all markets had partially recovered .
among the many other factors investors now take into consideration , “ geo-political ” developments - as experts kindly term terrorist activities as well as political turbulence resulting from , say , a eu-u.s. trade war - are now considered among the most important .
but a debate persists over whether or not such developments , particularly of the terrorist variety , will spell trouble for europe ’ s economic recovery .
“ should we see a decline in confidence because of geo-political developments , that could be a problem for the economy , ” lorenzo condogno , an economist at the bank of america in london told dw-world .
“ that could actually undermine or slow down the economic recovery in europe .
most analysts stress the big picture others , however , downplay the temporary panic sparked by the attacks and emphasize the big picture , stressing that as long as other news - earnings reports and consumer confidence reports , for example - continues to be good , the recovery will remain on track .
“ these events will definitely have a temporary negative sentiment on equities and may even call into question the end of the year rally , ” hendrick garz , a european equity strategist at westlb panmure in düsseldorf told reuters .
“ but i have no doubt that we will see further equity gains if the economic news-flow continues to be positive next week , ” he added .
“ investors will definitely have these -lsb- security -rsb- topics in mind , but we are still far away from the point where they would really see this as an obstacle to investment . ”
garz is not the only expert to hold this opinion .
“ at the sort of level we are seeing , i don ’ t think it is going to disrupt the progression of the recovery - the fundamentals are very supportive , ” mike lenhoff , a chief strategist at brewin dolphin securities told reuters .
historically speaking , markets have always been sensitive to geo-political events .

“ investors will definitely have these -lsb- security -rsb- topics in mind , but we are still far away from the point where they would really see this as an obstacle to investment . ”
garz is not the only expert to hold this opinion .
“ at the sort of level we are seeing , i don ’ t think it is going to disrupt the progression of the recovery - the fundamentals are very supportive , ” mike lenhoff , a chief strategist at brewin dolphin securities told reuters .

chancellor gerhard schröder is in new york to promote business ties and attract greater u.s. investment .
the sales pitch ?
his planned package of reforms will get europe ’ s largest economy running smoothly again . throwing himself into the role of germany ’ s top salesman , chancellor gerhard schröder came to new york looking to strengthen u.s.-german business ties .
and as any good salesman would , he remained optimistic halfway through his short trip , despite a looming transatlantic trade war and soaring euro against the u.s. dollar . speaking at the the american institute for contemporary german studies , which was honoring citigroup chief sanford weill , schröder trumpeted his so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package of economic and welfare reforms as just what germany needed to stay competitive in the 21st century . “ we want to get our country in shape for the challenges of this decade , this century , in order to be an equal partner , ” schröder said before an audience of 500 business leaders .
“ we ’ ve realized after a period of being satisfied with ourselves that something has to change . ” schröder presented germany as on the verge of becoming a motor for reform in europe - something that could be a hard sale on either side of the atlantic , considering the country has been a drag on eu growth in recent years .
but with germany ’ s export-dependent economy growing only a meager 0.2 percent in the third quarter , schröder knows how important it is to bolster trade relations with germany ’ s second largest trading partner , the united states . amd picks dresden as if to underscore schröder ’ s case , u.s. semiconductor giant amd announced on thursday that it would build a $ 2.4 billion -lrb- € 2.0 billion -rrb- chip-making plant in the eastern city of dresden .
lured by generous government subsides , the facility will create around 1,000 jobs and will secure the state of saxony ’ s position as one of europe ’ s leading high-tech regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amd decision to pick dresden over east fishkill , new york and singapore will add to the estimated € 100 billion that u.s. investors have poured into germany .
realizing more u.s. investment could translate into more jobs for germany , which suffers chronically high unemployment , schröder will continue his business-boosting role during a lunch on friday with 17 leading u.s. executives . but the soaring euro , which has hit an all-time high against the u.s. dollar , could spoil the party for schröder and german companies , which fear the stronger currency will make their goods more expensive on world markets .
perhaps aware the euro could threaten germany ’ s export-led recovery , schröder addressed the issue in new york . “ both sides have an interest in advantageous exchange rates .
nobody has an interest in a weak dollar , ” said schröder , referring to the growing u.s. trade deficit , according to bloomberg news .

germany hopes to save its scandal-plagued effort to host the olympic games in 2012 by appointing new members to the olympic committee positions left vacant by disgraced departing members . interior minister otto schily announced on wednesday that highly respected political and business leaders would take charge of leipzig 's beleaguered effort to host the 2012 summer olympics .
key figures had resigned in disgrace or were forced out after a series of scandals came to light in october . peter zühlsdorff , a former top manager at wella haircare group , will take over the chairmanship of the committee overseeing leipzig ’ s bid .
schily described zühlsdorff as a “ patriot of practice , ” and suggested that - unlike his predecessor - he would neither be tempted to use the position for personal gain nor would questions about his past come back to haunt him - or the olympic bid . the same criteria seems to have gone into the selection of the former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher , who will take over the position as chairman of the supervisory board .
former baden-württemberg premier lothar späth and businessman arend oetker will occupy other positions on the supervisory board . in addition , a report was released that clears leipzig mayor wolfgang tiefensee and saxon premier georg milbrant of any wrongdoing related to financial irregularities in the olympic bid . having cleaned house , interior minister schily said he hoped the committee can now get down to business .
“ we have drawn a line under everything that has happened , ” he said . heads roll ' everything ' began in october .
then , dirk thärichen , who had headed committee overseeing the bid and was considered close to leipzig mayor tiefensee , resigned after it was revealed that he had had ties to the east german secret police , the stasi .
burkhard jung , a supervisory board member , was forced out after allegations surfaced that he had taken illegal commission payments worth more than € 150,000 -lrb- $ 171,400 -rrb- .
tiefensee 's state secretary , wolfram köhler , was forced to retire after he came under fire for allegedly paying his wife high commissions for helping to find financial sponsors while he was the mayor of the town of riesa . rostock too , which would host the olympic sailing competition if the bid is successful , has not been free of scandals either .
harald lochotzke , the chairman of the city 's olympic marketing committee , also resigned over allegations of involvement with the stasi and complicity in a number of financial irregularities .
tough work ahead zühlsdorff and company will have their work cut out for them in order to revive a bid that was considered a long shot from the start .
though leipzig seems to have come out of nowhere to secure the position as germany ’ s official candidate to host the 2012 olympics , it still needs to fend off tough competition from other cities , including paris and new york .
plus , after being forced to face its own demons over the bribery scandal in conjunction with salt lake city winning the 2002 winter games , the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- may be reluctant to choose leipzig .
german olympic committee head walther tröger though , said leipzig 's chances had n't been diminished .
" heads rolling over olympic bids is nothing extraordinary , " he said .
the newly configured committee will meet again on december 10 to approve the city ’ s final proposal , which is due to the ioc on january 15 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de olympic committee issues leipzig ultimatum the organizers behind the scandal-ridden joint bid by leipzig / rostock to host the 2012 olympic games have been given a final warning by germany ’ s olympic committee : clean up your act or we ’ ll pull the plug .

germany hopes to save its scandal-plagued effort to host the olympic games in 2012 by appointing new members to the olympic committee positions left vacant by disgraced departing members . interior minister otto schily announced on wednesday that highly respected political and business leaders would take charge of leipzig 's beleaguered effort to host the 2012 summer olympics .
key figures had resigned in disgrace or were forced out after a series of scandals came to light in october . peter zühlsdorff , a former top manager at wella haircare group , will take over the chairmanship of the committee overseeing leipzig ’ s bid .
schily described zühlsdorff as a “ patriot of practice , ” and suggested that - unlike his predecessor - he would neither be tempted to use the position for personal gain nor would questions about his past come back to haunt him - or the olympic bid . the same criteria seems to have gone into the selection of the former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher , who will take over the position as chairman of the supervisory board .
former baden-württemberg premier lothar späth and businessman arend oetker will occupy other positions on the supervisory board . in addition , a report was released that clears leipzig mayor wolfgang tiefensee and saxon premier georg milbrant of any wrongdoing related to financial irregularities in the olympic bid . having cleaned house , interior minister schily said he hoped the committee can now get down to business .
“ we have drawn a line under everything that has happened , ” he said . heads roll ' everything ' began in october .
then , dirk thärichen , who had headed committee overseeing the bid and was considered close to leipzig mayor tiefensee , resigned after it was revealed that he had had ties to the east german secret police , the stasi .
burkhard jung , a supervisory board member , was forced out after allegations surfaced that he had taken illegal commission payments worth more than € 150,000 -lrb- $ 171,400 -rrb- .
tiefensee 's state secretary , wolfram köhler , was forced to retire after he came under fire for allegedly paying his wife high commissions for helping to find financial sponsors while he was the mayor of the town of riesa . rostock too , which would host the olympic sailing competition if the bid is successful , has not been free of scandals either .
harald lochotzke , the chairman of the city 's olympic marketing committee , also resigned over allegations of involvement with the stasi and complicity in a number of financial irregularities .
tough work ahead zühlsdorff and company will have their work cut out for them in order to revive a bid that was considered a long shot from the start .
though leipzig seems to have come out of nowhere to secure the position as germany ’ s official candidate to host the 2012 olympics , it still needs to fend off tough competition from other cities , including paris and new york .
plus , after being forced to face its own demons over the bribery scandal in conjunction with salt lake city winning the 2002 winter games , the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- may be reluctant to choose leipzig .
german olympic committee head walther tröger though , said leipzig 's chances had n't been diminished .

chancellor gerhard schröder is in new york to promote business ties and attract greater u.s. investment .
the sales pitch ?
his planned package of reforms will get europe ’ s largest economy running smoothly again . throwing himself into the role of germany ’ s top salesman , chancellor gerhard schröder came to new york looking to strengthen u.s.-german business ties .
and as any good salesman would , he remained optimistic halfway through his short trip , despite a looming transatlantic trade war and soaring euro against the u.s. dollar . speaking at the the american institute for contemporary german studies , which was honoring citigroup chief sanford weill , schröder trumpeted his so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package of economic and welfare reforms as just what germany needed to stay competitive in the 21st century . “ we want to get our country in shape for the challenges of this decade , this century , in order to be an equal partner , ” schröder said before an audience of 500 business leaders .
“ we ’ ve realized after a period of being satisfied with ourselves that something has to change . ” schröder presented germany as on the verge of becoming a motor for reform in europe - something that could be a hard sale on either side of the atlantic , considering the country has been a drag on eu growth in recent years .
but with germany ’ s export-dependent economy growing only a meager 0.2 percent in the third quarter , schröder knows how important it is to bolster trade relations with germany ’ s second largest trading partner , the united states . amd picks dresden as if to underscore schröder ’ s case , u.s. semiconductor giant amd announced on thursday that it would build a $ 2.4 billion -lrb- € 2.0 billion -rrb- chip-making plant in the eastern city of dresden .

realizing more u.s. investment could translate into more jobs for germany , which suffers chronically high unemployment , schröder will continue his business-boosting role during a lunch on friday with 17 leading u.s. executives . but the soaring euro , which has hit an all-time high against the u.s. dollar , could spoil the party for schröder and german companies , which fear the stronger currency will make their goods more expensive on world markets .
perhaps aware the euro could threaten germany ’ s export-led recovery , schröder addressed the issue in new york . “ both sides have an interest in advantageous exchange rates .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.11.2003 could terror attacks slow europe ’ s economic recovery ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future of europe 's markets looks blurry - it 's hard to know if more attacks will unsettle investors .
the attacks in istanbul drove the european markets down .
they bounced back friday morning , but fears linger that further attacks could unsettle investors and interfere with europe ’ s economic recovery . shortly after the news started pouring in that two british buildings had been the target of terrorist attacks in istanbul , stock markets in europe and across the world experienced a sharp dip on thursday .
the dramatic drop marked the second in just a few days , after the markets faltered similarly in the aftermath of last weekend 's bombings of two istanbul synagogues . before the latest round of terror , european markets had rallied over the summer , leading many to hope that an economic recovery was just around the corner .
but the events in istanbul have served as a reminder that al qaeda is far from defeated , and more attacks on so-called “ soft targets , ” like the hsbc headquarters in istanbul , may follow .
at the same time , the war in iraq has dragged on , and the security situation on the ground has continued to deteriorate .
all this has many wondering if further attacks and jittery markets will slow europe ’ s economic recovery .
experts are divided , but most paint a generally optimistic picture .
attacks could slow economic recovery almost immediately following the attacks on thursday , the effects were reflected in the european markets .
the eurotop 300 index of pan european blue chips was down 1.2 percent , the dj euro stoxx 1.5 percent and the frankfurt dax 1.7 percent .
on monday , following the attack on two synagogues over the weekend , the frankfurt dax suffered an even more extreme drop-off , tumbling 3.2 percent .
by friday morning , all markets had partially recovered .
among the many other factors investors now take into consideration , “ geo-political ” developments - as experts kindly term terrorist activities as well as political turbulence resulting from , say , a eu-u.s. trade war - are now considered among the most important .
but a debate persists over whether or not such developments , particularly of the terrorist variety , will spell trouble for europe ’ s economic recovery .
“ should we see a decline in confidence because of geo-political developments , that could be a problem for the economy , ” lorenzo condogno , an economist at the bank of america in london told dw-world .
“ that could actually undermine or slow down the economic recovery in europe .
most analysts stress the big picture others , however , downplay the temporary panic sparked by the attacks and emphasize the big picture , stressing that as long as other news - earnings reports and consumer confidence reports , for example - continues to be good , the recovery will remain on track .
“ these events will definitely have a temporary negative sentiment on equities and may even call into question the end of the year rally , ” hendrick garz , a european equity strategist at westlb panmure in düsseldorf told reuters .
“ but i have no doubt that we will see further equity gains if the economic news-flow continues to be positive next week , ” he added .
“ investors will definitely have these -lsb- security -rsb- topics in mind , but we are still far away from the point where they would really see this as an obstacle to investment . ”
garz is not the only expert to hold this opinion .
“ at the sort of level we are seeing , i don ’ t think it is going to disrupt the progression of the recovery - the fundamentals are very supportive , ” mike lenhoff , a chief strategist at brewin dolphin securities told reuters .
historically speaking , markets have always been sensitive to geo-political events .
u.s. markets dropped 2.93 percent after the japanese attacked pearl harbor and 2.89 percent after john f. kennedy 's assassination .
in europe , the various markets dropped between 5 and 10 percent following the attacks on september 11 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback the european economy : will more attacks slow down a recovery ? radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" the spread of hate propaganda in mosques has to stop , " rabbi arthur schneier , founder of the appeal of conscience foundation , said , adding that thursday 's suicide bombings in istanbul should be considered alarm signals .
malcolm hoenlein , executive vice chairman of the conference of presidents of major american jewish organizations , said it was intolerable that " pictures of children with suicide bombs are shown " at anti-israeli demonstrations .

the sales pitch ?
his planned package of reforms will get europe ’ s largest economy running smoothly again . throwing himself into the role of germany ’ s top salesman , chancellor gerhard schröder came to new york looking to strengthen u.s.-german business ties .
and as any good salesman would , he remained optimistic halfway through his short trip , despite a looming transatlantic trade war and soaring euro against the u.s. dollar . speaking at the the american institute for contemporary german studies , which was honoring citigroup chief sanford weill , schröder trumpeted his so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package of economic and welfare reforms as just what germany needed to stay competitive in the 21st century . “ we want to get our country in shape for the challenges of this decade , this century , in order to be an equal partner , ” schröder said before an audience of 500 business leaders .
“ we ’ ve realized after a period of being satisfied with ourselves that something has to change . ” schröder presented germany as on the verge of becoming a motor for reform in europe - something that could be a hard sale on either side of the atlantic , considering the country has been a drag on eu growth in recent years .

realizing more u.s. investment could translate into more jobs for germany , which suffers chronically high unemployment , schröder will continue his business-boosting role during a lunch on friday with 17 leading u.s. executives . but the soaring euro , which has hit an all-time high against the u.s. dollar , could spoil the party for schröder and german companies , which fear the stronger currency will make their goods more expensive on world markets .
perhaps aware the euro could threaten germany ’ s export-led recovery , schröder addressed the issue in new york . “ both sides have an interest in advantageous exchange rates .

istanbul was rocked by two explosions on thursday , only days after twin suicide bombings against jewish targets in the turkish city .
meanwhile , germany ’ s intelligence service warned islamic terrorism may be on the rise . at least 26 people have died and more than 400 were injured in the blasts , which damaged the british consulate and the headquarters of the hsbc bank in istanbul . the british consul was among the confirmed dead .
british foreign secretary jack straw said the explosions bore all the signs of attacks by the al qaeda islamic terrorist network . " it ’ s too early to say who carried out these attacks , but they have every hallmark of al qaeda , " straw told the british house of commons .
" a number of british and turkish and other people have died .
a number of the british consulate staff are still unaccounted for . " apparently the bombings against british targets were timed to coincide with u.s. president george bush 's visit to britain .
both bush and british prime minister tony blair condemned the attacks on thursday . " someone wants to convey a very clear message that will go out not only to britain but to the united states , " gustav lindstrom at the institute of security studies in paris told reuters .
" many people will read into this a connection with britain 's effort in iraq and its special relationship to the united states . " the bombings on thursday come less than a week after other deadly terrorist attacks in istanbul .
on saturday , two trucks packed with homemade explosives detonated outside the beit israel and neve shalom synagogues in istanbul , killing 26 people and wounding hundreds more . the head of germany ’ s intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- on wednesday warned the first attacks in istanbul showed international terrorism was on the rise again . european radicals being recruited speaking to germany ’ s ard television , bnd director august hanning also said that islamic radicals were currently being recruited from all over europe to join the fight against u.s.-led occupying forces in iraq .
he said that the increasing violence in iraq could also evolve into the kind of guerilla warfare endured by the former soviet union in afghanistan during the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : august hanning “ there are reports of recruiting going on in europe , especially in countries such as britain and bosnia , ” said hanning .
“ we also have evidence that islamic radicals living in germany have already left for iraq . ” on average , the coalition forces in iraq have to endure almost 30 attacks per day and hanning said there was evidence that some of these attacks are being professionally masterminded by members of osama bin laden ’ s al qaeda terrorist network . hanning said german intelligence still believes there was no link in pre-war iraq between the regime of saddam hussein and al qaeda , but added that the country was quickly becoming a focal point for the group ’ s jihad against western civilization .
in a statement issued from aboard a plane en route to the united states , german chancellor gerhard schröder condemned the bombings .

istanbul was rocked by two explosions on thursday , only days after twin suicide bombings against jewish targets in the turkish city .
meanwhile , germany ’ s intelligence service warned islamic terrorism may be on the rise . at least 26 people have died and more than 400 were injured in the blasts , which damaged the british consulate and the headquarters of the hsbc bank in istanbul . the british consul was among the confirmed dead .
british foreign secretary jack straw said the explosions bore all the signs of attacks by the al qaeda islamic terrorist network . " it ’ s too early to say who carried out these attacks , but they have every hallmark of al qaeda , " straw told the british house of commons .
" a number of british and turkish and other people have died .
a number of the british consulate staff are still unaccounted for . " apparently the bombings against british targets were timed to coincide with u.s. president george bush 's visit to britain .
both bush and british prime minister tony blair condemned the attacks on thursday . " someone wants to convey a very clear message that will go out not only to britain but to the united states , " gustav lindstrom at the institute of security studies in paris told reuters .
" many people will read into this a connection with britain 's effort in iraq and its special relationship to the united states . " the bombings on thursday come less than a week after other deadly terrorist attacks in istanbul .

he said that the increasing violence in iraq could also evolve into the kind of guerilla warfare endured by the former soviet union in afghanistan during the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : august hanning “ there are reports of recruiting going on in europe , especially in countries such as britain and bosnia , ” said hanning .
“ we also have evidence that islamic radicals living in germany have already left for iraq . ” on average , the coalition forces in iraq have to endure almost 30 attacks per day and hanning said there was evidence that some of these attacks are being professionally masterminded by members of osama bin laden ’ s al qaeda terrorist network . hanning said german intelligence still believes there was no link in pre-war iraq between the regime of saddam hussein and al qaeda , but added that the country was quickly becoming a focal point for the group ’ s jihad against western civilization .
in a statement issued from aboard a plane en route to the united states , german chancellor gerhard schröder condemned the bombings .

the car manufacturer 's management board has approved the sale , daimlerchrysler announced on friday in stuttgart .

the german government had opposed selling mtu to foreign investors , fearing that germany 's defense sector would be sold off to the competition - u.s. competition in particular .

the attacks in istanbul drove the european markets down .
they bounced back friday morning , but fears linger that further attacks could unsettle investors and interfere with europe ’ s economic recovery . shortly after the news started pouring in that two british buildings had been the target of terrorist attacks in istanbul , stock markets in europe and across the world experienced a sharp dip on thursday .
the dramatic drop marked the second in just a few days , after the markets faltered similarly in the aftermath of last weekend 's bombings of two istanbul synagogues . before the latest round of terror , european markets had rallied over the summer , leading many to hope that an economic recovery was just around the corner .
but the events in istanbul have served as a reminder that al qaeda is far from defeated , and more attacks on so-called “ soft targets , ” like the hsbc headquarters in istanbul , may follow .
at the same time , the war in iraq has dragged on , and the security situation on the ground has continued to deteriorate .
all this has many wondering if further attacks and jittery markets will slow europe ’ s economic recovery .
experts are divided , but most paint a generally optimistic picture .
attacks could slow economic recovery almost immediately following the attacks on thursday , the effects were reflected in the european markets .
the eurotop 300 index of pan european blue chips was down 1.2 percent , the dj euro stoxx 1.5 percent and the frankfurt dax 1.7 percent .
on monday , following the attack on two synagogues over the weekend , the frankfurt dax suffered an even more extreme drop-off , tumbling 3.2 percent .
by friday morning , all markets had partially recovered .
among the many other factors investors now take into consideration , “ geo-political ” developments - as experts kindly term terrorist activities as well as political turbulence resulting from , say , a eu-u.s. trade war - are now considered among the most important .
but a debate persists over whether or not such developments , particularly of the terrorist variety , will spell trouble for europe ’ s economic recovery .
“ should we see a decline in confidence because of geo-political developments , that could be a problem for the economy , ” lorenzo condogno , an economist at the bank of america in london told dw-world .
“ that could actually undermine or slow down the economic recovery in europe .
most analysts stress the big picture others , however , downplay the temporary panic sparked by the attacks and emphasize the big picture , stressing that as long as other news - earnings reports and consumer confidence reports , for example - continues to be good , the recovery will remain on track .
“ these events will definitely have a temporary negative sentiment on equities and may even call into question the end of the year rally , ” hendrick garz , a european equity strategist at westlb panmure in düsseldorf told reuters .
“ but i have no doubt that we will see further equity gains if the economic news-flow continues to be positive next week , ” he added .
“ investors will definitely have these -lsb- security -rsb- topics in mind , but we are still far away from the point where they would really see this as an obstacle to investment . ”
garz is not the only expert to hold this opinion .
“ at the sort of level we are seeing , i don ’ t think it is going to disrupt the progression of the recovery - the fundamentals are very supportive , ” mike lenhoff , a chief strategist at brewin dolphin securities told reuters .
historically speaking , markets have always been sensitive to geo-political events .

the attacks in istanbul drove the european markets down .
they bounced back friday morning , but fears linger that further attacks could unsettle investors and interfere with europe ’ s economic recovery . shortly after the news started pouring in that two british buildings had been the target of terrorist attacks in istanbul , stock markets in europe and across the world experienced a sharp dip on thursday .
the dramatic drop marked the second in just a few days , after the markets faltered similarly in the aftermath of last weekend 's bombings of two istanbul synagogues . before the latest round of terror , european markets had rallied over the summer , leading many to hope that an economic recovery was just around the corner .
but the events in istanbul have served as a reminder that al qaeda is far from defeated , and more attacks on so-called “ soft targets , ” like the hsbc headquarters in istanbul , may follow .
at the same time , the war in iraq has dragged on , and the security situation on the ground has continued to deteriorate .
all this has many wondering if further attacks and jittery markets will slow europe ’ s economic recovery .
experts are divided , but most paint a generally optimistic picture .
attacks could slow economic recovery almost immediately following the attacks on thursday , the effects were reflected in the european markets .
the eurotop 300 index of pan european blue chips was down 1.2 percent , the dj euro stoxx 1.5 percent and the frankfurt dax 1.7 percent .
on monday , following the attack on two synagogues over the weekend , the frankfurt dax suffered an even more extreme drop-off , tumbling 3.2 percent .
by friday morning , all markets had partially recovered .
among the many other factors investors now take into consideration , “ geo-political ” developments - as experts kindly term terrorist activities as well as political turbulence resulting from , say , a eu-u.s. trade war - are now considered among the most important .
but a debate persists over whether or not such developments , particularly of the terrorist variety , will spell trouble for europe ’ s economic recovery .
“ should we see a decline in confidence because of geo-political developments , that could be a problem for the economy , ” lorenzo condogno , an economist at the bank of america in london told dw-world .
“ that could actually undermine or slow down the economic recovery in europe .
most analysts stress the big picture others , however , downplay the temporary panic sparked by the attacks and emphasize the big picture , stressing that as long as other news - earnings reports and consumer confidence reports , for example - continues to be good , the recovery will remain on track .
“ these events will definitely have a temporary negative sentiment on equities and may even call into question the end of the year rally , ” hendrick garz , a european equity strategist at westlb panmure in düsseldorf told reuters .
“ but i have no doubt that we will see further equity gains if the economic news-flow continues to be positive next week , ” he added .
“ investors will definitely have these -lsb- security -rsb- topics in mind , but we are still far away from the point where they would really see this as an obstacle to investment . ”
garz is not the only expert to hold this opinion .

chancellor gerhard schröder is in new york to promote business ties and attract greater u.s. investment .
the sales pitch ?
his planned package of reforms will get europe ’ s largest economy running smoothly again . throwing himself into the role of germany ’ s top salesman , chancellor gerhard schröder came to new york looking to strengthen u.s.-german business ties .
and as any good salesman would , he remained optimistic halfway through his short trip , despite a looming transatlantic trade war and soaring euro against the u.s. dollar . speaking at the the american institute for contemporary german studies , which was honoring citigroup chief sanford weill , schröder trumpeted his so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package of economic and welfare reforms as just what germany needed to stay competitive in the 21st century . “ we want to get our country in shape for the challenges of this decade , this century , in order to be an equal partner , ” schröder said before an audience of 500 business leaders .
“ we ’ ve realized after a period of being satisfied with ourselves that something has to change . ” schröder presented germany as on the verge of becoming a motor for reform in europe - something that could be a hard sale on either side of the atlantic , considering the country has been a drag on eu growth in recent years .
but with germany ’ s export-dependent economy growing only a meager 0.2 percent in the third quarter , schröder knows how important it is to bolster trade relations with germany ’ s second largest trading partner , the united states . amd picks dresden as if to underscore schröder ’ s case , u.s. semiconductor giant amd announced on thursday that it would build a $ 2.4 billion -lrb- € 2.0 billion -rrb- chip-making plant in the eastern city of dresden .
lured by generous government subsides , the facility will create around 1,000 jobs and will secure the state of saxony ’ s position as one of europe ’ s leading high-tech regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amd decision to pick dresden over east fishkill , new york and singapore will add to the estimated € 100 billion that u.s. investors have poured into germany .
realizing more u.s. investment could translate into more jobs for germany , which suffers chronically high unemployment , schröder will continue his business-boosting role during a lunch on friday with 17 leading u.s. executives . but the soaring euro , which has hit an all-time high against the u.s. dollar , could spoil the party for schröder and german companies , which fear the stronger currency will make their goods more expensive on world markets .
perhaps aware the euro could threaten germany ’ s export-led recovery , schröder addressed the issue in new york . “ both sides have an interest in advantageous exchange rates .

chancellor gerhard schröder is in new york to promote business ties and attract greater u.s. investment .
the sales pitch ?
his planned package of reforms will get europe ’ s largest economy running smoothly again . throwing himself into the role of germany ’ s top salesman , chancellor gerhard schröder came to new york looking to strengthen u.s.-german business ties .
and as any good salesman would , he remained optimistic halfway through his short trip , despite a looming transatlantic trade war and soaring euro against the u.s. dollar . speaking at the the american institute for contemporary german studies , which was honoring citigroup chief sanford weill , schröder trumpeted his so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package of economic and welfare reforms as just what germany needed to stay competitive in the 21st century . “ we want to get our country in shape for the challenges of this decade , this century , in order to be an equal partner , ” schröder said before an audience of 500 business leaders .
“ we ’ ve realized after a period of being satisfied with ourselves that something has to change . ” schröder presented germany as on the verge of becoming a motor for reform in europe - something that could be a hard sale on either side of the atlantic , considering the country has been a drag on eu growth in recent years .

the attacks in istanbul drove the european markets down .
they bounced back friday morning , but fears linger that further attacks could unsettle investors and interfere with europe ’ s economic recovery . shortly after the news started pouring in that two british buildings had been the target of terrorist attacks in istanbul , stock markets in europe and across the world experienced a sharp dip on thursday .
the dramatic drop marked the second in just a few days , after the markets faltered similarly in the aftermath of last weekend 's bombings of two istanbul synagogues . before the latest round of terror , european markets had rallied over the summer , leading many to hope that an economic recovery was just around the corner .
but the events in istanbul have served as a reminder that al qaeda is far from defeated , and more attacks on so-called “ soft targets , ” like the hsbc headquarters in istanbul , may follow .
at the same time , the war in iraq has dragged on , and the security situation on the ground has continued to deteriorate .
all this has many wondering if further attacks and jittery markets will slow europe ’ s economic recovery .
experts are divided , but most paint a generally optimistic picture .
attacks could slow economic recovery almost immediately following the attacks on thursday , the effects were reflected in the european markets .
the eurotop 300 index of pan european blue chips was down 1.2 percent , the dj euro stoxx 1.5 percent and the frankfurt dax 1.7 percent .
on monday , following the attack on two synagogues over the weekend , the frankfurt dax suffered an even more extreme drop-off , tumbling 3.2 percent .
by friday morning , all markets had partially recovered .
among the many other factors investors now take into consideration , “ geo-political ” developments - as experts kindly term terrorist activities as well as political turbulence resulting from , say , a eu-u.s. trade war - are now considered among the most important .
but a debate persists over whether or not such developments , particularly of the terrorist variety , will spell trouble for europe ’ s economic recovery .
“ should we see a decline in confidence because of geo-political developments , that could be a problem for the economy , ” lorenzo condogno , an economist at the bank of america in london told dw-world .
“ that could actually undermine or slow down the economic recovery in europe .
most analysts stress the big picture others , however , downplay the temporary panic sparked by the attacks and emphasize the big picture , stressing that as long as other news - earnings reports and consumer confidence reports , for example - continues to be good , the recovery will remain on track .
“ these events will definitely have a temporary negative sentiment on equities and may even call into question the end of the year rally , ” hendrick garz , a european equity strategist at westlb panmure in düsseldorf told reuters .
“ but i have no doubt that we will see further equity gains if the economic news-flow continues to be positive next week , ” he added .
“ investors will definitely have these -lsb- security -rsb- topics in mind , but we are still far away from the point where they would really see this as an obstacle to investment . ”
garz is not the only expert to hold this opinion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.11.2003 opinion : high stakes for turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blasts in istanbul killed at least 27 people and injured over 400 .
istanbul was shaken by deadly terror attacks on thursday that exploded in the banking quarter and in front of the british consulate .
the international fight against terror must be intensified . whoever is behind the istanbul attacks is likely to bomb the country even deeper into a conflict it has tried to keep itself out of in recent months : during the iraq war turkey was pained by the unreserved support of u.s. policies toward iraq that was demanded of it . the turkish refusal to allow the allies to use its territory for deploying their troops severely disturbed the american plan .
and when ankara did finally offer troops to reinforce the allies , it quickly rescinded the offer out of consideration for iraqi sensitivities . consideration and reserve have been of no use to turkey .
it has become the scene of previously unknown terrorism , that strikes blindly and hits the innocent despite the fact that the actual targets are apparent : first jewish , now british facilities . sick logic and tomorrow ? in their sick logic , the people behind the attacks aim to drive a wedge between turkey and those who they deem responsible for the war in iraq - that is , americans , brits and israelis . that turkish pedestrians die vicariously , does nothing to disrupt the terrorists plan .
on the contrary , the terrorists reckon on " solidarity out of fear " turning the people 's ranks against their own government , which should discontinue all support for the united states and all cooperation with israel . but that is precisely what will not happen now .
the turkish government has been challenged by the attacks and it will not back down .
it was not prepared to in the course of the conflict with the pkk -lrb- kurdish paramilitary group -rrb- and the whole world appealed to ankara to give in .
why should it now yield when turkey has been bombed right in the middle of the anti-terror war stage and foreign countries demand pertinacity ?
there 's a lot at stake for turkey .
if it fails to position itself clearly and unambiguously against such terror , for example , skepticism and rejection of turkish rapprochement to the eu will grow , an understandable reaction perhaps , but nevertheless utterly wrong . europe 's latent terrorism europe is not threatened by a new terrorism from turkey , but rather the danger of terrorism is latently in existence in europe itself - and not just since september 11 .
volunteers from europe and from germany have supposedly gone to iraq to fight against the americans .
other like-minded people are sure to have remained in europe , and it would therefore be no surprise if bombs detonate there tomorrow . fanatics and fools are also among us .

istanbul was shaken by deadly terror attacks on thursday that exploded in the banking quarter and in front of the british consulate .
the international fight against terror must be intensified . whoever is behind the istanbul attacks is likely to bomb the country even deeper into a conflict it has tried to keep itself out of in recent months : during the iraq war turkey was pained by the unreserved support of u.s. policies toward iraq that was demanded of it . the turkish refusal to allow the allies to use its territory for deploying their troops severely disturbed the american plan .
and when ankara did finally offer troops to reinforce the allies , it quickly rescinded the offer out of consideration for iraqi sensitivities . consideration and reserve have been of no use to turkey .
it has become the scene of previously unknown terrorism , that strikes blindly and hits the innocent despite the fact that the actual targets are apparent : first jewish , now british facilities . sick logic and tomorrow ? in their sick logic , the people behind the attacks aim to drive a wedge between turkey and those who they deem responsible for the war in iraq - that is , americans , brits and israelis . that turkish pedestrians die vicariously , does nothing to disrupt the terrorists plan .
on the contrary , the terrorists reckon on " solidarity out of fear " turning the people 's ranks against their own government , which should discontinue all support for the united states and all cooperation with israel . but that is precisely what will not happen now .
the turkish government has been challenged by the attacks and it will not back down .

the international fight against terror must be intensified . whoever is behind the istanbul attacks is likely to bomb the country even deeper into a conflict it has tried to keep itself out of in recent months : during the iraq war turkey was pained by the unreserved support of u.s. policies toward iraq that was demanded of it . the turkish refusal to allow the allies to use its territory for deploying their troops severely disturbed the american plan .
and when ankara did finally offer troops to reinforce the allies , it quickly rescinded the offer out of consideration for iraqi sensitivities . consideration and reserve have been of no use to turkey .
it has become the scene of previously unknown terrorism , that strikes blindly and hits the innocent despite the fact that the actual targets are apparent : first jewish , now british facilities . sick logic and tomorrow ? in their sick logic , the people behind the attacks aim to drive a wedge between turkey and those who they deem responsible for the war in iraq - that is , americans , brits and israelis . that turkish pedestrians die vicariously , does nothing to disrupt the terrorists plan .

germany responded to the second set of bombings in istanbul with harsh words of condemnation .
but the attacks have also ignited a fresh round of debate on turkey ’ s bid to join the eu . quick to condemn thursday ’ s bombings in istanbul , german leaders across the political spectrum expressed their dismay and indignation that the turkish city on europe ’ s edge was again attacked by islamic terrorists .
german foreign policy experts regarded the blasts in downtown istanbul in front of the british consulate and the hsbc bank as yet another attempt by fundamentalists to sever ties between the western and muslim worlds .
gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats , told deutsche welle that the brutal attacks require a strong reaction from the civilized world .
" the terrorists are aiming to drive a wedge between the west and muslim countries , " he maintained , and added that the choice of turkey , a " key country " between europe and the islamic world , was deliberate for the series of attacks .
" the terrorists want to cut off the relationship between islam and the christian world , " weisskirchen said and targeted turkey because they want to send out a signal of fear to the muslims not to align themselves too closely with the west .
bolstering turkey ’ s bid for the eu it is precisely for this reason that many german politicians are arguing that it is more important than ever to support turkey 's democratization process and to aid it in its bid to join the european union as soon as possible .
social democrat interior minister otto schily told german public television zdf on thursday that germany needs to encourage dialogue between the eu and turkey with a view to giving turkey a " clear perspective " as to when and under which conditions it may join the european bloc in the future .

christian democrat union deputy parliamentary leader wolfgang bosbach addressed the fears of many in his party when he said that turkish membership in the eu would place other member countries in greater danger than they already are .
" a quick eu accession for turkey would import the terror problem to europe , " bosbach was quoted in the passauer neue presse as saying .
the cdu member also said that a muslim-dominated country does not belong in a bloc supposedly based on christian values , an argument many in the conservative party endorse .
ingo friedrich , a senior member of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , has also criticized attempts to extend the eu beyond the bosporus .
" it would n't work , " he said , " because the european union would be overstretched endangering the entire project of achieving peace and stability in europe . "
friedrich , who is also a deputy speaker of the european parliament , added that a speedy inclusion " could even intensify terrorism in turkey because islamic extremists would feel that a key muslim country is forcibly alienated from the islamic world . "
other politicians , such as werner hoyer , foreign affairs spokesman for the neo-liberal free democrats , are convinced including turkey in the eu could provide a concrete example of mutually beneficial cooperation between the western and muslim worlds and could help put an end to the talk about a clash of civilizations .
" what we have to do is to make sure that turkey remains on the western track .
it would be a real strengthening of europe if turkey stays in the western boat and that it becomes a member of the european union , " hoyer said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : high stakes for turkey istanbul was shaken by deadly terror attacks on thursday that exploded in the banking quarter and in front of the british consulate .

but the attacks have also ignited a fresh round of debate on turkey ’ s bid to join the eu . quick to condemn thursday ’ s bombings in istanbul , german leaders across the political spectrum expressed their dismay and indignation that the turkish city on europe ’ s edge was again attacked by islamic terrorists .
german foreign policy experts regarded the blasts in downtown istanbul in front of the british consulate and the hsbc bank as yet another attempt by fundamentalists to sever ties between the western and muslim worlds .
gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats , told deutsche welle that the brutal attacks require a strong reaction from the civilized world .
" the terrorists are aiming to drive a wedge between the west and muslim countries , " he maintained , and added that the choice of turkey , a " key country " between europe and the islamic world , was deliberate for the series of attacks .
" the terrorists want to cut off the relationship between islam and the christian world , " weisskirchen said and targeted turkey because they want to send out a signal of fear to the muslims not to align themselves too closely with the west .
bolstering turkey ’ s bid for the eu it is precisely for this reason that many german politicians are arguing that it is more important than ever to support turkey 's democratization process and to aid it in its bid to join the european union as soon as possible .
social democrat interior minister otto schily told german public television zdf on thursday that germany needs to encourage dialogue between the eu and turkey with a view to giving turkey a " clear perspective " as to when and under which conditions it may join the european bloc in the future .

christian democrat union deputy parliamentary leader wolfgang bosbach addressed the fears of many in his party when he said that turkish membership in the eu would place other member countries in greater danger than they already are .
" a quick eu accession for turkey would import the terror problem to europe , " bosbach was quoted in the passauer neue presse as saying .
the cdu member also said that a muslim-dominated country does not belong in a bloc supposedly based on christian values , an argument many in the conservative party endorse .
ingo friedrich , a senior member of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , has also criticized attempts to extend the eu beyond the bosporus .
" it would n't work , " he said , " because the european union would be overstretched endangering the entire project of achieving peace and stability in europe . "
friedrich , who is also a deputy speaker of the european parliament , added that a speedy inclusion " could even intensify terrorism in turkey because islamic extremists would feel that a key muslim country is forcibly alienated from the islamic world . "
other politicians , such as werner hoyer , foreign affairs spokesman for the neo-liberal free democrats , are convinced including turkey in the eu could provide a concrete example of mutually beneficial cooperation between the western and muslim worlds and could help put an end to the talk about a clash of civilizations .

chancellor gerhard schröder is in new york to promote business ties and attract greater u.s. investment .
the sales pitch ?
his planned package of reforms will get europe ’ s largest economy running smoothly again . throwing himself into the role of germany ’ s top salesman , chancellor gerhard schröder came to new york looking to strengthen u.s.-german business ties .
and as any good salesman would , he remained optimistic halfway through his short trip , despite a looming transatlantic trade war and soaring euro against the u.s. dollar . speaking at the the american institute for contemporary german studies , which was honoring citigroup chief sanford weill , schröder trumpeted his so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package of economic and welfare reforms as just what germany needed to stay competitive in the 21st century . “ we want to get our country in shape for the challenges of this decade , this century , in order to be an equal partner , ” schröder said before an audience of 500 business leaders .
“ we ’ ve realized after a period of being satisfied with ourselves that something has to change . ” schröder presented germany as on the verge of becoming a motor for reform in europe - something that could be a hard sale on either side of the atlantic , considering the country has been a drag on eu growth in recent years .
but with germany ’ s export-dependent economy growing only a meager 0.2 percent in the third quarter , schröder knows how important it is to bolster trade relations with germany ’ s second largest trading partner , the united states . amd picks dresden as if to underscore schröder ’ s case , u.s. semiconductor giant amd announced on thursday that it would build a $ 2.4 billion -lrb- € 2.0 billion -rrb- chip-making plant in the eastern city of dresden .
lured by generous government subsides , the facility will create around 1,000 jobs and will secure the state of saxony ’ s position as one of europe ’ s leading high-tech regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amd decision to pick dresden over east fishkill , new york and singapore will add to the estimated € 100 billion that u.s. investors have poured into germany .
realizing more u.s. investment could translate into more jobs for germany , which suffers chronically high unemployment , schröder will continue his business-boosting role during a lunch on friday with 17 leading u.s. executives . but the soaring euro , which has hit an all-time high against the u.s. dollar , could spoil the party for schröder and german companies , which fear the stronger currency will make their goods more expensive on world markets .
perhaps aware the euro could threaten germany ’ s export-led recovery , schröder addressed the issue in new york . “ both sides have an interest in advantageous exchange rates .
nobody has an interest in a weak dollar , ” said schröder , referring to the growing u.s. trade deficit , according to bloomberg news .
“ i don ’ t think there is an intentional weak dollar policy . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder heads to u.s. as trade war looms german chancellor gerhard schröder embarked on a two-day trip to new york on thursday to strengthen u.s.-german business ties .

germany hopes to save its scandal-plagued effort to host the olympic games in 2012 by appointing new members to the olympic committee positions left vacant by disgraced departing members . interior minister otto schily announced on wednesday that highly respected political and business leaders would take charge of leipzig 's beleaguered effort to host the 2012 summer olympics .
key figures had resigned in disgrace or were forced out after a series of scandals came to light in october . peter zühlsdorff , a former top manager at wella haircare group , will take over the chairmanship of the committee overseeing leipzig ’ s bid .
schily described zühlsdorff as a “ patriot of practice , ” and suggested that - unlike his predecessor - he would neither be tempted to use the position for personal gain nor would questions about his past come back to haunt him - or the olympic bid . the same criteria seems to have gone into the selection of the former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher , who will take over the position as chairman of the supervisory board .
former baden-württemberg premier lothar späth and businessman arend oetker will occupy other positions on the supervisory board . in addition , a report was released that clears leipzig mayor wolfgang tiefensee and saxon premier georg milbrant of any wrongdoing related to financial irregularities in the olympic bid . having cleaned house , interior minister schily said he hoped the committee can now get down to business .
“ we have drawn a line under everything that has happened , ” he said . heads roll ' everything ' began in october .
then , dirk thärichen , who had headed committee overseeing the bid and was considered close to leipzig mayor tiefensee , resigned after it was revealed that he had had ties to the east german secret police , the stasi .
burkhard jung , a supervisory board member , was forced out after allegations surfaced that he had taken illegal commission payments worth more than € 150,000 -lrb- $ 171,400 -rrb- .
tiefensee 's state secretary , wolfram köhler , was forced to retire after he came under fire for allegedly paying his wife high commissions for helping to find financial sponsors while he was the mayor of the town of riesa . rostock too , which would host the olympic sailing competition if the bid is successful , has not been free of scandals either .
harald lochotzke , the chairman of the city 's olympic marketing committee , also resigned over allegations of involvement with the stasi and complicity in a number of financial irregularities .
tough work ahead zühlsdorff and company will have their work cut out for them in order to revive a bid that was considered a long shot from the start .
though leipzig seems to have come out of nowhere to secure the position as germany ’ s official candidate to host the 2012 olympics , it still needs to fend off tough competition from other cities , including paris and new york .
plus , after being forced to face its own demons over the bribery scandal in conjunction with salt lake city winning the 2002 winter games , the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- may be reluctant to choose leipzig .
german olympic committee head walther tröger though , said leipzig 's chances had n't been diminished .

germany hopes to save its scandal-plagued effort to host the olympic games in 2012 by appointing new members to the olympic committee positions left vacant by disgraced departing members . interior minister otto schily announced on wednesday that highly respected political and business leaders would take charge of leipzig 's beleaguered effort to host the 2012 summer olympics .
key figures had resigned in disgrace or were forced out after a series of scandals came to light in october . peter zühlsdorff , a former top manager at wella haircare group , will take over the chairmanship of the committee overseeing leipzig ’ s bid .
schily described zühlsdorff as a “ patriot of practice , ” and suggested that - unlike his predecessor - he would neither be tempted to use the position for personal gain nor would questions about his past come back to haunt him - or the olympic bid . the same criteria seems to have gone into the selection of the former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher , who will take over the position as chairman of the supervisory board .
former baden-württemberg premier lothar späth and businessman arend oetker will occupy other positions on the supervisory board . in addition , a report was released that clears leipzig mayor wolfgang tiefensee and saxon premier georg milbrant of any wrongdoing related to financial irregularities in the olympic bid . having cleaned house , interior minister schily said he hoped the committee can now get down to business .
“ we have drawn a line under everything that has happened , ” he said . heads roll ' everything ' began in october .
then , dirk thärichen , who had headed committee overseeing the bid and was considered close to leipzig mayor tiefensee , resigned after it was revealed that he had had ties to the east german secret police , the stasi .
burkhard jung , a supervisory board member , was forced out after allegations surfaced that he had taken illegal commission payments worth more than € 150,000 -lrb- $ 171,400 -rrb- .
tiefensee 's state secretary , wolfram köhler , was forced to retire after he came under fire for allegedly paying his wife high commissions for helping to find financial sponsors while he was the mayor of the town of riesa . rostock too , which would host the olympic sailing competition if the bid is successful , has not been free of scandals either .
harald lochotzke , the chairman of the city 's olympic marketing committee , also resigned over allegations of involvement with the stasi and complicity in a number of financial irregularities .
tough work ahead zühlsdorff and company will have their work cut out for them in order to revive a bid that was considered a long shot from the start .
though leipzig seems to have come out of nowhere to secure the position as germany ’ s official candidate to host the 2012 olympics , it still needs to fend off tough competition from other cities , including paris and new york .
plus , after being forced to face its own demons over the bribery scandal in conjunction with salt lake city winning the 2002 winter games , the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- may be reluctant to choose leipzig .
german olympic committee head walther tröger though , said leipzig 's chances had n't been diminished .

istanbul was rocked by two explosions on thursday , only days after twin suicide bombings against jewish targets in the turkish city .
meanwhile , germany ’ s intelligence service warned islamic terrorism may be on the rise . at least 26 people have died and more than 400 were injured in the blasts , which damaged the british consulate and the headquarters of the hsbc bank in istanbul . the british consul was among the confirmed dead .
british foreign secretary jack straw said the explosions bore all the signs of attacks by the al qaeda islamic terrorist network . " it ’ s too early to say who carried out these attacks , but they have every hallmark of al qaeda , " straw told the british house of commons .
" a number of british and turkish and other people have died .
a number of the british consulate staff are still unaccounted for . " apparently the bombings against british targets were timed to coincide with u.s. president george bush 's visit to britain .
both bush and british prime minister tony blair condemned the attacks on thursday . " someone wants to convey a very clear message that will go out not only to britain but to the united states , " gustav lindstrom at the institute of security studies in paris told reuters .
" many people will read into this a connection with britain 's effort in iraq and its special relationship to the united states . " the bombings on thursday come less than a week after other deadly terrorist attacks in istanbul .
on saturday , two trucks packed with homemade explosives detonated outside the beit israel and neve shalom synagogues in istanbul , killing 26 people and wounding hundreds more . the head of germany ’ s intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- on wednesday warned the first attacks in istanbul showed international terrorism was on the rise again . european radicals being recruited speaking to germany ’ s ard television , bnd director august hanning also said that islamic radicals were currently being recruited from all over europe to join the fight against u.s.-led occupying forces in iraq .
he said that the increasing violence in iraq could also evolve into the kind of guerilla warfare endured by the former soviet union in afghanistan during the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : august hanning “ there are reports of recruiting going on in europe , especially in countries such as britain and bosnia , ” said hanning .
“ we also have evidence that islamic radicals living in germany have already left for iraq . ” on average , the coalition forces in iraq have to endure almost 30 attacks per day and hanning said there was evidence that some of these attacks are being professionally masterminded by members of osama bin laden ’ s al qaeda terrorist network . hanning said german intelligence still believes there was no link in pre-war iraq between the regime of saddam hussein and al qaeda , but added that the country was quickly becoming a focal point for the group ’ s jihad against western civilization .
in a statement issued from aboard a plane en route to the united states , german chancellor gerhard schröder condemned the bombings .
" the attacks do n't only target turkey and britain ... but also our form of state , society and living , our basic values like democracy , freedom and human rights .
thus , the attacks hurt us all . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de istanbul blasts trigger debate about eu membership germany responded to the second set of bombings in istanbul with harsh words of condemnation .

atomic energy regulators from europe and washington disagree on measures against iran for its potential development of nuclear arms .
talks will continue next week , after negotiators failed to find a compromise this week . the members of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the u.n. 's nuclear watchdog , are n't expected to pass a resolution on iran 's nuclear program until next week at the earliest .
instead , european and u.s. diplomats continue to struggle to reach a compromise , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei said friday . it will be " some time " until they come to an agreement , elbaradei said . the iaea governors meeting , which began on thursday , was originally meant to come to an end on friday .
but the 35-nation board of governors plans to meet again on wednesday , spokeswoman melissa fleming announced . the discord revolves around how strongly iran should be censured for its nuclear program .
a recent iaea report said that iran had not complied with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- over the past two decades .
but elbaradei 's report also said there was no evidence that tehran was conducting a secret nuclear weapons program . iran has admitted to failing to disclose uranium enrichment activities and plants . u.s. wants sanctions the united states says iran 's past actions regarding inspections of its nuclear program indicates it is working towards developing nuclear arms .
american officials say they want the iaea to find iran in breach of the npt , which would allow the u.n. security council to impose sanctions . britain , france and germany had first proposed a draft resolution that rebuked iran for " failures to meet safeguards obligations , " but praised the country for cooperating with the iaea .
the draft was rejected by washington , which said the wording was too mild . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian foreign minister kamal kharrazi -lrb- left -rrb- talks with german foreign minister joschka fischer during an official meeting in tehran in late october , 2003 .
the " big three " european countries had won key concessions from iran to cooperate with the iaea when its foreign ministers visited tehran in october .
now they fear the threat of sanctions could push iran to break the agreements that include permitting snap inspections and suspending uranium enrichment . big three under fire but they are also reaping criticism from their european allies .
according to reuters , diplomats from other european states have complained that britain , france and germany have designated themselves eu spokesmen , but they do n't represent the views of the entire bloc . iran denies that it is working on developing nuclear weapons , insisting its program is geared solely toward generating power and is civilian in nature . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu and us clash on iran nuclear question tuesday 's meeting between eu foreign ministers and u.s. secretary of state colin powell showed a spirit of reconciliation after the divisions over iraq .

atomic energy regulators from europe and washington disagree on measures against iran for its potential development of nuclear arms .
talks will continue next week , after negotiators failed to find a compromise this week . the members of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the u.n. 's nuclear watchdog , are n't expected to pass a resolution on iran 's nuclear program until next week at the earliest .
instead , european and u.s. diplomats continue to struggle to reach a compromise , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei said friday . it will be " some time " until they come to an agreement , elbaradei said . the iaea governors meeting , which began on thursday , was originally meant to come to an end on friday .
but the 35-nation board of governors plans to meet again on wednesday , spokeswoman melissa fleming announced . the discord revolves around how strongly iran should be censured for its nuclear program .
a recent iaea report said that iran had not complied with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- over the past two decades .

american officials say they want the iaea to find iran in breach of the npt , which would allow the u.n. security council to impose sanctions . britain , france and germany had first proposed a draft resolution that rebuked iran for " failures to meet safeguards obligations , " but praised the country for cooperating with the iaea .
the draft was rejected by washington , which said the wording was too mild . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian foreign minister kamal kharrazi -lrb- left -rrb- talks with german foreign minister joschka fischer during an official meeting in tehran in late october , 2003 .

now they fear the threat of sanctions could push iran to break the agreements that include permitting snap inspections and suspending uranium enrichment . big three under fire but they are also reaping criticism from their european allies .
according to reuters , diplomats from other european states have complained that britain , france and germany have designated themselves eu spokesmen , but they do n't represent the views of the entire bloc . iran denies that it is working on developing nuclear weapons , insisting its program is geared solely toward generating power and is civilian in nature . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu and us clash on iran nuclear question tuesday 's meeting between eu foreign ministers and u.s. secretary of state colin powell showed a spirit of reconciliation after the divisions over iraq .

the malaysian car maker proton is in talks to buy a 50 % stake in the italian superbike maker mv agusta , according to a proton official .
the two companies have entered a three month period during which they will explore whether a deal is desirable , proton 's roger mercer told bbc news online .
" my understanding is that mv agusta is in -lsb- controlled -rsb- administration at the moment , so no wonder that they are looking for a controlling partner , " he said .
under italian law , being in controlled administration means mv agusta 's future is guaranteed for four years , during which time suppliers can continue delivering parts without fear that they will not get paid , according to its uk importer david perceval , import sales manager , three cross motorcycles .
ferrari engine mv agusta is remaining tight-lipped about any potential deal , according mr perceval .
proton , which already owns lotus , clearly likes sporty europeans " but having a large backer like that would obviously be a good thing . "
" the company needs a more secure financial situation , " mr perceval said .
" it has eminently sellable products , demand constantly outstrips supply . "
mv agusta , whose stunning italian designer bike , the £ 12,500 f4 1000 , is on show at the birmingham motorcycle & scooter show at the moment , is already linked with the car industry .
the motorcycle 's 166bhp engine has been developed by the car maker ferrari .
asian market proton is keen to develop closer links with mv agusta and its husqvarna and cagiva brands .
these might be ideally suited to help the car maker diversify into motorcycles , to take advantage of an anticipated sharp rise in demand in asia where , as a rule , supply is very limited when compared with europe and the us .
in the uk , for example , motorcycle buyers can chose between up to 250 different models , while in some countries in asia there are less than a handful of different bikes on offer , an official from a japanese bike builder explained .
sporty proton already owns the british sports car and engineering company lotus .
the car maker is taking full advantage of lotus ' technical expertise and bold design skills , while offering cash injections aplenty in return .
lotus is deeply involved in the development of all of proton 's cars , said mr mercer .

the malaysian car maker proton is in talks to buy a 50 % stake in the italian superbike maker mv agusta , according to a proton official .
the two companies have entered a three month period during which they will explore whether a deal is desirable , proton 's roger mercer told bbc news online .
" my understanding is that mv agusta is in -lsb- controlled -rsb- administration at the moment , so no wonder that they are looking for a controlling partner , " he said .
under italian law , being in controlled administration means mv agusta 's future is guaranteed for four years , during which time suppliers can continue delivering parts without fear that they will not get paid , according to its uk importer david perceval , import sales manager , three cross motorcycles .
ferrari engine mv agusta is remaining tight-lipped about any potential deal , according mr perceval .
proton , which already owns lotus , clearly likes sporty europeans " but having a large backer like that would obviously be a good thing . "
" the company needs a more secure financial situation , " mr perceval said .
" it has eminently sellable products , demand constantly outstrips supply . "
mv agusta , whose stunning italian designer bike , the £ 12,500 f4 1000 , is on show at the birmingham motorcycle & scooter show at the moment , is already linked with the car industry .
the motorcycle 's 166bhp engine has been developed by the car maker ferrari .
asian market proton is keen to develop closer links with mv agusta and its husqvarna and cagiva brands .
these might be ideally suited to help the car maker diversify into motorcycles , to take advantage of an anticipated sharp rise in demand in asia where , as a rule , supply is very limited when compared with europe and the us .
in the uk , for example , motorcycle buyers can chose between up to 250 different models , while in some countries in asia there are less than a handful of different bikes on offer , an official from a japanese bike builder explained .
sporty proton already owns the british sports car and engineering company lotus .
the car maker is taking full advantage of lotus ' technical expertise and bold design skills , while offering cash injections aplenty in return .
lotus is deeply involved in the development of all of proton 's cars , said mr mercer .

amnesty international said that scotland has seen an improved welcome for immigrants but believes there are still issues to address .
the booklet , which has been backed by the scottish refugee council , covers the numbers of asylum seekers in the uk , their rights and the problems they face .
amnesty international said it hoped to improve debate , promote analysis and change public perceptions .

it shows that there are currently about 12,000 asylum seekers across scotland , with individuals receiving about 70 % of the support and benefits of the average uk citizen .
it also highlights issues of falling birth rates and increasing skills shortages north of the border , problems which the scottish executive has pledged to address .
the executive has already put forward proposals to try and attract more skilled immigrants and international students to scotland .
sally daghlian , the scottish refugee council 's chief executive said : " as a charity that supports refugees and asylum seekers we have a duty to ensure that the relevant facts are in the public domain and readily available .
" this guide provides a wide range of information and also the necessary contacts to access further information on asylum issues . "

the free trade agreement of the americas - due to come into effect in 2005 - is a key us economic goal .
a summit on the issue has been taking place all week in miami , florida .
there had been fears the talks might collapse amid disagreements between brazil and the us but the deal actually came a day earlier than expected .
it does n't guarantee an agreement , but it creates the condition for an agreement celso amorim brazilian foreign minister but the trade ministers of the 34 states involved agreed to a proposal announced by the us and brazilian delegations earlier in the week which allows countries to opt in or out of certain clauses .
the ftaa will cover 800 million people with an output of $ 14 trillion a year .
" we still have a lot of substantial issues to discuss and they are not easy , " said brazilian foreign minister celso amorim .
" but what we decided was to pursue a course that will make it possible , creates the conditions to come to an agreement .
it does n't guarantee an agreement , but it creates the condition for an agreement . "
compromise brazil and the us drew up their " menu " approach to the ftaa as a way of overcoming their deep disagreements on how comprehensive the accord should be .
all the americas except cuba are at the summit this went against what many of the other countries meeting in miami wanted - that is , an all-embracing deal dropping tariffs and trade barriers across the twin continents .
however , america 's farmers , not to mention powerful voices in the unions , wanted to limit the agreement 's scope and us president george w bush was reluctant to push the issue with an election due in less than a year .
the location of the talks , in the key electoral battleground of florida , highlights the importance of the thousands of us citrus farmers whose livelihoods could be threatened if they lose their lucrative subsidies .
in any case , the bush administration 's early enthusiasm for the ftaa has waned as its war on terror and particularly the situation in iraq has dominated its attention .
brazil , for its part , wanted farm access badly and was a leader of the developing-nation moves at the global trade talks in cancun in september , which blocked us and european attempts to push forward their own agenda .
but it was prepared to leave farm talks for a fresh global round as long as the us did not push too hard for access to brazil 's financial services and technology markets .
protests anti-globalisation protesters clashed with police in miami on thursday during the summit .
at least three people were arrested as riot police used tear gas to disperse a crowd in front of the hotel where the ministers had gathered .
while ministers from 34 of the 35 countries in the americas - all except cuba - debated the proposal at the intercontinental hotel , the protesters were marching outside .
police estimated the number of demonstrators at about 1,000 and described them as well organised .

when fully operational , the north hoyle windfarm will be capable of producing enough power for 50,000 homes .
thirty wind turbines standing more than 40m high have been built four to five miles off the coast .
there has been surprisingly little opposition to the project compared with the experience of windfarms in other parts .
electricity from two turbines will enter the national grid , with the rest being commissioned over the next few months .
project operators national wind power have invested £ 70m in the project , and the switch-on represents an important day for them .
the government is aiming for more schemes like this one to take the strain of generating electricity for the uk .
it has a target of producing 10 % of the uk 's energy from renewable sources by 2010 .
now eco-minded residents can pay their electricity bills direct to a company which has set up a joint venture with environmental campaign group greenpeace . "
we have considerable natural resources in wales , both on land and at sea " andrew davies am the assembly economic development minister , andrew davies , said : this is a very exciting time for the renewable energy sector in wales .
" the start of electricity generation at north hoyle marks the beginning of a serious , mainstream approach to renewable power development offshore and provides a significant contribution to our renewable energy targets " we have considerable natural resources in wales , both on land and at sea .
" i very much hope that we can develop indigenous , home-grown industries to serve this growing sector and maximise the benefits for the welsh economy and environment .
speaking earlier this year , stephen tindale from greenpeace commented : " this pioneering windfarm will lead the way towards ... bigger developments in uk waters that we so urgently need to help tackle global warming " " the first turbine installed at north hoyle represents a crucial milestone on the road to clean energy in the uk . "
national windpower also has planning consent to build a second offshore windfarm at rhyl flats near abergele .
a spokeswoman said they are still discussing how best to take the project forward .

the scottish federation of housing associations is calling for twice as many new homes to be built than the scottish executive is committed to providing .
currently almost a quarter of a million scots are on local authority waiting lists and more new applicants are coming forward than are currently being re-housed .
last year alone , 17,000 public sector homes were sold through the right to buy scheme but the scottish executive is committed to building only 5,000 such houses a year .
the federation said recent legislation meant that , by 2012 , local authorities would be required to provide all homeless people with a roof over their heads .
the real issue here is that the funding for new homes has fallen , while demand has risen david orr but it claims that without affordable social housing available , councils will not be able to meet their commitments .
federation chief executive david orr said : " the real issue here is that the funding for new homes has fallen , while demand has risen .
" if we were investing the same amount in new build as we were in 1995 , we would be building an extra 2,500 homes every year .
" that would go a long way to meet the problems we are going to be facing very shortly . "
however deputy housing minister mary mulligan told bbc radio scotland : " it 's not just about a roof over people 's heads , there are complexities that need to be looked at such as the kind of housing required , the size , the type , where it should be and what different needs people have .
" there are new houses being built but what we need to do is make sure that they are in the right place , that they are the right size for a family and that they are of the right quality - these are the issues that the executive is trying to address . "

cuba 's position in the developing world has always been something of a paradox .
not all tourists to cuba want sun and sand its low material living standards and crisis-ridden economy leads to a low per capita income , but president fidel castro 's caribbean blend of socialism has developed a public health system that places cuba in another league altogether on human development indexes .
basic health indicators are comparable to the achievements of welfare systems in western europe .
education , science and health , the cornerstone of the 1959 revolution , are closely linked together in cuba 's development of an advanced medical sector .
the export of pharmaceutical products , vaccines and biotechnology helps to pay for the growing costs of funding medical research and a free health system with comprehensive coverage .
today the medical sector ranks sixth in terms of exports and services , providing the country with vitally needed foreign exchange that was worth $ 250m a year in 2002 .
out of that figure biotechnology alone accounted for more than $ 150m .
vaccines in the 1980s millions of dollars were invested by the cuban government in developing modern vaccines laboratories and a massive centre for biotechnology .
cuba has invested millions in developing vaccines since the end of soviet aid in 1989 , and the acute economic crisis of the 1990s , cuba has seen the excellence of its medico-scientific institutions as a strategic resource for developing new medical products for export .
the country 's first breakthrough in medical research was its discovery and patenting of meningitis-b vaccine in late 1980s .
it has been successfully exported to cope with epidemics in south american countries including brazil and argentina .
the vaccine has now been licensed to glaxosmithkline who will now market it in europe and it is hoped eventually in the usa .
political obstacles cuba 's attempts to gain a foothold in the international pharmaceutical market have come up against formidable obstacles , both commercial and political , with the stringent us trade embargo .
castro has gambled on developing the medical sector this socialist island 's strength has been in the quality of its products , not in marketing and export know-how .
during the last few years the biggest earner for cuban biotechnology has been the export of hepatitis-b vaccine to more than 30 countries .
the cuban vaccine is widely regarded as the more effective than belgian and us-produced vaccines .
cuba maybe judged poor by material living standards , but its medical sector is a strong demonstration of its wealth in human resources .
joint ventures with china , india and russia have been established to set up vaccine plants in their countries based on a transfer of cuban technology .
health tourism another growing source of income is health tourism , with a number of specialist hospitals , clinics , health spas and resorts catering to foreign visitors .
many patients travel to cuba for treatment last year more than 5000 foreign patients travelled to cuba for a wide range of treatments including eye-surgery , neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis and parkinson 's ' disease , and orthopaedics .
most patients are from latin america .
however the unique cuban treatment for retinitis pigmentosa , often known as night blindness , has attracted many patients from europe and north america , health tourism generates revenues of around $ 40m a year .
more than 500 different medical products are manufactured by the pharmaceutical industry , which during the1980s provided 80 % of domestic needs .
now most supplies of raw materials for the manufacture of antibiotics and other drugs are sourced from china , but production still has not recovered to pre-1990s levels .
many drugs are supplied to hospitals by international aid from cuba solidarity groups around the world .
joint ventures the special obstacles to cuba breaking into the western market have led to a policy of trying to find joint venture partners , which currently include a canadian , german and a spanish company .
cuba 's cutting-edge products for neck and breast cancer have caused the biggest stir in the world of biotechnology .
they have just been licensed to a german pharmaceutical company , with rights to develop the drug theracim h-r3 for the european market .
analysts say so far the commercial rewards for cuba 's many medical innovations have only been a fraction of their potential .
but if theracim h-r3 receives regulatory approval , it could become a standard cancer treatment in europe in four or five years , with estimated sales of around $ 3bn a year .
in the long-term , fidel castro 's big gamble with the heavy state investment in biotechnology may finally pay a dividend not only in health benefits , but also in the top-notch economic rewards that have so far eluded him .
it would also be a very satisfying for cuban scientists to feel their research and development , which is not driven by the profit motive , had been successful in the world marketplace .

not all tourists to cuba want sun and sand its low material living standards and crisis-ridden economy leads to a low per capita income , but president fidel castro 's caribbean blend of socialism has developed a public health system that places cuba in another league altogether on human development indexes .
basic health indicators are comparable to the achievements of welfare systems in western europe .
education , science and health , the cornerstone of the 1959 revolution , are closely linked together in cuba 's development of an advanced medical sector .
the export of pharmaceutical products , vaccines and biotechnology helps to pay for the growing costs of funding medical research and a free health system with comprehensive coverage .
today the medical sector ranks sixth in terms of exports and services , providing the country with vitally needed foreign exchange that was worth $ 250m a year in 2002 .
out of that figure biotechnology alone accounted for more than $ 150m .
vaccines in the 1980s millions of dollars were invested by the cuban government in developing modern vaccines laboratories and a massive centre for biotechnology .
cuba has invested millions in developing vaccines since the end of soviet aid in 1989 , and the acute economic crisis of the 1990s , cuba has seen the excellence of its medico-scientific institutions as a strategic resource for developing new medical products for export .
the country 's first breakthrough in medical research was its discovery and patenting of meningitis-b vaccine in late 1980s .
it has been successfully exported to cope with epidemics in south american countries including brazil and argentina .
the vaccine has now been licensed to glaxosmithkline who will now market it in europe and it is hoped eventually in the usa .
political obstacles cuba 's attempts to gain a foothold in the international pharmaceutical market have come up against formidable obstacles , both commercial and political , with the stringent us trade embargo .
castro has gambled on developing the medical sector this socialist island 's strength has been in the quality of its products , not in marketing and export know-how .
during the last few years the biggest earner for cuban biotechnology has been the export of hepatitis-b vaccine to more than 30 countries .
the cuban vaccine is widely regarded as the more effective than belgian and us-produced vaccines .
cuba maybe judged poor by material living standards , but its medical sector is a strong demonstration of its wealth in human resources .
joint ventures with china , india and russia have been established to set up vaccine plants in their countries based on a transfer of cuban technology .
health tourism another growing source of income is health tourism , with a number of specialist hospitals , clinics , health spas and resorts catering to foreign visitors .
many patients travel to cuba for treatment last year more than 5000 foreign patients travelled to cuba for a wide range of treatments including eye-surgery , neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis and parkinson 's ' disease , and orthopaedics .
most patients are from latin america .
however the unique cuban treatment for retinitis pigmentosa , often known as night blindness , has attracted many patients from europe and north america , health tourism generates revenues of around $ 40m a year .
more than 500 different medical products are manufactured by the pharmaceutical industry , which during the1980s provided 80 % of domestic needs .
now most supplies of raw materials for the manufacture of antibiotics and other drugs are sourced from china , but production still has not recovered to pre-1990s levels .
many drugs are supplied to hospitals by international aid from cuba solidarity groups around the world .
joint ventures the special obstacles to cuba breaking into the western market have led to a policy of trying to find joint venture partners , which currently include a canadian , german and a spanish company .
cuba 's cutting-edge products for neck and breast cancer have caused the biggest stir in the world of biotechnology .
they have just been licensed to a german pharmaceutical company , with rights to develop the drug theracim h-r3 for the european market .
analysts say so far the commercial rewards for cuba 's many medical innovations have only been a fraction of their potential .
but if theracim h-r3 receives regulatory approval , it could become a standard cancer treatment in europe in four or five years , with estimated sales of around $ 3bn a year .
in the long-term , fidel castro 's big gamble with the heavy state investment in biotechnology may finally pay a dividend not only in health benefits , but also in the top-notch economic rewards that have so far eluded him .
it would also be a very satisfying for cuban scientists to feel their research and development , which is not driven by the profit motive , had been successful in the world marketplace .

the statement by more than 30 european and us groups urges manufacturers and retailers to agree on a voluntary moratorium on the tagging consumer items until " a formal technology assessment process involving all stakeholders , including consumers , can take place " .
it added : " some uses of rfid technology are inappropriate in a free society , and should be flatly prohibited .

editor piers morgan said the paper had done the queen a favour by exposing " the most serious security breach ever " .
mirror writer ryan parry got a job as a footman at buckingham palace with a false reference , and has been regaling readers with details about palace life .
the queen was granted an injunction on any further details , after she said he had broken a confidentiality agreement .
mr morgan said : " the fact is that the daily mirror , by common consent , has exposed the most serious security breach ever involving the royal family .
" we have acted at all times in the public interest and have been completely open about the subterfuge we deployed , and why we deployed it . "
i hope that over time the royal household will realise that ryan parry has done them a massive favour in highlighting this devastating lapse in their security system " piers morgan daily mirror editor " terrorists are not renowned for their honesty in filling in application forms for jobs like this .
" i hope that over time the royal household will realise that ryan parry has done them a massive favour in highlighting this devastating lapse in their security system . "
mr parry 's identity was revealed by the paper the same day us president george bush arrived in the uk for a state visit .
mr bush has been staying in buckingham palace , and the mirror showed pictures of the bedroom used by mr bush and his wife .
other pictures included photos of the queen 's breakfast table , complete with tupperware boxes of cereal , the earl and countess of wessex 's suite and the duke of york 's bedroom .
' flagrant breach ' the injunction , which applies to all the media , was granted on thursday until monday afternoon , to give mirror lawyers a chance to prepare their case for a full hearing .
david pannick qc , representing the attorney general for the queen , told mr justice lewison the palace was seeking an injunction because of the " flagrant breach " of a contractual obligation to maintain confidentiality .
he said mr parry had signed a confidentiality clause when he took the job , undertaking not to reveal to any unauthorised person " any information whatsoever whether of an official of personal nature " concerning any member of the royal family or royal household , unless authorised to do so .
he also said the personal nature of the details published were " obvious and unjustified intrusions " of privacy .
a buckingham palace spokeswoman later said : " we sought this injunction in order to protect personal privacy and we are satisfied with the progress made this afternoon . "
former royal spokesman dickie arbiter told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " they can not do all the checks .
" they go onto the police and the security services and you have got to ask yourself , ' how good are those checks ? " '
any " serious check " would have exposed parry as a reporter , mr arbiter told today .
the mirror had " done the palace a favour " by revealing a " very serious flaw " in its employment process , he added .
" but it has gone beyond that .
" it has become an invasion of privacy . "
pictures of bedrooms are not in the public interest " former royal spokesman dickie arbiter " the queen can quite justifiably say , ' i have been burgled .
" ' my privacy has been stolen . '
" pictures of the breakfast table are not in the public interest .
" pictures of bedrooms are not in the public interest . "
mr parry says he got the job after responding to an advertisement on a recruitment page of the buckingham palace official website .
on his cv , he left out any mention of his journalistic career and included one fake reference and a real one , the newspaper claimed .
an inquiry has been set up by the home secretary to look into palace security , and is expected to give its interim findings before christmas .

a huge amount of cash has been dedicated to the cause , but money can not buy the workers so desperately needed .
it 's 5am in gaborone and people are already queuing outside the gates of the princess marina hospital .
the hospital 's waiting rooms and corridors will be filled to bursting point until the doors close again at the end of the day .
staff admit they can not treat anyone else .
this hospital is dispatching drugs and advice to more than 6,000 people , making it the largest treatment centre for hiv or aids in the world .
many have presumed that money - or the lack of it - has been the main obstacle to distributing the drugs that are so desperately needed .
but here the crunch has come because of a lack of workers .
" we 're extremely busy , every day , all the time .
no matter how many patients you see the workload is unending , " says ava avalos , one of the doctors at the hospital .
" we 're in desperate need for more staff on every level : we need doctors , nurses , administrators , counsellors , social workers . "
' in denial ' the problem is about to get worse as the drugs distribution programme is rolled out to new areas of the country . "
if we fail i think there will be little hope for the rest of africa " dr howard moffat hospital superintendent at the moment , achap - a partnership between pharmaceutical giant merck , the bill and melinda gates foundation and the botswana government - has six treatment centres but it desperately needs to better serve rural communities .
" the skills shortage is much wider than healthcare workers .
we need people who can manage the centres , do the finances and put forward budget proposals , " says achap 's brad ryder .
there is another , sadder reason why the problem is becoming more acute .
hospital superintendent howard moffat confirms that many health workers have been living in denial when faced with the virus they spend their days treating - and some are being lost to aids .
botswana 's aids fund government $ 70m / year gates foundation $ 10m / year merck foundation $ 10m / year as the so-called " death phase " of the aids pandemic takes hold , there are casualties amongst almost all public sector workforces , including teachers , the police , and bureaucrats .
the government is desperately negotiating with china and cuba to get more doctors , but existing staff are simultaneously being lured away by agencies in the west .
last year , botswana lost 120 of its nurses to the uk .
not daring to take the test the net result is that , despite the huge amount of money being dedicated to the cause , progress is happening more slowly than had been expected .
35 % of botswana 's 1.8m people are living with hiv more than 90 % do not know their status 9,000 are on treatment 14,500 are enrolled for treatment " we thought that by offering drugs for free we would achieve more .
no doubt we are saving lives , but it 's not the percentage we wanted , " says ibou thior , project director at the harvard aids institute in gaborone .
mr thior , alongside other experts , points to the " chronic shortage of manpower in the system " , but he also blames the enormous stigma that still exists despite an extremely aggressive information campaign .
" the biggest challenge for the country is that people are not going for testing , " mr thior says .
explicit , eye-catching posters are everywhere - from bus stops to government buildings - likening hiv to fatal car crashes or showing boxing gloves being unable to punch through condoms .
the foreign minister says he has been instructed to highlight the fight against aids at every public speech .
and president festus mogae - who regularly warns that his people face extinction - himself publicly took an hiv test and declared his status -lrb- negative -rrb- .
despite this enormous effort , 90 % or more of the population have still not dared to take the test .
death sentence " people wo n't agree to be tested when they think the doctor ca n't fix you , " explains louis nchindo , managing director of debswana diamond company , itself involved in trying to persuade staff to get tested .
" the philosophy is : ' if you 've got a death sentence , what 's the point in knowing it ? " '
there are ongoing discussions about the ethics of routinely testing for hiv .
however , the real need is to combat the fear and convince people they can have a meaningful life while living with hiv .
dr moffat at the princess marina hospital says that people delay confronting the truth to such an extent that some are brought in when it 's already too late .
each day , a handful of patients will be brought into the marina 's waiting room on stretchers .
those who have waited so long are a significant drain on resources .
pan-african implications up to 10 healthy patients could be given drugs and counselling during the time needed to cope with one patient in intensive care .
as the battle goes on , the international donor community and other african countries are watching closely to assess botswana 's success .
dr howard moffat is optimistic that the battle will eventually be won .
the race to train more staff is already underway , with a medical school under construction in gaborone and almost 1,000 health care workers having been trained at the harvard aids institute .
but he is also conscious of the implications for the rest of africa if botswana - with all the money it has in relation to a relatively small population - can not find a way to manage the virus .
the government - one of the richest in africa thanks to huge diamond resources - has set aside $ 70m a year to tackle the disease , while it has also won an unprecedented level of support from the private sector .
" we have no choice , with all the benefits that we have and all the resources that we have been given , we have to succeed , " he says .
" if we fail i think there will be little hope for the rest of africa , " he warns .
