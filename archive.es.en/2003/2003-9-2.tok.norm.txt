the decision by the dutch government to legalize cannabis prescriptions for patients suffering from serious illnesses has aroused the interest of countries in europe and beyond . in a move that raised few eyebrows in the netherlands and caused other countries around the world to turn their curiosity and interest towards the liberal european nation , the dutch government legalized the medical use of cannabis on monday , paving the way for doctors to prescribe the narcotic as a painkiller for those who are seriously ill . the decision to permit cannabis for the relief of symptoms related to the treatment of terminal cancer , aids and hiv , and for patients with multiple sclerosis or tourette 's syndrome , is the latest in a list of pioneering social reforms in the netherlands . however , whereas the dutch decisions to legalize euthanasia and sell cannabis for recreational use in licensed coffee shops caused controversy in the international arena , the move to permit cannabis for medical purposes has attracted the attention of other countries that have been considering similar initiatives - especially in europe .
all eyes on holland the dutch health ministry says it has already fielded calls for progress reports from officials in germany , britain , belgium and luxembourg .
britain announced plans to begin testing cannabis for medical purposes earlier this year with the possibility of the government making it legal for doctors to prescribe their patients starting in 2004 if tests prove conclusive .
germany already legally provides patients with oral pills and liquids , such as the pharmaceutically manufactured products marinol and nabilone , which contain tetrahydrocannabinol -lrb- thc -rrb- , one of the active compounds found in cannabis .
according to dr. franjo grotenherman from the international association for cannabis as medicine -lrb- iacm -rrb- , the german government agreed in 1999 to work on creating a formula for a cannabis extract that could be used as a medical treatment .
the government passed the responsibility for developing the formula to the german pharmaceutical association , which announced two months ago that their work was complete .
“ but now the winds have changed , ” dr. grotenherman told deutsche welle .
“ at the time of the agreement on the formula , we had a green party minister in health , now the minister is from the spd and is a little more sceptical . ”
dr. grotenherman added that the process had now slowed down even after the bundestag voted in support of developing cannabis for medical use in 2001 .
the dutch move may now grease the wheels , he hoped .
a report in 2002 by the vienna-based international narcotics control board -lrb- incb -rrb- suggested that decisions by italy , luxembourg , portugal and spain to decriminalize the drug could also open up possibilities for developing cannabis for medical use .
us , canada and australia monitoring elsewhere in the world , the duitch experience will be carefully monitored parts of the united states , australia and canada that began to sell and distribute marijuana for medical use in july were all considering following suit and prescribing the drug through medical sources .
federal law has made it difficult for american states to implement medical marijuana laws .
in california , where the drug could be legally used for medical purposes , federal prosecutors used national laws to convict professionals involved in prescribing or supplying cannabis .
the dutch decision came after extensive tests on the medical benefits of the drug that began in 1996 .
there has yet to be any concrete evidence of physiological change from using the drug in its medical form , but research shows certain alleviating effects in patients .
" there is no scientific proof that it works , " said a health ministry spokesman , " but repeated use indicates that an effect does exist . "
claims of effectiveness cannabis is claimed to be effective in reducing nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy , of reducing tension in glaucoma patients and in improving the appetite of those suffering from hiv and aids .
it is also said to be effective in treating multiple sclerosis and certain nervous disorders .
experts at the dutch health ministry have recommended that the drug only be taken via an inhaler or mixed with tea and not smoked .
based on these findings , the dutch government has given permission for two cultivators - the stichting institute of medical marijuana -lrb- simm -rrb- and the firm bedrocan - to supply pharmacists with strictly regulated dosages of cannabis .
the cannabis provided by the two companies is rigorously tested for impurities by the bureau for medicinal cannabis , which also organizes its distribution .
available now the government-contracted suppliers began transporting the drug to several hundred pharmacies across the country on monday , where it will be available to patients , in five gram -lrb- 0.18 oz -rrb- pots or packets .
the drug will be sold for between € 40 and € 50 -lrb- $ 43.80- $ 54.80 -rrb- per bag , and patients will be expected to pay for their cannabis themselves .
there are no plans as yet to provide the drug as a subsidized health benefit .
the dutch health ministry expects the drug to be initially available to between 4,000 and 7,000 patients , rising to 15,000 within a year .
government estimates put the number of people who are already regularly taking cannabis for medical reasons at around 7,000 , with many either buying it in coffee shops or receiving it illegally from doctors and chemists , according to health ministry estimates .
" it was ridiculous that people were using this drug while no doctor was permitted to prescribe it , despite the fact that scientific studies showed benefits , " a dutch health ministry official said .
less expensive relief on the street cannabis is available in licensed coffee shops in the netherlands at almost half the price of the government regulated drug , although the strength and quality of the product from illegal channels can not be guaranteed .

hoping to avert a european union dominated by larger nations , representatives from 15 mostly smaller current and future eu members have met in prague to discuss changes to a draft european constitution . a 105-member convention this spring , led by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , unveiled a blueprint constitution that aims to streamline the eu ’ s institutions and make it capable of functioning when the bloc expands from 15 to 25 members next year . although the constitution would consolidate various eu treaties and likely make the bloc more transparent and governable , it has unsettled smaller countries that fear their interests could be swept aside in the name of efficiency .
meeting in prague on monday , officials from 15 nations agreed to adopt a common negotiating position before an intergovernmental conference in october that will hammer out the final shape of the european constitution . officials from slovakia , hungary , greece , finland , austria , sweden , denmark , lithuania , latvia , estonia , ireland , portugal , slovenia and the czech republic attended the meeting , amounting to the strongest challenge so far to the eu ’ s larger countries and their alleged intentions to consolidate the bloc ’ s power . “ there is a certain agreement , so it can be expected that in these areas , i do n't want to say there will be common proposals , but certainly some synergy during the intergovernmental conference , ” czech deputy foreign minister jan kohout told reuters after the summit . poland , with around 40 million citizens by far the largest candidate country , also attended the “ dwarf summit ” in prague , but smaller current eu members the netherlands , belgium and luxembourg did not . “ one country , one commissioner ” kohout said the representatives accepted 90 to 95 percent of the proposed constitution and did not want to derail the draft , but that some changes were necessary .

the decision by the dutch government to legalize cannabis prescriptions for patients suffering from serious illnesses has aroused the interest of countries in europe and beyond . in a move that raised few eyebrows in the netherlands and caused other countries around the world to turn their curiosity and interest towards the liberal european nation , the dutch government legalized the medical use of cannabis on monday , paving the way for doctors to prescribe the narcotic as a painkiller for those who are seriously ill . the decision to permit cannabis for the relief of symptoms related to the treatment of terminal cancer , aids and hiv , and for patients with multiple sclerosis or tourette 's syndrome , is the latest in a list of pioneering social reforms in the netherlands . however , whereas the dutch decisions to legalize euthanasia and sell cannabis for recreational use in licensed coffee shops caused controversy in the international arena , the move to permit cannabis for medical purposes has attracted the attention of other countries that have been considering similar initiatives - especially in europe .
all eyes on holland the dutch health ministry says it has already fielded calls for progress reports from officials in germany , britain , belgium and luxembourg .
britain announced plans to begin testing cannabis for medical purposes earlier this year with the possibility of the government making it legal for doctors to prescribe their patients starting in 2004 if tests prove conclusive .
germany already legally provides patients with oral pills and liquids , such as the pharmaceutically manufactured products marinol and nabilone , which contain tetrahydrocannabinol -lrb- thc -rrb- , one of the active compounds found in cannabis .
according to dr. franjo grotenherman from the international association for cannabis as medicine -lrb- iacm -rrb- , the german government agreed in 1999 to work on creating a formula for a cannabis extract that could be used as a medical treatment .
the government passed the responsibility for developing the formula to the german pharmaceutical association , which announced two months ago that their work was complete .
“ but now the winds have changed , ” dr. grotenherman told deutsche welle .
“ at the time of the agreement on the formula , we had a green party minister in health , now the minister is from the spd and is a little more sceptical . ”
dr. grotenherman added that the process had now slowed down even after the bundestag voted in support of developing cannabis for medical use in 2001 .
the dutch move may now grease the wheels , he hoped .

the dutch decision came after extensive tests on the medical benefits of the drug that began in 1996 .

it is also said to be effective in treating multiple sclerosis and certain nervous disorders .
experts at the dutch health ministry have recommended that the drug only be taken via an inhaler or mixed with tea and not smoked .
based on these findings , the dutch government has given permission for two cultivators - the stichting institute of medical marijuana -lrb- simm -rrb- and the firm bedrocan - to supply pharmacists with strictly regulated dosages of cannabis .
the cannabis provided by the two companies is rigorously tested for impurities by the bureau for medicinal cannabis , which also organizes its distribution .

there are no plans as yet to provide the drug as a subsidized health benefit .
the dutch health ministry expects the drug to be initially available to between 4,000 and 7,000 patients , rising to 15,000 within a year .
government estimates put the number of people who are already regularly taking cannabis for medical reasons at around 7,000 , with many either buying it in coffee shops or receiving it illegally from doctors and chemists , according to health ministry estimates .

the decision by the dutch government to legalize cannabis prescriptions for patients suffering from serious illnesses has aroused the interest of countries in europe and beyond . in a move that raised few eyebrows in the netherlands and caused other countries around the world to turn their curiosity and interest towards the liberal european nation , the dutch government legalized the medical use of cannabis on monday , paving the way for doctors to prescribe the narcotic as a painkiller for those who are seriously ill . the decision to permit cannabis for the relief of symptoms related to the treatment of terminal cancer , aids and hiv , and for patients with multiple sclerosis or tourette 's syndrome , is the latest in a list of pioneering social reforms in the netherlands . however , whereas the dutch decisions to legalize euthanasia and sell cannabis for recreational use in licensed coffee shops caused controversy in the international arena , the move to permit cannabis for medical purposes has attracted the attention of other countries that have been considering similar initiatives - especially in europe .
all eyes on holland the dutch health ministry says it has already fielded calls for progress reports from officials in germany , britain , belgium and luxembourg .
britain announced plans to begin testing cannabis for medical purposes earlier this year with the possibility of the government making it legal for doctors to prescribe their patients starting in 2004 if tests prove conclusive .
germany already legally provides patients with oral pills and liquids , such as the pharmaceutically manufactured products marinol and nabilone , which contain tetrahydrocannabinol -lrb- thc -rrb- , one of the active compounds found in cannabis .
according to dr. franjo grotenherman from the international association for cannabis as medicine -lrb- iacm -rrb- , the german government agreed in 1999 to work on creating a formula for a cannabis extract that could be used as a medical treatment .
the government passed the responsibility for developing the formula to the german pharmaceutical association , which announced two months ago that their work was complete .
“ but now the winds have changed , ” dr. grotenherman told deutsche welle .
“ at the time of the agreement on the formula , we had a green party minister in health , now the minister is from the spd and is a little more sceptical . ”
dr. grotenherman added that the process had now slowed down even after the bundestag voted in support of developing cannabis for medical use in 2001 .
the dutch move may now grease the wheels , he hoped .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape eu constitution negotiations draw to a close germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft eu constitution dominates debate at summit europe -pipe- 02.09.2003 small eu countries aim to revamp constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small countries fear their interests will be trampled by the new eu constitution .
hoping to avert a european union dominated by larger nations , representatives from 15 mostly smaller current and future eu members have met in prague to discuss changes to a draft european constitution . a 105-member convention this spring , led by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , unveiled a blueprint constitution that aims to streamline the eu ’ s institutions and make it capable of functioning when the bloc expands from 15 to 25 members next year . although the constitution would consolidate various eu treaties and likely make the bloc more transparent and governable , it has unsettled smaller countries that fear their interests could be swept aside in the name of efficiency .
meeting in prague on monday , officials from 15 nations agreed to adopt a common negotiating position before an intergovernmental conference in october that will hammer out the final shape of the european constitution . officials from slovakia , hungary , greece , finland , austria , sweden , denmark , lithuania , latvia , estonia , ireland , portugal , slovenia and the czech republic attended the meeting , amounting to the strongest challenge so far to the eu ’ s larger countries and their alleged intentions to consolidate the bloc ’ s power . “ there is a certain agreement , so it can be expected that in these areas , i do n't want to say there will be common proposals , but certainly some synergy during the intergovernmental conference , ” czech deputy foreign minister jan kohout told reuters after the summit . poland , with around 40 million citizens by far the largest candidate country , also attended the “ dwarf summit ” in prague , but smaller current eu members the netherlands , belgium and luxembourg did not . “ one country , one commissioner ” kohout said the representatives accepted 90 to 95 percent of the proposed constitution and did not want to derail the draft , but that some changes were necessary .
he said they had agreed that each eu country should retain its own representative at the european commission . as it now stands , the new constitution would limit the size of the commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies , to 15 executive members .
presently , each country is guaranteed one commissioner and larger nations have two .

the decision by the dutch government to legalize cannabis prescriptions for patients suffering from serious illnesses has aroused the interest of countries in europe and beyond . in a move that raised few eyebrows in the netherlands and caused other countries around the world to turn their curiosity and interest towards the liberal european nation , the dutch government legalized the medical use of cannabis on monday , paving the way for doctors to prescribe the narcotic as a painkiller for those who are seriously ill . the decision to permit cannabis for the relief of symptoms related to the treatment of terminal cancer , aids and hiv , and for patients with multiple sclerosis or tourette 's syndrome , is the latest in a list of pioneering social reforms in the netherlands . however , whereas the dutch decisions to legalize euthanasia and sell cannabis for recreational use in licensed coffee shops caused controversy in the international arena , the move to permit cannabis for medical purposes has attracted the attention of other countries that have been considering similar initiatives - especially in europe .
all eyes on holland the dutch health ministry says it has already fielded calls for progress reports from officials in germany , britain , belgium and luxembourg .
britain announced plans to begin testing cannabis for medical purposes earlier this year with the possibility of the government making it legal for doctors to prescribe their patients starting in 2004 if tests prove conclusive .
germany already legally provides patients with oral pills and liquids , such as the pharmaceutically manufactured products marinol and nabilone , which contain tetrahydrocannabinol -lrb- thc -rrb- , one of the active compounds found in cannabis .
according to dr. franjo grotenherman from the international association for cannabis as medicine -lrb- iacm -rrb- , the german government agreed in 1999 to work on creating a formula for a cannabis extract that could be used as a medical treatment .
the government passed the responsibility for developing the formula to the german pharmaceutical association , which announced two months ago that their work was complete .

“ at the time of the agreement on the formula , we had a green party minister in health , now the minister is from the spd and is a little more sceptical . ”
dr. grotenherman added that the process had now slowed down even after the bundestag voted in support of developing cannabis for medical use in 2001 .
the dutch move may now grease the wheels , he hoped .

it is also said to be effective in treating multiple sclerosis and certain nervous disorders .
experts at the dutch health ministry have recommended that the drug only be taken via an inhaler or mixed with tea and not smoked .
based on these findings , the dutch government has given permission for two cultivators - the stichting institute of medical marijuana -lrb- simm -rrb- and the firm bedrocan - to supply pharmacists with strictly regulated dosages of cannabis .

the decision by the dutch government to legalize cannabis prescriptions for patients suffering from serious illnesses has aroused the interest of countries in europe and beyond . in a move that raised few eyebrows in the netherlands and caused other countries around the world to turn their curiosity and interest towards the liberal european nation , the dutch government legalized the medical use of cannabis on monday , paving the way for doctors to prescribe the narcotic as a painkiller for those who are seriously ill . the decision to permit cannabis for the relief of symptoms related to the treatment of terminal cancer , aids and hiv , and for patients with multiple sclerosis or tourette 's syndrome , is the latest in a list of pioneering social reforms in the netherlands . however , whereas the dutch decisions to legalize euthanasia and sell cannabis for recreational use in licensed coffee shops caused controversy in the international arena , the move to permit cannabis for medical purposes has attracted the attention of other countries that have been considering similar initiatives - especially in europe .
all eyes on holland the dutch health ministry says it has already fielded calls for progress reports from officials in germany , britain , belgium and luxembourg .
britain announced plans to begin testing cannabis for medical purposes earlier this year with the possibility of the government making it legal for doctors to prescribe their patients starting in 2004 if tests prove conclusive .
germany already legally provides patients with oral pills and liquids , such as the pharmaceutically manufactured products marinol and nabilone , which contain tetrahydrocannabinol -lrb- thc -rrb- , one of the active compounds found in cannabis .
according to dr. franjo grotenherman from the international association for cannabis as medicine -lrb- iacm -rrb- , the german government agreed in 1999 to work on creating a formula for a cannabis extract that could be used as a medical treatment .
the government passed the responsibility for developing the formula to the german pharmaceutical association , which announced two months ago that their work was complete .
“ but now the winds have changed , ” dr. grotenherman told deutsche welle .
“ at the time of the agreement on the formula , we had a green party minister in health , now the minister is from the spd and is a little more sceptical . ”
dr. grotenherman added that the process had now slowed down even after the bundestag voted in support of developing cannabis for medical use in 2001 .
the dutch move may now grease the wheels , he hoped .
a report in 2002 by the vienna-based international narcotics control board -lrb- incb -rrb- suggested that decisions by italy , luxembourg , portugal and spain to decriminalize the drug could also open up possibilities for developing cannabis for medical use .
us , canada and australia monitoring elsewhere in the world , the duitch experience will be carefully monitored parts of the united states , australia and canada that began to sell and distribute marijuana for medical use in july were all considering following suit and prescribing the drug through medical sources .
federal law has made it difficult for american states to implement medical marijuana laws .

experts at the dutch health ministry have recommended that the drug only be taken via an inhaler or mixed with tea and not smoked .
based on these findings , the dutch government has given permission for two cultivators - the stichting institute of medical marijuana -lrb- simm -rrb- and the firm bedrocan - to supply pharmacists with strictly regulated dosages of cannabis .
the cannabis provided by the two companies is rigorously tested for impurities by the bureau for medicinal cannabis , which also organizes its distribution .
available now the government-contracted suppliers began transporting the drug to several hundred pharmacies across the country on monday , where it will be available to patients , in five gram -lrb- 0.18 oz -rrb- pots or packets .
the drug will be sold for between € 40 and € 50 -lrb- $ 43.80- $ 54.80 -rrb- per bag , and patients will be expected to pay for their cannabis themselves .
there are no plans as yet to provide the drug as a subsidized health benefit .
the dutch health ministry expects the drug to be initially available to between 4,000 and 7,000 patients , rising to 15,000 within a year .
government estimates put the number of people who are already regularly taking cannabis for medical reasons at around 7,000 , with many either buying it in coffee shops or receiving it illegally from doctors and chemists , according to health ministry estimates .
" it was ridiculous that people were using this drug while no doctor was permitted to prescribe it , despite the fact that scientific studies showed benefits , " a dutch health ministry official said .
less expensive relief on the street cannabis is available in licensed coffee shops in the netherlands at almost half the price of the government regulated drug , although the strength and quality of the product from illegal channels can not be guaranteed .
time will tell if the government scheme replaces the street option for patients searching for relief - something other countries will be watching with interest . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green party wants to legalize the green germany ’ s green party is making the legalization of marijuana part of their campaign platform this year .

hoping to avert a european union dominated by larger nations , representatives from 15 mostly smaller current and future eu members have met in prague to discuss changes to a draft european constitution . a 105-member convention this spring , led by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , unveiled a blueprint constitution that aims to streamline the eu ’ s institutions and make it capable of functioning when the bloc expands from 15 to 25 members next year . although the constitution would consolidate various eu treaties and likely make the bloc more transparent and governable , it has unsettled smaller countries that fear their interests could be swept aside in the name of efficiency .
meeting in prague on monday , officials from 15 nations agreed to adopt a common negotiating position before an intergovernmental conference in october that will hammer out the final shape of the european constitution . officials from slovakia , hungary , greece , finland , austria , sweden , denmark , lithuania , latvia , estonia , ireland , portugal , slovenia and the czech republic attended the meeting , amounting to the strongest challenge so far to the eu ’ s larger countries and their alleged intentions to consolidate the bloc ’ s power . “ there is a certain agreement , so it can be expected that in these areas , i do n't want to say there will be common proposals , but certainly some synergy during the intergovernmental conference , ” czech deputy foreign minister jan kohout told reuters after the summit . poland , with around 40 million citizens by far the largest candidate country , also attended the “ dwarf summit ” in prague , but smaller current eu members the netherlands , belgium and luxembourg did not . “ one country , one commissioner ” kohout said the representatives accepted 90 to 95 percent of the proposed constitution and did not want to derail the draft , but that some changes were necessary .

meeting in prague on monday , officials from 15 nations agreed to adopt a common negotiating position before an intergovernmental conference in october that will hammer out the final shape of the european constitution . officials from slovakia , hungary , greece , finland , austria , sweden , denmark , lithuania , latvia , estonia , ireland , portugal , slovenia and the czech republic attended the meeting , amounting to the strongest challenge so far to the eu ’ s larger countries and their alleged intentions to consolidate the bloc ’ s power . “ there is a certain agreement , so it can be expected that in these areas , i do n't want to say there will be common proposals , but certainly some synergy during the intergovernmental conference , ” czech deputy foreign minister jan kohout told reuters after the summit . poland , with around 40 million citizens by far the largest candidate country , also attended the “ dwarf summit ” in prague , but smaller current eu members the netherlands , belgium and luxembourg did not . “ one country , one commissioner ” kohout said the representatives accepted 90 to 95 percent of the proposed constitution and did not want to derail the draft , but that some changes were necessary .
he said they had agreed that each eu country should retain its own representative at the european commission . as it now stands , the new constitution would limit the size of the commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies , to 15 executive members .
presently , each country is guaranteed one commissioner and larger nations have two .
the smaller nations want to see each member guaranteed a commissioner to protect their national interests in brussels . “ the overwhelming majority are for the principle of ‘ one country , one commissioner ’ , ” kohout said . some smaller countries also want the eu to keep its system of a rotating presidency instead of electing a permanent chairman and they also want to ditch the proposed voting system , under which decisions would be taken by a majority of countries representing at least 60 percent of the eu 's population . “ many states joining on may 1 , 2004 have only been sovereign since the political changes in 1989 .
for some of them it is difficult to once again subordinate themselves to something larger , ” an unnamed official representing the eu in prague told the german news agency dpa . big four against changes politicians from europe ’ s biggest four nations – germany , france , britain and italy – have said trying to drastically revamp the draft constitution could have the disastrous effect of derailing the whole project . “ the draft is a great and reasonable compromise between large and small states , ” said german foreign minister joschka fischer on a trip to prague last month . while expressing understanding for the small countries ’ desire to protect their interests , fischer warned against “ opening up the package , ” saying doing so could create a crisis in within the eu . the eu hopes to finish negotiations on the constitution before the next election of the european parliament in june . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer says hands off eu constitution german foreign minister joschka fischer warns other european countries not to re-negotiate the eu draft constitution .

the decision by the dutch government to legalize cannabis prescriptions for patients suffering from serious illnesses has aroused the interest of countries in europe and beyond . in a move that raised few eyebrows in the netherlands and caused other countries around the world to turn their curiosity and interest towards the liberal european nation , the dutch government legalized the medical use of cannabis on monday , paving the way for doctors to prescribe the narcotic as a painkiller for those who are seriously ill . the decision to permit cannabis for the relief of symptoms related to the treatment of terminal cancer , aids and hiv , and for patients with multiple sclerosis or tourette 's syndrome , is the latest in a list of pioneering social reforms in the netherlands . however , whereas the dutch decisions to legalize euthanasia and sell cannabis for recreational use in licensed coffee shops caused controversy in the international arena , the move to permit cannabis for medical purposes has attracted the attention of other countries that have been considering similar initiatives - especially in europe .
all eyes on holland the dutch health ministry says it has already fielded calls for progress reports from officials in germany , britain , belgium and luxembourg .
britain announced plans to begin testing cannabis for medical purposes earlier this year with the possibility of the government making it legal for doctors to prescribe their patients starting in 2004 if tests prove conclusive .
germany already legally provides patients with oral pills and liquids , such as the pharmaceutically manufactured products marinol and nabilone , which contain tetrahydrocannabinol -lrb- thc -rrb- , one of the active compounds found in cannabis .
according to dr. franjo grotenherman from the international association for cannabis as medicine -lrb- iacm -rrb- , the german government agreed in 1999 to work on creating a formula for a cannabis extract that could be used as a medical treatment .
the government passed the responsibility for developing the formula to the german pharmaceutical association , which announced two months ago that their work was complete .
“ but now the winds have changed , ” dr. grotenherman told deutsche welle .
“ at the time of the agreement on the formula , we had a green party minister in health , now the minister is from the spd and is a little more sceptical . ”
dr. grotenherman added that the process had now slowed down even after the bundestag voted in support of developing cannabis for medical use in 2001 .
the dutch move may now grease the wheels , he hoped .
a report in 2002 by the vienna-based international narcotics control board -lrb- incb -rrb- suggested that decisions by italy , luxembourg , portugal and spain to decriminalize the drug could also open up possibilities for developing cannabis for medical use .
us , canada and australia monitoring elsewhere in the world , the duitch experience will be carefully monitored parts of the united states , australia and canada that began to sell and distribute marijuana for medical use in july were all considering following suit and prescribing the drug through medical sources .
federal law has made it difficult for american states to implement medical marijuana laws .
in california , where the drug could be legally used for medical purposes , federal prosecutors used national laws to convict professionals involved in prescribing or supplying cannabis .
the dutch decision came after extensive tests on the medical benefits of the drug that began in 1996 .
there has yet to be any concrete evidence of physiological change from using the drug in its medical form , but research shows certain alleviating effects in patients .
" there is no scientific proof that it works , " said a health ministry spokesman , " but repeated use indicates that an effect does exist . "
claims of effectiveness cannabis is claimed to be effective in reducing nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy , of reducing tension in glaucoma patients and in improving the appetite of those suffering from hiv and aids .
it is also said to be effective in treating multiple sclerosis and certain nervous disorders .
experts at the dutch health ministry have recommended that the drug only be taken via an inhaler or mixed with tea and not smoked .
based on these findings , the dutch government has given permission for two cultivators - the stichting institute of medical marijuana -lrb- simm -rrb- and the firm bedrocan - to supply pharmacists with strictly regulated dosages of cannabis .
the cannabis provided by the two companies is rigorously tested for impurities by the bureau for medicinal cannabis , which also organizes its distribution .
available now the government-contracted suppliers began transporting the drug to several hundred pharmacies across the country on monday , where it will be available to patients , in five gram -lrb- 0.18 oz -rrb- pots or packets .
the drug will be sold for between € 40 and € 50 -lrb- $ 43.80- $ 54.80 -rrb- per bag , and patients will be expected to pay for their cannabis themselves .
there are no plans as yet to provide the drug as a subsidized health benefit .
the dutch health ministry expects the drug to be initially available to between 4,000 and 7,000 patients , rising to 15,000 within a year .
government estimates put the number of people who are already regularly taking cannabis for medical reasons at around 7,000 , with many either buying it in coffee shops or receiving it illegally from doctors and chemists , according to health ministry estimates .
" it was ridiculous that people were using this drug while no doctor was permitted to prescribe it , despite the fact that scientific studies showed benefits , " a dutch health ministry official said .
less expensive relief on the street cannabis is available in licensed coffee shops in the netherlands at almost half the price of the government regulated drug , although the strength and quality of the product from illegal channels can not be guaranteed .

hoping to avert a european union dominated by larger nations , representatives from 15 mostly smaller current and future eu members have met in prague to discuss changes to a draft european constitution . a 105-member convention this spring , led by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , unveiled a blueprint constitution that aims to streamline the eu ’ s institutions and make it capable of functioning when the bloc expands from 15 to 25 members next year . although the constitution would consolidate various eu treaties and likely make the bloc more transparent and governable , it has unsettled smaller countries that fear their interests could be swept aside in the name of efficiency .
meeting in prague on monday , officials from 15 nations agreed to adopt a common negotiating position before an intergovernmental conference in october that will hammer out the final shape of the european constitution . officials from slovakia , hungary , greece , finland , austria , sweden , denmark , lithuania , latvia , estonia , ireland , portugal , slovenia and the czech republic attended the meeting , amounting to the strongest challenge so far to the eu ’ s larger countries and their alleged intentions to consolidate the bloc ’ s power . “ there is a certain agreement , so it can be expected that in these areas , i do n't want to say there will be common proposals , but certainly some synergy during the intergovernmental conference , ” czech deputy foreign minister jan kohout told reuters after the summit . poland , with around 40 million citizens by far the largest candidate country , also attended the “ dwarf summit ” in prague , but smaller current eu members the netherlands , belgium and luxembourg did not . “ one country , one commissioner ” kohout said the representatives accepted 90 to 95 percent of the proposed constitution and did not want to derail the draft , but that some changes were necessary .
he said they had agreed that each eu country should retain its own representative at the european commission . as it now stands , the new constitution would limit the size of the commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies , to 15 executive members .
presently , each country is guaranteed one commissioner and larger nations have two .
the smaller nations want to see each member guaranteed a commissioner to protect their national interests in brussels . “ the overwhelming majority are for the principle of ‘ one country , one commissioner ’ , ” kohout said . some smaller countries also want the eu to keep its system of a rotating presidency instead of electing a permanent chairman and they also want to ditch the proposed voting system , under which decisions would be taken by a majority of countries representing at least 60 percent of the eu 's population . “ many states joining on may 1 , 2004 have only been sovereign since the political changes in 1989 .
for some of them it is difficult to once again subordinate themselves to something larger , ” an unnamed official representing the eu in prague told the german news agency dpa . big four against changes politicians from europe ’ s biggest four nations – germany , france , britain and italy – have said trying to drastically revamp the draft constitution could have the disastrous effect of derailing the whole project . “ the draft is a great and reasonable compromise between large and small states , ” said german foreign minister joschka fischer on a trip to prague last month . while expressing understanding for the small countries ’ desire to protect their interests , fischer warned against “ opening up the package , ” saying doing so could create a crisis in within the eu . the eu hopes to finish negotiations on the constitution before the next election of the european parliament in june . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer says hands off eu constitution german foreign minister joschka fischer warns other european countries not to re-negotiate the eu draft constitution .

the decision by the dutch government to legalize cannabis prescriptions for patients suffering from serious illnesses has aroused the interest of countries in europe and beyond . in a move that raised few eyebrows in the netherlands and caused other countries around the world to turn their curiosity and interest towards the liberal european nation , the dutch government legalized the medical use of cannabis on monday , paving the way for doctors to prescribe the narcotic as a painkiller for those who are seriously ill . the decision to permit cannabis for the relief of symptoms related to the treatment of terminal cancer , aids and hiv , and for patients with multiple sclerosis or tourette 's syndrome , is the latest in a list of pioneering social reforms in the netherlands . however , whereas the dutch decisions to legalize euthanasia and sell cannabis for recreational use in licensed coffee shops caused controversy in the international arena , the move to permit cannabis for medical purposes has attracted the attention of other countries that have been considering similar initiatives - especially in europe .
all eyes on holland the dutch health ministry says it has already fielded calls for progress reports from officials in germany , britain , belgium and luxembourg .
britain announced plans to begin testing cannabis for medical purposes earlier this year with the possibility of the government making it legal for doctors to prescribe their patients starting in 2004 if tests prove conclusive .
germany already legally provides patients with oral pills and liquids , such as the pharmaceutically manufactured products marinol and nabilone , which contain tetrahydrocannabinol -lrb- thc -rrb- , one of the active compounds found in cannabis .
according to dr. franjo grotenherman from the international association for cannabis as medicine -lrb- iacm -rrb- , the german government agreed in 1999 to work on creating a formula for a cannabis extract that could be used as a medical treatment .
the government passed the responsibility for developing the formula to the german pharmaceutical association , which announced two months ago that their work was complete .
“ but now the winds have changed , ” dr. grotenherman told deutsche welle .
“ at the time of the agreement on the formula , we had a green party minister in health , now the minister is from the spd and is a little more sceptical . ”
dr. grotenherman added that the process had now slowed down even after the bundestag voted in support of developing cannabis for medical use in 2001 .

the survey of global labor market trends from the geneva-based international labor organization showed that the productivity gap between the u.s. and the rest of the world widened in 2002 due to americans working longer hours than europeans .
americans clocked up an average of 1,825 working hours last year , compared with 1,300 to 1,800 hours in leading european economies .
output per worker in the united states grew 2.8 percent in 2002 from the previous year , more than double the 1.2 percent growth rate across the european union .
according to the study , three european countries are doing better than the u.s. in terms of output per hour - belgium , norway and france . more briefs 02.09.2003 -pipe- foreign carmakers challenged by local brand loyalty 01.09.2003 -pipe- bundesbank head says germany will breach pact 01.09.2003 -pipe- regulator against merger of berlin dailies 01.09.2003 -pipe- fifa to issue bond for world cup coverage 01.09.2003 -pipe- east german companies buck trend 29.08.2003 -pipe- german retailer equates gay partnerships with marriage 29.08.2003 -pipe- german retail sales fall again 28.08.2003 -pipe- no pale imitations : liebfrauenmilch joins exclusive name list radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

hoping to avert a european union dominated by larger nations , representatives from 15 mostly smaller current and future eu members have met in prague to discuss changes to a draft european constitution . a 105-member convention this spring , led by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , unveiled a blueprint constitution that aims to streamline the eu ’ s institutions and make it capable of functioning when the bloc expands from 15 to 25 members next year . although the constitution would consolidate various eu treaties and likely make the bloc more transparent and governable , it has unsettled smaller countries that fear their interests could be swept aside in the name of efficiency .
meeting in prague on monday , officials from 15 nations agreed to adopt a common negotiating position before an intergovernmental conference in october that will hammer out the final shape of the european constitution . officials from slovakia , hungary , greece , finland , austria , sweden , denmark , lithuania , latvia , estonia , ireland , portugal , slovenia and the czech republic attended the meeting , amounting to the strongest challenge so far to the eu ’ s larger countries and their alleged intentions to consolidate the bloc ’ s power . “ there is a certain agreement , so it can be expected that in these areas , i do n't want to say there will be common proposals , but certainly some synergy during the intergovernmental conference , ” czech deputy foreign minister jan kohout told reuters after the summit . poland , with around 40 million citizens by far the largest candidate country , also attended the “ dwarf summit ” in prague , but smaller current eu members the netherlands , belgium and luxembourg did not . “ one country , one commissioner ” kohout said the representatives accepted 90 to 95 percent of the proposed constitution and did not want to derail the draft , but that some changes were necessary .
he said they had agreed that each eu country should retain its own representative at the european commission . as it now stands , the new constitution would limit the size of the commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies , to 15 executive members .
presently , each country is guaranteed one commissioner and larger nations have two .
the smaller nations want to see each member guaranteed a commissioner to protect their national interests in brussels . “ the overwhelming majority are for the principle of ‘ one country , one commissioner ’ , ” kohout said . some smaller countries also want the eu to keep its system of a rotating presidency instead of electing a permanent chairman and they also want to ditch the proposed voting system , under which decisions would be taken by a majority of countries representing at least 60 percent of the eu 's population . “ many states joining on may 1 , 2004 have only been sovereign since the political changes in 1989 .

hoping to avert a european union dominated by larger nations , representatives from 15 mostly smaller current and future eu members have met in prague to discuss changes to a draft european constitution . a 105-member convention this spring , led by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , unveiled a blueprint constitution that aims to streamline the eu ’ s institutions and make it capable of functioning when the bloc expands from 15 to 25 members next year . although the constitution would consolidate various eu treaties and likely make the bloc more transparent and governable , it has unsettled smaller countries that fear their interests could be swept aside in the name of efficiency .
meeting in prague on monday , officials from 15 nations agreed to adopt a common negotiating position before an intergovernmental conference in october that will hammer out the final shape of the european constitution . officials from slovakia , hungary , greece , finland , austria , sweden , denmark , lithuania , latvia , estonia , ireland , portugal , slovenia and the czech republic attended the meeting , amounting to the strongest challenge so far to the eu ’ s larger countries and their alleged intentions to consolidate the bloc ’ s power . “ there is a certain agreement , so it can be expected that in these areas , i do n't want to say there will be common proposals , but certainly some synergy during the intergovernmental conference , ” czech deputy foreign minister jan kohout told reuters after the summit . poland , with around 40 million citizens by far the largest candidate country , also attended the “ dwarf summit ” in prague , but smaller current eu members the netherlands , belgium and luxembourg did not . “ one country , one commissioner ” kohout said the representatives accepted 90 to 95 percent of the proposed constitution and did not want to derail the draft , but that some changes were necessary .
he said they had agreed that each eu country should retain its own representative at the european commission . as it now stands , the new constitution would limit the size of the commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies , to 15 executive members .
presently , each country is guaranteed one commissioner and larger nations have two .
the smaller nations want to see each member guaranteed a commissioner to protect their national interests in brussels . “ the overwhelming majority are for the principle of ‘ one country , one commissioner ’ , ” kohout said . some smaller countries also want the eu to keep its system of a rotating presidency instead of electing a permanent chairman and they also want to ditch the proposed voting system , under which decisions would be taken by a majority of countries representing at least 60 percent of the eu 's population . “ many states joining on may 1 , 2004 have only been sovereign since the political changes in 1989 .
for some of them it is difficult to once again subordinate themselves to something larger , ” an unnamed official representing the eu in prague told the german news agency dpa . big four against changes politicians from europe ’ s biggest four nations – germany , france , britain and italy – have said trying to drastically revamp the draft constitution could have the disastrous effect of derailing the whole project . “ the draft is a great and reasonable compromise between large and small states , ” said german foreign minister joschka fischer on a trip to prague last month . while expressing understanding for the small countries ’ desire to protect their interests , fischer warned against “ opening up the package , ” saying doing so could create a crisis in within the eu . the eu hopes to finish negotiations on the constitution before the next election of the european parliament in june . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer says hands off eu constitution german foreign minister joschka fischer warns other european countries not to re-negotiate the eu draft constitution .
should they attempt to do so , germany would follow suit , bringing their own grievances to the table .

the decision by the dutch government to legalize cannabis prescriptions for patients suffering from serious illnesses has aroused the interest of countries in europe and beyond . in a move that raised few eyebrows in the netherlands and caused other countries around the world to turn their curiosity and interest towards the liberal european nation , the dutch government legalized the medical use of cannabis on monday , paving the way for doctors to prescribe the narcotic as a painkiller for those who are seriously ill . the decision to permit cannabis for the relief of symptoms related to the treatment of terminal cancer , aids and hiv , and for patients with multiple sclerosis or tourette 's syndrome , is the latest in a list of pioneering social reforms in the netherlands . however , whereas the dutch decisions to legalize euthanasia and sell cannabis for recreational use in licensed coffee shops caused controversy in the international arena , the move to permit cannabis for medical purposes has attracted the attention of other countries that have been considering similar initiatives - especially in europe .
all eyes on holland the dutch health ministry says it has already fielded calls for progress reports from officials in germany , britain , belgium and luxembourg .
britain announced plans to begin testing cannabis for medical purposes earlier this year with the possibility of the government making it legal for doctors to prescribe their patients starting in 2004 if tests prove conclusive .
germany already legally provides patients with oral pills and liquids , such as the pharmaceutically manufactured products marinol and nabilone , which contain tetrahydrocannabinol -lrb- thc -rrb- , one of the active compounds found in cannabis .
according to dr. franjo grotenherman from the international association for cannabis as medicine -lrb- iacm -rrb- , the german government agreed in 1999 to work on creating a formula for a cannabis extract that could be used as a medical treatment .
the government passed the responsibility for developing the formula to the german pharmaceutical association , which announced two months ago that their work was complete .
“ but now the winds have changed , ” dr. grotenherman told deutsche welle .
“ at the time of the agreement on the formula , we had a green party minister in health , now the minister is from the spd and is a little more sceptical . ”
dr. grotenherman added that the process had now slowed down even after the bundestag voted in support of developing cannabis for medical use in 2001 .
the dutch move may now grease the wheels , he hoped .
a report in 2002 by the vienna-based international narcotics control board -lrb- incb -rrb- suggested that decisions by italy , luxembourg , portugal and spain to decriminalize the drug could also open up possibilities for developing cannabis for medical use .
us , canada and australia monitoring elsewhere in the world , the duitch experience will be carefully monitored parts of the united states , australia and canada that began to sell and distribute marijuana for medical use in july were all considering following suit and prescribing the drug through medical sources .
federal law has made it difficult for american states to implement medical marijuana laws .
in california , where the drug could be legally used for medical purposes , federal prosecutors used national laws to convict professionals involved in prescribing or supplying cannabis .
the dutch decision came after extensive tests on the medical benefits of the drug that began in 1996 .
there has yet to be any concrete evidence of physiological change from using the drug in its medical form , but research shows certain alleviating effects in patients .
" there is no scientific proof that it works , " said a health ministry spokesman , " but repeated use indicates that an effect does exist . "
claims of effectiveness cannabis is claimed to be effective in reducing nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy , of reducing tension in glaucoma patients and in improving the appetite of those suffering from hiv and aids .
it is also said to be effective in treating multiple sclerosis and certain nervous disorders .
experts at the dutch health ministry have recommended that the drug only be taken via an inhaler or mixed with tea and not smoked .
based on these findings , the dutch government has given permission for two cultivators - the stichting institute of medical marijuana -lrb- simm -rrb- and the firm bedrocan - to supply pharmacists with strictly regulated dosages of cannabis .
the cannabis provided by the two companies is rigorously tested for impurities by the bureau for medicinal cannabis , which also organizes its distribution .
available now the government-contracted suppliers began transporting the drug to several hundred pharmacies across the country on monday , where it will be available to patients , in five gram -lrb- 0.18 oz -rrb- pots or packets .
the drug will be sold for between € 40 and € 50 -lrb- $ 43.80- $ 54.80 -rrb- per bag , and patients will be expected to pay for their cannabis themselves .
there are no plans as yet to provide the drug as a subsidized health benefit .
the dutch health ministry expects the drug to be initially available to between 4,000 and 7,000 patients , rising to 15,000 within a year .
government estimates put the number of people who are already regularly taking cannabis for medical reasons at around 7,000 , with many either buying it in coffee shops or receiving it illegally from doctors and chemists , according to health ministry estimates .
" it was ridiculous that people were using this drug while no doctor was permitted to prescribe it , despite the fact that scientific studies showed benefits , " a dutch health ministry official said .
less expensive relief on the street cannabis is available in licensed coffee shops in the netherlands at almost half the price of the government regulated drug , although the strength and quality of the product from illegal channels can not be guaranteed .

the decision by the dutch government to legalize cannabis prescriptions for patients suffering from serious illnesses has aroused the interest of countries in europe and beyond . in a move that raised few eyebrows in the netherlands and caused other countries around the world to turn their curiosity and interest towards the liberal european nation , the dutch government legalized the medical use of cannabis on monday , paving the way for doctors to prescribe the narcotic as a painkiller for those who are seriously ill . the decision to permit cannabis for the relief of symptoms related to the treatment of terminal cancer , aids and hiv , and for patients with multiple sclerosis or tourette 's syndrome , is the latest in a list of pioneering social reforms in the netherlands . however , whereas the dutch decisions to legalize euthanasia and sell cannabis for recreational use in licensed coffee shops caused controversy in the international arena , the move to permit cannabis for medical purposes has attracted the attention of other countries that have been considering similar initiatives - especially in europe .
all eyes on holland the dutch health ministry says it has already fielded calls for progress reports from officials in germany , britain , belgium and luxembourg .
britain announced plans to begin testing cannabis for medical purposes earlier this year with the possibility of the government making it legal for doctors to prescribe their patients starting in 2004 if tests prove conclusive .
germany already legally provides patients with oral pills and liquids , such as the pharmaceutically manufactured products marinol and nabilone , which contain tetrahydrocannabinol -lrb- thc -rrb- , one of the active compounds found in cannabis .
according to dr. franjo grotenherman from the international association for cannabis as medicine -lrb- iacm -rrb- , the german government agreed in 1999 to work on creating a formula for a cannabis extract that could be used as a medical treatment .
the government passed the responsibility for developing the formula to the german pharmaceutical association , which announced two months ago that their work was complete .
“ but now the winds have changed , ” dr. grotenherman told deutsche welle .
“ at the time of the agreement on the formula , we had a green party minister in health , now the minister is from the spd and is a little more sceptical . ”
dr. grotenherman added that the process had now slowed down even after the bundestag voted in support of developing cannabis for medical use in 2001 .
the dutch move may now grease the wheels , he hoped .
a report in 2002 by the vienna-based international narcotics control board -lrb- incb -rrb- suggested that decisions by italy , luxembourg , portugal and spain to decriminalize the drug could also open up possibilities for developing cannabis for medical use .

federal law has made it difficult for american states to implement medical marijuana laws .
in california , where the drug could be legally used for medical purposes , federal prosecutors used national laws to convict professionals involved in prescribing or supplying cannabis .
the dutch decision came after extensive tests on the medical benefits of the drug that began in 1996 .
there has yet to be any concrete evidence of physiological change from using the drug in its medical form , but research shows certain alleviating effects in patients .
" there is no scientific proof that it works , " said a health ministry spokesman , " but repeated use indicates that an effect does exist . "
claims of effectiveness cannabis is claimed to be effective in reducing nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy , of reducing tension in glaucoma patients and in improving the appetite of those suffering from hiv and aids .
it is also said to be effective in treating multiple sclerosis and certain nervous disorders .
experts at the dutch health ministry have recommended that the drug only be taken via an inhaler or mixed with tea and not smoked .
based on these findings , the dutch government has given permission for two cultivators - the stichting institute of medical marijuana -lrb- simm -rrb- and the firm bedrocan - to supply pharmacists with strictly regulated dosages of cannabis .
the cannabis provided by the two companies is rigorously tested for impurities by the bureau for medicinal cannabis , which also organizes its distribution .
available now the government-contracted suppliers began transporting the drug to several hundred pharmacies across the country on monday , where it will be available to patients , in five gram -lrb- 0.18 oz -rrb- pots or packets .
the drug will be sold for between € 40 and € 50 -lrb- $ 43.80- $ 54.80 -rrb- per bag , and patients will be expected to pay for their cannabis themselves .
there are no plans as yet to provide the drug as a subsidized health benefit .
the dutch health ministry expects the drug to be initially available to between 4,000 and 7,000 patients , rising to 15,000 within a year .
government estimates put the number of people who are already regularly taking cannabis for medical reasons at around 7,000 , with many either buying it in coffee shops or receiving it illegally from doctors and chemists , according to health ministry estimates .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape eu constitution negotiations draw to a close germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft eu constitution dominates debate at summit europe -pipe- 02.09.2003 small eu countries aim to revamp constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small countries fear their interests will be trampled by the new eu constitution .
hoping to avert a european union dominated by larger nations , representatives from 15 mostly smaller current and future eu members have met in prague to discuss changes to a draft european constitution . a 105-member convention this spring , led by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , unveiled a blueprint constitution that aims to streamline the eu ’ s institutions and make it capable of functioning when the bloc expands from 15 to 25 members next year . although the constitution would consolidate various eu treaties and likely make the bloc more transparent and governable , it has unsettled smaller countries that fear their interests could be swept aside in the name of efficiency .
meeting in prague on monday , officials from 15 nations agreed to adopt a common negotiating position before an intergovernmental conference in october that will hammer out the final shape of the european constitution . officials from slovakia , hungary , greece , finland , austria , sweden , denmark , lithuania , latvia , estonia , ireland , portugal , slovenia and the czech republic attended the meeting , amounting to the strongest challenge so far to the eu ’ s larger countries and their alleged intentions to consolidate the bloc ’ s power . “ there is a certain agreement , so it can be expected that in these areas , i do n't want to say there will be common proposals , but certainly some synergy during the intergovernmental conference , ” czech deputy foreign minister jan kohout told reuters after the summit . poland , with around 40 million citizens by far the largest candidate country , also attended the “ dwarf summit ” in prague , but smaller current eu members the netherlands , belgium and luxembourg did not . “ one country , one commissioner ” kohout said the representatives accepted 90 to 95 percent of the proposed constitution and did not want to derail the draft , but that some changes were necessary .
he said they had agreed that each eu country should retain its own representative at the european commission . as it now stands , the new constitution would limit the size of the commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies , to 15 executive members .
presently , each country is guaranteed one commissioner and larger nations have two .
the smaller nations want to see each member guaranteed a commissioner to protect their national interests in brussels . “ the overwhelming majority are for the principle of ‘ one country , one commissioner ’ , ” kohout said . some smaller countries also want the eu to keep its system of a rotating presidency instead of electing a permanent chairman and they also want to ditch the proposed voting system , under which decisions would be taken by a majority of countries representing at least 60 percent of the eu 's population . “ many states joining on may 1 , 2004 have only been sovereign since the political changes in 1989 .
for some of them it is difficult to once again subordinate themselves to something larger , ” an unnamed official representing the eu in prague told the german news agency dpa . big four against changes politicians from europe ’ s biggest four nations – germany , france , britain and italy – have said trying to drastically revamp the draft constitution could have the disastrous effect of derailing the whole project . “ the draft is a great and reasonable compromise between large and small states , ” said german foreign minister joschka fischer on a trip to prague last month . while expressing understanding for the small countries ’ desire to protect their interests , fischer warned against “ opening up the package , ” saying doing so could create a crisis in within the eu . the eu hopes to finish negotiations on the constitution before the next election of the european parliament in june . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer says hands off eu constitution german foreign minister joschka fischer warns other european countries not to re-negotiate the eu draft constitution .
should they attempt to do so , germany would follow suit , bringing their own grievances to the table .

the decision by the dutch government to legalize cannabis prescriptions for patients suffering from serious illnesses has aroused the interest of countries in europe and beyond . in a move that raised few eyebrows in the netherlands and caused other countries around the world to turn their curiosity and interest towards the liberal european nation , the dutch government legalized the medical use of cannabis on monday , paving the way for doctors to prescribe the narcotic as a painkiller for those who are seriously ill . the decision to permit cannabis for the relief of symptoms related to the treatment of terminal cancer , aids and hiv , and for patients with multiple sclerosis or tourette 's syndrome , is the latest in a list of pioneering social reforms in the netherlands . however , whereas the dutch decisions to legalize euthanasia and sell cannabis for recreational use in licensed coffee shops caused controversy in the international arena , the move to permit cannabis for medical purposes has attracted the attention of other countries that have been considering similar initiatives - especially in europe .
all eyes on holland the dutch health ministry says it has already fielded calls for progress reports from officials in germany , britain , belgium and luxembourg .
britain announced plans to begin testing cannabis for medical purposes earlier this year with the possibility of the government making it legal for doctors to prescribe their patients starting in 2004 if tests prove conclusive .
germany already legally provides patients with oral pills and liquids , such as the pharmaceutically manufactured products marinol and nabilone , which contain tetrahydrocannabinol -lrb- thc -rrb- , one of the active compounds found in cannabis .
according to dr. franjo grotenherman from the international association for cannabis as medicine -lrb- iacm -rrb- , the german government agreed in 1999 to work on creating a formula for a cannabis extract that could be used as a medical treatment .
the government passed the responsibility for developing the formula to the german pharmaceutical association , which announced two months ago that their work was complete .
“ but now the winds have changed , ” dr. grotenherman told deutsche welle .
“ at the time of the agreement on the formula , we had a green party minister in health , now the minister is from the spd and is a little more sceptical . ”
dr. grotenherman added that the process had now slowed down even after the bundestag voted in support of developing cannabis for medical use in 2001 .
the dutch move may now grease the wheels , he hoped .
a report in 2002 by the vienna-based international narcotics control board -lrb- incb -rrb- suggested that decisions by italy , luxembourg , portugal and spain to decriminalize the drug could also open up possibilities for developing cannabis for medical use .
us , canada and australia monitoring elsewhere in the world , the duitch experience will be carefully monitored parts of the united states , australia and canada that began to sell and distribute marijuana for medical use in july were all considering following suit and prescribing the drug through medical sources .
federal law has made it difficult for american states to implement medical marijuana laws .
in california , where the drug could be legally used for medical purposes , federal prosecutors used national laws to convict professionals involved in prescribing or supplying cannabis .
the dutch decision came after extensive tests on the medical benefits of the drug that began in 1996 .
there has yet to be any concrete evidence of physiological change from using the drug in its medical form , but research shows certain alleviating effects in patients .
" there is no scientific proof that it works , " said a health ministry spokesman , " but repeated use indicates that an effect does exist . "
claims of effectiveness cannabis is claimed to be effective in reducing nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy , of reducing tension in glaucoma patients and in improving the appetite of those suffering from hiv and aids .
it is also said to be effective in treating multiple sclerosis and certain nervous disorders .
experts at the dutch health ministry have recommended that the drug only be taken via an inhaler or mixed with tea and not smoked .
based on these findings , the dutch government has given permission for two cultivators - the stichting institute of medical marijuana -lrb- simm -rrb- and the firm bedrocan - to supply pharmacists with strictly regulated dosages of cannabis .
the cannabis provided by the two companies is rigorously tested for impurities by the bureau for medicinal cannabis , which also organizes its distribution .
available now the government-contracted suppliers began transporting the drug to several hundred pharmacies across the country on monday , where it will be available to patients , in five gram -lrb- 0.18 oz -rrb- pots or packets .
the drug will be sold for between € 40 and € 50 -lrb- $ 43.80- $ 54.80 -rrb- per bag , and patients will be expected to pay for their cannabis themselves .
there are no plans as yet to provide the drug as a subsidized health benefit .
the dutch health ministry expects the drug to be initially available to between 4,000 and 7,000 patients , rising to 15,000 within a year .
government estimates put the number of people who are already regularly taking cannabis for medical reasons at around 7,000 , with many either buying it in coffee shops or receiving it illegally from doctors and chemists , according to health ministry estimates .
" it was ridiculous that people were using this drug while no doctor was permitted to prescribe it , despite the fact that scientific studies showed benefits , " a dutch health ministry official said .
less expensive relief on the street cannabis is available in licensed coffee shops in the netherlands at almost half the price of the government regulated drug , although the strength and quality of the product from illegal channels can not be guaranteed .

the decision by the dutch government to legalize cannabis prescriptions for patients suffering from serious illnesses has aroused the interest of countries in europe and beyond . in a move that raised few eyebrows in the netherlands and caused other countries around the world to turn their curiosity and interest towards the liberal european nation , the dutch government legalized the medical use of cannabis on monday , paving the way for doctors to prescribe the narcotic as a painkiller for those who are seriously ill . the decision to permit cannabis for the relief of symptoms related to the treatment of terminal cancer , aids and hiv , and for patients with multiple sclerosis or tourette 's syndrome , is the latest in a list of pioneering social reforms in the netherlands . however , whereas the dutch decisions to legalize euthanasia and sell cannabis for recreational use in licensed coffee shops caused controversy in the international arena , the move to permit cannabis for medical purposes has attracted the attention of other countries that have been considering similar initiatives - especially in europe .
all eyes on holland the dutch health ministry says it has already fielded calls for progress reports from officials in germany , britain , belgium and luxembourg .
britain announced plans to begin testing cannabis for medical purposes earlier this year with the possibility of the government making it legal for doctors to prescribe their patients starting in 2004 if tests prove conclusive .
germany already legally provides patients with oral pills and liquids , such as the pharmaceutically manufactured products marinol and nabilone , which contain tetrahydrocannabinol -lrb- thc -rrb- , one of the active compounds found in cannabis .
according to dr. franjo grotenherman from the international association for cannabis as medicine -lrb- iacm -rrb- , the german government agreed in 1999 to work on creating a formula for a cannabis extract that could be used as a medical treatment .
the government passed the responsibility for developing the formula to the german pharmaceutical association , which announced two months ago that their work was complete .
“ but now the winds have changed , ” dr. grotenherman told deutsche welle .
“ at the time of the agreement on the formula , we had a green party minister in health , now the minister is from the spd and is a little more sceptical . ”
dr. grotenherman added that the process had now slowed down even after the bundestag voted in support of developing cannabis for medical use in 2001 .
the dutch move may now grease the wheels , he hoped .
a report in 2002 by the vienna-based international narcotics control board -lrb- incb -rrb- suggested that decisions by italy , luxembourg , portugal and spain to decriminalize the drug could also open up possibilities for developing cannabis for medical use .
us , canada and australia monitoring elsewhere in the world , the duitch experience will be carefully monitored parts of the united states , australia and canada that began to sell and distribute marijuana for medical use in july were all considering following suit and prescribing the drug through medical sources .
federal law has made it difficult for american states to implement medical marijuana laws .
in california , where the drug could be legally used for medical purposes , federal prosecutors used national laws to convict professionals involved in prescribing or supplying cannabis .
the dutch decision came after extensive tests on the medical benefits of the drug that began in 1996 .
there has yet to be any concrete evidence of physiological change from using the drug in its medical form , but research shows certain alleviating effects in patients .
" there is no scientific proof that it works , " said a health ministry spokesman , " but repeated use indicates that an effect does exist . "
claims of effectiveness cannabis is claimed to be effective in reducing nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy , of reducing tension in glaucoma patients and in improving the appetite of those suffering from hiv and aids .
it is also said to be effective in treating multiple sclerosis and certain nervous disorders .
experts at the dutch health ministry have recommended that the drug only be taken via an inhaler or mixed with tea and not smoked .
based on these findings , the dutch government has given permission for two cultivators - the stichting institute of medical marijuana -lrb- simm -rrb- and the firm bedrocan - to supply pharmacists with strictly regulated dosages of cannabis .
the cannabis provided by the two companies is rigorously tested for impurities by the bureau for medicinal cannabis , which also organizes its distribution .
available now the government-contracted suppliers began transporting the drug to several hundred pharmacies across the country on monday , where it will be available to patients , in five gram -lrb- 0.18 oz -rrb- pots or packets .
the drug will be sold for between € 40 and € 50 -lrb- $ 43.80- $ 54.80 -rrb- per bag , and patients will be expected to pay for their cannabis themselves .
there are no plans as yet to provide the drug as a subsidized health benefit .

hoping to avert a european union dominated by larger nations , representatives from 15 mostly smaller current and future eu members have met in prague to discuss changes to a draft european constitution . a 105-member convention this spring , led by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , unveiled a blueprint constitution that aims to streamline the eu ’ s institutions and make it capable of functioning when the bloc expands from 15 to 25 members next year . although the constitution would consolidate various eu treaties and likely make the bloc more transparent and governable , it has unsettled smaller countries that fear their interests could be swept aside in the name of efficiency .
meeting in prague on monday , officials from 15 nations agreed to adopt a common negotiating position before an intergovernmental conference in october that will hammer out the final shape of the european constitution . officials from slovakia , hungary , greece , finland , austria , sweden , denmark , lithuania , latvia , estonia , ireland , portugal , slovenia and the czech republic attended the meeting , amounting to the strongest challenge so far to the eu ’ s larger countries and their alleged intentions to consolidate the bloc ’ s power . “ there is a certain agreement , so it can be expected that in these areas , i do n't want to say there will be common proposals , but certainly some synergy during the intergovernmental conference , ” czech deputy foreign minister jan kohout told reuters after the summit . poland , with around 40 million citizens by far the largest candidate country , also attended the “ dwarf summit ” in prague , but smaller current eu members the netherlands , belgium and luxembourg did not . “ one country , one commissioner ” kohout said the representatives accepted 90 to 95 percent of the proposed constitution and did not want to derail the draft , but that some changes were necessary .
he said they had agreed that each eu country should retain its own representative at the european commission . as it now stands , the new constitution would limit the size of the commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies , to 15 executive members .
presently , each country is guaranteed one commissioner and larger nations have two .
the smaller nations want to see each member guaranteed a commissioner to protect their national interests in brussels . “ the overwhelming majority are for the principle of ‘ one country , one commissioner ’ , ” kohout said . some smaller countries also want the eu to keep its system of a rotating presidency instead of electing a permanent chairman and they also want to ditch the proposed voting system , under which decisions would be taken by a majority of countries representing at least 60 percent of the eu 's population . “ many states joining on may 1 , 2004 have only been sovereign since the political changes in 1989 .

hoping to avert a european union dominated by larger nations , representatives from 15 mostly smaller current and future eu members have met in prague to discuss changes to a draft european constitution . a 105-member convention this spring , led by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , unveiled a blueprint constitution that aims to streamline the eu ’ s institutions and make it capable of functioning when the bloc expands from 15 to 25 members next year . although the constitution would consolidate various eu treaties and likely make the bloc more transparent and governable , it has unsettled smaller countries that fear their interests could be swept aside in the name of efficiency .
meeting in prague on monday , officials from 15 nations agreed to adopt a common negotiating position before an intergovernmental conference in october that will hammer out the final shape of the european constitution . officials from slovakia , hungary , greece , finland , austria , sweden , denmark , lithuania , latvia , estonia , ireland , portugal , slovenia and the czech republic attended the meeting , amounting to the strongest challenge so far to the eu ’ s larger countries and their alleged intentions to consolidate the bloc ’ s power . “ there is a certain agreement , so it can be expected that in these areas , i do n't want to say there will be common proposals , but certainly some synergy during the intergovernmental conference , ” czech deputy foreign minister jan kohout told reuters after the summit . poland , with around 40 million citizens by far the largest candidate country , also attended the “ dwarf summit ” in prague , but smaller current eu members the netherlands , belgium and luxembourg did not . “ one country , one commissioner ” kohout said the representatives accepted 90 to 95 percent of the proposed constitution and did not want to derail the draft , but that some changes were necessary .
he said they had agreed that each eu country should retain its own representative at the european commission . as it now stands , the new constitution would limit the size of the commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies , to 15 executive members .
presently , each country is guaranteed one commissioner and larger nations have two .
the smaller nations want to see each member guaranteed a commissioner to protect their national interests in brussels . “ the overwhelming majority are for the principle of ‘ one country , one commissioner ’ , ” kohout said . some smaller countries also want the eu to keep its system of a rotating presidency instead of electing a permanent chairman and they also want to ditch the proposed voting system , under which decisions would be taken by a majority of countries representing at least 60 percent of the eu 's population . “ many states joining on may 1 , 2004 have only been sovereign since the political changes in 1989 .

the decision by the dutch government to legalize cannabis prescriptions for patients suffering from serious illnesses has aroused the interest of countries in europe and beyond . in a move that raised few eyebrows in the netherlands and caused other countries around the world to turn their curiosity and interest towards the liberal european nation , the dutch government legalized the medical use of cannabis on monday , paving the way for doctors to prescribe the narcotic as a painkiller for those who are seriously ill . the decision to permit cannabis for the relief of symptoms related to the treatment of terminal cancer , aids and hiv , and for patients with multiple sclerosis or tourette 's syndrome , is the latest in a list of pioneering social reforms in the netherlands . however , whereas the dutch decisions to legalize euthanasia and sell cannabis for recreational use in licensed coffee shops caused controversy in the international arena , the move to permit cannabis for medical purposes has attracted the attention of other countries that have been considering similar initiatives - especially in europe .
all eyes on holland the dutch health ministry says it has already fielded calls for progress reports from officials in germany , britain , belgium and luxembourg .
britain announced plans to begin testing cannabis for medical purposes earlier this year with the possibility of the government making it legal for doctors to prescribe their patients starting in 2004 if tests prove conclusive .
germany already legally provides patients with oral pills and liquids , such as the pharmaceutically manufactured products marinol and nabilone , which contain tetrahydrocannabinol -lrb- thc -rrb- , one of the active compounds found in cannabis .
according to dr. franjo grotenherman from the international association for cannabis as medicine -lrb- iacm -rrb- , the german government agreed in 1999 to work on creating a formula for a cannabis extract that could be used as a medical treatment .
the government passed the responsibility for developing the formula to the german pharmaceutical association , which announced two months ago that their work was complete .
“ but now the winds have changed , ” dr. grotenherman told deutsche welle .
“ at the time of the agreement on the formula , we had a green party minister in health , now the minister is from the spd and is a little more sceptical . ”
dr. grotenherman added that the process had now slowed down even after the bundestag voted in support of developing cannabis for medical use in 2001 .
the dutch move may now grease the wheels , he hoped .
a report in 2002 by the vienna-based international narcotics control board -lrb- incb -rrb- suggested that decisions by italy , luxembourg , portugal and spain to decriminalize the drug could also open up possibilities for developing cannabis for medical use .
us , canada and australia monitoring elsewhere in the world , the duitch experience will be carefully monitored parts of the united states , australia and canada that began to sell and distribute marijuana for medical use in july were all considering following suit and prescribing the drug through medical sources .
federal law has made it difficult for american states to implement medical marijuana laws .
in california , where the drug could be legally used for medical purposes , federal prosecutors used national laws to convict professionals involved in prescribing or supplying cannabis .
the dutch decision came after extensive tests on the medical benefits of the drug that began in 1996 .
there has yet to be any concrete evidence of physiological change from using the drug in its medical form , but research shows certain alleviating effects in patients .
" there is no scientific proof that it works , " said a health ministry spokesman , " but repeated use indicates that an effect does exist . "
claims of effectiveness cannabis is claimed to be effective in reducing nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy , of reducing tension in glaucoma patients and in improving the appetite of those suffering from hiv and aids .
it is also said to be effective in treating multiple sclerosis and certain nervous disorders .
experts at the dutch health ministry have recommended that the drug only be taken via an inhaler or mixed with tea and not smoked .
based on these findings , the dutch government has given permission for two cultivators - the stichting institute of medical marijuana -lrb- simm -rrb- and the firm bedrocan - to supply pharmacists with strictly regulated dosages of cannabis .
the cannabis provided by the two companies is rigorously tested for impurities by the bureau for medicinal cannabis , which also organizes its distribution .
available now the government-contracted suppliers began transporting the drug to several hundred pharmacies across the country on monday , where it will be available to patients , in five gram -lrb- 0.18 oz -rrb- pots or packets .
the drug will be sold for between € 40 and € 50 -lrb- $ 43.80- $ 54.80 -rrb- per bag , and patients will be expected to pay for their cannabis themselves .
there are no plans as yet to provide the drug as a subsidized health benefit .
the dutch health ministry expects the drug to be initially available to between 4,000 and 7,000 patients , rising to 15,000 within a year .
government estimates put the number of people who are already regularly taking cannabis for medical reasons at around 7,000 , with many either buying it in coffee shops or receiving it illegally from doctors and chemists , according to health ministry estimates .
" it was ridiculous that people were using this drug while no doctor was permitted to prescribe it , despite the fact that scientific studies showed benefits , " a dutch health ministry official said .
less expensive relief on the street cannabis is available in licensed coffee shops in the netherlands at almost half the price of the government regulated drug , although the strength and quality of the product from illegal channels can not be guaranteed .

when inspectors visited cardiff six months ago they found the victorian prison held 150 more prisoners than it should .
and although 87 % of inmates have been involved with drugs , either as users or dealers , there are no specific detox or rehabilitation facilities .
but preparations are under way to address the problem and the welsh assembly has provided money for a 60-bed treatment unit .
chief inspector of prisons anne owers said : " local prisons like cardiff hold a huge variety of prisoners - but some are held for quite a long time - even prisoners who are on remand awaiting trial can spend weeks or months in prison before that happens .
" it is trying to make sure things happen to them within the prison which means they do n't just return as soon as they have gone out again .
" drug detoxification and treatment work is critical to that as well . "
reacting to the report on tuesday , cardiff prison governor paul tidball said it was keeping drugs out of the prison that was one of the main problems .
" the most common way for drugs to be smuggled into prisons in this country is through visits , " he said .
" in british prisons , most prisoners are able to embrace and have some close contact with their visitors so it is about the balance between decency and security and we do n't , as in the movies , stick people behind glass screens so they can touch each other through the glass . "
cardiff 's city centre prison has cramped conditions according to the report , published on tuesday , the majority of prisoners - a total of 87 % - felt reasonably safe at cardiff and suicide prevention and care were also commended .
even so , the study concluded that more education facilities , and more workshops needed to be in place as only 63 % of prisoners benefited from access to a purposeful activity .
in a separate report by the prison reform trust last month , cardiff jail was found to be the sixth most overcrowded prison in england and wales .
cardiff was also above the england and wales average for the number of positive drug tests carried out .

when inspectors visited cardiff six months ago they found the victorian prison held 150 more prisoners than it should .
and although 87 % of inmates have been involved with drugs , either as users or dealers , there are no specific detox or rehabilitation facilities .
but preparations are under way to address the problem and the welsh assembly has provided money for a 60-bed treatment unit .
chief inspector of prisons anne owers said : " local prisons like cardiff hold a huge variety of prisoners - but some are held for quite a long time - even prisoners who are on remand awaiting trial can spend weeks or months in prison before that happens .
" it is trying to make sure things happen to them within the prison which means they do n't just return as soon as they have gone out again .
" drug detoxification and treatment work is critical to that as well . "
reacting to the report on tuesday , cardiff prison governor paul tidball said it was keeping drugs out of the prison that was one of the main problems .
" the most common way for drugs to be smuggled into prisons in this country is through visits , " he said .
" in british prisons , most prisoners are able to embrace and have some close contact with their visitors so it is about the balance between decency and security and we do n't , as in the movies , stick people behind glass screens so they can touch each other through the glass . "
according to the report , published on tuesday , the majority of prisoners - a total of 87 % - felt reasonably safe at cardiff and suicide prevention and care were also commended .
even so , the study concluded that more education facilities , and more workshops needed to be in place as only 63 % of prisoners benefited from access to a purposeful activity .
in a separate report by the prison reform trust last month , cardiff jail was found to be the sixth most overcrowded prison in england and wales .
cardiff was also above the england and wales average for the number of positive drug tests carried out .

a survey in a north wales town has revealed serious problems among the teaching staff .
more than 2,000 questionnaires were sent out by wrexham council after concerns were raised by the health and safety executive .
the council received 600 replies from teaching and administrative staff working in schools across the county borough .
of those surveyed , 10 % said they were taking some form of anti-depressant and 30 % said they were drinking more alcohol than they used to .
a previous survey , carried out in 2001 by the office for national statistics , identified 25 % of the uk population had raised or ' hazardous ' patterns of drinking . "
it 's a picture of reality and it needs to be tackled " paul davies nasuwt " i think the problem of teaching stress has grown , " said paul davies , wrexham secretary of the nasuwt .
" in this survey 77 % said they were fatigued , 64 % said their workload was impossible and 30 % dreaded going to work .
" it 's a picture of reality and it needs to be tackled , " he added .
more than a quarter of respondents questioned admitted suffering from raised blood pressure levels and high numbers reported muscular pains and headaches .
wrexham council estimated that absenteeism through stress related illness cost the education authority around £ 200,000 a year .
workload staff who responded to the stress survey also claimed they were underpaid , overworked and did not receive sufficient support from the local education authority , nor from management .
mr davies , a teacher for more than 25 years , said the two main problems that need to be tackled are excessive workload and a perceived lack of discipline among pupils .
on tuesday , councillors will consider an action plan to tackle the issue which includes subscribing to a helpline for all staff run by the teacher support line cymru .
the service , which would complement the occupational health service , would cost up to £ 20,000 per year .
it is proposed that the local education authority funds the first year of provision in the hope it will reduce sickness costs by up to 20 % .

shorter opening hours , and a ban on trading while a licensing appeal is being considered , are on the cards , he was set to warn .
the crackdown could also see a fall in the number of off-licences in some towns .
mr mcconnell , who visited livingston , west lothian , on monday night to witness the problems posed by drunken behaviour , announced the setting up of an urgent review on the regulation of off-licences , building on the recommendations of the nicholson report on licensing reform . "
shorter opening hours and a ban on trading while an appeal is being considered may be some of the ways we can tighten up on off-licences " jack mcconnell , first minister as well as stopping off-licences becoming the focus of loutish behaviour , he wants the review to find ways of giving local people a greater say before licences are granted .
public concerns about off-licences came to the fore during the may election campaign when mr mcconnell and home secretary david blunkett visited cardonald on the south side of glasgow .
on a tour of the area he heard of youngsters urinating in the street near off-licences , too drunk to get to the nearest park .
research has indicated that half of all 15-year-olds bought drink illegally in the last 12 months , with small licensed grocers and corner shops the most common source .
violence concern mr mcconnell said public concerns of violent behaviour around off-licences and under-age drinking had again been voiced to ministers over the summer recess .
" too often these off-licenses are in the middle of neighbourhoods where is a large concentration of young families and pensioners , " he said .
" decent hard-working families and our elderly people must be allowed to live in peace and security , and their view must be heard before any decision is made on granting off-licences . "
he said sheriff principal gordon nicholson 's review of licensing laws provided a tougher framework for licensed premises like corner-shops and off-licences , but left it open to the executive to come up with detailed proposals for tougher enforcement .
" and that is what we will do , " pledged the first minister .
" i do not wish to pre-empt the review , but shorter opening hours and a ban on trading while an appeal is being considered may be some of the ways we can tighten up on off-licences .
" i am also concerned about reports that there are too many off-licences being granted in some towns and communities . "
but mr mcconnell 's pledges were dismissed as " cheap , opportunistic soundbites " , by scottish tory justice spokeswoman annabel goldie . "
a daily cheap headline may please mr mcconnell but it does n't impress those who have to live with the daily threat of young hooligans " annabel goldie , tory justice spokeswoman miss goldie acknowledged the serious problems of alcohol being sold to underage youths , but claimed people were " sick and tired of the government 's jaw , jaw , jaw " .
" a daily cheap headline may please mr mcconnell but it does n't impress those who have to live with the daily threat of young hooligans tearing apart their communities , " she said .
nationalists echoed tory calls for the existing law to be better enforced , highlighting the fact that there have been just 346 convictions in scotland for selling alcohol to someone underage since 1999 .
snp justice spokeswoman nicola sturgeon said : " jack mcconnell is making all the right noises on underage drinking , but when we look at what he has actually been doing we see a different picture .
" it 's time to prosecute the pushers of underage drinking and target those off-licenses that night after night fuel trouble on our streets . "
a working group led by peter daniels , chief executive of east renfrewshire council , will report to ministers in december .

" too often these off-licenses are in the middle of neighbourhoods where is a large concentration of young families and pensioners , " he said .
" decent hard-working families and our elderly people must be allowed to live in peace and security , and their view must be heard before any decision is made on granting off-licences . "
a review of drinking laws is under way he said sheriff principal gordon nicholson 's review of licensing laws provided a tougher framework for licensed premises like corner-shops and off-licences , but left it open to the executive to come up with detailed proposals for tougher enforcement .
" and that is what we will do , " pledged the first minister .
" i do not wish to pre-empt the review , but shorter opening hours and a ban on trading while an appeal is being considered may be some of the ways we can tighten up on off-licences .
" i am also concerned about reports that there are too many off-licences being granted in some towns and communities . "
but mr mcconnell 's pledges were dismissed as " cheap , opportunistic soundbites " , by scottish tory justice spokeswoman annabel goldie .

" a daily cheap headline may please mr mcconnell but it does n't impress those who have to live with the daily threat of young hooligans tearing apart their communities , " she said .
nationalists echoed tory calls for the existing law to be better enforced , highlighting the fact that there have been just 346 convictions in scotland for selling alcohol to someone underage since 1999 .
snp justice spokeswoman nicola sturgeon said : " jack mcconnell is making all the right noises on underage drinking , but when we look at what he has actually been doing we see a different picture .
" it 's time to prosecute the pushers of underage drinking and target those off-licenses that night after night fuel trouble on our streets . "

the crackdown could also see a fall in the number of off-licences in some towns .
mr mcconnell , who visited livingston , west lothian , on monday night to witness the problems posed by drunken behaviour , announced the setting up of an urgent review on the regulation of off-licences , building on the recommendations of the nicholson report on licensing reform .
shorter opening hours and a ban on trading while an appeal is being considered may be some of the ways we can tighten up on off-licences jack mcconnell , first minister as well as stopping off-licences becoming the focus of loutish behaviour , he wants the review to find ways of giving local people a greater say before licences are granted .
public concerns about off-licences came to the fore during the may election campaign when mr mcconnell and home secretary david blunkett visited cardonald on the south side of glasgow .
on a tour of the area he heard of youngsters urinating in the street near off-licences , too drunk to get to the nearest park .
research has indicated that half of all 15-year-olds bought drink illegally in the last 12 months , with small licensed grocers and corner shops the most common source .
violence concern mr mcconnell said public concerns of violent behaviour around off-licences and under-age drinking had again been voiced to ministers over the summer recess .
" too often these off-licenses are in the middle of neighbourhoods where is a large concentration of young families and pensioners , " he said .
" decent hard-working families and our elderly people must be allowed to live in peace and security , and their view must be heard before any decision is made on granting off-licences . "
a review of drinking laws is under way he said sheriff principal gordon nicholson 's review of licensing laws provided a tougher framework for licensed premises like corner-shops and off-licences , but left it open to the executive to come up with detailed proposals for tougher enforcement .
" and that is what we will do , " pledged the first minister .
" i do not wish to pre-empt the review , but shorter opening hours and a ban on trading while an appeal is being considered may be some of the ways we can tighten up on off-licences .
" i am also concerned about reports that there are too many off-licences being granted in some towns and communities . "
but mr mcconnell 's pledges were dismissed as " cheap , opportunistic soundbites " , by scottish tory justice spokeswoman annabel goldie .
a daily cheap headline may please mr mcconnell but it does n't impress those who have to live with the daily threat of young hooligans annabel goldie , tory justice spokeswoman miss goldie acknowledged the serious problems of alcohol being sold to underage youths , but claimed people were " sick and tired of the government 's jaw , jaw , jaw " .
" a daily cheap headline may please mr mcconnell but it does n't impress those who have to live with the daily threat of young hooligans tearing apart their communities , " she said .
nationalists echoed tory calls for the existing law to be better enforced , highlighting the fact that there have been just 346 convictions in scotland for selling alcohol to someone underage since 1999 .
snp justice spokeswoman nicola sturgeon said : " jack mcconnell is making all the right noises on underage drinking , but when we look at what he has actually been doing we see a different picture .
" it 's time to prosecute the pushers of underage drinking and target those off-licenses that night after night fuel trouble on our streets . "
a working group led by peter daniels , chief executive of east renfrewshire council , will report to ministers in december .
