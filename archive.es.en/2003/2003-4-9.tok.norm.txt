german foreign minister fischer wrapped up his three-day visit to the middle east on wednesday by urging palestinians to speed up reforms in order to facilitate a “ road map ” for peace in the intifada-torn region . in a speech overshadowed by an israeli attack on a palestinian vehicle in gaza city that claimed five lives , german foreign minister joschka fischer called on both israelis and palestinians to end their cycle of violence on wednesday , the last day of his three-day tour of the middle east .
speaking in ramallah after meeting with beleaguered palestinian leader yasser arafat in his battered headquarters and prime minister-designate mahmoud abbas , fischer said : " stop terror , stop violence and come back to the negotiating table . "
fischer also had a specific message for the palestinians : speed up cabinet-building and the reform process and pave the way for the official implementation of the west ’ s " road map , " which according to the minister is " a very dynamic element in the hands of the palestinians . "
palestinian cabinet building the " road map " to peace is a plan hammered out by the so-called middle east quartet , which includes the european union , the united nations , the united states and russia .
it aims to bring both the palestinians and israelis back to the negotiating table and involves a series of steps aimed at creating a palestinian state by 2005 .
most importantly , the united states , which plays a leading role in the implementation of the " road map , " insists that moderate palestinian prime minister-designate abbas , the first ever to occupy the new position , should first form a cabinet before it releases details of the peace plan .
mahmoud abbas , also known as abu mazen , is seen by both the eu and the u.s. as a leader who could contribute significantly towards lasting peace in the middle east - largely owing to his moderate stance towards israel .
abbas , appointed by arafat under intense pressure from palestinian legislators and international mediators , has criticized the use of armed attacks on israelis in the uprising or " intifada " as unproductive .
fischer calls for accelerated reforms the u.s. insistence that the palestinian cabinet-building should be a prelude to the release of the " road map " is a point that foreign minister fischer reiterated during his diplomatic trip .
" it ’ s of absolute importance to speed up the building of the new government and reforms , " fischer said on wednesday .
" everything depends on the palestinian government . "
abbas ’ newly-formed government is expected to launch a new reform drive to root out corruption in the palestinian authority and curb violence in the 30-month-old palestinian uprising .
fischer ’ s attempts to revive the " road map " are also seen to target the u.s. , which has often postponed its publication in consideration of israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
many eu nations have been urging the u.s. to once again play a leading mediating role in the middle east conflict .
the german foreign minister also met with representatives of the palestinian reform committee in ramallah on wednesday , who assured him that the reform process in the autonomous palestinian territories would continue .
representatives of the committee said it was also necessary to hold palestinian elections as part of the reform process .
fischer also reasserted his support for abbas and urged both israeli prime minister ariel sharon and foreign minister silvan schalom in meetings on monday and tuesday in israel to " fully support " abbas and accept the " road map " to peace .
fischer plays balancing act between abbas and arafat but despite the successful three-day visit , there is little doubt that fischer ’ s task of playing mediator in the middle east the past three days was far from easy given the inner-palestinian conflict in particular between abbas and arafat .
the pro-reform and progressive abbas remains controversial among the palestinian population for what is seen as his " soft position " towards israel .
the americans , europeans and the israelis expect abbas to dismantle the palestinian security apparatus controlled by arafat and create new transparent structures .
it 's a move that is hardly likely to please arafat , who is reluctant to relinquish his hold on the autonomous territories .
abbas also has to ensure that the palestinians do n't regard him as a mere puppet of washington especially given the fact that the u.s. and its allies are unpopular at the moment with the palestinians on account of the iraq war .
at the same time fischer ’ s meeting with arafat , who still enjoys widespread support among the palestinians and is seen to be the one who dictates abbas ’ fate , was seen as a controversial move by many .
leading israeli politicians criticized fischer ’ s meeting with arafat , who they say is responsible for much of the violence directed at israelis and is a hindrance to a peaceful solution to the middle east conflict .
arafat also remains boycotted by the u.s. new palestinian government-building soon ?
fischer is reported to have told arafat on wednesday that a real breakthrough was needed in the palestinian reform process , hinting that abbas ’ efforts to form a cabinet swiftly should be supported .
soon after the meeting with fischer , arafat told reporters in his office that abbas had received an extension to form a new cabinet .
arafat had initially offered last month to make abbas the first-ever palestinian prime minister and had given him three weeks to present a cabinet to the palestinian legislative council -lrb- plc -rrb- .
that deadline ended on tuesday .

it aims to bring both the palestinians and israelis back to the negotiating table and involves a series of steps aimed at creating a palestinian state by 2005 .
most importantly , the united states , which plays a leading role in the implementation of the " road map , " insists that moderate palestinian prime minister-designate abbas , the first ever to occupy the new position , should first form a cabinet before it releases details of the peace plan .
mahmoud abbas , also known as abu mazen , is seen by both the eu and the u.s. as a leader who could contribute significantly towards lasting peace in the middle east - largely owing to his moderate stance towards israel .
abbas , appointed by arafat under intense pressure from palestinian legislators and international mediators , has criticized the use of armed attacks on israelis in the uprising or " intifada " as unproductive .
fischer calls for accelerated reforms the u.s. insistence that the palestinian cabinet-building should be a prelude to the release of the " road map " is a point that foreign minister fischer reiterated during his diplomatic trip .
" it ’ s of absolute importance to speed up the building of the new government and reforms , " fischer said on wednesday .
" everything depends on the palestinian government . "
abbas ’ newly-formed government is expected to launch a new reform drive to root out corruption in the palestinian authority and curb violence in the 30-month-old palestinian uprising .
fischer ’ s attempts to revive the " road map " are also seen to target the u.s. , which has often postponed its publication in consideration of israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
many eu nations have been urging the u.s. to once again play a leading mediating role in the middle east conflict .
the german foreign minister also met with representatives of the palestinian reform committee in ramallah on wednesday , who assured him that the reform process in the autonomous palestinian territories would continue .
representatives of the committee said it was also necessary to hold palestinian elections as part of the reform process .
fischer also reasserted his support for abbas and urged both israeli prime minister ariel sharon and foreign minister silvan schalom in meetings on monday and tuesday in israel to " fully support " abbas and accept the " road map " to peace .
fischer plays balancing act between abbas and arafat but despite the successful three-day visit , there is little doubt that fischer ’ s task of playing mediator in the middle east the past three days was far from easy given the inner-palestinian conflict in particular between abbas and arafat .
the pro-reform and progressive abbas remains controversial among the palestinian population for what is seen as his " soft position " towards israel .
the americans , europeans and the israelis expect abbas to dismantle the palestinian security apparatus controlled by arafat and create new transparent structures .
it 's a move that is hardly likely to please arafat , who is reluctant to relinquish his hold on the autonomous territories .
abbas also has to ensure that the palestinians do n't regard him as a mere puppet of washington especially given the fact that the u.s. and its allies are unpopular at the moment with the palestinians on account of the iraq war .
at the same time fischer ’ s meeting with arafat , who still enjoys widespread support among the palestinians and is seen to be the one who dictates abbas ’ fate , was seen as a controversial move by many .
leading israeli politicians criticized fischer ’ s meeting with arafat , who they say is responsible for much of the violence directed at israelis and is a hindrance to a peaceful solution to the middle east conflict .
arafat also remains boycotted by the u.s. new palestinian government-building soon ?
fischer is reported to have told arafat on wednesday that a real breakthrough was needed in the palestinian reform process , hinting that abbas ’ efforts to form a cabinet swiftly should be supported .
soon after the meeting with fischer , arafat told reporters in his office that abbas had received an extension to form a new cabinet .
arafat had initially offered last month to make abbas the first-ever palestinian prime minister and had given him three weeks to present a cabinet to the palestinian legislative council -lrb- plc -rrb- .
that deadline ended on tuesday .

fischer plays balancing act between abbas and arafat but despite the successful three-day visit , there is little doubt that fischer ’ s task of playing mediator in the middle east the past three days was far from easy given the inner-palestinian conflict in particular between abbas and arafat .
the pro-reform and progressive abbas remains controversial among the palestinian population for what is seen as his " soft position " towards israel .
the americans , europeans and the israelis expect abbas to dismantle the palestinian security apparatus controlled by arafat and create new transparent structures .
it 's a move that is hardly likely to please arafat , who is reluctant to relinquish his hold on the autonomous territories .

fischer is reported to have told arafat on wednesday that a real breakthrough was needed in the palestinian reform process , hinting that abbas ’ efforts to form a cabinet swiftly should be supported .

german foreign minister fischer wrapped up his three-day visit to the middle east on wednesday by urging palestinians to speed up reforms in order to facilitate a “ road map ” for peace in the intifada-torn region . in a speech overshadowed by an israeli attack on a palestinian vehicle in gaza city that claimed five lives , german foreign minister joschka fischer called on both israelis and palestinians to end their cycle of violence on wednesday , the last day of his three-day tour of the middle east .
speaking in ramallah after meeting with beleaguered palestinian leader yasser arafat in his battered headquarters and prime minister-designate mahmoud abbas , fischer said : " stop terror , stop violence and come back to the negotiating table . "
fischer also had a specific message for the palestinians : speed up cabinet-building and the reform process and pave the way for the official implementation of the west ’ s " road map , " which according to the minister is " a very dynamic element in the hands of the palestinians . "
palestinian cabinet building the " road map " to peace is a plan hammered out by the so-called middle east quartet , which includes the european union , the united nations , the united states and russia .
it aims to bring both the palestinians and israelis back to the negotiating table and involves a series of steps aimed at creating a palestinian state by 2005 .
most importantly , the united states , which plays a leading role in the implementation of the " road map , " insists that moderate palestinian prime minister-designate abbas , the first ever to occupy the new position , should first form a cabinet before it releases details of the peace plan .
mahmoud abbas , also known as abu mazen , is seen by both the eu and the u.s. as a leader who could contribute significantly towards lasting peace in the middle east - largely owing to his moderate stance towards israel .
abbas , appointed by arafat under intense pressure from palestinian legislators and international mediators , has criticized the use of armed attacks on israelis in the uprising or " intifada " as unproductive .
fischer calls for accelerated reforms the u.s. insistence that the palestinian cabinet-building should be a prelude to the release of the " road map " is a point that foreign minister fischer reiterated during his diplomatic trip .
" it ’ s of absolute importance to speed up the building of the new government and reforms , " fischer said on wednesday .
" everything depends on the palestinian government . "
abbas ’ newly-formed government is expected to launch a new reform drive to root out corruption in the palestinian authority and curb violence in the 30-month-old palestinian uprising .
fischer ’ s attempts to revive the " road map " are also seen to target the u.s. , which has often postponed its publication in consideration of israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
many eu nations have been urging the u.s. to once again play a leading mediating role in the middle east conflict .
the german foreign minister also met with representatives of the palestinian reform committee in ramallah on wednesday , who assured him that the reform process in the autonomous palestinian territories would continue .
representatives of the committee said it was also necessary to hold palestinian elections as part of the reform process .

german foreign minister fischer wrapped up his three-day visit to the middle east on wednesday by urging palestinians to speed up reforms in order to facilitate a “ road map ” for peace in the intifada-torn region . in a speech overshadowed by an israeli attack on a palestinian vehicle in gaza city that claimed five lives , german foreign minister joschka fischer called on both israelis and palestinians to end their cycle of violence on wednesday , the last day of his three-day tour of the middle east .
speaking in ramallah after meeting with beleaguered palestinian leader yasser arafat in his battered headquarters and prime minister-designate mahmoud abbas , fischer said : " stop terror , stop violence and come back to the negotiating table . "
fischer also had a specific message for the palestinians : speed up cabinet-building and the reform process and pave the way for the official implementation of the west ’ s " road map , " which according to the minister is " a very dynamic element in the hands of the palestinians . "
palestinian cabinet building the " road map " to peace is a plan hammered out by the so-called middle east quartet , which includes the european union , the united nations , the united states and russia .
it aims to bring both the palestinians and israelis back to the negotiating table and involves a series of steps aimed at creating a palestinian state by 2005 .
most importantly , the united states , which plays a leading role in the implementation of the " road map , " insists that moderate palestinian prime minister-designate abbas , the first ever to occupy the new position , should first form a cabinet before it releases details of the peace plan .
mahmoud abbas , also known as abu mazen , is seen by both the eu and the u.s. as a leader who could contribute significantly towards lasting peace in the middle east - largely owing to his moderate stance towards israel .
abbas , appointed by arafat under intense pressure from palestinian legislators and international mediators , has criticized the use of armed attacks on israelis in the uprising or " intifada " as unproductive .
fischer calls for accelerated reforms the u.s. insistence that the palestinian cabinet-building should be a prelude to the release of the " road map " is a point that foreign minister fischer reiterated during his diplomatic trip .
" it ’ s of absolute importance to speed up the building of the new government and reforms , " fischer said on wednesday .
" everything depends on the palestinian government . "
abbas ’ newly-formed government is expected to launch a new reform drive to root out corruption in the palestinian authority and curb violence in the 30-month-old palestinian uprising .
fischer ’ s attempts to revive the " road map " are also seen to target the u.s. , which has often postponed its publication in consideration of israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
many eu nations have been urging the u.s. to once again play a leading mediating role in the middle east conflict .
the german foreign minister also met with representatives of the palestinian reform committee in ramallah on wednesday , who assured him that the reform process in the autonomous palestinian territories would continue .
representatives of the committee said it was also necessary to hold palestinian elections as part of the reform process .
fischer also reasserted his support for abbas and urged both israeli prime minister ariel sharon and foreign minister silvan schalom in meetings on monday and tuesday in israel to " fully support " abbas and accept the " road map " to peace .
fischer plays balancing act between abbas and arafat but despite the successful three-day visit , there is little doubt that fischer ’ s task of playing mediator in the middle east the past three days was far from easy given the inner-palestinian conflict in particular between abbas and arafat .
the pro-reform and progressive abbas remains controversial among the palestinian population for what is seen as his " soft position " towards israel .
the americans , europeans and the israelis expect abbas to dismantle the palestinian security apparatus controlled by arafat and create new transparent structures .
it 's a move that is hardly likely to please arafat , who is reluctant to relinquish his hold on the autonomous territories .
abbas also has to ensure that the palestinians do n't regard him as a mere puppet of washington especially given the fact that the u.s. and its allies are unpopular at the moment with the palestinians on account of the iraq war .
at the same time fischer ’ s meeting with arafat , who still enjoys widespread support among the palestinians and is seen to be the one who dictates abbas ’ fate , was seen as a controversial move by many .
leading israeli politicians criticized fischer ’ s meeting with arafat , who they say is responsible for much of the violence directed at israelis and is a hindrance to a peaceful solution to the middle east conflict .
arafat also remains boycotted by the u.s. new palestinian government-building soon ?
fischer is reported to have told arafat on wednesday that a real breakthrough was needed in the palestinian reform process , hinting that abbas ’ efforts to form a cabinet swiftly should be supported .
soon after the meeting with fischer , arafat told reporters in his office that abbas had received an extension to form a new cabinet .
arafat had initially offered last month to make abbas the first-ever palestinian prime minister and had given him three weeks to present a cabinet to the palestinian legislative council -lrb- plc -rrb- .
that deadline ended on tuesday .

german foreign minister fischer wrapped up his three-day visit to the middle east on wednesday by urging palestinians to speed up reforms in order to facilitate a “ road map ” for peace in the intifada-torn region . in a speech overshadowed by an israeli attack on a palestinian vehicle in gaza city that claimed five lives , german foreign minister joschka fischer called on both israelis and palestinians to end their cycle of violence on wednesday , the last day of his three-day tour of the middle east .
speaking in ramallah after meeting with beleaguered palestinian leader yasser arafat in his battered headquarters and prime minister-designate mahmoud abbas , fischer said : " stop terror , stop violence and come back to the negotiating table . "
fischer also had a specific message for the palestinians : speed up cabinet-building and the reform process and pave the way for the official implementation of the west ’ s " road map , " which according to the minister is " a very dynamic element in the hands of the palestinians . "
palestinian cabinet building the " road map " to peace is a plan hammered out by the so-called middle east quartet , which includes the european union , the united nations , the united states and russia .
it aims to bring both the palestinians and israelis back to the negotiating table and involves a series of steps aimed at creating a palestinian state by 2005 .
most importantly , the united states , which plays a leading role in the implementation of the " road map , " insists that moderate palestinian prime minister-designate abbas , the first ever to occupy the new position , should first form a cabinet before it releases details of the peace plan .
mahmoud abbas , also known as abu mazen , is seen by both the eu and the u.s. as a leader who could contribute significantly towards lasting peace in the middle east - largely owing to his moderate stance towards israel .
abbas , appointed by arafat under intense pressure from palestinian legislators and international mediators , has criticized the use of armed attacks on israelis in the uprising or " intifada " as unproductive .
fischer calls for accelerated reforms the u.s. insistence that the palestinian cabinet-building should be a prelude to the release of the " road map " is a point that foreign minister fischer reiterated during his diplomatic trip .
" it ’ s of absolute importance to speed up the building of the new government and reforms , " fischer said on wednesday .
" everything depends on the palestinian government . "
abbas ’ newly-formed government is expected to launch a new reform drive to root out corruption in the palestinian authority and curb violence in the 30-month-old palestinian uprising .
fischer ’ s attempts to revive the " road map " are also seen to target the u.s. , which has often postponed its publication in consideration of israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
many eu nations have been urging the u.s. to once again play a leading mediating role in the middle east conflict .
the german foreign minister also met with representatives of the palestinian reform committee in ramallah on wednesday , who assured him that the reform process in the autonomous palestinian territories would continue .
representatives of the committee said it was also necessary to hold palestinian elections as part of the reform process .
fischer also reasserted his support for abbas and urged both israeli prime minister ariel sharon and foreign minister silvan schalom in meetings on monday and tuesday in israel to " fully support " abbas and accept the " road map " to peace .
fischer plays balancing act between abbas and arafat but despite the successful three-day visit , there is little doubt that fischer ’ s task of playing mediator in the middle east the past three days was far from easy given the inner-palestinian conflict in particular between abbas and arafat .
the pro-reform and progressive abbas remains controversial among the palestinian population for what is seen as his " soft position " towards israel .
the americans , europeans and the israelis expect abbas to dismantle the palestinian security apparatus controlled by arafat and create new transparent structures .
it 's a move that is hardly likely to please arafat , who is reluctant to relinquish his hold on the autonomous territories .
abbas also has to ensure that the palestinians do n't regard him as a mere puppet of washington especially given the fact that the u.s. and its allies are unpopular at the moment with the palestinians on account of the iraq war .
at the same time fischer ’ s meeting with arafat , who still enjoys widespread support among the palestinians and is seen to be the one who dictates abbas ’ fate , was seen as a controversial move by many .
leading israeli politicians criticized fischer ’ s meeting with arafat , who they say is responsible for much of the violence directed at israelis and is a hindrance to a peaceful solution to the middle east conflict .
arafat also remains boycotted by the u.s. new palestinian government-building soon ?
fischer is reported to have told arafat on wednesday that a real breakthrough was needed in the palestinian reform process , hinting that abbas ’ efforts to form a cabinet swiftly should be supported .
soon after the meeting with fischer , arafat told reporters in his office that abbas had received an extension to form a new cabinet .
arafat had initially offered last month to make abbas the first-ever palestinian prime minister and had given him three weeks to present a cabinet to the palestinian legislative council -lrb- plc -rrb- .
that deadline ended on tuesday .

most importantly , the united states , which plays a leading role in the implementation of the " road map , " insists that moderate palestinian prime minister-designate abbas , the first ever to occupy the new position , should first form a cabinet before it releases details of the peace plan .
mahmoud abbas , also known as abu mazen , is seen by both the eu and the u.s. as a leader who could contribute significantly towards lasting peace in the middle east - largely owing to his moderate stance towards israel .
abbas , appointed by arafat under intense pressure from palestinian legislators and international mediators , has criticized the use of armed attacks on israelis in the uprising or " intifada " as unproductive .
fischer calls for accelerated reforms the u.s. insistence that the palestinian cabinet-building should be a prelude to the release of the " road map " is a point that foreign minister fischer reiterated during his diplomatic trip .
" it ’ s of absolute importance to speed up the building of the new government and reforms , " fischer said on wednesday .
" everything depends on the palestinian government . "
abbas ’ newly-formed government is expected to launch a new reform drive to root out corruption in the palestinian authority and curb violence in the 30-month-old palestinian uprising .
fischer ’ s attempts to revive the " road map " are also seen to target the u.s. , which has often postponed its publication in consideration of israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
many eu nations have been urging the u.s. to once again play a leading mediating role in the middle east conflict .
the german foreign minister also met with representatives of the palestinian reform committee in ramallah on wednesday , who assured him that the reform process in the autonomous palestinian territories would continue .
representatives of the committee said it was also necessary to hold palestinian elections as part of the reform process .
fischer also reasserted his support for abbas and urged both israeli prime minister ariel sharon and foreign minister silvan schalom in meetings on monday and tuesday in israel to " fully support " abbas and accept the " road map " to peace .
fischer plays balancing act between abbas and arafat but despite the successful three-day visit , there is little doubt that fischer ’ s task of playing mediator in the middle east the past three days was far from easy given the inner-palestinian conflict in particular between abbas and arafat .
the pro-reform and progressive abbas remains controversial among the palestinian population for what is seen as his " soft position " towards israel .
the americans , europeans and the israelis expect abbas to dismantle the palestinian security apparatus controlled by arafat and create new transparent structures .
it 's a move that is hardly likely to please arafat , who is reluctant to relinquish his hold on the autonomous territories .
abbas also has to ensure that the palestinians do n't regard him as a mere puppet of washington especially given the fact that the u.s. and its allies are unpopular at the moment with the palestinians on account of the iraq war .
at the same time fischer ’ s meeting with arafat , who still enjoys widespread support among the palestinians and is seen to be the one who dictates abbas ’ fate , was seen as a controversial move by many .
leading israeli politicians criticized fischer ’ s meeting with arafat , who they say is responsible for much of the violence directed at israelis and is a hindrance to a peaceful solution to the middle east conflict .
arafat also remains boycotted by the u.s. new palestinian government-building soon ?
fischer is reported to have told arafat on wednesday that a real breakthrough was needed in the palestinian reform process , hinting that abbas ’ efforts to form a cabinet swiftly should be supported .
soon after the meeting with fischer , arafat told reporters in his office that abbas had received an extension to form a new cabinet .
arafat had initially offered last month to make abbas the first-ever palestinian prime minister and had given him three weeks to present a cabinet to the palestinian legislative council -lrb- plc -rrb- .
that deadline ended on tuesday .

german foreign minister fischer wrapped up his three-day visit to the middle east on wednesday by urging palestinians to speed up reforms in order to facilitate a “ road map ” for peace in the intifada-torn region . in a speech overshadowed by an israeli attack on a palestinian vehicle in gaza city that claimed five lives , german foreign minister joschka fischer called on both israelis and palestinians to end their cycle of violence on wednesday , the last day of his three-day tour of the middle east .
speaking in ramallah after meeting with beleaguered palestinian leader yasser arafat in his battered headquarters and prime minister-designate mahmoud abbas , fischer said : " stop terror , stop violence and come back to the negotiating table . "
fischer also had a specific message for the palestinians : speed up cabinet-building and the reform process and pave the way for the official implementation of the west ’ s " road map , " which according to the minister is " a very dynamic element in the hands of the palestinians . "
palestinian cabinet building the " road map " to peace is a plan hammered out by the so-called middle east quartet , which includes the european union , the united nations , the united states and russia .
it aims to bring both the palestinians and israelis back to the negotiating table and involves a series of steps aimed at creating a palestinian state by 2005 .
most importantly , the united states , which plays a leading role in the implementation of the " road map , " insists that moderate palestinian prime minister-designate abbas , the first ever to occupy the new position , should first form a cabinet before it releases details of the peace plan .
mahmoud abbas , also known as abu mazen , is seen by both the eu and the u.s. as a leader who could contribute significantly towards lasting peace in the middle east - largely owing to his moderate stance towards israel .
abbas , appointed by arafat under intense pressure from palestinian legislators and international mediators , has criticized the use of armed attacks on israelis in the uprising or " intifada " as unproductive .
fischer calls for accelerated reforms the u.s. insistence that the palestinian cabinet-building should be a prelude to the release of the " road map " is a point that foreign minister fischer reiterated during his diplomatic trip .
" it ’ s of absolute importance to speed up the building of the new government and reforms , " fischer said on wednesday .
" everything depends on the palestinian government . "
abbas ’ newly-formed government is expected to launch a new reform drive to root out corruption in the palestinian authority and curb violence in the 30-month-old palestinian uprising .
fischer ’ s attempts to revive the " road map " are also seen to target the u.s. , which has often postponed its publication in consideration of israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
many eu nations have been urging the u.s. to once again play a leading mediating role in the middle east conflict .
the german foreign minister also met with representatives of the palestinian reform committee in ramallah on wednesday , who assured him that the reform process in the autonomous palestinian territories would continue .
representatives of the committee said it was also necessary to hold palestinian elections as part of the reform process .
fischer also reasserted his support for abbas and urged both israeli prime minister ariel sharon and foreign minister silvan schalom in meetings on monday and tuesday in israel to " fully support " abbas and accept the " road map " to peace .

the job losses come less than a month after qantas announced it would slash international operations by about 20 % in april-july because of the global downturn caused by fears of terrorism .
sars , which has infected more than 2,800 people , mainly so far in east asia , has had a devastating effect on travel around the region .
with tourist bookings to destinations such as singapore and hong kong down by at least one-third already , airlines in the region are having to cut costs further .
other regional carriers , including cathay pacific and singapore airlines , have also announced deep cuts .
protective move " we regret the need for this action , " said qantas chief executive geoff dixon .
" however , it is vital we move quickly to protect our position in a very difficult and competitive industry .
" our aim is to protect the jobs of the vast majority of qantas employees , to ensure we continue to meet the needs of our many shareholders and to position ourselves for the inevitable recovery . "
