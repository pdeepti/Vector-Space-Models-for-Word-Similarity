program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 15.04.2003 eu ministers discuss possible role in postwar iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq is a broken country waiting for reconstruction to begin .
foreign ministers from the european union are discussing possible plans for involvement in postwar iraq at a meeting in luxembourg .
while humanitarian relief heads the agenda , some are suggesting a peacekeeping force . eu foreign ministers meeting in luxembourg on monday had no small task to consider .
after the fall of baghdad , the european union is considering two working proposals designed to provoke a wide-ranging debate on the 15-nation bloc 's role in postwar iraq and what concrete measures it should take in the reconstruction of the war-torn country .
the 14 ministers , minus britain 's jack straw who is in the gulf , are likely to avoid the sensitive issue of making firm decisions over iraq while military action continues in the country .
the proposals - one from the european commission ; one from the greek presidency - will analyze the role of the eu in post-conflict situations that it has committed to in the past , such as afghanistan , east timor , kosovo and cambodia and could be used as blueprints for any plan for eu involvement .
among other possible topics for discussion is the idea of sending an eu envoy to iraq or setting up an eu mission in the country .
eu to concentrate on humanitarian relief however , it remains unclear what role , if any , the european union will take in postwar iraq .
it is unlikely that the eu will commit itself to answering that question at the meeting .
in a proposal outlined by eu external affairs commissioner chris patten , the eu commission has urged the foreign ministers to find a quick common position on the role of the u.n. and the eu in the reconstruction of postwar iraq . " if the eu is in a position to clarify early which role it wants to play in iraq after the conflict , then it could possibly influence the contents of a u.n. resolution on the process , " the proposal said .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana described the meeting as a chance to take stock of events and regroup for decisions ahead .
" i expect a very solid debate , " he told the associated press .
" it 's a moment to take stock of what has been going on and to begin to take decisions although i do n't think that today will take very fundamental decisions ... it 's to get a sense of where we are . "
according to diplomats in luxembourg , the eu will , for the time being , confine itself to discussing how the eu can help in the shorter-term matter of getting aid to the iraqi people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers of german relief organization " asb " load humanitarian aid for iraq .
the european commission has already begun to channel € 21 million -lrb- $ 22.5 million -rrb- in humanitarian relief money into iraq and is pressing the member states to release another € 79 million .
" the first priority for the moment is humanitarian aid : how to mobilize to deliver aid in the most efficient and fastest way possible for the iraqi people , " one eu diplomat told the bbc .
" the second is security .
on this point , there is a consensus that this task is incumbent upon the military forces on the ground , " he added , with much of iraq in chaos since u.s. soldiers swept into baghdad last week .
no action has been excluded but france 's european affairs minister noelle lenoir hinted that the eu 's involvement may go beyond distributing aid when she was interviewed on french public radio broadcaster rfi , saying that the eu 's role in iraq may not be limited to humanitarian relief , and that " nothing has been excluded " .

foreign ministers from the european union are discussing possible plans for involvement in postwar iraq at a meeting in luxembourg .
while humanitarian relief heads the agenda , some are suggesting a peacekeeping force . eu foreign ministers meeting in luxembourg on monday had no small task to consider .
after the fall of baghdad , the european union is considering two working proposals designed to provoke a wide-ranging debate on the 15-nation bloc 's role in postwar iraq and what concrete measures it should take in the reconstruction of the war-torn country .
the 14 ministers , minus britain 's jack straw who is in the gulf , are likely to avoid the sensitive issue of making firm decisions over iraq while military action continues in the country .
the proposals - one from the european commission ; one from the greek presidency - will analyze the role of the eu in post-conflict situations that it has committed to in the past , such as afghanistan , east timor , kosovo and cambodia and could be used as blueprints for any plan for eu involvement .
among other possible topics for discussion is the idea of sending an eu envoy to iraq or setting up an eu mission in the country .
eu to concentrate on humanitarian relief however , it remains unclear what role , if any , the european union will take in postwar iraq .
it is unlikely that the eu will commit itself to answering that question at the meeting .
in a proposal outlined by eu external affairs commissioner chris patten , the eu commission has urged the foreign ministers to find a quick common position on the role of the u.n. and the eu in the reconstruction of postwar iraq . " if the eu is in a position to clarify early which role it wants to play in iraq after the conflict , then it could possibly influence the contents of a u.n. resolution on the process , " the proposal said .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana described the meeting as a chance to take stock of events and regroup for decisions ahead .
" i expect a very solid debate , " he told the associated press .
" it 's a moment to take stock of what has been going on and to begin to take decisions although i do n't think that today will take very fundamental decisions ... it 's to get a sense of where we are . "
according to diplomats in luxembourg , the eu will , for the time being , confine itself to discussing how the eu can help in the shorter-term matter of getting aid to the iraqi people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers of german relief organization " asb " load humanitarian aid for iraq .
the european commission has already begun to channel € 21 million -lrb- $ 22.5 million -rrb- in humanitarian relief money into iraq and is pressing the member states to release another € 79 million .
" the first priority for the moment is humanitarian aid : how to mobilize to deliver aid in the most efficient and fastest way possible for the iraqi people , " one eu diplomat told the bbc .
" the second is security .
on this point , there is a consensus that this task is incumbent upon the military forces on the ground , " he added , with much of iraq in chaos since u.s. soldiers swept into baghdad last week .
no action has been excluded but france 's european affairs minister noelle lenoir hinted that the eu 's involvement may go beyond distributing aid when she was interviewed on french public radio broadcaster rfi , saying that the eu 's role in iraq may not be limited to humanitarian relief , and that " nothing has been excluded " .

britain wants germany to help in post war iraq germany may have been staunchly against war with iraq , but its involvement rebuilding the postwar gulf state looks increasing likely . german troops may have played no part in coalition-led fighting against the fallen iraqi regime , but germany may yet play a central role in postwar iraq . the british prime minister , tony blair , is to meet chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday for talks on germany 's role in postwar iraq .
the two will meet in the german leader 's home constituency , hanover , ahead of wednesday 's summit of eu foreign ministers in athens , which u.n. secretary general kofi annan is expected to attend . while the world waits to see what shape iraq will take , reports in the german press are claiming that unofficial talks on germany 's post-conflict role have long been underway between the two countries . according to the reports , britain wants german experts to work predominantly in british-controlled southern iraq to rebuild telecommunication networks , re-establish electricity and water supplies and clear mines .
germans carrying arms may also play a role , albeit performing security functions . british defense secretary geoff hoon told the german sunday tabloid , bild am sonntag " we would welcome it if we -lrb- germany and great britain -rrb- could work together in iraq . " government denies unofficial talks but the german government – - which has already promised € 90 million in humanitarian aid to iraq and appears to be sticking to the eu line - has denied the rumors . " who is doing what can only be decided when the role of the u.n. has been clearly defined , " a government spokesperson told german news agency dpa .
the eu said this week it wants the u.n. to play a central role in iraq . over the weekend , however , german politicians were lining up to give their opinion on whether german firms should be involved in iraq . the leader of the opposition party , cdu / csu , angela merkel , together with chairman of the csu parliamentary group , michael glos called for a nato-led peacekeeping force to be sent to iraq and said they would hold the schröder government responsible if a nato no-show resulted in german companies missing out on lucrative contracts to re-build iraq . but the leader of the green parliamentary group , katrin göring-eckardt attacked merkel 's position , saying that germany should give humanitarian aid without thinking of the influence this might have on winning contracts . but any german involvement may not sit well with the bush administration after last weekend 's franco-russo-german summit in st. petersburg .
last week , the u.s. deputy defense minister , paul wolfowitz called for european countries to aid a swift rebuilding of iraq by waiving debts owed to them by iraq .
but german finance minister , hans eichel made it clear that germany would not be toeing the u.s. line regarding the loan repayments from iraq , estimated at $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.7 billion -rrb- . speaking at last weekend 's g7 summit in washington , eichel said : " i do n't merely expect to get the $ 4 billion back – i will get it back .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday tied his political fate to a special party congress on the government ’ s controversial plans to reform the welfare state and spur the economy . giving in to demands from the grassroots of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , german chancellor gerhard schröder agreed to hold a party congress on june 1 after meeting with the spd leadership in berlin .
effectively turning the event into a vote of confidence , spd general secretary olaf scholz said the reforms would be voted upon as a complete package at the congress . “ we believe there is now a situation where it has to be made clear that the spd stands behind the reform agenda and supports the policies of the chancellor , ” scholz told journalists on monday . schröder announced a package of sweeping reforms last month in an attempt to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system , but his “ agenda 2010 ” plan has encountered massive criticism from unions and the left-wing faction of the spd .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . storm of protest the government ’ s plans are likely to face a storm of protest at the congress , as the party ’ s hard-left members take the opportunity to attack proposals they say would irreparably damage the german welfare state .
the greens , schröder ’ s junior coalition partner , face opposition from its own regional chapters over the reforms and has scheduled its own party congress on june 14 . andrea nahles , the leader of the spd leftwing members of parliament said on monday he expected the government to back away from its reform agenda at the congress . “ i expect movement .
if there isn ’ t , we ’ ll head towards a confrontation , ” nahles told the reuters news agency in an interview . despite the resistance from within the government ’ s own ranks , schröder appears committed to his reform course .
after scraping to victory in last september ’ s general election , he has staked his political survival on pushing through the unpopular measures . economy grinds to a halt in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday tied his political fate to a special party congress on the government ’ s controversial plans to reform the welfare state and spur the economy . giving in to demands from the grassroots of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , german chancellor gerhard schröder agreed to hold a party congress on june 1 after meeting with the spd leadership in berlin .
effectively turning the event into a vote of confidence , spd general secretary olaf scholz said the reforms would be voted upon as a complete package at the congress . “ we believe there is now a situation where it has to be made clear that the spd stands behind the reform agenda and supports the policies of the chancellor , ” scholz told journalists on monday . schröder announced a package of sweeping reforms last month in an attempt to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system , but his “ agenda 2010 ” plan has encountered massive criticism from unions and the left-wing faction of the spd .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . storm of protest the government ’ s plans are likely to face a storm of protest at the congress , as the party ’ s hard-left members take the opportunity to attack proposals they say would irreparably damage the german welfare state .
the greens , schröder ’ s junior coalition partner , face opposition from its own regional chapters over the reforms and has scheduled its own party congress on june 14 . andrea nahles , the leader of the spd leftwing members of parliament said on monday he expected the government to back away from its reform agenda at the congress . “ i expect movement .
if there isn ’ t , we ’ ll head towards a confrontation , ” nahles told the reuters news agency in an interview . despite the resistance from within the government ’ s own ranks , schröder appears committed to his reform course .
after scraping to victory in last september ’ s general election , he has staked his political survival on pushing through the unpopular measures . economy grinds to a halt in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of 11 percent . rainer brüderle , the deputy chief of the opposition liberal free democrats , said the decision to have the spd congress showed the party would have difficult forcing the reforms through . “ the spd leadership suffered a crashing defeat .

britain wants germany to help in post war iraq germany may have been staunchly against war with iraq , but its involvement rebuilding the postwar gulf state looks increasing likely . german troops may have played no part in coalition-led fighting against the fallen iraqi regime , but germany may yet play a central role in postwar iraq . the british prime minister , tony blair , is to meet chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday for talks on germany 's role in postwar iraq .
the two will meet in the german leader 's home constituency , hanover , ahead of wednesday 's summit of eu foreign ministers in athens , which u.n. secretary general kofi annan is expected to attend . while the world waits to see what shape iraq will take , reports in the german press are claiming that unofficial talks on germany 's post-conflict role have long been underway between the two countries . according to the reports , britain wants german experts to work predominantly in british-controlled southern iraq to rebuild telecommunication networks , re-establish electricity and water supplies and clear mines .
germans carrying arms may also play a role , albeit performing security functions . british defense secretary geoff hoon told the german sunday tabloid , bild am sonntag " we would welcome it if we -lrb- germany and great britain -rrb- could work together in iraq . " government denies unofficial talks but the german government – - which has already promised € 90 million in humanitarian aid to iraq and appears to be sticking to the eu line - has denied the rumors . " who is doing what can only be decided when the role of the u.n. has been clearly defined , " a government spokesperson told german news agency dpa .
the eu said this week it wants the u.n. to play a central role in iraq . over the weekend , however , german politicians were lining up to give their opinion on whether german firms should be involved in iraq . the leader of the opposition party , cdu / csu , angela merkel , together with chairman of the csu parliamentary group , michael glos called for a nato-led peacekeeping force to be sent to iraq and said they would hold the schröder government responsible if a nato no-show resulted in german companies missing out on lucrative contracts to re-build iraq . but the leader of the green parliamentary group , katrin göring-eckardt attacked merkel 's position , saying that germany should give humanitarian aid without thinking of the influence this might have on winning contracts . but any german involvement may not sit well with the bush administration after last weekend 's franco-russo-german summit in st. petersburg .
last week , the u.s. deputy defense minister , paul wolfowitz called for european countries to aid a swift rebuilding of iraq by waiving debts owed to them by iraq .
but german finance minister , hans eichel made it clear that germany would not be toeing the u.s. line regarding the loan repayments from iraq , estimated at $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.7 billion -rrb- . speaking at last weekend 's g7 summit in washington , eichel said : " i do n't merely expect to get the $ 4 billion back – i will get it back .

britain wants germany to help in post war iraq germany may have been staunchly against war with iraq , but its involvement rebuilding the postwar gulf state looks increasing likely . german troops may have played no part in coalition-led fighting against the fallen iraqi regime , but germany may yet play a central role in postwar iraq . the british prime minister , tony blair , is to meet chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday for talks on germany 's role in postwar iraq .
the two will meet in the german leader 's home constituency , hanover , ahead of wednesday 's summit of eu foreign ministers in athens , which u.n. secretary general kofi annan is expected to attend . while the world waits to see what shape iraq will take , reports in the german press are claiming that unofficial talks on germany 's post-conflict role have long been underway between the two countries . according to the reports , britain wants german experts to work predominantly in british-controlled southern iraq to rebuild telecommunication networks , re-establish electricity and water supplies and clear mines .
germans carrying arms may also play a role , albeit performing security functions . british defense secretary geoff hoon told the german sunday tabloid , bild am sonntag " we would welcome it if we -lrb- germany and great britain -rrb- could work together in iraq . " government denies unofficial talks but the german government – - which has already promised € 90 million in humanitarian aid to iraq and appears to be sticking to the eu line - has denied the rumors . " who is doing what can only be decided when the role of the u.n. has been clearly defined , " a government spokesperson told german news agency dpa .
the eu said this week it wants the u.n. to play a central role in iraq . over the weekend , however , german politicians were lining up to give their opinion on whether german firms should be involved in iraq . the leader of the opposition party , cdu / csu , angela merkel , together with chairman of the csu parliamentary group , michael glos called for a nato-led peacekeeping force to be sent to iraq and said they would hold the schröder government responsible if a nato no-show resulted in german companies missing out on lucrative contracts to re-build iraq . but the leader of the green parliamentary group , katrin göring-eckardt attacked merkel 's position , saying that germany should give humanitarian aid without thinking of the influence this might have on winning contracts . but any german involvement may not sit well with the bush administration after last weekend 's franco-russo-german summit in st. petersburg .
last week , the u.s. deputy defense minister , paul wolfowitz called for european countries to aid a swift rebuilding of iraq by waiving debts owed to them by iraq .
but german finance minister , hans eichel made it clear that germany would not be toeing the u.s. line regarding the loan repayments from iraq , estimated at $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.7 billion -rrb- . speaking at last weekend 's g7 summit in washington , eichel said : " i do n't merely expect to get the $ 4 billion back – i will get it back .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 15.04.2003 eu ministers discuss possible role in postwar iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq is a broken country waiting for reconstruction to begin .
foreign ministers from the european union are discussing possible plans for involvement in postwar iraq at a meeting in luxembourg .
while humanitarian relief heads the agenda , some are suggesting a peacekeeping force . eu foreign ministers meeting in luxembourg on monday had no small task to consider .
after the fall of baghdad , the european union is considering two working proposals designed to provoke a wide-ranging debate on the 15-nation bloc 's role in postwar iraq and what concrete measures it should take in the reconstruction of the war-torn country .
the 14 ministers , minus britain 's jack straw who is in the gulf , are likely to avoid the sensitive issue of making firm decisions over iraq while military action continues in the country .
the proposals - one from the european commission ; one from the greek presidency - will analyze the role of the eu in post-conflict situations that it has committed to in the past , such as afghanistan , east timor , kosovo and cambodia and could be used as blueprints for any plan for eu involvement .
among other possible topics for discussion is the idea of sending an eu envoy to iraq or setting up an eu mission in the country .
eu to concentrate on humanitarian relief however , it remains unclear what role , if any , the european union will take in postwar iraq .
it is unlikely that the eu will commit itself to answering that question at the meeting .
in a proposal outlined by eu external affairs commissioner chris patten , the eu commission has urged the foreign ministers to find a quick common position on the role of the u.n. and the eu in the reconstruction of postwar iraq . " if the eu is in a position to clarify early which role it wants to play in iraq after the conflict , then it could possibly influence the contents of a u.n. resolution on the process , " the proposal said .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana described the meeting as a chance to take stock of events and regroup for decisions ahead .
" i expect a very solid debate , " he told the associated press .
" it 's a moment to take stock of what has been going on and to begin to take decisions although i do n't think that today will take very fundamental decisions ... it 's to get a sense of where we are . "
according to diplomats in luxembourg , the eu will , for the time being , confine itself to discussing how the eu can help in the shorter-term matter of getting aid to the iraqi people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers of german relief organization " asb " load humanitarian aid for iraq .
the european commission has already begun to channel € 21 million -lrb- $ 22.5 million -rrb- in humanitarian relief money into iraq and is pressing the member states to release another € 79 million .
" the first priority for the moment is humanitarian aid : how to mobilize to deliver aid in the most efficient and fastest way possible for the iraqi people , " one eu diplomat told the bbc .
" the second is security .
on this point , there is a consensus that this task is incumbent upon the military forces on the ground , " he added , with much of iraq in chaos since u.s. soldiers swept into baghdad last week .
no action has been excluded but france 's european affairs minister noelle lenoir hinted that the eu 's involvement may go beyond distributing aid when she was interviewed on french public radio broadcaster rfi , saying that the eu 's role in iraq may not be limited to humanitarian relief , and that " nothing has been excluded " .
refusing to be drawn into a debate on a possible eu military peace-keeping force in iraq , lenoir explained , " what we do n't want is for each country to go off on its own , a situation we regretted a short while back .
each country can make proposals and suggestions , we 've done it ourselves .
but when it comes to action , the union must present itself as a political entity , a community of states , all going in the same direction , " she added .
the eu has been slowly establishing a rapid reaction force , which began its first operation in macedonia last month , and its use in iraq could be a topic for discussion over the next few days .
the peace can be won militarily : fischer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu troops are already on missions in macedonia .
german foreign minister joschka fischer believes that after the war is over , order can be achieved militarily with europe 's peacekeeping experience and help to secure peace in iraq .
fischer said on sunday in an interview with swiss weekly nzz am sonntag that , " the danger does not go away after a military solution , quite the opposite .
we must win the peace when the war is over militarily . "
making his case for european involvement in iraq , fischer added , " it 's not that there 's too much america , there 's not enough europe .
europe is especially strong in matters that are not purely military .
that can be seen in the balkans , and is also true in afghanistan . "
german peacekeeping forces are currently in joint command in afghanistan .
eu leaders agreed on un role while the european union discusses what should happen next in iraq , the general consensus voiced throughout the member states is that the united nations should have a pivotal role in the reconstruction of iraq and that every effort must be made to return the country to a state of sovereignty .
fischer too emphasized that the u.n. should play a central role in postwar iraq .
" i believe , that the umbrella of the u.n. is of decisive importance when one considers the enormity of the tasks involved , " he said .
despite the differences between " the willing " , british prime minister tony blair , together with spain 's jose maria aznar , and the eu " anti-war " leaders , france and germany , it seems that eu leaders agree on one thing - the central role of the united nations in iraq 's reconstruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder talks with russian president vladimir putin .
returning from a two-day summit on iraq in saint petersburg with russia 's vladimir putin , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac demanded a central role for the united nations in rebuilding iraq .
chancellor schröder stressed that " the u.n. security council must confer legitimacy " on any reconstruction drive in iraq .
bridges to be built at athens summit as a result of growing calls for united nations involvement , secretary general kofi annan has cancelled visits to the uk , germany , france and russia to attend a special eu summit in athens that begins in wednesday .
it is likely that the debate will continue in the wings at the so-called " kiss and make up " summit in athens where the 10 eu candidate states will sign accession treaties .

the proposals - one from the european commission ; one from the greek presidency - will analyze the role of the eu in post-conflict situations that it has committed to in the past , such as afghanistan , east timor , kosovo and cambodia and could be used as blueprints for any plan for eu involvement .
among other possible topics for discussion is the idea of sending an eu envoy to iraq or setting up an eu mission in the country .
eu to concentrate on humanitarian relief however , it remains unclear what role , if any , the european union will take in postwar iraq .
it is unlikely that the eu will commit itself to answering that question at the meeting .
in a proposal outlined by eu external affairs commissioner chris patten , the eu commission has urged the foreign ministers to find a quick common position on the role of the u.n. and the eu in the reconstruction of postwar iraq . " if the eu is in a position to clarify early which role it wants to play in iraq after the conflict , then it could possibly influence the contents of a u.n. resolution on the process , " the proposal said .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana described the meeting as a chance to take stock of events and regroup for decisions ahead .
" i expect a very solid debate , " he told the associated press .
" it 's a moment to take stock of what has been going on and to begin to take decisions although i do n't think that today will take very fundamental decisions ... it 's to get a sense of where we are . "
according to diplomats in luxembourg , the eu will , for the time being , confine itself to discussing how the eu can help in the shorter-term matter of getting aid to the iraqi people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers of german relief organization " asb " load humanitarian aid for iraq .
the european commission has already begun to channel € 21 million -lrb- $ 22.5 million -rrb- in humanitarian relief money into iraq and is pressing the member states to release another € 79 million .
" the first priority for the moment is humanitarian aid : how to mobilize to deliver aid in the most efficient and fastest way possible for the iraqi people , " one eu diplomat told the bbc .
" the second is security .
on this point , there is a consensus that this task is incumbent upon the military forces on the ground , " he added , with much of iraq in chaos since u.s. soldiers swept into baghdad last week .
no action has been excluded but france 's european affairs minister noelle lenoir hinted that the eu 's involvement may go beyond distributing aid when she was interviewed on french public radio broadcaster rfi , saying that the eu 's role in iraq may not be limited to humanitarian relief , and that " nothing has been excluded " .
refusing to be drawn into a debate on a possible eu military peace-keeping force in iraq , lenoir explained , " what we do n't want is for each country to go off on its own , a situation we regretted a short while back .
each country can make proposals and suggestions , we 've done it ourselves .
but when it comes to action , the union must present itself as a political entity , a community of states , all going in the same direction , " she added .
the eu has been slowly establishing a rapid reaction force , which began its first operation in macedonia last month , and its use in iraq could be a topic for discussion over the next few days .
the peace can be won militarily : fischer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu troops are already on missions in macedonia .
german foreign minister joschka fischer believes that after the war is over , order can be achieved militarily with europe 's peacekeeping experience and help to secure peace in iraq .
fischer said on sunday in an interview with swiss weekly nzz am sonntag that , " the danger does not go away after a military solution , quite the opposite .
we must win the peace when the war is over militarily . "
making his case for european involvement in iraq , fischer added , " it 's not that there 's too much america , there 's not enough europe .
europe is especially strong in matters that are not purely military .
that can be seen in the balkans , and is also true in afghanistan . "
german peacekeeping forces are currently in joint command in afghanistan .
eu leaders agreed on un role while the european union discusses what should happen next in iraq , the general consensus voiced throughout the member states is that the united nations should have a pivotal role in the reconstruction of iraq and that every effort must be made to return the country to a state of sovereignty .
fischer too emphasized that the u.n. should play a central role in postwar iraq .
" i believe , that the umbrella of the u.n. is of decisive importance when one considers the enormity of the tasks involved , " he said .
despite the differences between " the willing " , british prime minister tony blair , together with spain 's jose maria aznar , and the eu " anti-war " leaders , france and germany , it seems that eu leaders agree on one thing - the central role of the united nations in iraq 's reconstruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder talks with russian president vladimir putin .
returning from a two-day summit on iraq in saint petersburg with russia 's vladimir putin , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac demanded a central role for the united nations in rebuilding iraq .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday tied his political fate to a special party congress on the government ’ s controversial plans to reform the welfare state and spur the economy . giving in to demands from the grassroots of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , german chancellor gerhard schröder agreed to hold a party congress on june 1 after meeting with the spd leadership in berlin .
effectively turning the event into a vote of confidence , spd general secretary olaf scholz said the reforms would be voted upon as a complete package at the congress . “ we believe there is now a situation where it has to be made clear that the spd stands behind the reform agenda and supports the policies of the chancellor , ” scholz told journalists on monday . schröder announced a package of sweeping reforms last month in an attempt to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system , but his “ agenda 2010 ” plan has encountered massive criticism from unions and the left-wing faction of the spd .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . storm of protest the government ’ s plans are likely to face a storm of protest at the congress , as the party ’ s hard-left members take the opportunity to attack proposals they say would irreparably damage the german welfare state .
the greens , schröder ’ s junior coalition partner , face opposition from its own regional chapters over the reforms and has scheduled its own party congress on june 14 . andrea nahles , the leader of the spd leftwing members of parliament said on monday he expected the government to back away from its reform agenda at the congress . “ i expect movement .
if there isn ’ t , we ’ ll head towards a confrontation , ” nahles told the reuters news agency in an interview . despite the resistance from within the government ’ s own ranks , schröder appears committed to his reform course .
after scraping to victory in last september ’ s general election , he has staked his political survival on pushing through the unpopular measures . economy grinds to a halt in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of 11 percent . rainer brüderle , the deputy chief of the opposition liberal free democrats , said the decision to have the spd congress showed the party would have difficult forcing the reforms through . “ the spd leadership suffered a crashing defeat .
it no longer has its own shop under control , ” said brüderle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unions are planning to demonstrate .
unfortunately for schröder , even if he faces down his own revolting backbenchers and regional spd chapters at the party congress , germany ’ s trade unions have announced major demonstrations against the chancellor ’ s reform plans starting may 1 . a traditional spd constituency , the unions argue relaxing job protection rules won ’ t create new jobs and are instead calling on the government to spend more on public works projects to spur the economy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unions threaten to oppose german reforms german chancellor gerhard schröder failed this week to persuade the nation ’ s trade unions to support his plans to reform the welfare state , heralding what could be a major confrontation with organized labor this spring .

britain wants germany to help in post war iraq germany may have been staunchly against war with iraq , but its involvement rebuilding the postwar gulf state looks increasing likely . german troops may have played no part in coalition-led fighting against the fallen iraqi regime , but germany may yet play a central role in postwar iraq . the british prime minister , tony blair , is to meet chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday for talks on germany 's role in postwar iraq .
the two will meet in the german leader 's home constituency , hanover , ahead of wednesday 's summit of eu foreign ministers in athens , which u.n. secretary general kofi annan is expected to attend . while the world waits to see what shape iraq will take , reports in the german press are claiming that unofficial talks on germany 's post-conflict role have long been underway between the two countries . according to the reports , britain wants german experts to work predominantly in british-controlled southern iraq to rebuild telecommunication networks , re-establish electricity and water supplies and clear mines .
germans carrying arms may also play a role , albeit performing security functions . british defense secretary geoff hoon told the german sunday tabloid , bild am sonntag " we would welcome it if we -lrb- germany and great britain -rrb- could work together in iraq . " government denies unofficial talks but the german government – - which has already promised € 90 million in humanitarian aid to iraq and appears to be sticking to the eu line - has denied the rumors . " who is doing what can only be decided when the role of the u.n. has been clearly defined , " a government spokesperson told german news agency dpa .
the eu said this week it wants the u.n. to play a central role in iraq . over the weekend , however , german politicians were lining up to give their opinion on whether german firms should be involved in iraq . the leader of the opposition party , cdu / csu , angela merkel , together with chairman of the csu parliamentary group , michael glos called for a nato-led peacekeeping force to be sent to iraq and said they would hold the schröder government responsible if a nato no-show resulted in german companies missing out on lucrative contracts to re-build iraq . but the leader of the green parliamentary group , katrin göring-eckardt attacked merkel 's position , saying that germany should give humanitarian aid without thinking of the influence this might have on winning contracts . but any german involvement may not sit well with the bush administration after last weekend 's franco-russo-german summit in st. petersburg .
last week , the u.s. deputy defense minister , paul wolfowitz called for european countries to aid a swift rebuilding of iraq by waiving debts owed to them by iraq .
but german finance minister , hans eichel made it clear that germany would not be toeing the u.s. line regarding the loan repayments from iraq , estimated at $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.7 billion -rrb- . speaking at last weekend 's g7 summit in washington , eichel said : " i do n't merely expect to get the $ 4 billion back – i will get it back .

at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . storm of protest the government ’ s plans are likely to face a storm of protest at the congress , as the party ’ s hard-left members take the opportunity to attack proposals they say would irreparably damage the german welfare state .

if there isn ’ t , we ’ ll head towards a confrontation , ” nahles told the reuters news agency in an interview . despite the resistance from within the government ’ s own ranks , schröder appears committed to his reform course .
after scraping to victory in last september ’ s general election , he has staked his political survival on pushing through the unpopular measures . economy grinds to a halt in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of 11 percent . rainer brüderle , the deputy chief of the opposition liberal free democrats , said the decision to have the spd congress showed the party would have difficult forcing the reforms through . “ the spd leadership suffered a crashing defeat .
it no longer has its own shop under control , ” said brüderle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unions are planning to demonstrate .
unfortunately for schröder , even if he faces down his own revolting backbenchers and regional spd chapters at the party congress , germany ’ s trade unions have announced major demonstrations against the chancellor ’ s reform plans starting may 1 . a traditional spd constituency , the unions argue relaxing job protection rules won ’ t create new jobs and are instead calling on the government to spend more on public works projects to spur the economy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unions threaten to oppose german reforms german chancellor gerhard schröder failed this week to persuade the nation ’ s trade unions to support his plans to reform the welfare state , heralding what could be a major confrontation with organized labor this spring .

german chancellor schröder and british prime minister blair have shown a united front at their meeting in hanover , agreeing that the united nations should have a pivotal role in postwar iraq . meeting to discuss the next steps in the reconstruction and rebuilding of iraq , blair and schröder attempted to put the serious rift over military action against iraq behind them .

britain wants germany to help in post war iraq germany may have been staunchly against war with iraq , but its involvement rebuilding the postwar gulf state looks increasing likely . german troops may have played no part in coalition-led fighting against the fallen iraqi regime , but germany may yet play a central role in postwar iraq . the british prime minister , tony blair , is to meet chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday for talks on germany 's role in postwar iraq .
the two will meet in the german leader 's home constituency , hanover , ahead of wednesday 's summit of eu foreign ministers in athens , which u.n. secretary general kofi annan is expected to attend . while the world waits to see what shape iraq will take , reports in the german press are claiming that unofficial talks on germany 's post-conflict role have long been underway between the two countries . according to the reports , britain wants german experts to work predominantly in british-controlled southern iraq to rebuild telecommunication networks , re-establish electricity and water supplies and clear mines .
germans carrying arms may also play a role , albeit performing security functions . british defense secretary geoff hoon told the german sunday tabloid , bild am sonntag " we would welcome it if we -lrb- germany and great britain -rrb- could work together in iraq . " government denies unofficial talks but the german government – - which has already promised € 90 million in humanitarian aid to iraq and appears to be sticking to the eu line - has denied the rumors . " who is doing what can only be decided when the role of the u.n. has been clearly defined , " a government spokesperson told german news agency dpa .
the eu said this week it wants the u.n. to play a central role in iraq . over the weekend , however , german politicians were lining up to give their opinion on whether german firms should be involved in iraq . the leader of the opposition party , cdu / csu , angela merkel , together with chairman of the csu parliamentary group , michael glos called for a nato-led peacekeeping force to be sent to iraq and said they would hold the schröder government responsible if a nato no-show resulted in german companies missing out on lucrative contracts to re-build iraq . but the leader of the green parliamentary group , katrin göring-eckardt attacked merkel 's position , saying that germany should give humanitarian aid without thinking of the influence this might have on winning contracts . but any german involvement may not sit well with the bush administration after last weekend 's franco-russo-german summit in st. petersburg .
last week , the u.s. deputy defense minister , paul wolfowitz called for european countries to aid a swift rebuilding of iraq by waiving debts owed to them by iraq .
but german finance minister , hans eichel made it clear that germany would not be toeing the u.s. line regarding the loan repayments from iraq , estimated at $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.7 billion -rrb- . speaking at last weekend 's g7 summit in washington , eichel said : " i do n't merely expect to get the $ 4 billion back – i will get it back . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iraq war opponents stress importance of the united nations germany 's chancellor met with his french and russian counterparts to discuss postwar iraq .
the three agreed the united nations must play a central role in rebuilding iraq , and force should only be used as a last resort .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday tied his political fate to a special party congress on the government ’ s controversial plans to reform the welfare state and spur the economy . giving in to demands from the grassroots of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , german chancellor gerhard schröder agreed to hold a party congress on june 1 after meeting with the spd leadership in berlin .
effectively turning the event into a vote of confidence , spd general secretary olaf scholz said the reforms would be voted upon as a complete package at the congress . “ we believe there is now a situation where it has to be made clear that the spd stands behind the reform agenda and supports the policies of the chancellor , ” scholz told journalists on monday . schröder announced a package of sweeping reforms last month in an attempt to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system , but his “ agenda 2010 ” plan has encountered massive criticism from unions and the left-wing faction of the spd .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . storm of protest the government ’ s plans are likely to face a storm of protest at the congress , as the party ’ s hard-left members take the opportunity to attack proposals they say would irreparably damage the german welfare state .
the greens , schröder ’ s junior coalition partner , face opposition from its own regional chapters over the reforms and has scheduled its own party congress on june 14 . andrea nahles , the leader of the spd leftwing members of parliament said on monday he expected the government to back away from its reform agenda at the congress . “ i expect movement .
if there isn ’ t , we ’ ll head towards a confrontation , ” nahles told the reuters news agency in an interview . despite the resistance from within the government ’ s own ranks , schröder appears committed to his reform course .
after scraping to victory in last september ’ s general election , he has staked his political survival on pushing through the unpopular measures . economy grinds to a halt in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of 11 percent . rainer brüderle , the deputy chief of the opposition liberal free democrats , said the decision to have the spd congress showed the party would have difficult forcing the reforms through . “ the spd leadership suffered a crashing defeat .
it no longer has its own shop under control , ” said brüderle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unions are planning to demonstrate .
unfortunately for schröder , even if he faces down his own revolting backbenchers and regional spd chapters at the party congress , germany ’ s trade unions have announced major demonstrations against the chancellor ’ s reform plans starting may 1 . a traditional spd constituency , the unions argue relaxing job protection rules won ’ t create new jobs and are instead calling on the government to spend more on public works projects to spur the economy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unions threaten to oppose german reforms german chancellor gerhard schröder failed this week to persuade the nation ’ s trade unions to support his plans to reform the welfare state , heralding what could be a major confrontation with organized labor this spring .

german chancellor schröder and british prime minister blair have shown a united front at their meeting in hanover , agreeing that the united nations should have a pivotal role in postwar iraq . meeting to discuss the next steps in the reconstruction and rebuilding of iraq , blair and schröder attempted to put the serious rift over military action against iraq behind them .
claiming strong bilateral ties and friendships , the two leaders made clear they were united in their vision for the future for iraq despite past differences .
both agreed the united nations had to be the basis for reconstruction and aid as early as possible .
" i am very pleased to be here in germany with the chancellor who i regard as a good friend .
i am also pleased to say that bilateral relations are strong and will remain so , " said blair .
democracy and security needed swiftly blair said that both he and chancellor schröder were in strong agreement that the installation of a democratic government in iraq was vitally important and that progress in humanitarian and security efforts in the country must be implemented as swiftly as possible .
" it is time now to concentrate on the problems arising out of the new situation and to resolve those problems , " said schröder .

blair admitted the process to fully involve the united nations would be problematic but said : " there is an agreement that , in principle , the un must have a key role . "
german participation one question arising from the summit was the level of german involvement in the reconstruction and rebuilding of iraq .
having refused to participate in military action , pressure to take a role in postwar iraq is beginning to build on those countries who opted out and protested against the war .

foreign ministers from the european union are discussing possible plans for involvement in postwar iraq at a meeting in luxembourg .
while humanitarian relief heads the agenda , some are suggesting a peacekeeping force . eu foreign ministers meeting in luxembourg on monday had no small task to consider .
after the fall of baghdad , the european union is considering two working proposals designed to provoke a wide-ranging debate on the 15-nation bloc 's role in postwar iraq and what concrete measures it should take in the reconstruction of the war-torn country .
the 14 ministers , minus britain 's jack straw who is in the gulf , are likely to avoid the sensitive issue of making firm decisions over iraq while military action continues in the country .
the proposals - one from the european commission ; one from the greek presidency - will analyze the role of the eu in post-conflict situations that it has committed to in the past , such as afghanistan , east timor , kosovo and cambodia and could be used as blueprints for any plan for eu involvement .
among other possible topics for discussion is the idea of sending an eu envoy to iraq or setting up an eu mission in the country .
eu to concentrate on humanitarian relief however , it remains unclear what role , if any , the european union will take in postwar iraq .
it is unlikely that the eu will commit itself to answering that question at the meeting .
in a proposal outlined by eu external affairs commissioner chris patten , the eu commission has urged the foreign ministers to find a quick common position on the role of the u.n. and the eu in the reconstruction of postwar iraq . " if the eu is in a position to clarify early which role it wants to play in iraq after the conflict , then it could possibly influence the contents of a u.n. resolution on the process , " the proposal said .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana described the meeting as a chance to take stock of events and regroup for decisions ahead .
" i expect a very solid debate , " he told the associated press .
" it 's a moment to take stock of what has been going on and to begin to take decisions although i do n't think that today will take very fundamental decisions ... it 's to get a sense of where we are . "
according to diplomats in luxembourg , the eu will , for the time being , confine itself to discussing how the eu can help in the shorter-term matter of getting aid to the iraqi people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers of german relief organization " asb " load humanitarian aid for iraq .
the european commission has already begun to channel € 21 million -lrb- $ 22.5 million -rrb- in humanitarian relief money into iraq and is pressing the member states to release another € 79 million .
" the first priority for the moment is humanitarian aid : how to mobilize to deliver aid in the most efficient and fastest way possible for the iraqi people , " one eu diplomat told the bbc .
" the second is security .
on this point , there is a consensus that this task is incumbent upon the military forces on the ground , " he added , with much of iraq in chaos since u.s. soldiers swept into baghdad last week .
no action has been excluded but france 's european affairs minister noelle lenoir hinted that the eu 's involvement may go beyond distributing aid when she was interviewed on french public radio broadcaster rfi , saying that the eu 's role in iraq may not be limited to humanitarian relief , and that " nothing has been excluded " .
refusing to be drawn into a debate on a possible eu military peace-keeping force in iraq , lenoir explained , " what we do n't want is for each country to go off on its own , a situation we regretted a short while back .
each country can make proposals and suggestions , we 've done it ourselves .
but when it comes to action , the union must present itself as a political entity , a community of states , all going in the same direction , " she added .

fischer said on sunday in an interview with swiss weekly nzz am sonntag that , " the danger does not go away after a military solution , quite the opposite .
we must win the peace when the war is over militarily . "
making his case for european involvement in iraq , fischer added , " it 's not that there 's too much america , there 's not enough europe .
europe is especially strong in matters that are not purely military .
that can be seen in the balkans , and is also true in afghanistan . "
german peacekeeping forces are currently in joint command in afghanistan .
eu leaders agreed on un role while the european union discusses what should happen next in iraq , the general consensus voiced throughout the member states is that the united nations should have a pivotal role in the reconstruction of iraq and that every effort must be made to return the country to a state of sovereignty .

foreign ministers from the european union are discussing possible plans for involvement in postwar iraq at a meeting in luxembourg .
while humanitarian relief heads the agenda , some are suggesting a peacekeeping force . eu foreign ministers meeting in luxembourg on monday had no small task to consider .
after the fall of baghdad , the european union is considering two working proposals designed to provoke a wide-ranging debate on the 15-nation bloc 's role in postwar iraq and what concrete measures it should take in the reconstruction of the war-torn country .
the 14 ministers , minus britain 's jack straw who is in the gulf , are likely to avoid the sensitive issue of making firm decisions over iraq while military action continues in the country .
the proposals - one from the european commission ; one from the greek presidency - will analyze the role of the eu in post-conflict situations that it has committed to in the past , such as afghanistan , east timor , kosovo and cambodia and could be used as blueprints for any plan for eu involvement .
among other possible topics for discussion is the idea of sending an eu envoy to iraq or setting up an eu mission in the country .
eu to concentrate on humanitarian relief however , it remains unclear what role , if any , the european union will take in postwar iraq .
it is unlikely that the eu will commit itself to answering that question at the meeting .
in a proposal outlined by eu external affairs commissioner chris patten , the eu commission has urged the foreign ministers to find a quick common position on the role of the u.n. and the eu in the reconstruction of postwar iraq . " if the eu is in a position to clarify early which role it wants to play in iraq after the conflict , then it could possibly influence the contents of a u.n. resolution on the process , " the proposal said .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana described the meeting as a chance to take stock of events and regroup for decisions ahead .
" i expect a very solid debate , " he told the associated press .
" it 's a moment to take stock of what has been going on and to begin to take decisions although i do n't think that today will take very fundamental decisions ... it 's to get a sense of where we are . "
according to diplomats in luxembourg , the eu will , for the time being , confine itself to discussing how the eu can help in the shorter-term matter of getting aid to the iraqi people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers of german relief organization " asb " load humanitarian aid for iraq .
the european commission has already begun to channel € 21 million -lrb- $ 22.5 million -rrb- in humanitarian relief money into iraq and is pressing the member states to release another € 79 million .
" the first priority for the moment is humanitarian aid : how to mobilize to deliver aid in the most efficient and fastest way possible for the iraqi people , " one eu diplomat told the bbc .
" the second is security .
on this point , there is a consensus that this task is incumbent upon the military forces on the ground , " he added , with much of iraq in chaos since u.s. soldiers swept into baghdad last week .
no action has been excluded but france 's european affairs minister noelle lenoir hinted that the eu 's involvement may go beyond distributing aid when she was interviewed on french public radio broadcaster rfi , saying that the eu 's role in iraq may not be limited to humanitarian relief , and that " nothing has been excluded " .
refusing to be drawn into a debate on a possible eu military peace-keeping force in iraq , lenoir explained , " what we do n't want is for each country to go off on its own , a situation we regretted a short while back .
each country can make proposals and suggestions , we 've done it ourselves .
but when it comes to action , the union must present itself as a political entity , a community of states , all going in the same direction , " she added .
the eu has been slowly establishing a rapid reaction force , which began its first operation in macedonia last month , and its use in iraq could be a topic for discussion over the next few days .
the peace can be won militarily : fischer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu troops are already on missions in macedonia .
german foreign minister joschka fischer believes that after the war is over , order can be achieved militarily with europe 's peacekeeping experience and help to secure peace in iraq .
fischer said on sunday in an interview with swiss weekly nzz am sonntag that , " the danger does not go away after a military solution , quite the opposite .
we must win the peace when the war is over militarily . "
making his case for european involvement in iraq , fischer added , " it 's not that there 's too much america , there 's not enough europe .
europe is especially strong in matters that are not purely military .
that can be seen in the balkans , and is also true in afghanistan . "
german peacekeeping forces are currently in joint command in afghanistan .
eu leaders agreed on un role while the european union discusses what should happen next in iraq , the general consensus voiced throughout the member states is that the united nations should have a pivotal role in the reconstruction of iraq and that every effort must be made to return the country to a state of sovereignty .
fischer too emphasized that the u.n. should play a central role in postwar iraq .
" i believe , that the umbrella of the u.n. is of decisive importance when one considers the enormity of the tasks involved , " he said .
despite the differences between " the willing " , british prime minister tony blair , together with spain 's jose maria aznar , and the eu " anti-war " leaders , france and germany , it seems that eu leaders agree on one thing - the central role of the united nations in iraq 's reconstruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder talks with russian president vladimir putin .
returning from a two-day summit on iraq in saint petersburg with russia 's vladimir putin , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac demanded a central role for the united nations in rebuilding iraq .
chancellor schröder stressed that " the u.n. security council must confer legitimacy " on any reconstruction drive in iraq .

britain wants germany to help in post war iraq germany may have been staunchly against war with iraq , but its involvement rebuilding the postwar gulf state looks increasing likely . german troops may have played no part in coalition-led fighting against the fallen iraqi regime , but germany may yet play a central role in postwar iraq . the british prime minister , tony blair , is to meet chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday for talks on germany 's role in postwar iraq .
the two will meet in the german leader 's home constituency , hanover , ahead of wednesday 's summit of eu foreign ministers in athens , which u.n. secretary general kofi annan is expected to attend . while the world waits to see what shape iraq will take , reports in the german press are claiming that unofficial talks on germany 's post-conflict role have long been underway between the two countries . according to the reports , britain wants german experts to work predominantly in british-controlled southern iraq to rebuild telecommunication networks , re-establish electricity and water supplies and clear mines .
germans carrying arms may also play a role , albeit performing security functions . british defense secretary geoff hoon told the german sunday tabloid , bild am sonntag " we would welcome it if we -lrb- germany and great britain -rrb- could work together in iraq .

britain wants germany to help in post war iraq germany may have been staunchly against war with iraq , but its involvement rebuilding the postwar gulf state looks increasing likely . german troops may have played no part in coalition-led fighting against the fallen iraqi regime , but germany may yet play a central role in postwar iraq . the british prime minister , tony blair , is to meet chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday for talks on germany 's role in postwar iraq .
the two will meet in the german leader 's home constituency , hanover , ahead of wednesday 's summit of eu foreign ministers in athens , which u.n. secretary general kofi annan is expected to attend . while the world waits to see what shape iraq will take , reports in the german press are claiming that unofficial talks on germany 's post-conflict role have long been underway between the two countries . according to the reports , britain wants german experts to work predominantly in british-controlled southern iraq to rebuild telecommunication networks , re-establish electricity and water supplies and clear mines .

german chancellor schröder and british prime minister blair have shown a united front at their meeting in hanover , agreeing that the united nations should have a pivotal role in postwar iraq . meeting to discuss the next steps in the reconstruction and rebuilding of iraq , blair and schröder attempted to put the serious rift over military action against iraq behind them .

german chancellor schröder and british prime minister blair have shown a united front at their meeting in hanover , agreeing that the united nations should have a pivotal role in postwar iraq . meeting to discuss the next steps in the reconstruction and rebuilding of iraq , blair and schröder attempted to put the serious rift over military action against iraq behind them .
claiming strong bilateral ties and friendships , the two leaders made clear they were united in their vision for the future for iraq despite past differences .
both agreed the united nations had to be the basis for reconstruction and aid as early as possible .
" i am very pleased to be here in germany with the chancellor who i regard as a good friend .
i am also pleased to say that bilateral relations are strong and will remain so , " said blair .
democracy and security needed swiftly blair said that both he and chancellor schröder were in strong agreement that the installation of a democratic government in iraq was vitally important and that progress in humanitarian and security efforts in the country must be implemented as swiftly as possible .
" it is time now to concentrate on the problems arising out of the new situation and to resolve those problems , " said schröder .
" it is no secret that germany wants the rebuilding to come from u.n. "
blair admitted the process to fully involve the united nations would be problematic but said : " there is an agreement that , in principle , the un must have a key role . "
german participation one question arising from the summit was the level of german involvement in the reconstruction and rebuilding of iraq .
having refused to participate in military action , pressure to take a role in postwar iraq is beginning to build on those countries who opted out and protested against the war .
gaining popularity for his stance on the war , schröder is now facing concern from german companies that fear they will miss out on lucrative contracts when rebuilding begins in iraq .

britain wants germany to help in post war iraq germany may have been staunchly against war with iraq , but its involvement rebuilding the postwar gulf state looks increasing likely . german troops may have played no part in coalition-led fighting against the fallen iraqi regime , but germany may yet play a central role in postwar iraq . the british prime minister , tony blair , is to meet chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday for talks on germany 's role in postwar iraq .
the two will meet in the german leader 's home constituency , hanover , ahead of wednesday 's summit of eu foreign ministers in athens , which u.n. secretary general kofi annan is expected to attend . while the world waits to see what shape iraq will take , reports in the german press are claiming that unofficial talks on germany 's post-conflict role have long been underway between the two countries . according to the reports , britain wants german experts to work predominantly in british-controlled southern iraq to rebuild telecommunication networks , re-establish electricity and water supplies and clear mines .
germans carrying arms may also play a role , albeit performing security functions . british defense secretary geoff hoon told the german sunday tabloid , bild am sonntag " we would welcome it if we -lrb- germany and great britain -rrb- could work together in iraq . " government denies unofficial talks but the german government – - which has already promised € 90 million in humanitarian aid to iraq and appears to be sticking to the eu line - has denied the rumors . " who is doing what can only be decided when the role of the u.n. has been clearly defined , " a government spokesperson told german news agency dpa .
the eu said this week it wants the u.n. to play a central role in iraq . over the weekend , however , german politicians were lining up to give their opinion on whether german firms should be involved in iraq . the leader of the opposition party , cdu / csu , angela merkel , together with chairman of the csu parliamentary group , michael glos called for a nato-led peacekeeping force to be sent to iraq and said they would hold the schröder government responsible if a nato no-show resulted in german companies missing out on lucrative contracts to re-build iraq . but the leader of the green parliamentary group , katrin göring-eckardt attacked merkel 's position , saying that germany should give humanitarian aid without thinking of the influence this might have on winning contracts . but any german involvement may not sit well with the bush administration after last weekend 's franco-russo-german summit in st. petersburg .
last week , the u.s. deputy defense minister , paul wolfowitz called for european countries to aid a swift rebuilding of iraq by waiving debts owed to them by iraq .
but german finance minister , hans eichel made it clear that germany would not be toeing the u.s. line regarding the loan repayments from iraq , estimated at $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.7 billion -rrb- . speaking at last weekend 's g7 summit in washington , eichel said : " i do n't merely expect to get the $ 4 billion back – i will get it back .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 15.04.2003 eu ministers discuss possible role in postwar iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq is a broken country waiting for reconstruction to begin .
foreign ministers from the european union are discussing possible plans for involvement in postwar iraq at a meeting in luxembourg .
while humanitarian relief heads the agenda , some are suggesting a peacekeeping force . eu foreign ministers meeting in luxembourg on monday had no small task to consider .
after the fall of baghdad , the european union is considering two working proposals designed to provoke a wide-ranging debate on the 15-nation bloc 's role in postwar iraq and what concrete measures it should take in the reconstruction of the war-torn country .
the 14 ministers , minus britain 's jack straw who is in the gulf , are likely to avoid the sensitive issue of making firm decisions over iraq while military action continues in the country .
the proposals - one from the european commission ; one from the greek presidency - will analyze the role of the eu in post-conflict situations that it has committed to in the past , such as afghanistan , east timor , kosovo and cambodia and could be used as blueprints for any plan for eu involvement .
among other possible topics for discussion is the idea of sending an eu envoy to iraq or setting up an eu mission in the country .
eu to concentrate on humanitarian relief however , it remains unclear what role , if any , the european union will take in postwar iraq .
it is unlikely that the eu will commit itself to answering that question at the meeting .
in a proposal outlined by eu external affairs commissioner chris patten , the eu commission has urged the foreign ministers to find a quick common position on the role of the u.n. and the eu in the reconstruction of postwar iraq . " if the eu is in a position to clarify early which role it wants to play in iraq after the conflict , then it could possibly influence the contents of a u.n. resolution on the process , " the proposal said .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana described the meeting as a chance to take stock of events and regroup for decisions ahead .
" i expect a very solid debate , " he told the associated press .
" it 's a moment to take stock of what has been going on and to begin to take decisions although i do n't think that today will take very fundamental decisions ... it 's to get a sense of where we are . "
according to diplomats in luxembourg , the eu will , for the time being , confine itself to discussing how the eu can help in the shorter-term matter of getting aid to the iraqi people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers of german relief organization " asb " load humanitarian aid for iraq .
the european commission has already begun to channel € 21 million -lrb- $ 22.5 million -rrb- in humanitarian relief money into iraq and is pressing the member states to release another € 79 million .
" the first priority for the moment is humanitarian aid : how to mobilize to deliver aid in the most efficient and fastest way possible for the iraqi people , " one eu diplomat told the bbc .
" the second is security .
on this point , there is a consensus that this task is incumbent upon the military forces on the ground , " he added , with much of iraq in chaos since u.s. soldiers swept into baghdad last week .
no action has been excluded but france 's european affairs minister noelle lenoir hinted that the eu 's involvement may go beyond distributing aid when she was interviewed on french public radio broadcaster rfi , saying that the eu 's role in iraq may not be limited to humanitarian relief , and that " nothing has been excluded " .
refusing to be drawn into a debate on a possible eu military peace-keeping force in iraq , lenoir explained , " what we do n't want is for each country to go off on its own , a situation we regretted a short while back .
each country can make proposals and suggestions , we 've done it ourselves .
but when it comes to action , the union must present itself as a political entity , a community of states , all going in the same direction , " she added .
the eu has been slowly establishing a rapid reaction force , which began its first operation in macedonia last month , and its use in iraq could be a topic for discussion over the next few days .
the peace can be won militarily : fischer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu troops are already on missions in macedonia .
german foreign minister joschka fischer believes that after the war is over , order can be achieved militarily with europe 's peacekeeping experience and help to secure peace in iraq .
fischer said on sunday in an interview with swiss weekly nzz am sonntag that , " the danger does not go away after a military solution , quite the opposite .
we must win the peace when the war is over militarily . "
making his case for european involvement in iraq , fischer added , " it 's not that there 's too much america , there 's not enough europe .
europe is especially strong in matters that are not purely military .
that can be seen in the balkans , and is also true in afghanistan . "
german peacekeeping forces are currently in joint command in afghanistan .
eu leaders agreed on un role while the european union discusses what should happen next in iraq , the general consensus voiced throughout the member states is that the united nations should have a pivotal role in the reconstruction of iraq and that every effort must be made to return the country to a state of sovereignty .
fischer too emphasized that the u.n. should play a central role in postwar iraq .
" i believe , that the umbrella of the u.n. is of decisive importance when one considers the enormity of the tasks involved , " he said .
despite the differences between " the willing " , british prime minister tony blair , together with spain 's jose maria aznar , and the eu " anti-war " leaders , france and germany , it seems that eu leaders agree on one thing - the central role of the united nations in iraq 's reconstruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder talks with russian president vladimir putin .
returning from a two-day summit on iraq in saint petersburg with russia 's vladimir putin , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac demanded a central role for the united nations in rebuilding iraq .
chancellor schröder stressed that " the u.n. security council must confer legitimacy " on any reconstruction drive in iraq .

foreign ministers from the european union are discussing possible plans for involvement in postwar iraq at a meeting in luxembourg .
while humanitarian relief heads the agenda , some are suggesting a peacekeeping force . eu foreign ministers meeting in luxembourg on monday had no small task to consider .
after the fall of baghdad , the european union is considering two working proposals designed to provoke a wide-ranging debate on the 15-nation bloc 's role in postwar iraq and what concrete measures it should take in the reconstruction of the war-torn country .
the 14 ministers , minus britain 's jack straw who is in the gulf , are likely to avoid the sensitive issue of making firm decisions over iraq while military action continues in the country .
the proposals - one from the european commission ; one from the greek presidency - will analyze the role of the eu in post-conflict situations that it has committed to in the past , such as afghanistan , east timor , kosovo and cambodia and could be used as blueprints for any plan for eu involvement .
among other possible topics for discussion is the idea of sending an eu envoy to iraq or setting up an eu mission in the country .
eu to concentrate on humanitarian relief however , it remains unclear what role , if any , the european union will take in postwar iraq .
it is unlikely that the eu will commit itself to answering that question at the meeting .
in a proposal outlined by eu external affairs commissioner chris patten , the eu commission has urged the foreign ministers to find a quick common position on the role of the u.n. and the eu in the reconstruction of postwar iraq . " if the eu is in a position to clarify early which role it wants to play in iraq after the conflict , then it could possibly influence the contents of a u.n. resolution on the process , " the proposal said .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana described the meeting as a chance to take stock of events and regroup for decisions ahead .
" i expect a very solid debate , " he told the associated press .
" it 's a moment to take stock of what has been going on and to begin to take decisions although i do n't think that today will take very fundamental decisions ... it 's to get a sense of where we are . "
according to diplomats in luxembourg , the eu will , for the time being , confine itself to discussing how the eu can help in the shorter-term matter of getting aid to the iraqi people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers of german relief organization " asb " load humanitarian aid for iraq .
the european commission has already begun to channel € 21 million -lrb- $ 22.5 million -rrb- in humanitarian relief money into iraq and is pressing the member states to release another € 79 million .
" the first priority for the moment is humanitarian aid : how to mobilize to deliver aid in the most efficient and fastest way possible for the iraqi people , " one eu diplomat told the bbc .
" the second is security .
on this point , there is a consensus that this task is incumbent upon the military forces on the ground , " he added , with much of iraq in chaos since u.s. soldiers swept into baghdad last week .
no action has been excluded but france 's european affairs minister noelle lenoir hinted that the eu 's involvement may go beyond distributing aid when she was interviewed on french public radio broadcaster rfi , saying that the eu 's role in iraq may not be limited to humanitarian relief , and that " nothing has been excluded " .
refusing to be drawn into a debate on a possible eu military peace-keeping force in iraq , lenoir explained , " what we do n't want is for each country to go off on its own , a situation we regretted a short while back .
each country can make proposals and suggestions , we 've done it ourselves .
but when it comes to action , the union must present itself as a political entity , a community of states , all going in the same direction , " she added .
the eu has been slowly establishing a rapid reaction force , which began its first operation in macedonia last month , and its use in iraq could be a topic for discussion over the next few days .
the peace can be won militarily : fischer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu troops are already on missions in macedonia .
german foreign minister joschka fischer believes that after the war is over , order can be achieved militarily with europe 's peacekeeping experience and help to secure peace in iraq .
fischer said on sunday in an interview with swiss weekly nzz am sonntag that , " the danger does not go away after a military solution , quite the opposite .
we must win the peace when the war is over militarily . "
making his case for european involvement in iraq , fischer added , " it 's not that there 's too much america , there 's not enough europe .
europe is especially strong in matters that are not purely military .
that can be seen in the balkans , and is also true in afghanistan . "
german peacekeeping forces are currently in joint command in afghanistan .

effectively turning the event into a vote of confidence , spd general secretary olaf scholz said the reforms would be voted upon as a complete package at the congress . “ we believe there is now a situation where it has to be made clear that the spd stands behind the reform agenda and supports the policies of the chancellor , ” scholz told journalists on monday . schröder announced a package of sweeping reforms last month in an attempt to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system , but his “ agenda 2010 ” plan has encountered massive criticism from unions and the left-wing faction of the spd .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . storm of protest the government ’ s plans are likely to face a storm of protest at the congress , as the party ’ s hard-left members take the opportunity to attack proposals they say would irreparably damage the german welfare state .
the greens , schröder ’ s junior coalition partner , face opposition from its own regional chapters over the reforms and has scheduled its own party congress on june 14 . andrea nahles , the leader of the spd leftwing members of parliament said on monday he expected the government to back away from its reform agenda at the congress . “ i expect movement .
if there isn ’ t , we ’ ll head towards a confrontation , ” nahles told the reuters news agency in an interview . despite the resistance from within the government ’ s own ranks , schröder appears committed to his reform course .
after scraping to victory in last september ’ s general election , he has staked his political survival on pushing through the unpopular measures . economy grinds to a halt in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of 11 percent . rainer brüderle , the deputy chief of the opposition liberal free democrats , said the decision to have the spd congress showed the party would have difficult forcing the reforms through . “ the spd leadership suffered a crashing defeat .
it no longer has its own shop under control , ” said brüderle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unions are planning to demonstrate .
unfortunately for schröder , even if he faces down his own revolting backbenchers and regional spd chapters at the party congress , germany ’ s trade unions have announced major demonstrations against the chancellor ’ s reform plans starting may 1 . a traditional spd constituency , the unions argue relaxing job protection rules won ’ t create new jobs and are instead calling on the government to spend more on public works projects to spur the economy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unions threaten to oppose german reforms german chancellor gerhard schröder failed this week to persuade the nation ’ s trade unions to support his plans to reform the welfare state , heralding what could be a major confrontation with organized labor this spring .

german chancellor schröder and british prime minister blair have shown a united front at their meeting in hanover , agreeing that the united nations should have a pivotal role in postwar iraq . meeting to discuss the next steps in the reconstruction and rebuilding of iraq , blair and schröder attempted to put the serious rift over military action against iraq behind them .
claiming strong bilateral ties and friendships , the two leaders made clear they were united in their vision for the future for iraq despite past differences .
both agreed the united nations had to be the basis for reconstruction and aid as early as possible .
" i am very pleased to be here in germany with the chancellor who i regard as a good friend .
i am also pleased to say that bilateral relations are strong and will remain so , " said blair .
democracy and security needed swiftly blair said that both he and chancellor schröder were in strong agreement that the installation of a democratic government in iraq was vitally important and that progress in humanitarian and security efforts in the country must be implemented as swiftly as possible .
" it is time now to concentrate on the problems arising out of the new situation and to resolve those problems , " said schröder .
" it is no secret that germany wants the rebuilding to come from u.n. "
blair admitted the process to fully involve the united nations would be problematic but said : " there is an agreement that , in principle , the un must have a key role . "
german participation one question arising from the summit was the level of german involvement in the reconstruction and rebuilding of iraq .
having refused to participate in military action , pressure to take a role in postwar iraq is beginning to build on those countries who opted out and protested against the war .
gaining popularity for his stance on the war , schröder is now facing concern from german companies that fear they will miss out on lucrative contracts when rebuilding begins in iraq .

britain wants germany to help in post war iraq germany may have been staunchly against war with iraq , but its involvement rebuilding the postwar gulf state looks increasing likely . german troops may have played no part in coalition-led fighting against the fallen iraqi regime , but germany may yet play a central role in postwar iraq . the british prime minister , tony blair , is to meet chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday for talks on germany 's role in postwar iraq .
the two will meet in the german leader 's home constituency , hanover , ahead of wednesday 's summit of eu foreign ministers in athens , which u.n. secretary general kofi annan is expected to attend . while the world waits to see what shape iraq will take , reports in the german press are claiming that unofficial talks on germany 's post-conflict role have long been underway between the two countries . according to the reports , britain wants german experts to work predominantly in british-controlled southern iraq to rebuild telecommunication networks , re-establish electricity and water supplies and clear mines .
germans carrying arms may also play a role , albeit performing security functions . british defense secretary geoff hoon told the german sunday tabloid , bild am sonntag " we would welcome it if we -lrb- germany and great britain -rrb- could work together in iraq . " government denies unofficial talks but the german government – - which has already promised € 90 million in humanitarian aid to iraq and appears to be sticking to the eu line - has denied the rumors . " who is doing what can only be decided when the role of the u.n. has been clearly defined , " a government spokesperson told german news agency dpa .
the eu said this week it wants the u.n. to play a central role in iraq . over the weekend , however , german politicians were lining up to give their opinion on whether german firms should be involved in iraq . the leader of the opposition party , cdu / csu , angela merkel , together with chairman of the csu parliamentary group , michael glos called for a nato-led peacekeeping force to be sent to iraq and said they would hold the schröder government responsible if a nato no-show resulted in german companies missing out on lucrative contracts to re-build iraq . but the leader of the green parliamentary group , katrin göring-eckardt attacked merkel 's position , saying that germany should give humanitarian aid without thinking of the influence this might have on winning contracts . but any german involvement may not sit well with the bush administration after last weekend 's franco-russo-german summit in st. petersburg .
last week , the u.s. deputy defense minister , paul wolfowitz called for european countries to aid a swift rebuilding of iraq by waiving debts owed to them by iraq .
but german finance minister , hans eichel made it clear that germany would not be toeing the u.s. line regarding the loan repayments from iraq , estimated at $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.7 billion -rrb- . speaking at last weekend 's g7 summit in washington , eichel said : " i do n't merely expect to get the $ 4 billion back – i will get it back .

the three agreed the united nations must play a central role in rebuilding iraq , and force should only be used as a last resort .

britain wants germany to help in post war iraq germany may have been staunchly against war with iraq , but its involvement rebuilding the postwar gulf state looks increasing likely . german troops may have played no part in coalition-led fighting against the fallen iraqi regime , but germany may yet play a central role in postwar iraq . the british prime minister , tony blair , is to meet chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday for talks on germany 's role in postwar iraq .
the two will meet in the german leader 's home constituency , hanover , ahead of wednesday 's summit of eu foreign ministers in athens , which u.n. secretary general kofi annan is expected to attend . while the world waits to see what shape iraq will take , reports in the german press are claiming that unofficial talks on germany 's post-conflict role have long been underway between the two countries . according to the reports , britain wants german experts to work predominantly in british-controlled southern iraq to rebuild telecommunication networks , re-establish electricity and water supplies and clear mines .
germans carrying arms may also play a role , albeit performing security functions . british defense secretary geoff hoon told the german sunday tabloid , bild am sonntag " we would welcome it if we -lrb- germany and great britain -rrb- could work together in iraq . " government denies unofficial talks but the german government – - which has already promised € 90 million in humanitarian aid to iraq and appears to be sticking to the eu line - has denied the rumors . " who is doing what can only be decided when the role of the u.n. has been clearly defined , " a government spokesperson told german news agency dpa .
the eu said this week it wants the u.n. to play a central role in iraq . over the weekend , however , german politicians were lining up to give their opinion on whether german firms should be involved in iraq . the leader of the opposition party , cdu / csu , angela merkel , together with chairman of the csu parliamentary group , michael glos called for a nato-led peacekeeping force to be sent to iraq and said they would hold the schröder government responsible if a nato no-show resulted in german companies missing out on lucrative contracts to re-build iraq . but the leader of the green parliamentary group , katrin göring-eckardt attacked merkel 's position , saying that germany should give humanitarian aid without thinking of the influence this might have on winning contracts . but any german involvement may not sit well with the bush administration after last weekend 's franco-russo-german summit in st. petersburg .
last week , the u.s. deputy defense minister , paul wolfowitz called for european countries to aid a swift rebuilding of iraq by waiving debts owed to them by iraq .
but german finance minister , hans eichel made it clear that germany would not be toeing the u.s. line regarding the loan repayments from iraq , estimated at $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.7 billion -rrb- . speaking at last weekend 's g7 summit in washington , eichel said : " i do n't merely expect to get the $ 4 billion back – i will get it back .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 15.04.2003 eu ministers discuss possible role in postwar iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq is a broken country waiting for reconstruction to begin .
foreign ministers from the european union are discussing possible plans for involvement in postwar iraq at a meeting in luxembourg .
while humanitarian relief heads the agenda , some are suggesting a peacekeeping force . eu foreign ministers meeting in luxembourg on monday had no small task to consider .
after the fall of baghdad , the european union is considering two working proposals designed to provoke a wide-ranging debate on the 15-nation bloc 's role in postwar iraq and what concrete measures it should take in the reconstruction of the war-torn country .
the 14 ministers , minus britain 's jack straw who is in the gulf , are likely to avoid the sensitive issue of making firm decisions over iraq while military action continues in the country .
the proposals - one from the european commission ; one from the greek presidency - will analyze the role of the eu in post-conflict situations that it has committed to in the past , such as afghanistan , east timor , kosovo and cambodia and could be used as blueprints for any plan for eu involvement .
among other possible topics for discussion is the idea of sending an eu envoy to iraq or setting up an eu mission in the country .
eu to concentrate on humanitarian relief however , it remains unclear what role , if any , the european union will take in postwar iraq .
it is unlikely that the eu will commit itself to answering that question at the meeting .
in a proposal outlined by eu external affairs commissioner chris patten , the eu commission has urged the foreign ministers to find a quick common position on the role of the u.n. and the eu in the reconstruction of postwar iraq . " if the eu is in a position to clarify early which role it wants to play in iraq after the conflict , then it could possibly influence the contents of a u.n. resolution on the process , " the proposal said .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana described the meeting as a chance to take stock of events and regroup for decisions ahead .
" i expect a very solid debate , " he told the associated press .
" it 's a moment to take stock of what has been going on and to begin to take decisions although i do n't think that today will take very fundamental decisions ... it 's to get a sense of where we are . "
according to diplomats in luxembourg , the eu will , for the time being , confine itself to discussing how the eu can help in the shorter-term matter of getting aid to the iraqi people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers of german relief organization " asb " load humanitarian aid for iraq .
the european commission has already begun to channel € 21 million -lrb- $ 22.5 million -rrb- in humanitarian relief money into iraq and is pressing the member states to release another € 79 million .
" the first priority for the moment is humanitarian aid : how to mobilize to deliver aid in the most efficient and fastest way possible for the iraqi people , " one eu diplomat told the bbc .
" the second is security .
on this point , there is a consensus that this task is incumbent upon the military forces on the ground , " he added , with much of iraq in chaos since u.s. soldiers swept into baghdad last week .
no action has been excluded but france 's european affairs minister noelle lenoir hinted that the eu 's involvement may go beyond distributing aid when she was interviewed on french public radio broadcaster rfi , saying that the eu 's role in iraq may not be limited to humanitarian relief , and that " nothing has been excluded " .
refusing to be drawn into a debate on a possible eu military peace-keeping force in iraq , lenoir explained , " what we do n't want is for each country to go off on its own , a situation we regretted a short while back .
each country can make proposals and suggestions , we 've done it ourselves .
but when it comes to action , the union must present itself as a political entity , a community of states , all going in the same direction , " she added .
the eu has been slowly establishing a rapid reaction force , which began its first operation in macedonia last month , and its use in iraq could be a topic for discussion over the next few days .
the peace can be won militarily : fischer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu troops are already on missions in macedonia .
german foreign minister joschka fischer believes that after the war is over , order can be achieved militarily with europe 's peacekeeping experience and help to secure peace in iraq .
fischer said on sunday in an interview with swiss weekly nzz am sonntag that , " the danger does not go away after a military solution , quite the opposite .
we must win the peace when the war is over militarily . "
making his case for european involvement in iraq , fischer added , " it 's not that there 's too much america , there 's not enough europe .
europe is especially strong in matters that are not purely military .
that can be seen in the balkans , and is also true in afghanistan . "
german peacekeeping forces are currently in joint command in afghanistan .
eu leaders agreed on un role while the european union discusses what should happen next in iraq , the general consensus voiced throughout the member states is that the united nations should have a pivotal role in the reconstruction of iraq and that every effort must be made to return the country to a state of sovereignty .
fischer too emphasized that the u.n. should play a central role in postwar iraq .
" i believe , that the umbrella of the u.n. is of decisive importance when one considers the enormity of the tasks involved , " he said .
despite the differences between " the willing " , british prime minister tony blair , together with spain 's jose maria aznar , and the eu " anti-war " leaders , france and germany , it seems that eu leaders agree on one thing - the central role of the united nations in iraq 's reconstruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder talks with russian president vladimir putin .
returning from a two-day summit on iraq in saint petersburg with russia 's vladimir putin , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac demanded a central role for the united nations in rebuilding iraq .
chancellor schröder stressed that " the u.n. security council must confer legitimacy " on any reconstruction drive in iraq .
bridges to be built at athens summit as a result of growing calls for united nations involvement , secretary general kofi annan has cancelled visits to the uk , germany , france and russia to attend a special eu summit in athens that begins in wednesday .
it is likely that the debate will continue in the wings at the so-called " kiss and make up " summit in athens where the 10 eu candidate states will sign accession treaties .

german chancellor schröder and british prime minister blair have shown a united front at their meeting in hanover , agreeing that the united nations should have a pivotal role in postwar iraq . meeting to discuss the next steps in the reconstruction and rebuilding of iraq , blair and schröder attempted to put the serious rift over military action against iraq behind them .
claiming strong bilateral ties and friendships , the two leaders made clear they were united in their vision for the future for iraq despite past differences .
both agreed the united nations had to be the basis for reconstruction and aid as early as possible .
" i am very pleased to be here in germany with the chancellor who i regard as a good friend .
i am also pleased to say that bilateral relations are strong and will remain so , " said blair .
democracy and security needed swiftly blair said that both he and chancellor schröder were in strong agreement that the installation of a democratic government in iraq was vitally important and that progress in humanitarian and security efforts in the country must be implemented as swiftly as possible .
" it is time now to concentrate on the problems arising out of the new situation and to resolve those problems , " said schröder .
" it is no secret that germany wants the rebuilding to come from u.n. "
blair admitted the process to fully involve the united nations would be problematic but said : " there is an agreement that , in principle , the un must have a key role . "
german participation one question arising from the summit was the level of german involvement in the reconstruction and rebuilding of iraq .
having refused to participate in military action , pressure to take a role in postwar iraq is beginning to build on those countries who opted out and protested against the war .

foreign ministers from the european union are discussing possible plans for involvement in postwar iraq at a meeting in luxembourg .
while humanitarian relief heads the agenda , some are suggesting a peacekeeping force . eu foreign ministers meeting in luxembourg on monday had no small task to consider .
after the fall of baghdad , the european union is considering two working proposals designed to provoke a wide-ranging debate on the 15-nation bloc 's role in postwar iraq and what concrete measures it should take in the reconstruction of the war-torn country .
the 14 ministers , minus britain 's jack straw who is in the gulf , are likely to avoid the sensitive issue of making firm decisions over iraq while military action continues in the country .
the proposals - one from the european commission ; one from the greek presidency - will analyze the role of the eu in post-conflict situations that it has committed to in the past , such as afghanistan , east timor , kosovo and cambodia and could be used as blueprints for any plan for eu involvement .
among other possible topics for discussion is the idea of sending an eu envoy to iraq or setting up an eu mission in the country .
eu to concentrate on humanitarian relief however , it remains unclear what role , if any , the european union will take in postwar iraq .
it is unlikely that the eu will commit itself to answering that question at the meeting .
in a proposal outlined by eu external affairs commissioner chris patten , the eu commission has urged the foreign ministers to find a quick common position on the role of the u.n. and the eu in the reconstruction of postwar iraq . " if the eu is in a position to clarify early which role it wants to play in iraq after the conflict , then it could possibly influence the contents of a u.n. resolution on the process , " the proposal said .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana described the meeting as a chance to take stock of events and regroup for decisions ahead .
" i expect a very solid debate , " he told the associated press .
" it 's a moment to take stock of what has been going on and to begin to take decisions although i do n't think that today will take very fundamental decisions ... it 's to get a sense of where we are . "
according to diplomats in luxembourg , the eu will , for the time being , confine itself to discussing how the eu can help in the shorter-term matter of getting aid to the iraqi people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers of german relief organization " asb " load humanitarian aid for iraq .
the european commission has already begun to channel € 21 million -lrb- $ 22.5 million -rrb- in humanitarian relief money into iraq and is pressing the member states to release another € 79 million .
" the first priority for the moment is humanitarian aid : how to mobilize to deliver aid in the most efficient and fastest way possible for the iraqi people , " one eu diplomat told the bbc .
" the second is security .
on this point , there is a consensus that this task is incumbent upon the military forces on the ground , " he added , with much of iraq in chaos since u.s. soldiers swept into baghdad last week .
no action has been excluded but france 's european affairs minister noelle lenoir hinted that the eu 's involvement may go beyond distributing aid when she was interviewed on french public radio broadcaster rfi , saying that the eu 's role in iraq may not be limited to humanitarian relief , and that " nothing has been excluded " .
refusing to be drawn into a debate on a possible eu military peace-keeping force in iraq , lenoir explained , " what we do n't want is for each country to go off on its own , a situation we regretted a short while back .
each country can make proposals and suggestions , we 've done it ourselves .
but when it comes to action , the union must present itself as a political entity , a community of states , all going in the same direction , " she added .
the eu has been slowly establishing a rapid reaction force , which began its first operation in macedonia last month , and its use in iraq could be a topic for discussion over the next few days .
the peace can be won militarily : fischer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu troops are already on missions in macedonia .
german foreign minister joschka fischer believes that after the war is over , order can be achieved militarily with europe 's peacekeeping experience and help to secure peace in iraq .
fischer said on sunday in an interview with swiss weekly nzz am sonntag that , " the danger does not go away after a military solution , quite the opposite .
we must win the peace when the war is over militarily . "
making his case for european involvement in iraq , fischer added , " it 's not that there 's too much america , there 's not enough europe .
europe is especially strong in matters that are not purely military .
that can be seen in the balkans , and is also true in afghanistan . "
german peacekeeping forces are currently in joint command in afghanistan .
eu leaders agreed on un role while the european union discusses what should happen next in iraq , the general consensus voiced throughout the member states is that the united nations should have a pivotal role in the reconstruction of iraq and that every effort must be made to return the country to a state of sovereignty .
fischer too emphasized that the u.n. should play a central role in postwar iraq .
" i believe , that the umbrella of the u.n. is of decisive importance when one considers the enormity of the tasks involved , " he said .
despite the differences between " the willing " , british prime minister tony blair , together with spain 's jose maria aznar , and the eu " anti-war " leaders , france and germany , it seems that eu leaders agree on one thing - the central role of the united nations in iraq 's reconstruction .

foreign ministers from the european union are discussing possible plans for involvement in postwar iraq at a meeting in luxembourg .
while humanitarian relief heads the agenda , some are suggesting a peacekeeping force . eu foreign ministers meeting in luxembourg on monday had no small task to consider .
after the fall of baghdad , the european union is considering two working proposals designed to provoke a wide-ranging debate on the 15-nation bloc 's role in postwar iraq and what concrete measures it should take in the reconstruction of the war-torn country .
the 14 ministers , minus britain 's jack straw who is in the gulf , are likely to avoid the sensitive issue of making firm decisions over iraq while military action continues in the country .
the proposals - one from the european commission ; one from the greek presidency - will analyze the role of the eu in post-conflict situations that it has committed to in the past , such as afghanistan , east timor , kosovo and cambodia and could be used as blueprints for any plan for eu involvement .
among other possible topics for discussion is the idea of sending an eu envoy to iraq or setting up an eu mission in the country .
eu to concentrate on humanitarian relief however , it remains unclear what role , if any , the european union will take in postwar iraq .
it is unlikely that the eu will commit itself to answering that question at the meeting .
in a proposal outlined by eu external affairs commissioner chris patten , the eu commission has urged the foreign ministers to find a quick common position on the role of the u.n. and the eu in the reconstruction of postwar iraq . " if the eu is in a position to clarify early which role it wants to play in iraq after the conflict , then it could possibly influence the contents of a u.n. resolution on the process , " the proposal said .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana described the meeting as a chance to take stock of events and regroup for decisions ahead .
" i expect a very solid debate , " he told the associated press .
" it 's a moment to take stock of what has been going on and to begin to take decisions although i do n't think that today will take very fundamental decisions ... it 's to get a sense of where we are . "
according to diplomats in luxembourg , the eu will , for the time being , confine itself to discussing how the eu can help in the shorter-term matter of getting aid to the iraqi people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers of german relief organization " asb " load humanitarian aid for iraq .
the european commission has already begun to channel € 21 million -lrb- $ 22.5 million -rrb- in humanitarian relief money into iraq and is pressing the member states to release another € 79 million .
" the first priority for the moment is humanitarian aid : how to mobilize to deliver aid in the most efficient and fastest way possible for the iraqi people , " one eu diplomat told the bbc .
" the second is security .
on this point , there is a consensus that this task is incumbent upon the military forces on the ground , " he added , with much of iraq in chaos since u.s. soldiers swept into baghdad last week .
no action has been excluded but france 's european affairs minister noelle lenoir hinted that the eu 's involvement may go beyond distributing aid when she was interviewed on french public radio broadcaster rfi , saying that the eu 's role in iraq may not be limited to humanitarian relief , and that " nothing has been excluded " .
refusing to be drawn into a debate on a possible eu military peace-keeping force in iraq , lenoir explained , " what we do n't want is for each country to go off on its own , a situation we regretted a short while back .
each country can make proposals and suggestions , we 've done it ourselves .
but when it comes to action , the union must present itself as a political entity , a community of states , all going in the same direction , " she added .
the eu has been slowly establishing a rapid reaction force , which began its first operation in macedonia last month , and its use in iraq could be a topic for discussion over the next few days .
the peace can be won militarily : fischer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu troops are already on missions in macedonia .
german foreign minister joschka fischer believes that after the war is over , order can be achieved militarily with europe 's peacekeeping experience and help to secure peace in iraq .
fischer said on sunday in an interview with swiss weekly nzz am sonntag that , " the danger does not go away after a military solution , quite the opposite .
we must win the peace when the war is over militarily . "
making his case for european involvement in iraq , fischer added , " it 's not that there 's too much america , there 's not enough europe .
europe is especially strong in matters that are not purely military .
that can be seen in the balkans , and is also true in afghanistan . "
german peacekeeping forces are currently in joint command in afghanistan .
eu leaders agreed on un role while the european union discusses what should happen next in iraq , the general consensus voiced throughout the member states is that the united nations should have a pivotal role in the reconstruction of iraq and that every effort must be made to return the country to a state of sovereignty .
fischer too emphasized that the u.n. should play a central role in postwar iraq .
" i believe , that the umbrella of the u.n. is of decisive importance when one considers the enormity of the tasks involved , " he said .
despite the differences between " the willing " , british prime minister tony blair , together with spain 's jose maria aznar , and the eu " anti-war " leaders , france and germany , it seems that eu leaders agree on one thing - the central role of the united nations in iraq 's reconstruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder talks with russian president vladimir putin .
returning from a two-day summit on iraq in saint petersburg with russia 's vladimir putin , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac demanded a central role for the united nations in rebuilding iraq .
chancellor schröder stressed that " the u.n. security council must confer legitimacy " on any reconstruction drive in iraq .
bridges to be built at athens summit as a result of growing calls for united nations involvement , secretary general kofi annan has cancelled visits to the uk , germany , france and russia to attend a special eu summit in athens that begins in wednesday .
it is likely that the debate will continue in the wings at the so-called " kiss and make up " summit in athens where the 10 eu candidate states will sign accession treaties .

britain wants germany to help in post war iraq germany may have been staunchly against war with iraq , but its involvement rebuilding the postwar gulf state looks increasing likely . german troops may have played no part in coalition-led fighting against the fallen iraqi regime , but germany may yet play a central role in postwar iraq . the british prime minister , tony blair , is to meet chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday for talks on germany 's role in postwar iraq .
the two will meet in the german leader 's home constituency , hanover , ahead of wednesday 's summit of eu foreign ministers in athens , which u.n. secretary general kofi annan is expected to attend . while the world waits to see what shape iraq will take , reports in the german press are claiming that unofficial talks on germany 's post-conflict role have long been underway between the two countries . according to the reports , britain wants german experts to work predominantly in british-controlled southern iraq to rebuild telecommunication networks , re-establish electricity and water supplies and clear mines .
germans carrying arms may also play a role , albeit performing security functions . british defense secretary geoff hoon told the german sunday tabloid , bild am sonntag " we would welcome it if we -lrb- germany and great britain -rrb- could work together in iraq . " government denies unofficial talks but the german government – - which has already promised € 90 million in humanitarian aid to iraq and appears to be sticking to the eu line - has denied the rumors . " who is doing what can only be decided when the role of the u.n. has been clearly defined , " a government spokesperson told german news agency dpa .
the eu said this week it wants the u.n. to play a central role in iraq . over the weekend , however , german politicians were lining up to give their opinion on whether german firms should be involved in iraq . the leader of the opposition party , cdu / csu , angela merkel , together with chairman of the csu parliamentary group , michael glos called for a nato-led peacekeeping force to be sent to iraq and said they would hold the schröder government responsible if a nato no-show resulted in german companies missing out on lucrative contracts to re-build iraq . but the leader of the green parliamentary group , katrin göring-eckardt attacked merkel 's position , saying that germany should give humanitarian aid without thinking of the influence this might have on winning contracts . but any german involvement may not sit well with the bush administration after last weekend 's franco-russo-german summit in st. petersburg .
last week , the u.s. deputy defense minister , paul wolfowitz called for european countries to aid a swift rebuilding of iraq by waiving debts owed to them by iraq .
but german finance minister , hans eichel made it clear that germany would not be toeing the u.s. line regarding the loan repayments from iraq , estimated at $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.7 billion -rrb- . speaking at last weekend 's g7 summit in washington , eichel said : " i do n't merely expect to get the $ 4 billion back – i will get it back .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday tied his political fate to a special party congress on the government ’ s controversial plans to reform the welfare state and spur the economy . giving in to demands from the grassroots of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , german chancellor gerhard schröder agreed to hold a party congress on june 1 after meeting with the spd leadership in berlin .
effectively turning the event into a vote of confidence , spd general secretary olaf scholz said the reforms would be voted upon as a complete package at the congress . “ we believe there is now a situation where it has to be made clear that the spd stands behind the reform agenda and supports the policies of the chancellor , ” scholz told journalists on monday . schröder announced a package of sweeping reforms last month in an attempt to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system , but his “ agenda 2010 ” plan has encountered massive criticism from unions and the left-wing faction of the spd .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . storm of protest the government ’ s plans are likely to face a storm of protest at the congress , as the party ’ s hard-left members take the opportunity to attack proposals they say would irreparably damage the german welfare state .
the greens , schröder ’ s junior coalition partner , face opposition from its own regional chapters over the reforms and has scheduled its own party congress on june 14 . andrea nahles , the leader of the spd leftwing members of parliament said on monday he expected the government to back away from its reform agenda at the congress . “ i expect movement .
if there isn ’ t , we ’ ll head towards a confrontation , ” nahles told the reuters news agency in an interview . despite the resistance from within the government ’ s own ranks , schröder appears committed to his reform course .
after scraping to victory in last september ’ s general election , he has staked his political survival on pushing through the unpopular measures . economy grinds to a halt in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of 11 percent . rainer brüderle , the deputy chief of the opposition liberal free democrats , said the decision to have the spd congress showed the party would have difficult forcing the reforms through . “ the spd leadership suffered a crashing defeat .
it no longer has its own shop under control , ” said brüderle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unions are planning to demonstrate .
unfortunately for schröder , even if he faces down his own revolting backbenchers and regional spd chapters at the party congress , germany ’ s trade unions have announced major demonstrations against the chancellor ’ s reform plans starting may 1 . a traditional spd constituency , the unions argue relaxing job protection rules won ’ t create new jobs and are instead calling on the government to spend more on public works projects to spur the economy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unions threaten to oppose german reforms german chancellor gerhard schröder failed this week to persuade the nation ’ s trade unions to support his plans to reform the welfare state , heralding what could be a major confrontation with organized labor this spring .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday tied his political fate to a special party congress on the government ’ s controversial plans to reform the welfare state and spur the economy . giving in to demands from the grassroots of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , german chancellor gerhard schröder agreed to hold a party congress on june 1 after meeting with the spd leadership in berlin .
effectively turning the event into a vote of confidence , spd general secretary olaf scholz said the reforms would be voted upon as a complete package at the congress . “ we believe there is now a situation where it has to be made clear that the spd stands behind the reform agenda and supports the policies of the chancellor , ” scholz told journalists on monday . schröder announced a package of sweeping reforms last month in an attempt to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system , but his “ agenda 2010 ” plan has encountered massive criticism from unions and the left-wing faction of the spd .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . storm of protest the government ’ s plans are likely to face a storm of protest at the congress , as the party ’ s hard-left members take the opportunity to attack proposals they say would irreparably damage the german welfare state .
the greens , schröder ’ s junior coalition partner , face opposition from its own regional chapters over the reforms and has scheduled its own party congress on june 14 . andrea nahles , the leader of the spd leftwing members of parliament said on monday he expected the government to back away from its reform agenda at the congress . “ i expect movement .
if there isn ’ t , we ’ ll head towards a confrontation , ” nahles told the reuters news agency in an interview . despite the resistance from within the government ’ s own ranks , schröder appears committed to his reform course .
after scraping to victory in last september ’ s general election , he has staked his political survival on pushing through the unpopular measures . economy grinds to a halt in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of 11 percent . rainer brüderle , the deputy chief of the opposition liberal free democrats , said the decision to have the spd congress showed the party would have difficult forcing the reforms through . “ the spd leadership suffered a crashing defeat .
it no longer has its own shop under control , ” said brüderle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unions are planning to demonstrate .
unfortunately for schröder , even if he faces down his own revolting backbenchers and regional spd chapters at the party congress , germany ’ s trade unions have announced major demonstrations against the chancellor ’ s reform plans starting may 1 . a traditional spd constituency , the unions argue relaxing job protection rules won ’ t create new jobs and are instead calling on the government to spend more on public works projects to spur the economy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unions threaten to oppose german reforms german chancellor gerhard schröder failed this week to persuade the nation ’ s trade unions to support his plans to reform the welfare state , heralding what could be a major confrontation with organized labor this spring .

foreign ministers from the european union are discussing possible plans for involvement in postwar iraq at a meeting in luxembourg .
while humanitarian relief heads the agenda , some are suggesting a peacekeeping force . eu foreign ministers meeting in luxembourg on monday had no small task to consider .
after the fall of baghdad , the european union is considering two working proposals designed to provoke a wide-ranging debate on the 15-nation bloc 's role in postwar iraq and what concrete measures it should take in the reconstruction of the war-torn country .
the 14 ministers , minus britain 's jack straw who is in the gulf , are likely to avoid the sensitive issue of making firm decisions over iraq while military action continues in the country .
the proposals - one from the european commission ; one from the greek presidency - will analyze the role of the eu in post-conflict situations that it has committed to in the past , such as afghanistan , east timor , kosovo and cambodia and could be used as blueprints for any plan for eu involvement .
among other possible topics for discussion is the idea of sending an eu envoy to iraq or setting up an eu mission in the country .
eu to concentrate on humanitarian relief however , it remains unclear what role , if any , the european union will take in postwar iraq .
it is unlikely that the eu will commit itself to answering that question at the meeting .
in a proposal outlined by eu external affairs commissioner chris patten , the eu commission has urged the foreign ministers to find a quick common position on the role of the u.n. and the eu in the reconstruction of postwar iraq . " if the eu is in a position to clarify early which role it wants to play in iraq after the conflict , then it could possibly influence the contents of a u.n. resolution on the process , " the proposal said .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana described the meeting as a chance to take stock of events and regroup for decisions ahead .
" i expect a very solid debate , " he told the associated press .
" it 's a moment to take stock of what has been going on and to begin to take decisions although i do n't think that today will take very fundamental decisions ... it 's to get a sense of where we are . "
according to diplomats in luxembourg , the eu will , for the time being , confine itself to discussing how the eu can help in the shorter-term matter of getting aid to the iraqi people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers of german relief organization " asb " load humanitarian aid for iraq .
the european commission has already begun to channel € 21 million -lrb- $ 22.5 million -rrb- in humanitarian relief money into iraq and is pressing the member states to release another € 79 million .
" the first priority for the moment is humanitarian aid : how to mobilize to deliver aid in the most efficient and fastest way possible for the iraqi people , " one eu diplomat told the bbc .
" the second is security .
on this point , there is a consensus that this task is incumbent upon the military forces on the ground , " he added , with much of iraq in chaos since u.s. soldiers swept into baghdad last week .
no action has been excluded but france 's european affairs minister noelle lenoir hinted that the eu 's involvement may go beyond distributing aid when she was interviewed on french public radio broadcaster rfi , saying that the eu 's role in iraq may not be limited to humanitarian relief , and that " nothing has been excluded " .
refusing to be drawn into a debate on a possible eu military peace-keeping force in iraq , lenoir explained , " what we do n't want is for each country to go off on its own , a situation we regretted a short while back .
each country can make proposals and suggestions , we 've done it ourselves .
but when it comes to action , the union must present itself as a political entity , a community of states , all going in the same direction , " she added .
the eu has been slowly establishing a rapid reaction force , which began its first operation in macedonia last month , and its use in iraq could be a topic for discussion over the next few days .
the peace can be won militarily : fischer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu troops are already on missions in macedonia .
german foreign minister joschka fischer believes that after the war is over , order can be achieved militarily with europe 's peacekeeping experience and help to secure peace in iraq .
fischer said on sunday in an interview with swiss weekly nzz am sonntag that , " the danger does not go away after a military solution , quite the opposite .
we must win the peace when the war is over militarily . "
making his case for european involvement in iraq , fischer added , " it 's not that there 's too much america , there 's not enough europe .
europe is especially strong in matters that are not purely military .
that can be seen in the balkans , and is also true in afghanistan . "
german peacekeeping forces are currently in joint command in afghanistan .
eu leaders agreed on un role while the european union discusses what should happen next in iraq , the general consensus voiced throughout the member states is that the united nations should have a pivotal role in the reconstruction of iraq and that every effort must be made to return the country to a state of sovereignty .
fischer too emphasized that the u.n. should play a central role in postwar iraq .
" i believe , that the umbrella of the u.n. is of decisive importance when one considers the enormity of the tasks involved , " he said .
despite the differences between " the willing " , british prime minister tony blair , together with spain 's jose maria aznar , and the eu " anti-war " leaders , france and germany , it seems that eu leaders agree on one thing - the central role of the united nations in iraq 's reconstruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder talks with russian president vladimir putin .
returning from a two-day summit on iraq in saint petersburg with russia 's vladimir putin , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac demanded a central role for the united nations in rebuilding iraq .
chancellor schröder stressed that " the u.n. security council must confer legitimacy " on any reconstruction drive in iraq .

foreign ministers from the european union are discussing possible plans for involvement in postwar iraq at a meeting in luxembourg .
while humanitarian relief heads the agenda , some are suggesting a peacekeeping force . eu foreign ministers meeting in luxembourg on monday had no small task to consider .
after the fall of baghdad , the european union is considering two working proposals designed to provoke a wide-ranging debate on the 15-nation bloc 's role in postwar iraq and what concrete measures it should take in the reconstruction of the war-torn country .
the 14 ministers , minus britain 's jack straw who is in the gulf , are likely to avoid the sensitive issue of making firm decisions over iraq while military action continues in the country .
the proposals - one from the european commission ; one from the greek presidency - will analyze the role of the eu in post-conflict situations that it has committed to in the past , such as afghanistan , east timor , kosovo and cambodia and could be used as blueprints for any plan for eu involvement .
among other possible topics for discussion is the idea of sending an eu envoy to iraq or setting up an eu mission in the country .
eu to concentrate on humanitarian relief however , it remains unclear what role , if any , the european union will take in postwar iraq .
it is unlikely that the eu will commit itself to answering that question at the meeting .
in a proposal outlined by eu external affairs commissioner chris patten , the eu commission has urged the foreign ministers to find a quick common position on the role of the u.n. and the eu in the reconstruction of postwar iraq . " if the eu is in a position to clarify early which role it wants to play in iraq after the conflict , then it could possibly influence the contents of a u.n. resolution on the process , " the proposal said .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana described the meeting as a chance to take stock of events and regroup for decisions ahead .
" i expect a very solid debate , " he told the associated press .
" it 's a moment to take stock of what has been going on and to begin to take decisions although i do n't think that today will take very fundamental decisions ... it 's to get a sense of where we are . "
according to diplomats in luxembourg , the eu will , for the time being , confine itself to discussing how the eu can help in the shorter-term matter of getting aid to the iraqi people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers of german relief organization " asb " load humanitarian aid for iraq .
the european commission has already begun to channel € 21 million -lrb- $ 22.5 million -rrb- in humanitarian relief money into iraq and is pressing the member states to release another € 79 million .
" the first priority for the moment is humanitarian aid : how to mobilize to deliver aid in the most efficient and fastest way possible for the iraqi people , " one eu diplomat told the bbc .
" the second is security .
on this point , there is a consensus that this task is incumbent upon the military forces on the ground , " he added , with much of iraq in chaos since u.s. soldiers swept into baghdad last week .
no action has been excluded but france 's european affairs minister noelle lenoir hinted that the eu 's involvement may go beyond distributing aid when she was interviewed on french public radio broadcaster rfi , saying that the eu 's role in iraq may not be limited to humanitarian relief , and that " nothing has been excluded " .
refusing to be drawn into a debate on a possible eu military peace-keeping force in iraq , lenoir explained , " what we do n't want is for each country to go off on its own , a situation we regretted a short while back .
each country can make proposals and suggestions , we 've done it ourselves .
but when it comes to action , the union must present itself as a political entity , a community of states , all going in the same direction , " she added .
the eu has been slowly establishing a rapid reaction force , which began its first operation in macedonia last month , and its use in iraq could be a topic for discussion over the next few days .
the peace can be won militarily : fischer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu troops are already on missions in macedonia .
german foreign minister joschka fischer believes that after the war is over , order can be achieved militarily with europe 's peacekeeping experience and help to secure peace in iraq .
fischer said on sunday in an interview with swiss weekly nzz am sonntag that , " the danger does not go away after a military solution , quite the opposite .
we must win the peace when the war is over militarily . "
making his case for european involvement in iraq , fischer added , " it 's not that there 's too much america , there 's not enough europe .
europe is especially strong in matters that are not purely military .
that can be seen in the balkans , and is also true in afghanistan . "
german peacekeeping forces are currently in joint command in afghanistan .
eu leaders agreed on un role while the european union discusses what should happen next in iraq , the general consensus voiced throughout the member states is that the united nations should have a pivotal role in the reconstruction of iraq and that every effort must be made to return the country to a state of sovereignty .
fischer too emphasized that the u.n. should play a central role in postwar iraq .
" i believe , that the umbrella of the u.n. is of decisive importance when one considers the enormity of the tasks involved , " he said .
despite the differences between " the willing " , british prime minister tony blair , together with spain 's jose maria aznar , and the eu " anti-war " leaders , france and germany , it seems that eu leaders agree on one thing - the central role of the united nations in iraq 's reconstruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder talks with russian president vladimir putin .
returning from a two-day summit on iraq in saint petersburg with russia 's vladimir putin , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac demanded a central role for the united nations in rebuilding iraq .
chancellor schröder stressed that " the u.n. security council must confer legitimacy " on any reconstruction drive in iraq .

" the first priority for the moment is humanitarian aid : how to mobilize to deliver aid in the most efficient and fastest way possible for the iraqi people , " one eu diplomat told the bbc .
" the second is security .
on this point , there is a consensus that this task is incumbent upon the military forces on the ground , " he added , with much of iraq in chaos since u.s. soldiers swept into baghdad last week .
no action has been excluded but france 's european affairs minister noelle lenoir hinted that the eu 's involvement may go beyond distributing aid when she was interviewed on french public radio broadcaster rfi , saying that the eu 's role in iraq may not be limited to humanitarian relief , and that " nothing has been excluded " .
refusing to be drawn into a debate on a possible eu military peace-keeping force in iraq , lenoir explained , " what we do n't want is for each country to go off on its own , a situation we regretted a short while back .
each country can make proposals and suggestions , we 've done it ourselves .
but when it comes to action , the union must present itself as a political entity , a community of states , all going in the same direction , " she added .
the eu has been slowly establishing a rapid reaction force , which began its first operation in macedonia last month , and its use in iraq could be a topic for discussion over the next few days .
the peace can be won militarily : fischer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu troops are already on missions in macedonia .
german foreign minister joschka fischer believes that after the war is over , order can be achieved militarily with europe 's peacekeeping experience and help to secure peace in iraq .
fischer said on sunday in an interview with swiss weekly nzz am sonntag that , " the danger does not go away after a military solution , quite the opposite .
we must win the peace when the war is over militarily . "
making his case for european involvement in iraq , fischer added , " it 's not that there 's too much america , there 's not enough europe .
europe is especially strong in matters that are not purely military .
that can be seen in the balkans , and is also true in afghanistan . "
german peacekeeping forces are currently in joint command in afghanistan .
eu leaders agreed on un role while the european union discusses what should happen next in iraq , the general consensus voiced throughout the member states is that the united nations should have a pivotal role in the reconstruction of iraq and that every effort must be made to return the country to a state of sovereignty .
fischer too emphasized that the u.n. should play a central role in postwar iraq .
" i believe , that the umbrella of the u.n. is of decisive importance when one considers the enormity of the tasks involved , " he said .
despite the differences between " the willing " , british prime minister tony blair , together with spain 's jose maria aznar , and the eu " anti-war " leaders , france and germany , it seems that eu leaders agree on one thing - the central role of the united nations in iraq 's reconstruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder talks with russian president vladimir putin .
returning from a two-day summit on iraq in saint petersburg with russia 's vladimir putin , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac demanded a central role for the united nations in rebuilding iraq .
chancellor schröder stressed that " the u.n. security council must confer legitimacy " on any reconstruction drive in iraq .
bridges to be built at athens summit as a result of growing calls for united nations involvement , secretary general kofi annan has cancelled visits to the uk , germany , france and russia to attend a special eu summit in athens that begins in wednesday .
it is likely that the debate will continue in the wings at the so-called " kiss and make up " summit in athens where the 10 eu candidate states will sign accession treaties .

professor michael adler is the latest expert to warn that growing levels of complacency about safe sex could have serious consequences .
his comments come as a separate study shows that lesbian and bisexual woman often fail to take adequate precautions to protect themselves from sexually transmitted disease .
although the rate of sti transmission among lesbian and bisexual women is relatively low , the report suggests that women who think they face no risk are wrong .
writing in the medical journal , sexually transmitted infections , professor adler , of the royal free and university college medical school , london , paints a dismal picture of the nation 's declining sexual health over the past decade .
he points to the government 's failure to deliver on all the sexual health targets set out in its publication , the health of the nation , in 1992 .
there has been an upsurge in chlamydial and gonococcal bacterial infections of well over 70 % since 1997 . "
it is no exaggeration that we now face a public health crisis in relation to sexual health " professor michael adler cases of hiv and aids are set to rise almost 10 % a year , and to double between 1997 and 2005 .
syphilis has risen 374 % since 1997 , with an increase of 112 % alone between 2000 and 2001 .
in addition , the teenage pregnancy rate of 8.3 per 1,000 in 2000 , is well below the health of the nation target of 4.8 per 1,000 .
professor adler said the £ 47.5m the government has allocated for its sexual health strategy , announced in 2000 , wo n't even cover one aspect of the strategy - the chlamydial screening programme .
he warned sexual health clinics are struggling to cope with demand - with some people in large urban centres forced to wait over a month for an appointment .
and he said consultant expansion in genitourinary medicine was currently 90 % below target .
he said : " it is no exaggeration that we now face a public health crisis in relation to sexual health .
" sexual health is not an nhs or political priority .
until it becomes so , we will witness further failure upon further failure . "
a department of health spokesman said a 10-year action plan had been put in place , but it was unrealistic to expect quick fixes .
he said : " we must both improve and modernise services , and also seek to change individual behaviour . "
lesbian survey the same issue of the journal carries a survey of the sexual experiences of over 1,200 lesbian and bisexual women .
among the 328 women asked about safer sex practices , a third who had had penetrative sex with men had never used a condom .
and over 85 % of lesbians engaging in oral sex with other women did not use dental dams .
a dental dam is basically a small sheet of latex which acts as a barrier between the vagina or anus and the mouth .
in addition , one in five of those sharing sex toys said they did not wash them before sharing .
although uncommon , women can pass on sexually transmitted infections to other women , including herpes , trichomoniasis , papilloma virus , syphilis , hiv and bacterial vaginosis .
the survey also found that the first sexual experience for many lesbians is with a man .
one in four lesbians and almost a third -lrb- 29 % -rrb- of bisexual women had been pregnant .
the average number of sexual partners in the preceding year was one , the survey showed .

professor michael adler is the latest expert to warn that growing levels of complacency about safe sex could have serious consequences .
his comments come as a separate study shows that lesbian and bisexual woman often fail to take adequate precautions to protect themselves from sexually transmitted disease .
although the rate of sti transmission among lesbian and bisexual women is relatively low , the report suggests that women who think they face no risk are wrong .
writing in the medical journal , sexually transmitted infections , professor adler , of the royal free and university college medical school , london , paints a dismal picture of the nation 's declining sexual health over the past decade .
he points to the government 's failure to deliver on all the sexual health targets set out in its publication , the health of the nation , in 1992 .
there has been an upsurge in chlamydial and gonococcal bacterial infections of well over 70 % since 1997 .
it is no exaggeration that we now face a public health crisis in relation to sexual health professor michael adler cases of hiv and aids are set to rise almost 10 % a year , and to double between 1997 and 2005 .
syphilis has risen 374 % since 1997 , with an increase of 112 % alone between 2000 and 2001 .
in addition , the teenage pregnancy rate of 8.3 per 1,000 in 2000 , is well below the health of the nation target of 4.8 per 1,000 .
professor adler said the £ 47.5m the government has allocated for its sexual health strategy , announced in 2000 , wo n't even cover one aspect of the strategy - the chlamydial screening programme .
he warned sexual health clinics are struggling to cope with demand - with some people in large urban centres forced to wait over a month for an appointment .
and he said consultant expansion in genitourinary medicine was currently 90 % below target .
he said : " it is no exaggeration that we now face a public health crisis in relation to sexual health .
" sexual health is not an nhs or political priority .
until it becomes so , we will witness further failure upon further failure . "
a department of health spokesman said a 10-year action plan had been put in place , but it was unrealistic to expect quick fixes .
he said : " we must both improve and modernise services , and also seek to change individual behaviour . "
lesbian survey the same issue of the journal carries a survey of the sexual experiences of over 1,200 lesbian and bisexual women .
among the 328 women asked about safer sex practices , a third who had had penetrative sex with men had never used a condom .
and over 85 % of lesbians engaging in oral sex with other women did not use dental dams .
a dental dam is basically a small sheet of latex which acts as a barrier between the vagina or anus and the mouth .
in addition , one in five of those sharing sex toys said they did not wash them before sharing .
although uncommon , women can pass on sexually transmitted infections to other women , including herpes , trichomoniasis , papilloma virus , syphilis , hiv and bacterial vaginosis .
the survey also found that the first sexual experience for many lesbians is with a man .

the criticism of the way regeneration money has been spent in the uk comes in a new report from the commons urban affairs sub-committee .
the mps say there are just too many different whitehall schemes and they argue local councils need more freedom to choose what works for their area .
too much regeneration money is also currently spent without the results being properly judged , says the report published on tuesday .
it continues : " consultants reports often claimed that output measures -lrb- eg the number of jobs created -rrb- had been met .
" but , in fact , large sums of additional money have been spent on the same deprived areas over and over again without bringing a significant or lasting improvement . "
the report , called the effectiveness of government regeneration initiatives , suggests the fact that many disadvantaged areas remain deprived proves the point .
swathe of schemes in some areas , the people behind regeneration schemes are not properly analysing an area 's needs and instead " chase any and all programmes " .
evidence from the government 's regional development agency suggests there can be about 27 different area-based initiatives under way in any one of the english regions , says the report .
labour mp clive betts , the committee 's chairman , said : " there are too many centrally driven national area-based initiatives .
" those working on the ground can not hope to make sense of all the different national programmes , never mind the associated bureaucracy .
" government tasked the regional coordination unit with reducing the number of initiatives , indeed the unit was termed the ' gatekeeper ' .
" we however are far from convinced it has sufficient clout because initiatives continue to squeeze under the gate .
" different places have different needs .
government currently assumes one size fits all , this is wrong .
" local authorities need the freedom to devise local solutions to local needs . "
riots worries the committee says all new regeneration schemes should report publicly on the effect they could have on community relations .
it was told that the way regeneration cash had been distributed might have added to the tensions which sparked the 2001 riots in bradford , oldham and burnley .
" the competition for recoveries between communities had exacerbated divisions in areas where there was a strong correlation between wards and different ethnic groups , " says the report .
the mps criticise development of brownfield sites in some areas , which they say has been " poor quality " and often made the area 's image worse .
in future , regional development agencies should explicitly aim to " improve the design of buildings and public spaces in regeneration areas " , they say .
wasted red tape ?
there is a call too for more training of people working on regeneration projects .
the committee was also worried the government 's offices in the regions were not having much effect on regeneration schemes .
" we recommend that in response to this report , ministers outline what impact the government offices are having on the ground , " he said .
" ministers must consider whether the government offices add to the bureaucracy and administration costs of delivering regeneration . "

the criticism of the way regeneration money has been spent in the uk comes in a new report from the commons urban affairs sub-committee .
the mps say there are just too many different whitehall schemes and they argue local councils need more freedom to choose what works for their area .
too much regeneration money is also currently spent without the results being properly judged , says the report published on tuesday .
it continues : " consultants reports often claimed that output measures -lrb- eg the number of jobs created -rrb- had been met .
" but , in fact , large sums of additional money have been spent on the same deprived areas over and over again without bringing a significant or lasting improvement . "
the report , called the effectiveness of government regeneration initiatives , suggests the fact that many disadvantaged areas remain deprived proves the point .
swathe of schemes in some areas , the people behind regeneration schemes are not properly analysing an area 's needs and instead " chase any and all programmes " .
evidence from the government 's regional development agency suggests there can be about 27 different area-based initiatives under way in any one of the english regions , says the report .
labour mp clive betts , the committee 's chairman , said : " there are too many centrally driven national area-based initiatives .
" those working on the ground can not hope to make sense of all the different national programmes , never mind the associated bureaucracy .
" government tasked the regional coordination unit with reducing the number of initiatives , indeed the unit was termed the ' gatekeeper ' .
" we however are far from convinced it has sufficient clout because initiatives continue to squeeze under the gate .
" different places have different needs .
government currently assumes one size fits all , this is wrong .
" local authorities need the freedom to devise local solutions to local needs . "
riots worries the committee says all new regeneration schemes should report publicly on the effect they could have on community relations .
it was told that the way regeneration cash had been distributed might have added to the tensions which sparked the 2001 riots in bradford , oldham and burnley .
" the competition for recoveries between communities had exacerbated divisions in areas where there was a strong correlation between wards and different ethnic groups , " says the report .
the mps criticise development of brownfield sites in some areas , which they say has been " poor quality " and often made the area 's image worse .
in future , regional development agencies should explicitly aim to " improve the design of buildings and public spaces in regeneration areas " , they say .
wasted red tape ?
there is a call too for more training of people working on regeneration projects .
the committee was also worried the government 's offices in the regions were not having much effect on regeneration schemes .
" we recommend that in response to this report , ministers outline what impact the government offices are having on the ground , " he said .
" ministers must consider whether the government offices add to the bureaucracy and administration costs of delivering regeneration . "

tokyo electric power company -lrb- tepco -rrb- shut down its last running reactor in fukushima , 200 kilometres -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north-east of tokyo , at midnight -lrb- 1500 gmt monday -rrb- .
japan 's nuclear industry been hit by a series of accidents and safety scandals in recent years - including the country 's worst ever nuclear accident in 1999 , when two people were killed because of lax safety standards .
the capital can switch to using fossil fuels to make up some of the shortfall .
but unless tepco completes the safety checks on several nuclear plants before the summer , tokyo would face its first power cuts due to a shortfall in supply .
" unless we can restart the facilities whose operations are halted now , we will inevitably face power shortages , " said cabinet spokesman yasuo fukuda .
" the government will do all it can , " he added , although no date has been set for restarting the facilities .
workers at tokaimura had been illegally mixing uranium in buckets " we do n't know how long the inspection will last .
at this moment , we do n't know when to resume our operations , " tepco spokesman mamoru shirakashi said .
according to mr shirakashi , the company needs to run at least 10 nuclear reactors to meet its customer demands this summer , when air conditioner use peaks in japan 's humid season .
if this does not happen the company could rely on thermal power and buying power from other suppliers .
" but these measures are not enough to meet the expected energy demand , " mr shirakashi warned .
tepco was ordered to shut down its nuclear facilities for a full safety inspection after admitting last year it had covered up maintenance problems and obstructed government inspections .
the japanese public is highly nervous about the safety of nuclear plants , especially since a radiation leak at a uranium processing facility in tokaimura three years ago , which killed two and exposed 600 to radiation .
afterwards it was discovered that workers at the power station had been illegally mixing uranium in buckets .
