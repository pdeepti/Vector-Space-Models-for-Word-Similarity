an earnest project aided by marketing and branding experts is underway in london to jazz up germany ’ s humorless and stereotypically staid image in great britain as reflected in a recent survey . it ’ s no secret that germany ’ s image in britain is in bad shape .
whether it ’ s the tabloids taking a gibe with headlines like " herr we go – bring on the krauts " or " let ’ s blitz fritz " when england was pitted against germany in the 1996 european soccer championships , weekly television documentaries on hitler and concentration camps or papers such as the independent concluding recently that books with swastikas gracing the cover are guaranteed to be bestsellers , the british are still fed cliché-heavy doses of germany ’ s past .
the only other strong connection most british citizens have to the germans are parked in their garages : german cars have a brilliant reputation and reinforce the image of their makers as being reliable , punctual and efficient .
clueless about modern germany little wonder then that a recent survey conducted by the goethe institut , the german language and cultural center , and the british council turned out such negative results .
the poll , which quizzed young people between 16 and 25 years on their picture of modern germany , drew up mostly question marks .
although 37 percent of the british displayed a positive stance towards germany , they could only come up with beer and sport as the two things they identified with the country .
another 17 percent said they didn ’ t like germany and cited its military past , far-right tendencies and the apparent lack of manners and humor of the germans as reasons .
an astonishing 64 percent couldn ’ t name a single living famous german personality -lrb- supermodel claudia schiffer was mentioned a few times -rrb- .
another larger survey conducted for the goethe institut last year concluded that more than half the british population – 52 percent – said they didn ’ t have a clue about modern day germany .
more than hitler and nazi past alarmed by the unpopularity of its country and the widespread ignorance about it in britain , the goethe institut in london launched a campaign last year in british schools to promote itself as a fun-loving , cool nation .
" english students think the hitler theme with its smart uniforms and all is sexy , " head of the london goethe institut dr. ulrich sacker told deutsche welle .
" teachers have told me that it ’ s much easier to sell hitler than say environmental consciousness .
but what do you expect ?
every evening there ’ s at least one film on world war ii on british television . "
sacker says there ’ s just no information on german cultural and social life in britain .
" people just do not know about the other side , the more contemporary germany , the hedonistic side , the traveling spirit of the germans . "
cool britannia german style sacker now wants to bring contemporary germany to a larger british audience .
the goethe institut london has teamed up with a host of other organizations promoting german-british relations and founded a new initiative " creative capital foundation " to shape a new modern image of germany .
to start with , the foundation invited a slew of british travel journalists to the goethe institut earlier this week to expand their minds on the charms of the western german state of north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- along the river rhine .
" tourism is an important part of the process , the british usually never travel to germany , but prefer to go south , " dr. sacker explains .
" berlin was a focus last year , this time it ’ s nrw , and in 2005 it ’ ll be saxony , " sacker adds .
the foundation also organized a " british-german media bash " this week where german and british journalists , marketing and branding experts , thrashed out the role that politics , celebrities , media and advertising could play in spiking up germany ’ s dull image .
make love not war sacker opened the day-long seminar by showing two photographs of berlin ’ s famous victory column .
one from 1945 showed the monument surrounded by tanks and ruins , the other from the 1990s showed dancing revelers at the annual love parade , the world ’ s largest techno party .
" the british only know the war picture , " sacker was quoted in the berliner zeitung .
" but they should get to know the berlin of love , " he added .
sacker described the initiative - modeled along the lines of cool britannia , a campaign promoted by tony blair in the 1990s to liven up britain ’ s stuffy image from an old-fashioned nation of tweed- jacket-wearers to britpop and britart – as a " brainstorming session . "
" there were some interesting suggestions , but we ’ ve decided not to market germany as a brand .
it would only reduce the strong image that already exists about the country , " he says .
" instead we ’ re going to focus on adding interesting facets and snippets like the love parade , contemporary fashion , cuisine and karneval – that ’ s the only way to get the british interested . "
there ’ s no time frame as yet for when all the recommendations and brainstorming for spiffing up germany ’ s reputation will translate into action .
there ’ s talk of " strategy " and " high-quality projects . "
but sacker says " the important thing is that none of the end projects will have a moral finger teaching the british about germany .
instead they ’ ll all be infused with humor and irony . "

an earnest project aided by marketing and branding experts is underway in london to jazz up germany ’ s humorless and stereotypically staid image in great britain as reflected in a recent survey . it ’ s no secret that germany ’ s image in britain is in bad shape .
whether it ’ s the tabloids taking a gibe with headlines like " herr we go – bring on the krauts " or " let ’ s blitz fritz " when england was pitted against germany in the 1996 european soccer championships , weekly television documentaries on hitler and concentration camps or papers such as the independent concluding recently that books with swastikas gracing the cover are guaranteed to be bestsellers , the british are still fed cliché-heavy doses of germany ’ s past .
the only other strong connection most british citizens have to the germans are parked in their garages : german cars have a brilliant reputation and reinforce the image of their makers as being reliable , punctual and efficient .
clueless about modern germany little wonder then that a recent survey conducted by the goethe institut , the german language and cultural center , and the british council turned out such negative results .
the poll , which quizzed young people between 16 and 25 years on their picture of modern germany , drew up mostly question marks .
although 37 percent of the british displayed a positive stance towards germany , they could only come up with beer and sport as the two things they identified with the country .
another 17 percent said they didn ’ t like germany and cited its military past , far-right tendencies and the apparent lack of manners and humor of the germans as reasons .
an astonishing 64 percent couldn ’ t name a single living famous german personality -lrb- supermodel claudia schiffer was mentioned a few times -rrb- .
another larger survey conducted for the goethe institut last year concluded that more than half the british population – 52 percent – said they didn ’ t have a clue about modern day germany .
more than hitler and nazi past alarmed by the unpopularity of its country and the widespread ignorance about it in britain , the goethe institut in london launched a campaign last year in british schools to promote itself as a fun-loving , cool nation .
" english students think the hitler theme with its smart uniforms and all is sexy , " head of the london goethe institut dr. ulrich sacker told deutsche welle .
" teachers have told me that it ’ s much easier to sell hitler than say environmental consciousness .
but what do you expect ?
every evening there ’ s at least one film on world war ii on british television . "
sacker says there ’ s just no information on german cultural and social life in britain .
" people just do not know about the other side , the more contemporary germany , the hedonistic side , the traveling spirit of the germans . "
cool britannia german style sacker now wants to bring contemporary germany to a larger british audience .
the goethe institut london has teamed up with a host of other organizations promoting german-british relations and founded a new initiative " creative capital foundation " to shape a new modern image of germany .
to start with , the foundation invited a slew of british travel journalists to the goethe institut earlier this week to expand their minds on the charms of the western german state of north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- along the river rhine .
" tourism is an important part of the process , the british usually never travel to germany , but prefer to go south , " dr. sacker explains .
" berlin was a focus last year , this time it ’ s nrw , and in 2005 it ’ ll be saxony , " sacker adds .
the foundation also organized a " british-german media bash " this week where german and british journalists , marketing and branding experts , thrashed out the role that politics , celebrities , media and advertising could play in spiking up germany ’ s dull image .
make love not war sacker opened the day-long seminar by showing two photographs of berlin ’ s famous victory column .
one from 1945 showed the monument surrounded by tanks and ruins , the other from the 1990s showed dancing revelers at the annual love parade , the world ’ s largest techno party .
" the british only know the war picture , " sacker was quoted in the berliner zeitung .
" but they should get to know the berlin of love , " he added .
sacker described the initiative - modeled along the lines of cool britannia , a campaign promoted by tony blair in the 1990s to liven up britain ’ s stuffy image from an old-fashioned nation of tweed- jacket-wearers to britpop and britart – as a " brainstorming session . "
" there were some interesting suggestions , but we ’ ve decided not to market germany as a brand .
it would only reduce the strong image that already exists about the country , " he says .
" instead we ’ re going to focus on adding interesting facets and snippets like the love parade , contemporary fashion , cuisine and karneval – that ’ s the only way to get the british interested . "
there ’ s no time frame as yet for when all the recommendations and brainstorming for spiffing up germany ’ s reputation will translate into action .
there ’ s talk of " strategy " and " high-quality projects . "
but sacker says " the important thing is that none of the end projects will have a moral finger teaching the british about germany .
instead they ’ ll all be infused with humor and irony . "
so watch out britannia , germany is rolling up its sleeves and heading your way with a serious charm offensive . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more fun please , we ’ re german !

an earnest project aided by marketing and branding experts is underway in london to jazz up germany ’ s humorless and stereotypically staid image in great britain as reflected in a recent survey . it ’ s no secret that germany ’ s image in britain is in bad shape .
whether it ’ s the tabloids taking a gibe with headlines like " herr we go – bring on the krauts " or " let ’ s blitz fritz " when england was pitted against germany in the 1996 european soccer championships , weekly television documentaries on hitler and concentration camps or papers such as the independent concluding recently that books with swastikas gracing the cover are guaranteed to be bestsellers , the british are still fed cliché-heavy doses of germany ’ s past .
the only other strong connection most british citizens have to the germans are parked in their garages : german cars have a brilliant reputation and reinforce the image of their makers as being reliable , punctual and efficient .
clueless about modern germany little wonder then that a recent survey conducted by the goethe institut , the german language and cultural center , and the british council turned out such negative results .
the poll , which quizzed young people between 16 and 25 years on their picture of modern germany , drew up mostly question marks .
although 37 percent of the british displayed a positive stance towards germany , they could only come up with beer and sport as the two things they identified with the country .
another 17 percent said they didn ’ t like germany and cited its military past , far-right tendencies and the apparent lack of manners and humor of the germans as reasons .
an astonishing 64 percent couldn ’ t name a single living famous german personality -lrb- supermodel claudia schiffer was mentioned a few times -rrb- .
another larger survey conducted for the goethe institut last year concluded that more than half the british population – 52 percent – said they didn ’ t have a clue about modern day germany .
more than hitler and nazi past alarmed by the unpopularity of its country and the widespread ignorance about it in britain , the goethe institut in london launched a campaign last year in british schools to promote itself as a fun-loving , cool nation .
" english students think the hitler theme with its smart uniforms and all is sexy , " head of the london goethe institut dr. ulrich sacker told deutsche welle .
" teachers have told me that it ’ s much easier to sell hitler than say environmental consciousness .
but what do you expect ?
every evening there ’ s at least one film on world war ii on british television . "
sacker says there ’ s just no information on german cultural and social life in britain .
" people just do not know about the other side , the more contemporary germany , the hedonistic side , the traveling spirit of the germans . "
cool britannia german style sacker now wants to bring contemporary germany to a larger british audience .
the goethe institut london has teamed up with a host of other organizations promoting german-british relations and founded a new initiative " creative capital foundation " to shape a new modern image of germany .
to start with , the foundation invited a slew of british travel journalists to the goethe institut earlier this week to expand their minds on the charms of the western german state of north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- along the river rhine .
" tourism is an important part of the process , the british usually never travel to germany , but prefer to go south , " dr. sacker explains .
" berlin was a focus last year , this time it ’ s nrw , and in 2005 it ’ ll be saxony , " sacker adds .
the foundation also organized a " british-german media bash " this week where german and british journalists , marketing and branding experts , thrashed out the role that politics , celebrities , media and advertising could play in spiking up germany ’ s dull image .
make love not war sacker opened the day-long seminar by showing two photographs of berlin ’ s famous victory column .
one from 1945 showed the monument surrounded by tanks and ruins , the other from the 1990s showed dancing revelers at the annual love parade , the world ’ s largest techno party .
" the british only know the war picture , " sacker was quoted in the berliner zeitung .
" but they should get to know the berlin of love , " he added .
sacker described the initiative - modeled along the lines of cool britannia , a campaign promoted by tony blair in the 1990s to liven up britain ’ s stuffy image from an old-fashioned nation of tweed- jacket-wearers to britpop and britart – as a " brainstorming session . "
" there were some interesting suggestions , but we ’ ve decided not to market germany as a brand .
it would only reduce the strong image that already exists about the country , " he says .
" instead we ’ re going to focus on adding interesting facets and snippets like the love parade , contemporary fashion , cuisine and karneval – that ’ s the only way to get the british interested . "
there ’ s no time frame as yet for when all the recommendations and brainstorming for spiffing up germany ’ s reputation will translate into action .
there ’ s talk of " strategy " and " high-quality projects . "
but sacker says " the important thing is that none of the end projects will have a moral finger teaching the british about germany .
instead they ’ ll all be infused with humor and irony . "

"
in a highly defensive appearance before the european parliament on wednesday , italy 's prime minister alienated many with his nazi jokes .
but he did lay out a solid plan for his country 's leadership of the eu . his detractors have made no secret of their fears that italian prime minister silvio berlusconi would tarnish the office of the rotating european union presidency with his scandal-plagued leadership and questionable business dealings .
indeed , as he laid out his roadmap for italy 's six-month term at the helm of europe on wednesday , he held true to all expectations .
berlusconi presented his political platforms to the european parliament in strasbourg amid boos , jeers and protests .
one green parliamentarian compared his political ways to those of atila the hun , who ravaged europe during the 5th century .
berlusconi fired back by calling his critics " tourists " in parliamentary democracy and compared one of his most vociferous detractors to a concentration camp guard .
for weeks , martin schulz , a social democratic party member of the european parliament from germany , has served as an outspoken critic of berlusconi , pointing his finger at the italian ’ s personal legal troubles and major media investments as a serious conflict of interest .
he has n't minced words in his policy critiques , either , lambasting berlusconi for recent remarks by his reforms minister that italy 's navy should be able to fire on boats filled with illegal immigrants to keep them from landing on italian shores .
the greens , too , were hardly welcoming of the new eu president when he took to the podium wednesday as they held up signs with slogans like " everyone is equal before the law , " and " no godfather for europe . "
at one point it become too much for berlusconi .
" mr. schulz , " berlusconi quipped , " i know there is in italy a man producing a film on the nazi concentration camps .
i would like to suggest you for the role of kapo .
you 'd be perfect . "
-lrb- kapo is a reference to prisoners selected by the ss to serve as guards and complete menial jobs ; they were given favorable treatment over other prisoners and were considered traitors by many . -rrb-
later , when asked if he wanted the remark to be stricken from the record by european parliament president pat cox , berlusconi refused .
the remarks so outraged the german government that it ordered the italian ambassador in berlin to the office of chancellor gerhard schröder .
members of parliament were no less outraged , and the session was suspended afterwards .
in response to berlusconi 's attack , schulz said : " my respect for the victims of fascism will not permit me to deal with that kind of claim .
but it is very hard for me accept that a politician should be exercising the role of president of the european council if he comes out with this kind of statement when he encounters the slightest contradiction . "
berlusconi later explained that his comments were intended as an " ironic joke " and refused to apologize .
seeking to put out the wildfire on wednesday afternoon , berlusconi went a step further , but still fell short of apologizing when he told eu politicians meeting behind closed doors he " did not mean to offend the feelings of a country , feelings that have a historical motivation . "
but graham watson , the leader of the liberal democratic group in the european parliament , said berlusconi 's remarks " debase the presidency of the council and offend europe . "
a roadmap for italy 's eu presidency the bitter exchange distracted attention from the real message berlusconi came to deliver on wednesday – how italy planned to steer the eu during its term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi berlusconi -lrb- photo -rrb- said his country wanted to create a " new dynamic " in the transatlantic relationship and to push ahead with eastward expansion , calling for bulgaria and romania to be given a clear path in order to facilitate their eu membership by 2007 .
the italian prime minister also called for a " new deal " style increase in public infrastructure investment in order to stimulate economic growth – largely through rail and other public transport projects .
but he said countries should find a way to invest in infrastructure projects without resorting to stability pact-busting deficit spending .
but berlusconi ’ s major task for the next six months is to conduct negotiations after the start of an intergovernmental conference in october that will hammer out the final draft of the eu 's first constitution .
berlusconi would like to see approval of the constitution at a december summit in rome , the site where the 1957 treaty establishing the european community was signed .
highlighting the importance of europe ’ s role in the middle east , berlusconi said brussels should push along the " road map " to peace between the israelis and palestinians and contribute to the reconstruction effort in iraq in order to bring the two continents closer .
addressing recent problems with illegal immigrants entering europe from northern africa , hundreds of whom have perished in accidents on rickety boats , berlusconi called for the creation of an eu border patrol to guard its external borders as well as immigrant holding centers outside the eu .
italian officials believe that last month alone at least 3,000 illegal northern african immigrants landed on italian shores .
now , they want brussels to take action .
with strapped social systems across the union and a graying population , berlusconi also called for eu-wide measures " aimed at increasing the activity level of older workers and reducing trends toward pre-retirement " that strain federal pocketbooks .

but he did lay out a solid plan for his country 's leadership of the eu . his detractors have made no secret of their fears that italian prime minister silvio berlusconi would tarnish the office of the rotating european union presidency with his scandal-plagued leadership and questionable business dealings .
indeed , as he laid out his roadmap for italy 's six-month term at the helm of europe on wednesday , he held true to all expectations .
berlusconi presented his political platforms to the european parliament in strasbourg amid boos , jeers and protests .
one green parliamentarian compared his political ways to those of atila the hun , who ravaged europe during the 5th century .
berlusconi fired back by calling his critics " tourists " in parliamentary democracy and compared one of his most vociferous detractors to a concentration camp guard .
for weeks , martin schulz , a social democratic party member of the european parliament from germany , has served as an outspoken critic of berlusconi , pointing his finger at the italian ’ s personal legal troubles and major media investments as a serious conflict of interest .
he has n't minced words in his policy critiques , either , lambasting berlusconi for recent remarks by his reforms minister that italy 's navy should be able to fire on boats filled with illegal immigrants to keep them from landing on italian shores .
the greens , too , were hardly welcoming of the new eu president when he took to the podium wednesday as they held up signs with slogans like " everyone is equal before the law , " and " no godfather for europe . "
at one point it become too much for berlusconi .
" mr. schulz , " berlusconi quipped , " i know there is in italy a man producing a film on the nazi concentration camps .
i would like to suggest you for the role of kapo .
you 'd be perfect . "
-lrb- kapo is a reference to prisoners selected by the ss to serve as guards and complete menial jobs ; they were given favorable treatment over other prisoners and were considered traitors by many . -rrb-
later , when asked if he wanted the remark to be stricken from the record by european parliament president pat cox , berlusconi refused .
the remarks so outraged the german government that it ordered the italian ambassador in berlin to the office of chancellor gerhard schröder .
members of parliament were no less outraged , and the session was suspended afterwards .
in response to berlusconi 's attack , schulz said : " my respect for the victims of fascism will not permit me to deal with that kind of claim .
but it is very hard for me accept that a politician should be exercising the role of president of the european council if he comes out with this kind of statement when he encounters the slightest contradiction . "
berlusconi later explained that his comments were intended as an " ironic joke " and refused to apologize .
seeking to put out the wildfire on wednesday afternoon , berlusconi went a step further , but still fell short of apologizing when he told eu politicians meeting behind closed doors he " did not mean to offend the feelings of a country , feelings that have a historical motivation . "
but graham watson , the leader of the liberal democratic group in the european parliament , said berlusconi 's remarks " debase the presidency of the council and offend europe . "
a roadmap for italy 's eu presidency the bitter exchange distracted attention from the real message berlusconi came to deliver on wednesday – how italy planned to steer the eu during its term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi berlusconi -lrb- photo -rrb- said his country wanted to create a " new dynamic " in the transatlantic relationship and to push ahead with eastward expansion , calling for bulgaria and romania to be given a clear path in order to facilitate their eu membership by 2007 .
the italian prime minister also called for a " new deal " style increase in public infrastructure investment in order to stimulate economic growth – largely through rail and other public transport projects .
but he said countries should find a way to invest in infrastructure projects without resorting to stability pact-busting deficit spending .
but berlusconi ’ s major task for the next six months is to conduct negotiations after the start of an intergovernmental conference in october that will hammer out the final draft of the eu 's first constitution .
berlusconi would like to see approval of the constitution at a december summit in rome , the site where the 1957 treaty establishing the european community was signed .
highlighting the importance of europe ’ s role in the middle east , berlusconi said brussels should push along the " road map " to peace between the israelis and palestinians and contribute to the reconstruction effort in iraq in order to bring the two continents closer .
addressing recent problems with illegal immigrants entering europe from northern africa , hundreds of whom have perished in accidents on rickety boats , berlusconi called for the creation of an eu border patrol to guard its external borders as well as immigrant holding centers outside the eu .
italian officials believe that last month alone at least 3,000 illegal northern african immigrants landed on italian shores .
now , they want brussels to take action .
with strapped social systems across the union and a graying population , berlusconi also called for eu-wide measures " aimed at increasing the activity level of older workers and reducing trends toward pre-retirement " that strain federal pocketbooks .

through his work translating the bible , luther is also credited with reforming the german language , helping mold the modern usage that prevails today .
the main landmarks in a luther pilgrimage can be explored in a whistle-stop , three-day tour of lutherland .
please note : the tour has been organized by geographical rather than the chronology of luther 's life .
day one - eisleben martin luther was born on november 10 , 1483 , in eisleben , a town in the foothills of the harz mountains , in the eastern part of saxony-anhalt .
his birthplace , a simple but smart building now numbered 15 , stands in a street named after the man himself -lrb- entrance at seminarstrasse 16 -rrb- .
his father hans luther , who worked in the copper mines , and his mother margarethe , baptized baby martin in eisleben 's late gothic church of st. peter and paul - now another must-see destination on the luther tour .
the population of eisleben was then nearly 4,000 , and the town flourished thanks to the local silver and copper mining industry .
today , the population numbers some 20,000 , but people are moving away in droves .
unemployment is rife and young people have little choice but to seek work elsewhere .
but for fans of martin luther , the town is well worth a visit .
the house where the revolutionary reformer was born has been revered as a memorial site since 1693 , making it the oldest museum in germany .
to preserve luther 's memory , the town was bestowed with the epithet " lutherstadt " in 1946 .
in 1997 , the luther memorial sites were declared unesco world heritage sites .
day two - eisenach continuing in luther ’ s footsteps , travel on to eisenach , just under 150 kilometers away and less than a two-hour drive .
traditionally , the picturesque town on the northern edge of the thuringian forest was staunchly religious and was sarcastically described by luther as a " nest of priests . "
in the 15th century , one in ten of the town 's 4,000 inhabitants was involved in religion , and the town had no less than three churches and seven monasteries .
the young luther came here in 1498 to study at the prestigious latin school , now known as the martin-luther-gymnasium on the predigerplatz , or " preacher 's square . "
the " lutherhaus " -lrb- lutherplatz 8 -rrb- overlooking eisenach 's market square gives visitors a chance to explore luther 's life and work .
one highlight of the exhibition is the " lutherstuben " - two small rooms where the reformer is believed to have lived as a pupil until 1501 .
a few footsteps away from the house is the church of st. george , where luther earned extra money by singing in the choir .
a silent witness to this time is the font upon which johann sebastian bach , who was born in eisenach , was baptized in 1685 .
the reformer had fond memories of his four years in eisenach , which he later referred to as " my dear town . "
the town itself remembers and honors luther with a large memorial on the karlsplatz .
wartburg castle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wartburg castle in eisenach the next port-of-call on the luther trail literally looms over eisenach - wartburg castle , where the theologian spent his final , solitary years .
but before heading up to the imposing fortress , take a short detour to the village of steinach , nestled in a picturesque valley .
here , a large memorial has been erected recalling the detention of luther after he refused to retract publicly his teachings even when faced with a ban by the emperor of the holy roman empire at the diet of worms .
the inscription reads : " here marks the spot where dr. martin luther was taken away to wartburg castle upon the orders of friedrich the wise , elector of saxony . "
in fact , the powerful elector had been acting to protect luther .
friedrich believed that allowing the reformer to live incognito at his castle would serve to calm feverish anti-reformation activity .
the wartburg -lrb- schlossberg 2 -rrb- , perched high on a 1230-foot cliff overlooking eisenach , is one of germany 's most famous and well-preserved castles .
it was founded by duke ludwig of thuringia in 1067 .
like all other places connected with luther , it was declared a unesco world heritage site in 1997 .
the entire castle underwent a comprehensive renovation carried out by the east german government between 1952-1966 .
this included work on the room where luther lived for 300 days disguised as junker jörg .
the original floor and paneled walls have been retained and a wooden desk also dates from the lutheran era .
names and dates etched into the stone walls bear witness to the fact that the castle has been visited by christian pilgrims since the end of the 16th century .
most of luther 's time at wartburg castle was spent in quiet study , and it was here that he set about translating the new testament from its original greek into german .
with the publication of the new testament in september 1522 , luther laid the foundations for the german language as we know it today .
the style he adopted was highly descriptive and reflected common language usage , thereby making the texts accessible to all .
in the early 1530s , luther devoted himself to translating the old testament , leading to the publication of the first complete german edition of the bible in august 1534 .
as though completing the circle of his life , luther returned to eisleben , the town of his birth , in january 1546 .
on 17 february , luther complained of serious chest pain and took to his bed .
alarmed , his friends and children gathered around him .
asked by his friend , the court preacher justus jonas : " reverend father , will you stand firm in christ and the doctrine you have preached ? "
luther responded with a clearly audible : " yes " .
it was to be his dying word .
-lrb- you can visit the house where luther died at andreaskirchplatz 7 . -rrb-
two memorial services were held at st. andrew 's church -lrb- sanktandreasplatz -rrb- in eisleben .
in the afternoon of 20 february , the entourage accompanying luther 's body began its journey to wittenberg , arriving two days later .
luther 's body was interred in the castle church , in front of the pulpit .
in 1894 , the house where luther died in eisleben was declared an official memorial site .
erfurt less than 65 kilometers away , erfurt can be easily reached in just half an hour by car .
today , some 200,000 people live in the attractive capital of the state of thuringia .
it boasts one of the best-preserved medieval city centers in germany and is especially proud of its landmark krämer bridge - the longest house bridge in europe , complete with 32 residences .

-lrb- ap photo / jens meyer -rrb- - zu unserem korr - often cited as his spiritual home , martin luther moved here in 1501 , when erfurt was the sixth largest town in germany .
he lived in the town 's augustinian monastery -lrb- augustinerstrasse 10 -rrb- , now one of the most important destinations on the lutheran trail , and began his studies at the university , graduating in 1505 .
in 1507 , luther was ordained as a priest here .
today , luther 's quarters in the monastery have been reconstructed to create a sense of what daily life must have been like in this strict monastic order .
the monastery is also an architectural monument to medieval religious architecture , situated right in the old town of erfurt .
badly destroyed during world war ii , it was rebuilt in 1982 as part of celebrations marking the 500th birthday of martin luther .

2003 - marktplatz von der lutherstadt wittenberg in sachsen-anhalt some 200 kilometers away from erfurt lies wittenberg , the final destination on the luther tour .
luther spent 36 years of his life here – and the town is a treasure trove for luther pilgrims .
as a 25-year-old priest , luther was inducted as teacher at wittenberg university in 1508 .
the small town on the banks of the river elbe had just 2,000 inhabitants , and the pace of life was slow .
luther was said to have described it as town " on the edge of civilization " .
the priest lived with augustinian hermits , and today , visitors to wittenberg can explore his quarters , maintained in their original form , at the luther house , luther memorial foundation of saxony-anhalt .
the museum also houses the world 's largest collection of documents charting the history of the reformation , with more than 10,000 prints , 6,000 manuscripts , thousands of portraits of luther , 2,000 coins and medallions as well as 14,000 graphics .
the museum authorities completed a comprehensive restoration of these historic pieces , and a permanent exhibition opened in march , 2003 .
reformation begins in wittenberg it was during his years in wittenberg that luther made a name for himself as a reformer .
during a visit to rome in 1510 , the theologian was appalled by what he perceived as a corrupt catholic church .
a system to raise badly-needed funds for the rebuilding of st. peter 's , which involved papal emissaries selling indulgences , was being grossly abused .
in october 1517 , luther drew up a list of 95 theses questioning the right of the pope to forgive sins .
when he nailed the document to the door of the palace church -lrb- schlossplatz -rrb- in wittenberg , his actions caused ripples in rome , and he was summoned for an audience with pope leo x. the event heralded the beginning of the protestant reformation in germany - and ultimately , protestantism in general .
today the palace church is wittenberg 's main attraction for luther pilgrims .
luther continued to challenge the papacy .
in 1520 , he published his famous address " an den christlichen adel deutscher nation " -lrb- address to the christian nobility of the german nation -rrb- , followed by the treatise " de captivitate babylonica ecclesiae praeludium " -lrb- a prelude concerning the babylonian captivity of the church -rrb- , which also attacked the doctrinal system of the church of rome .
on december 10 of the same year , luther burned the papal bull issued against him before a gathering of doctors , students , and citizens in wittenberg , on a spot marked today by the legendary " lutheran oak " -lrb- located at the intersection of lutherstrasse and collegienstrasse -rrb- .
in 1522 , luther gave his first sermons in german at the church of st. marien -lrb- kirchplatz -rrb- in wittenberg .
the most remarkable work of art in this , the oldest building in wittenberg , is the cycle of paintings on the reformation altar by lucas cranach the elder , dedicated in 1547 .
the group on the right-hand side of the main panel refers to luther ' communion teachings and shows luther taking his place among the apostles at the last supper .
wittenberg is also home to one of germany 's most beautiful renaissance town halls , situated on the market square and flanked by a striking luther memorial .
originally planned for eisleben , the town of luther 's birth and death , it was brought to wittenberg on the orders of the prussian king friedrich wilhelm iii .
perhaps one of the most significant of the many artistic tributes to luther in germany , the memorial is the work of the berlin sculptor gottfried schadow , while the neo-gothic dais was designed by karl friedrich schinkel .
lucas cranach the elder , a friend of luther 's , was an artist whose paintings and graphics gave strong impetus to the reformation movement .
he also served as mayor here from 1537 to 1544 , as well as running the town 's apothecary - which still stands to this day - a book shop and a flourishing studio , which helped make wittenberg an important center for various artistic activities in germany .
still a controversial figure although there are over 70 million followers of the lutheran church worldwide , dr. martin luther remains a controversial figure .
initially a supporter of the jews , he became frustrated by their unwillingness to embrace his own religion , and emerged as one of the most bitter anti-semites in history .
in his writings , he described jews as poisoners , ritual murderers and parasites , preaching that they were worse than devils , that their synagogues should be burned to the ground and that they should be expelled from germany .
his detractors may argue that luther helped set the stage for the holocaust .
but for others , luthers was a spiritual genius , a man with a remarkable ability to inspire others with his passion and dedication to the christian faith . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links luther pilgrimages a guide to the official luther pilgrimage itinerary routes to luther further tips for tours of luther landmarks unesco world heritage sites unesco world heritage sites in eastern germany martin luther comprehensive information on martin luther 9801 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

day one - eisleben martin luther was born on november 10 , 1483 , in eisleben , a town in the foothills of the harz mountains , in the eastern part of saxony-anhalt .
his birthplace , a simple but smart building now numbered 15 , stands in a street named after the man himself -lrb- entrance at seminarstrasse 16 -rrb- .
his father hans luther , who worked in the copper mines , and his mother margarethe , baptized baby martin in eisleben 's late gothic church of st. peter and paul - now another must-see destination on the luther tour .
the population of eisleben was then nearly 4,000 , and the town flourished thanks to the local silver and copper mining industry .
today , the population numbers some 20,000 , but people are moving away in droves .
unemployment is rife and young people have little choice but to seek work elsewhere .
but for fans of martin luther , the town is well worth a visit .
the house where the revolutionary reformer was born has been revered as a memorial site since 1693 , making it the oldest museum in germany .
to preserve luther 's memory , the town was bestowed with the epithet " lutherstadt " in 1946 .
in 1997 , the luther memorial sites were declared unesco world heritage sites .
day two - eisenach continuing in luther ’ s footsteps , travel on to eisenach , just under 150 kilometers away and less than a two-hour drive .
traditionally , the picturesque town on the northern edge of the thuringian forest was staunchly religious and was sarcastically described by luther as a " nest of priests . "
in the 15th century , one in ten of the town 's 4,000 inhabitants was involved in religion , and the town had no less than three churches and seven monasteries .
the young luther came here in 1498 to study at the prestigious latin school , now known as the martin-luther-gymnasium on the predigerplatz , or " preacher 's square . "
the " lutherhaus " -lrb- lutherplatz 8 -rrb- overlooking eisenach 's market square gives visitors a chance to explore luther 's life and work .
one highlight of the exhibition is the " lutherstuben " - two small rooms where the reformer is believed to have lived as a pupil until 1501 .
a few footsteps away from the house is the church of st. george , where luther earned extra money by singing in the choir .
a silent witness to this time is the font upon which johann sebastian bach , who was born in eisenach , was baptized in 1685 .
the reformer had fond memories of his four years in eisenach , which he later referred to as " my dear town . "
the town itself remembers and honors luther with a large memorial on the karlsplatz .
wartburg castle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wartburg castle in eisenach the next port-of-call on the luther trail literally looms over eisenach - wartburg castle , where the theologian spent his final , solitary years .
but before heading up to the imposing fortress , take a short detour to the village of steinach , nestled in a picturesque valley .
here , a large memorial has been erected recalling the detention of luther after he refused to retract publicly his teachings even when faced with a ban by the emperor of the holy roman empire at the diet of worms .
the inscription reads : " here marks the spot where dr. martin luther was taken away to wartburg castle upon the orders of friedrich the wise , elector of saxony . "
in fact , the powerful elector had been acting to protect luther .
friedrich believed that allowing the reformer to live incognito at his castle would serve to calm feverish anti-reformation activity .
the wartburg -lrb- schlossberg 2 -rrb- , perched high on a 1230-foot cliff overlooking eisenach , is one of germany 's most famous and well-preserved castles .
it was founded by duke ludwig of thuringia in 1067 .
like all other places connected with luther , it was declared a unesco world heritage site in 1997 .
the entire castle underwent a comprehensive renovation carried out by the east german government between 1952-1966 .
this included work on the room where luther lived for 300 days disguised as junker jörg .
the original floor and paneled walls have been retained and a wooden desk also dates from the lutheran era .
names and dates etched into the stone walls bear witness to the fact that the castle has been visited by christian pilgrims since the end of the 16th century .
most of luther 's time at wartburg castle was spent in quiet study , and it was here that he set about translating the new testament from its original greek into german .
with the publication of the new testament in september 1522 , luther laid the foundations for the german language as we know it today .
the style he adopted was highly descriptive and reflected common language usage , thereby making the texts accessible to all .
in the early 1530s , luther devoted himself to translating the old testament , leading to the publication of the first complete german edition of the bible in august 1534 .
as though completing the circle of his life , luther returned to eisleben , the town of his birth , in january 1546 .
on 17 february , luther complained of serious chest pain and took to his bed .
alarmed , his friends and children gathered around him .
asked by his friend , the court preacher justus jonas : " reverend father , will you stand firm in christ and the doctrine you have preached ? "
luther responded with a clearly audible : " yes " .
it was to be his dying word .
-lrb- you can visit the house where luther died at andreaskirchplatz 7 . -rrb-
two memorial services were held at st. andrew 's church -lrb- sanktandreasplatz -rrb- in eisleben .
in the afternoon of 20 february , the entourage accompanying luther 's body began its journey to wittenberg , arriving two days later .
luther 's body was interred in the castle church , in front of the pulpit .
in 1894 , the house where luther died in eisleben was declared an official memorial site .
erfurt less than 65 kilometers away , erfurt can be easily reached in just half an hour by car .
today , some 200,000 people live in the attractive capital of the state of thuringia .
it boasts one of the best-preserved medieval city centers in germany and is especially proud of its landmark krämer bridge - the longest house bridge in europe , complete with 32 residences .

-lrb- ap photo / jens meyer -rrb- - zu unserem korr - often cited as his spiritual home , martin luther moved here in 1501 , when erfurt was the sixth largest town in germany .
he lived in the town 's augustinian monastery -lrb- augustinerstrasse 10 -rrb- , now one of the most important destinations on the lutheran trail , and began his studies at the university , graduating in 1505 .
in 1507 , luther was ordained as a priest here .
today , luther 's quarters in the monastery have been reconstructed to create a sense of what daily life must have been like in this strict monastic order .
the monastery is also an architectural monument to medieval religious architecture , situated right in the old town of erfurt .
badly destroyed during world war ii , it was rebuilt in 1982 as part of celebrations marking the 500th birthday of martin luther .

2003 - marktplatz von der lutherstadt wittenberg in sachsen-anhalt some 200 kilometers away from erfurt lies wittenberg , the final destination on the luther tour .
luther spent 36 years of his life here – and the town is a treasure trove for luther pilgrims .
as a 25-year-old priest , luther was inducted as teacher at wittenberg university in 1508 .
the small town on the banks of the river elbe had just 2,000 inhabitants , and the pace of life was slow .
luther was said to have described it as town " on the edge of civilization " .
the priest lived with augustinian hermits , and today , visitors to wittenberg can explore his quarters , maintained in their original form , at the luther house , luther memorial foundation of saxony-anhalt .
the museum also houses the world 's largest collection of documents charting the history of the reformation , with more than 10,000 prints , 6,000 manuscripts , thousands of portraits of luther , 2,000 coins and medallions as well as 14,000 graphics .
the museum authorities completed a comprehensive restoration of these historic pieces , and a permanent exhibition opened in march , 2003 .
reformation begins in wittenberg it was during his years in wittenberg that luther made a name for himself as a reformer .
during a visit to rome in 1510 , the theologian was appalled by what he perceived as a corrupt catholic church .
a system to raise badly-needed funds for the rebuilding of st. peter 's , which involved papal emissaries selling indulgences , was being grossly abused .
in october 1517 , luther drew up a list of 95 theses questioning the right of the pope to forgive sins .
when he nailed the document to the door of the palace church -lrb- schlossplatz -rrb- in wittenberg , his actions caused ripples in rome , and he was summoned for an audience with pope leo x. the event heralded the beginning of the protestant reformation in germany - and ultimately , protestantism in general .
today the palace church is wittenberg 's main attraction for luther pilgrims .
luther continued to challenge the papacy .
in 1520 , he published his famous address " an den christlichen adel deutscher nation " -lrb- address to the christian nobility of the german nation -rrb- , followed by the treatise " de captivitate babylonica ecclesiae praeludium " -lrb- a prelude concerning the babylonian captivity of the church -rrb- , which also attacked the doctrinal system of the church of rome .
on december 10 of the same year , luther burned the papal bull issued against him before a gathering of doctors , students , and citizens in wittenberg , on a spot marked today by the legendary " lutheran oak " -lrb- located at the intersection of lutherstrasse and collegienstrasse -rrb- .
in 1522 , luther gave his first sermons in german at the church of st. marien -lrb- kirchplatz -rrb- in wittenberg .
the most remarkable work of art in this , the oldest building in wittenberg , is the cycle of paintings on the reformation altar by lucas cranach the elder , dedicated in 1547 .
the group on the right-hand side of the main panel refers to luther ' communion teachings and shows luther taking his place among the apostles at the last supper .
wittenberg is also home to one of germany 's most beautiful renaissance town halls , situated on the market square and flanked by a striking luther memorial .
originally planned for eisleben , the town of luther 's birth and death , it was brought to wittenberg on the orders of the prussian king friedrich wilhelm iii .
perhaps one of the most significant of the many artistic tributes to luther in germany , the memorial is the work of the berlin sculptor gottfried schadow , while the neo-gothic dais was designed by karl friedrich schinkel .
lucas cranach the elder , a friend of luther 's , was an artist whose paintings and graphics gave strong impetus to the reformation movement .
he also served as mayor here from 1537 to 1544 , as well as running the town 's apothecary - which still stands to this day - a book shop and a flourishing studio , which helped make wittenberg an important center for various artistic activities in germany .
still a controversial figure although there are over 70 million followers of the lutheran church worldwide , dr. martin luther remains a controversial figure .
initially a supporter of the jews , he became frustrated by their unwillingness to embrace his own religion , and emerged as one of the most bitter anti-semites in history .
in his writings , he described jews as poisoners , ritual murderers and parasites , preaching that they were worse than devils , that their synagogues should be burned to the ground and that they should be expelled from germany .
his detractors may argue that luther helped set the stage for the holocaust .
but for others , luthers was a spiritual genius , a man with a remarkable ability to inspire others with his passion and dedication to the christian faith . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links luther pilgrimages a guide to the official luther pilgrimage itinerary routes to luther further tips for tours of luther landmarks unesco world heritage sites unesco world heritage sites in eastern germany martin luther comprehensive information on martin luther 9801 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

although 37 percent of the british displayed a positive stance towards germany , they could only come up with beer and sport as the two things they identified with the country .
another 17 percent said they didn ’ t like germany and cited its military past , far-right tendencies and the apparent lack of manners and humor of the germans as reasons .
an astonishing 64 percent couldn ’ t name a single living famous german personality -lrb- supermodel claudia schiffer was mentioned a few times -rrb- .

an earnest project aided by marketing and branding experts is underway in london to jazz up germany ’ s humorless and stereotypically staid image in great britain as reflected in a recent survey . it ’ s no secret that germany ’ s image in britain is in bad shape .
whether it ’ s the tabloids taking a gibe with headlines like " herr we go – bring on the krauts " or " let ’ s blitz fritz " when england was pitted against germany in the 1996 european soccer championships , weekly television documentaries on hitler and concentration camps or papers such as the independent concluding recently that books with swastikas gracing the cover are guaranteed to be bestsellers , the british are still fed cliché-heavy doses of germany ’ s past .
the only other strong connection most british citizens have to the germans are parked in their garages : german cars have a brilliant reputation and reinforce the image of their makers as being reliable , punctual and efficient .

through his work translating the bible , luther is also credited with reforming the german language , helping mold the modern usage that prevails today .
the main landmarks in a luther pilgrimage can be explored in a whistle-stop , three-day tour of lutherland .
please note : the tour has been organized by geographical rather than the chronology of luther 's life .
day one - eisleben martin luther was born on november 10 , 1483 , in eisleben , a town in the foothills of the harz mountains , in the eastern part of saxony-anhalt .
his birthplace , a simple but smart building now numbered 15 , stands in a street named after the man himself -lrb- entrance at seminarstrasse 16 -rrb- .
his father hans luther , who worked in the copper mines , and his mother margarethe , baptized baby martin in eisleben 's late gothic church of st. peter and paul - now another must-see destination on the luther tour .
the population of eisleben was then nearly 4,000 , and the town flourished thanks to the local silver and copper mining industry .
today , the population numbers some 20,000 , but people are moving away in droves .
unemployment is rife and young people have little choice but to seek work elsewhere .
but for fans of martin luther , the town is well worth a visit .
the house where the revolutionary reformer was born has been revered as a memorial site since 1693 , making it the oldest museum in germany .
to preserve luther 's memory , the town was bestowed with the epithet " lutherstadt " in 1946 .
in 1997 , the luther memorial sites were declared unesco world heritage sites .
day two - eisenach continuing in luther ’ s footsteps , travel on to eisenach , just under 150 kilometers away and less than a two-hour drive .
traditionally , the picturesque town on the northern edge of the thuringian forest was staunchly religious and was sarcastically described by luther as a " nest of priests . "
in the 15th century , one in ten of the town 's 4,000 inhabitants was involved in religion , and the town had no less than three churches and seven monasteries .
the young luther came here in 1498 to study at the prestigious latin school , now known as the martin-luther-gymnasium on the predigerplatz , or " preacher 's square . "
the " lutherhaus " -lrb- lutherplatz 8 -rrb- overlooking eisenach 's market square gives visitors a chance to explore luther 's life and work .
one highlight of the exhibition is the " lutherstuben " - two small rooms where the reformer is believed to have lived as a pupil until 1501 .
a few footsteps away from the house is the church of st. george , where luther earned extra money by singing in the choir .
a silent witness to this time is the font upon which johann sebastian bach , who was born in eisenach , was baptized in 1685 .
the reformer had fond memories of his four years in eisenach , which he later referred to as " my dear town . "
the town itself remembers and honors luther with a large memorial on the karlsplatz .
wartburg castle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wartburg castle in eisenach the next port-of-call on the luther trail literally looms over eisenach - wartburg castle , where the theologian spent his final , solitary years .
but before heading up to the imposing fortress , take a short detour to the village of steinach , nestled in a picturesque valley .
here , a large memorial has been erected recalling the detention of luther after he refused to retract publicly his teachings even when faced with a ban by the emperor of the holy roman empire at the diet of worms .
the inscription reads : " here marks the spot where dr. martin luther was taken away to wartburg castle upon the orders of friedrich the wise , elector of saxony . "
in fact , the powerful elector had been acting to protect luther .
friedrich believed that allowing the reformer to live incognito at his castle would serve to calm feverish anti-reformation activity .
the wartburg -lrb- schlossberg 2 -rrb- , perched high on a 1230-foot cliff overlooking eisenach , is one of germany 's most famous and well-preserved castles .
it was founded by duke ludwig of thuringia in 1067 .
like all other places connected with luther , it was declared a unesco world heritage site in 1997 .
the entire castle underwent a comprehensive renovation carried out by the east german government between 1952-1966 .
this included work on the room where luther lived for 300 days disguised as junker jörg .
the original floor and paneled walls have been retained and a wooden desk also dates from the lutheran era .
names and dates etched into the stone walls bear witness to the fact that the castle has been visited by christian pilgrims since the end of the 16th century .
most of luther 's time at wartburg castle was spent in quiet study , and it was here that he set about translating the new testament from its original greek into german .
with the publication of the new testament in september 1522 , luther laid the foundations for the german language as we know it today .
the style he adopted was highly descriptive and reflected common language usage , thereby making the texts accessible to all .
in the early 1530s , luther devoted himself to translating the old testament , leading to the publication of the first complete german edition of the bible in august 1534 .
as though completing the circle of his life , luther returned to eisleben , the town of his birth , in january 1546 .
on 17 february , luther complained of serious chest pain and took to his bed .
alarmed , his friends and children gathered around him .
asked by his friend , the court preacher justus jonas : " reverend father , will you stand firm in christ and the doctrine you have preached ? "
luther responded with a clearly audible : " yes " .
it was to be his dying word .
-lrb- you can visit the house where luther died at andreaskirchplatz 7 . -rrb-
two memorial services were held at st. andrew 's church -lrb- sanktandreasplatz -rrb- in eisleben .
in the afternoon of 20 february , the entourage accompanying luther 's body began its journey to wittenberg , arriving two days later .
luther 's body was interred in the castle church , in front of the pulpit .
in 1894 , the house where luther died in eisleben was declared an official memorial site .
erfurt less than 65 kilometers away , erfurt can be easily reached in just half an hour by car .
today , some 200,000 people live in the attractive capital of the state of thuringia .
it boasts one of the best-preserved medieval city centers in germany and is especially proud of its landmark krämer bridge - the longest house bridge in europe , complete with 32 residences .

-lrb- ap photo / jens meyer -rrb- - zu unserem korr - often cited as his spiritual home , martin luther moved here in 1501 , when erfurt was the sixth largest town in germany .
he lived in the town 's augustinian monastery -lrb- augustinerstrasse 10 -rrb- , now one of the most important destinations on the lutheran trail , and began his studies at the university , graduating in 1505 .
in 1507 , luther was ordained as a priest here .
today , luther 's quarters in the monastery have been reconstructed to create a sense of what daily life must have been like in this strict monastic order .
the monastery is also an architectural monument to medieval religious architecture , situated right in the old town of erfurt .
badly destroyed during world war ii , it was rebuilt in 1982 as part of celebrations marking the 500th birthday of martin luther .

2003 - marktplatz von der lutherstadt wittenberg in sachsen-anhalt some 200 kilometers away from erfurt lies wittenberg , the final destination on the luther tour .
luther spent 36 years of his life here – and the town is a treasure trove for luther pilgrims .
as a 25-year-old priest , luther was inducted as teacher at wittenberg university in 1508 .
the small town on the banks of the river elbe had just 2,000 inhabitants , and the pace of life was slow .
luther was said to have described it as town " on the edge of civilization " .
the priest lived with augustinian hermits , and today , visitors to wittenberg can explore his quarters , maintained in their original form , at the luther house , luther memorial foundation of saxony-anhalt .
the museum also houses the world 's largest collection of documents charting the history of the reformation , with more than 10,000 prints , 6,000 manuscripts , thousands of portraits of luther , 2,000 coins and medallions as well as 14,000 graphics .
the museum authorities completed a comprehensive restoration of these historic pieces , and a permanent exhibition opened in march , 2003 .
reformation begins in wittenberg it was during his years in wittenberg that luther made a name for himself as a reformer .
during a visit to rome in 1510 , the theologian was appalled by what he perceived as a corrupt catholic church .
a system to raise badly-needed funds for the rebuilding of st. peter 's , which involved papal emissaries selling indulgences , was being grossly abused .
in october 1517 , luther drew up a list of 95 theses questioning the right of the pope to forgive sins .
when he nailed the document to the door of the palace church -lrb- schlossplatz -rrb- in wittenberg , his actions caused ripples in rome , and he was summoned for an audience with pope leo x. the event heralded the beginning of the protestant reformation in germany - and ultimately , protestantism in general .
today the palace church is wittenberg 's main attraction for luther pilgrims .
luther continued to challenge the papacy .
in 1520 , he published his famous address " an den christlichen adel deutscher nation " -lrb- address to the christian nobility of the german nation -rrb- , followed by the treatise " de captivitate babylonica ecclesiae praeludium " -lrb- a prelude concerning the babylonian captivity of the church -rrb- , which also attacked the doctrinal system of the church of rome .
on december 10 of the same year , luther burned the papal bull issued against him before a gathering of doctors , students , and citizens in wittenberg , on a spot marked today by the legendary " lutheran oak " -lrb- located at the intersection of lutherstrasse and collegienstrasse -rrb- .
in 1522 , luther gave his first sermons in german at the church of st. marien -lrb- kirchplatz -rrb- in wittenberg .
the most remarkable work of art in this , the oldest building in wittenberg , is the cycle of paintings on the reformation altar by lucas cranach the elder , dedicated in 1547 .
the group on the right-hand side of the main panel refers to luther ' communion teachings and shows luther taking his place among the apostles at the last supper .
wittenberg is also home to one of germany 's most beautiful renaissance town halls , situated on the market square and flanked by a striking luther memorial .
originally planned for eisleben , the town of luther 's birth and death , it was brought to wittenberg on the orders of the prussian king friedrich wilhelm iii .
perhaps one of the most significant of the many artistic tributes to luther in germany , the memorial is the work of the berlin sculptor gottfried schadow , while the neo-gothic dais was designed by karl friedrich schinkel .
lucas cranach the elder , a friend of luther 's , was an artist whose paintings and graphics gave strong impetus to the reformation movement .
he also served as mayor here from 1537 to 1544 , as well as running the town 's apothecary - which still stands to this day - a book shop and a flourishing studio , which helped make wittenberg an important center for various artistic activities in germany .
still a controversial figure although there are over 70 million followers of the lutheran church worldwide , dr. martin luther remains a controversial figure .
initially a supporter of the jews , he became frustrated by their unwillingness to embrace his own religion , and emerged as one of the most bitter anti-semites in history .
in his writings , he described jews as poisoners , ritual murderers and parasites , preaching that they were worse than devils , that their synagogues should be burned to the ground and that they should be expelled from germany .
his detractors may argue that luther helped set the stage for the holocaust .
but for others , luthers was a spiritual genius , a man with a remarkable ability to inspire others with his passion and dedication to the christian faith . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links luther pilgrimages a guide to the official luther pilgrimage itinerary routes to luther further tips for tours of luther landmarks unesco world heritage sites unesco world heritage sites in eastern germany martin luther comprehensive information on martin luther 9797 dw-tv europe live journal - news with business we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

his birthplace , a simple but smart building now numbered 15 , stands in a street named after the man himself -lrb- entrance at seminarstrasse 16 -rrb- .
his father hans luther , who worked in the copper mines , and his mother margarethe , baptized baby martin in eisleben 's late gothic church of st. peter and paul - now another must-see destination on the luther tour .
the population of eisleben was then nearly 4,000 , and the town flourished thanks to the local silver and copper mining industry .
today , the population numbers some 20,000 , but people are moving away in droves .
unemployment is rife and young people have little choice but to seek work elsewhere .
but for fans of martin luther , the town is well worth a visit .
the house where the revolutionary reformer was born has been revered as a memorial site since 1693 , making it the oldest museum in germany .
to preserve luther 's memory , the town was bestowed with the epithet " lutherstadt " in 1946 .
in 1997 , the luther memorial sites were declared unesco world heritage sites .
day two - eisenach continuing in luther ’ s footsteps , travel on to eisenach , just under 150 kilometers away and less than a two-hour drive .
traditionally , the picturesque town on the northern edge of the thuringian forest was staunchly religious and was sarcastically described by luther as a " nest of priests . "
in the 15th century , one in ten of the town 's 4,000 inhabitants was involved in religion , and the town had no less than three churches and seven monasteries .
the young luther came here in 1498 to study at the prestigious latin school , now known as the martin-luther-gymnasium on the predigerplatz , or " preacher 's square . "
the " lutherhaus " -lrb- lutherplatz 8 -rrb- overlooking eisenach 's market square gives visitors a chance to explore luther 's life and work .
one highlight of the exhibition is the " lutherstuben " - two small rooms where the reformer is believed to have lived as a pupil until 1501 .
a few footsteps away from the house is the church of st. george , where luther earned extra money by singing in the choir .
a silent witness to this time is the font upon which johann sebastian bach , who was born in eisenach , was baptized in 1685 .
the reformer had fond memories of his four years in eisenach , which he later referred to as " my dear town . "
the town itself remembers and honors luther with a large memorial on the karlsplatz .
wartburg castle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wartburg castle in eisenach the next port-of-call on the luther trail literally looms over eisenach - wartburg castle , where the theologian spent his final , solitary years .
but before heading up to the imposing fortress , take a short detour to the village of steinach , nestled in a picturesque valley .
here , a large memorial has been erected recalling the detention of luther after he refused to retract publicly his teachings even when faced with a ban by the emperor of the holy roman empire at the diet of worms .
the inscription reads : " here marks the spot where dr. martin luther was taken away to wartburg castle upon the orders of friedrich the wise , elector of saxony . "
in fact , the powerful elector had been acting to protect luther .
friedrich believed that allowing the reformer to live incognito at his castle would serve to calm feverish anti-reformation activity .
the wartburg -lrb- schlossberg 2 -rrb- , perched high on a 1230-foot cliff overlooking eisenach , is one of germany 's most famous and well-preserved castles .
it was founded by duke ludwig of thuringia in 1067 .
like all other places connected with luther , it was declared a unesco world heritage site in 1997 .
the entire castle underwent a comprehensive renovation carried out by the east german government between 1952-1966 .
this included work on the room where luther lived for 300 days disguised as junker jörg .
the original floor and paneled walls have been retained and a wooden desk also dates from the lutheran era .
names and dates etched into the stone walls bear witness to the fact that the castle has been visited by christian pilgrims since the end of the 16th century .
most of luther 's time at wartburg castle was spent in quiet study , and it was here that he set about translating the new testament from its original greek into german .
with the publication of the new testament in september 1522 , luther laid the foundations for the german language as we know it today .
the style he adopted was highly descriptive and reflected common language usage , thereby making the texts accessible to all .
in the early 1530s , luther devoted himself to translating the old testament , leading to the publication of the first complete german edition of the bible in august 1534 .
as though completing the circle of his life , luther returned to eisleben , the town of his birth , in january 1546 .
on 17 february , luther complained of serious chest pain and took to his bed .
alarmed , his friends and children gathered around him .
asked by his friend , the court preacher justus jonas : " reverend father , will you stand firm in christ and the doctrine you have preached ? "
luther responded with a clearly audible : " yes " .
it was to be his dying word .
-lrb- you can visit the house where luther died at andreaskirchplatz 7 . -rrb-
two memorial services were held at st. andrew 's church -lrb- sanktandreasplatz -rrb- in eisleben .
in the afternoon of 20 february , the entourage accompanying luther 's body began its journey to wittenberg , arriving two days later .
luther 's body was interred in the castle church , in front of the pulpit .
in 1894 , the house where luther died in eisleben was declared an official memorial site .
erfurt less than 65 kilometers away , erfurt can be easily reached in just half an hour by car .
today , some 200,000 people live in the attractive capital of the state of thuringia .
it boasts one of the best-preserved medieval city centers in germany and is especially proud of its landmark krämer bridge - the longest house bridge in europe , complete with 32 residences .

-lrb- ap photo / jens meyer -rrb- - zu unserem korr - often cited as his spiritual home , martin luther moved here in 1501 , when erfurt was the sixth largest town in germany .
he lived in the town 's augustinian monastery -lrb- augustinerstrasse 10 -rrb- , now one of the most important destinations on the lutheran trail , and began his studies at the university , graduating in 1505 .
in 1507 , luther was ordained as a priest here .
today , luther 's quarters in the monastery have been reconstructed to create a sense of what daily life must have been like in this strict monastic order .
the monastery is also an architectural monument to medieval religious architecture , situated right in the old town of erfurt .
badly destroyed during world war ii , it was rebuilt in 1982 as part of celebrations marking the 500th birthday of martin luther .

2 .
2003 - marktplatz von der lutherstadt wittenberg in sachsen-anhalt some 200 kilometers away from erfurt lies wittenberg , the final destination on the luther tour .
luther spent 36 years of his life here – and the town is a treasure trove for luther pilgrims .
as a 25-year-old priest , luther was inducted as teacher at wittenberg university in 1508 .
the small town on the banks of the river elbe had just 2,000 inhabitants , and the pace of life was slow .
luther was said to have described it as town " on the edge of civilization " .
the priest lived with augustinian hermits , and today , visitors to wittenberg can explore his quarters , maintained in their original form , at the luther house , luther memorial foundation of saxony-anhalt .
the museum also houses the world 's largest collection of documents charting the history of the reformation , with more than 10,000 prints , 6,000 manuscripts , thousands of portraits of luther , 2,000 coins and medallions as well as 14,000 graphics .
the museum authorities completed a comprehensive restoration of these historic pieces , and a permanent exhibition opened in march , 2003 .
reformation begins in wittenberg it was during his years in wittenberg that luther made a name for himself as a reformer .
during a visit to rome in 1510 , the theologian was appalled by what he perceived as a corrupt catholic church .
a system to raise badly-needed funds for the rebuilding of st. peter 's , which involved papal emissaries selling indulgences , was being grossly abused .
in october 1517 , luther drew up a list of 95 theses questioning the right of the pope to forgive sins .
when he nailed the document to the door of the palace church -lrb- schlossplatz -rrb- in wittenberg , his actions caused ripples in rome , and he was summoned for an audience with pope leo x. the event heralded the beginning of the protestant reformation in germany - and ultimately , protestantism in general .
today the palace church is wittenberg 's main attraction for luther pilgrims .
luther continued to challenge the papacy .
in 1520 , he published his famous address " an den christlichen adel deutscher nation " -lrb- address to the christian nobility of the german nation -rrb- , followed by the treatise " de captivitate babylonica ecclesiae praeludium " -lrb- a prelude concerning the babylonian captivity of the church -rrb- , which also attacked the doctrinal system of the church of rome .
on december 10 of the same year , luther burned the papal bull issued against him before a gathering of doctors , students , and citizens in wittenberg , on a spot marked today by the legendary " lutheran oak " -lrb- located at the intersection of lutherstrasse and collegienstrasse -rrb- .
in 1522 , luther gave his first sermons in german at the church of st. marien -lrb- kirchplatz -rrb- in wittenberg .
the most remarkable work of art in this , the oldest building in wittenberg , is the cycle of paintings on the reformation altar by lucas cranach the elder , dedicated in 1547 .
the group on the right-hand side of the main panel refers to luther ' communion teachings and shows luther taking his place among the apostles at the last supper .
wittenberg is also home to one of germany 's most beautiful renaissance town halls , situated on the market square and flanked by a striking luther memorial .
originally planned for eisleben , the town of luther 's birth and death , it was brought to wittenberg on the orders of the prussian king friedrich wilhelm iii .
perhaps one of the most significant of the many artistic tributes to luther in germany , the memorial is the work of the berlin sculptor gottfried schadow , while the neo-gothic dais was designed by karl friedrich schinkel .
lucas cranach the elder , a friend of luther 's , was an artist whose paintings and graphics gave strong impetus to the reformation movement .
he also served as mayor here from 1537 to 1544 , as well as running the town 's apothecary - which still stands to this day - a book shop and a flourishing studio , which helped make wittenberg an important center for various artistic activities in germany .
still a controversial figure although there are over 70 million followers of the lutheran church worldwide , dr. martin luther remains a controversial figure .
initially a supporter of the jews , he became frustrated by their unwillingness to embrace his own religion , and emerged as one of the most bitter anti-semites in history .
in his writings , he described jews as poisoners , ritual murderers and parasites , preaching that they were worse than devils , that their synagogues should be burned to the ground and that they should be expelled from germany .
his detractors may argue that luther helped set the stage for the holocaust .
but for others , luthers was a spiritual genius , a man with a remarkable ability to inspire others with his passion and dedication to the christian faith . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links luther pilgrimages a guide to the official luther pilgrimage itinerary routes to luther further tips for tours of luther landmarks unesco world heritage sites unesco world heritage sites in eastern germany martin luther comprehensive information on martin luther 9797 dw-tv europe live people and politics we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

through his work translating the bible , luther is also credited with reforming the german language , helping mold the modern usage that prevails today .
the main landmarks in a luther pilgrimage can be explored in a whistle-stop , three-day tour of lutherland .

"
in a highly defensive appearance before the european parliament on wednesday , italy 's prime minister alienated many with his nazi jokes .
but he did lay out a solid plan for his country 's leadership of the eu . his detractors have made no secret of their fears that italian prime minister silvio berlusconi would tarnish the office of the rotating european union presidency with his scandal-plagued leadership and questionable business dealings .
indeed , as he laid out his roadmap for italy 's six-month term at the helm of europe on wednesday , he held true to all expectations .
berlusconi presented his political platforms to the european parliament in strasbourg amid boos , jeers and protests .
one green parliamentarian compared his political ways to those of atila the hun , who ravaged europe during the 5th century .
berlusconi fired back by calling his critics " tourists " in parliamentary democracy and compared one of his most vociferous detractors to a concentration camp guard .
for weeks , martin schulz , a social democratic party member of the european parliament from germany , has served as an outspoken critic of berlusconi , pointing his finger at the italian ’ s personal legal troubles and major media investments as a serious conflict of interest .
he has n't minced words in his policy critiques , either , lambasting berlusconi for recent remarks by his reforms minister that italy 's navy should be able to fire on boats filled with illegal immigrants to keep them from landing on italian shores .
the greens , too , were hardly welcoming of the new eu president when he took to the podium wednesday as they held up signs with slogans like " everyone is equal before the law , " and " no godfather for europe . "

" mr. schulz , " berlusconi quipped , " i know there is in italy a man producing a film on the nazi concentration camps .
i would like to suggest you for the role of kapo .

later , when asked if he wanted the remark to be stricken from the record by european parliament president pat cox , berlusconi refused .
the remarks so outraged the german government that it ordered the italian ambassador in berlin to the office of chancellor gerhard schröder .
members of parliament were no less outraged , and the session was suspended afterwards .
in response to berlusconi 's attack , schulz said : " my respect for the victims of fascism will not permit me to deal with that kind of claim .
but it is very hard for me accept that a politician should be exercising the role of president of the european council if he comes out with this kind of statement when he encounters the slightest contradiction . "
berlusconi later explained that his comments were intended as an " ironic joke " and refused to apologize .
seeking to put out the wildfire on wednesday afternoon , berlusconi went a step further , but still fell short of apologizing when he told eu politicians meeting behind closed doors he " did not mean to offend the feelings of a country , feelings that have a historical motivation . "

the remarks so outraged the german government that it ordered the italian ambassador in berlin to the office of chancellor gerhard schröder .
members of parliament were no less outraged , and the session was suspended afterwards .
in response to berlusconi 's attack , schulz said : " my respect for the victims of fascism will not permit me to deal with that kind of claim .
but it is very hard for me accept that a politician should be exercising the role of president of the european council if he comes out with this kind of statement when he encounters the slightest contradiction . "
berlusconi later explained that his comments were intended as an " ironic joke " and refused to apologize .
seeking to put out the wildfire on wednesday afternoon , berlusconi went a step further , but still fell short of apologizing when he told eu politicians meeting behind closed doors he " did not mean to offend the feelings of a country , feelings that have a historical motivation . "
but graham watson , the leader of the liberal democratic group in the european parliament , said berlusconi 's remarks " debase the presidency of the council and offend europe . "
a roadmap for italy 's eu presidency the bitter exchange distracted attention from the real message berlusconi came to deliver on wednesday – how italy planned to steer the eu during its term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi berlusconi -lrb- photo -rrb- said his country wanted to create a " new dynamic " in the transatlantic relationship and to push ahead with eastward expansion , calling for bulgaria and romania to be given a clear path in order to facilitate their eu membership by 2007 .
the italian prime minister also called for a " new deal " style increase in public infrastructure investment in order to stimulate economic growth – largely through rail and other public transport projects .
but he said countries should find a way to invest in infrastructure projects without resorting to stability pact-busting deficit spending .
but berlusconi ’ s major task for the next six months is to conduct negotiations after the start of an intergovernmental conference in october that will hammer out the final draft of the eu 's first constitution .
berlusconi would like to see approval of the constitution at a december summit in rome , the site where the 1957 treaty establishing the european community was signed .
highlighting the importance of europe ’ s role in the middle east , berlusconi said brussels should push along the " road map " to peace between the israelis and palestinians and contribute to the reconstruction effort in iraq in order to bring the two continents closer .
addressing recent problems with illegal immigrants entering europe from northern africa , hundreds of whom have perished in accidents on rickety boats , berlusconi called for the creation of an eu border patrol to guard its external borders as well as immigrant holding centers outside the eu .
italian officials believe that last month alone at least 3,000 illegal northern african immigrants landed on italian shores .
now , they want brussels to take action .
with strapped social systems across the union and a graying population , berlusconi also called for eu-wide measures " aimed at increasing the activity level of older workers and reducing trends toward pre-retirement " that strain federal pocketbooks .
among those measures would be a common eu approach to retirement systems . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the eu presidency according to silvio his party changed the law to to make him immune from prosecution and his criminal case was dropped .

through his work translating the bible , luther is also credited with reforming the german language , helping mold the modern usage that prevails today .
the main landmarks in a luther pilgrimage can be explored in a whistle-stop , three-day tour of lutherland .
please note : the tour has been organized by geographical rather than the chronology of luther 's life .
day one - eisleben martin luther was born on november 10 , 1483 , in eisleben , a town in the foothills of the harz mountains , in the eastern part of saxony-anhalt .
his birthplace , a simple but smart building now numbered 15 , stands in a street named after the man himself -lrb- entrance at seminarstrasse 16 -rrb- .
his father hans luther , who worked in the copper mines , and his mother margarethe , baptized baby martin in eisleben 's late gothic church of st. peter and paul - now another must-see destination on the luther tour .
the population of eisleben was then nearly 4,000 , and the town flourished thanks to the local silver and copper mining industry .
today , the population numbers some 20,000 , but people are moving away in droves .
unemployment is rife and young people have little choice but to seek work elsewhere .
but for fans of martin luther , the town is well worth a visit .
the house where the revolutionary reformer was born has been revered as a memorial site since 1693 , making it the oldest museum in germany .
to preserve luther 's memory , the town was bestowed with the epithet " lutherstadt " in 1946 .
in 1997 , the luther memorial sites were declared unesco world heritage sites .
day two - eisenach continuing in luther ’ s footsteps , travel on to eisenach , just under 150 kilometers away and less than a two-hour drive .
traditionally , the picturesque town on the northern edge of the thuringian forest was staunchly religious and was sarcastically described by luther as a " nest of priests . "
in the 15th century , one in ten of the town 's 4,000 inhabitants was involved in religion , and the town had no less than three churches and seven monasteries .
the young luther came here in 1498 to study at the prestigious latin school , now known as the martin-luther-gymnasium on the predigerplatz , or " preacher 's square . "
the " lutherhaus " -lrb- lutherplatz 8 -rrb- overlooking eisenach 's market square gives visitors a chance to explore luther 's life and work .
one highlight of the exhibition is the " lutherstuben " - two small rooms where the reformer is believed to have lived as a pupil until 1501 .
a few footsteps away from the house is the church of st. george , where luther earned extra money by singing in the choir .
a silent witness to this time is the font upon which johann sebastian bach , who was born in eisenach , was baptized in 1685 .
the reformer had fond memories of his four years in eisenach , which he later referred to as " my dear town . "
the town itself remembers and honors luther with a large memorial on the karlsplatz .
wartburg castle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wartburg castle in eisenach the next port-of-call on the luther trail literally looms over eisenach - wartburg castle , where the theologian spent his final , solitary years .
but before heading up to the imposing fortress , take a short detour to the village of steinach , nestled in a picturesque valley .
here , a large memorial has been erected recalling the detention of luther after he refused to retract publicly his teachings even when faced with a ban by the emperor of the holy roman empire at the diet of worms .
the inscription reads : " here marks the spot where dr. martin luther was taken away to wartburg castle upon the orders of friedrich the wise , elector of saxony . "
in fact , the powerful elector had been acting to protect luther .
friedrich believed that allowing the reformer to live incognito at his castle would serve to calm feverish anti-reformation activity .
the wartburg -lrb- schlossberg 2 -rrb- , perched high on a 1230-foot cliff overlooking eisenach , is one of germany 's most famous and well-preserved castles .
it was founded by duke ludwig of thuringia in 1067 .
like all other places connected with luther , it was declared a unesco world heritage site in 1997 .
the entire castle underwent a comprehensive renovation carried out by the east german government between 1952-1966 .
this included work on the room where luther lived for 300 days disguised as junker jörg .
the original floor and paneled walls have been retained and a wooden desk also dates from the lutheran era .
names and dates etched into the stone walls bear witness to the fact that the castle has been visited by christian pilgrims since the end of the 16th century .
most of luther 's time at wartburg castle was spent in quiet study , and it was here that he set about translating the new testament from its original greek into german .
with the publication of the new testament in september 1522 , luther laid the foundations for the german language as we know it today .
the style he adopted was highly descriptive and reflected common language usage , thereby making the texts accessible to all .
in the early 1530s , luther devoted himself to translating the old testament , leading to the publication of the first complete german edition of the bible in august 1534 .
as though completing the circle of his life , luther returned to eisleben , the town of his birth , in january 1546 .
on 17 february , luther complained of serious chest pain and took to his bed .
alarmed , his friends and children gathered around him .
asked by his friend , the court preacher justus jonas : " reverend father , will you stand firm in christ and the doctrine you have preached ? "
luther responded with a clearly audible : " yes " .
it was to be his dying word .

two memorial services were held at st. andrew 's church -lrb- sanktandreasplatz -rrb- in eisleben .
in the afternoon of 20 february , the entourage accompanying luther 's body began its journey to wittenberg , arriving two days later .
luther 's body was interred in the castle church , in front of the pulpit .
in 1894 , the house where luther died in eisleben was declared an official memorial site .
erfurt less than 65 kilometers away , erfurt can be easily reached in just half an hour by car .
today , some 200,000 people live in the attractive capital of the state of thuringia .
it boasts one of the best-preserved medieval city centers in germany and is especially proud of its landmark krämer bridge - the longest house bridge in europe , complete with 32 residences .

-lrb- ap photo / jens meyer -rrb- - zu unserem korr - often cited as his spiritual home , martin luther moved here in 1501 , when erfurt was the sixth largest town in germany .
he lived in the town 's augustinian monastery -lrb- augustinerstrasse 10 -rrb- , now one of the most important destinations on the lutheran trail , and began his studies at the university , graduating in 1505 .
in 1507 , luther was ordained as a priest here .
today , luther 's quarters in the monastery have been reconstructed to create a sense of what daily life must have been like in this strict monastic order .
the monastery is also an architectural monument to medieval religious architecture , situated right in the old town of erfurt .
badly destroyed during world war ii , it was rebuilt in 1982 as part of celebrations marking the 500th birthday of martin luther .

2003 - marktplatz von der lutherstadt wittenberg in sachsen-anhalt some 200 kilometers away from erfurt lies wittenberg , the final destination on the luther tour .
luther spent 36 years of his life here – and the town is a treasure trove for luther pilgrims .
as a 25-year-old priest , luther was inducted as teacher at wittenberg university in 1508 .
the small town on the banks of the river elbe had just 2,000 inhabitants , and the pace of life was slow .
luther was said to have described it as town " on the edge of civilization " .
the priest lived with augustinian hermits , and today , visitors to wittenberg can explore his quarters , maintained in their original form , at the luther house , luther memorial foundation of saxony-anhalt .
the museum also houses the world 's largest collection of documents charting the history of the reformation , with more than 10,000 prints , 6,000 manuscripts , thousands of portraits of luther , 2,000 coins and medallions as well as 14,000 graphics .
the museum authorities completed a comprehensive restoration of these historic pieces , and a permanent exhibition opened in march , 2003 .
reformation begins in wittenberg it was during his years in wittenberg that luther made a name for himself as a reformer .
during a visit to rome in 1510 , the theologian was appalled by what he perceived as a corrupt catholic church .
a system to raise badly-needed funds for the rebuilding of st. peter 's , which involved papal emissaries selling indulgences , was being grossly abused .
in october 1517 , luther drew up a list of 95 theses questioning the right of the pope to forgive sins .
when he nailed the document to the door of the palace church -lrb- schlossplatz -rrb- in wittenberg , his actions caused ripples in rome , and he was summoned for an audience with pope leo x. the event heralded the beginning of the protestant reformation in germany - and ultimately , protestantism in general .
today the palace church is wittenberg 's main attraction for luther pilgrims .
luther continued to challenge the papacy .
in 1520 , he published his famous address " an den christlichen adel deutscher nation " -lrb- address to the christian nobility of the german nation -rrb- , followed by the treatise " de captivitate babylonica ecclesiae praeludium " -lrb- a prelude concerning the babylonian captivity of the church -rrb- , which also attacked the doctrinal system of the church of rome .
on december 10 of the same year , luther burned the papal bull issued against him before a gathering of doctors , students , and citizens in wittenberg , on a spot marked today by the legendary " lutheran oak " -lrb- located at the intersection of lutherstrasse and collegienstrasse -rrb- .
in 1522 , luther gave his first sermons in german at the church of st. marien -lrb- kirchplatz -rrb- in wittenberg .
the most remarkable work of art in this , the oldest building in wittenberg , is the cycle of paintings on the reformation altar by lucas cranach the elder , dedicated in 1547 .
the group on the right-hand side of the main panel refers to luther ' communion teachings and shows luther taking his place among the apostles at the last supper .
wittenberg is also home to one of germany 's most beautiful renaissance town halls , situated on the market square and flanked by a striking luther memorial .
originally planned for eisleben , the town of luther 's birth and death , it was brought to wittenberg on the orders of the prussian king friedrich wilhelm iii .
perhaps one of the most significant of the many artistic tributes to luther in germany , the memorial is the work of the berlin sculptor gottfried schadow , while the neo-gothic dais was designed by karl friedrich schinkel .
lucas cranach the elder , a friend of luther 's , was an artist whose paintings and graphics gave strong impetus to the reformation movement .
he also served as mayor here from 1537 to 1544 , as well as running the town 's apothecary - which still stands to this day - a book shop and a flourishing studio , which helped make wittenberg an important center for various artistic activities in germany .
still a controversial figure although there are over 70 million followers of the lutheran church worldwide , dr. martin luther remains a controversial figure .
initially a supporter of the jews , he became frustrated by their unwillingness to embrace his own religion , and emerged as one of the most bitter anti-semites in history .
in his writings , he described jews as poisoners , ritual murderers and parasites , preaching that they were worse than devils , that their synagogues should be burned to the ground and that they should be expelled from germany .
his detractors may argue that luther helped set the stage for the holocaust .
but for others , luthers was a spiritual genius , a man with a remarkable ability to inspire others with his passion and dedication to the christian faith . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links luther pilgrimages a guide to the official luther pilgrimage itinerary routes to luther further tips for tours of luther landmarks unesco world heritage sites unesco world heritage sites in eastern germany martin luther comprehensive information on martin luther 9797 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

today the palace church is wittenberg 's main attraction for luther pilgrims .
luther continued to challenge the papacy .
in 1520 , he published his famous address " an den christlichen adel deutscher nation " -lrb- address to the christian nobility of the german nation -rrb- , followed by the treatise " de captivitate babylonica ecclesiae praeludium " -lrb- a prelude concerning the babylonian captivity of the church -rrb- , which also attacked the doctrinal system of the church of rome .
on december 10 of the same year , luther burned the papal bull issued against him before a gathering of doctors , students , and citizens in wittenberg , on a spot marked today by the legendary " lutheran oak " -lrb- located at the intersection of lutherstrasse and collegienstrasse -rrb- .
in 1522 , luther gave his first sermons in german at the church of st. marien -lrb- kirchplatz -rrb- in wittenberg .
the most remarkable work of art in this , the oldest building in wittenberg , is the cycle of paintings on the reformation altar by lucas cranach the elder , dedicated in 1547 .
the group on the right-hand side of the main panel refers to luther ' communion teachings and shows luther taking his place among the apostles at the last supper .
wittenberg is also home to one of germany 's most beautiful renaissance town halls , situated on the market square and flanked by a striking luther memorial .
originally planned for eisleben , the town of luther 's birth and death , it was brought to wittenberg on the orders of the prussian king friedrich wilhelm iii .
perhaps one of the most significant of the many artistic tributes to luther in germany , the memorial is the work of the berlin sculptor gottfried schadow , while the neo-gothic dais was designed by karl friedrich schinkel .
lucas cranach the elder , a friend of luther 's , was an artist whose paintings and graphics gave strong impetus to the reformation movement .
he also served as mayor here from 1537 to 1544 , as well as running the town 's apothecary - which still stands to this day - a book shop and a flourishing studio , which helped make wittenberg an important center for various artistic activities in germany .
still a controversial figure although there are over 70 million followers of the lutheran church worldwide , dr. martin luther remains a controversial figure .
initially a supporter of the jews , he became frustrated by their unwillingness to embrace his own religion , and emerged as one of the most bitter anti-semites in history .
in his writings , he described jews as poisoners , ritual murderers and parasites , preaching that they were worse than devils , that their synagogues should be burned to the ground and that they should be expelled from germany .
his detractors may argue that luther helped set the stage for the holocaust .

through his work translating the bible , luther is also credited with reforming the german language , helping mold the modern usage that prevails today .
the main landmarks in a luther pilgrimage can be explored in a whistle-stop , three-day tour of lutherland .
please note : the tour has been organized by geographical rather than the chronology of luther 's life .
day one - eisleben martin luther was born on november 10 , 1483 , in eisleben , a town in the foothills of the harz mountains , in the eastern part of saxony-anhalt .
his birthplace , a simple but smart building now numbered 15 , stands in a street named after the man himself -lrb- entrance at seminarstrasse 16 -rrb- .
his father hans luther , who worked in the copper mines , and his mother margarethe , baptized baby martin in eisleben 's late gothic church of st. peter and paul - now another must-see destination on the luther tour .
the population of eisleben was then nearly 4,000 , and the town flourished thanks to the local silver and copper mining industry .
today , the population numbers some 20,000 , but people are moving away in droves .
unemployment is rife and young people have little choice but to seek work elsewhere .
but for fans of martin luther , the town is well worth a visit .
the house where the revolutionary reformer was born has been revered as a memorial site since 1693 , making it the oldest museum in germany .
to preserve luther 's memory , the town was bestowed with the epithet " lutherstadt " in 1946 .
in 1997 , the luther memorial sites were declared unesco world heritage sites .
day two - eisenach continuing in luther ’ s footsteps , travel on to eisenach , just under 150 kilometers away and less than a two-hour drive .
traditionally , the picturesque town on the northern edge of the thuringian forest was staunchly religious and was sarcastically described by luther as a " nest of priests . "
in the 15th century , one in ten of the town 's 4,000 inhabitants was involved in religion , and the town had no less than three churches and seven monasteries .
the young luther came here in 1498 to study at the prestigious latin school , now known as the martin-luther-gymnasium on the predigerplatz , or " preacher 's square . "
the " lutherhaus " -lrb- lutherplatz 8 -rrb- overlooking eisenach 's market square gives visitors a chance to explore luther 's life and work .
one highlight of the exhibition is the " lutherstuben " - two small rooms where the reformer is believed to have lived as a pupil until 1501 .
a few footsteps away from the house is the church of st. george , where luther earned extra money by singing in the choir .
a silent witness to this time is the font upon which johann sebastian bach , who was born in eisenach , was baptized in 1685 .
the reformer had fond memories of his four years in eisenach , which he later referred to as " my dear town . "
the town itself remembers and honors luther with a large memorial on the karlsplatz .
wartburg castle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wartburg castle in eisenach the next port-of-call on the luther trail literally looms over eisenach - wartburg castle , where the theologian spent his final , solitary years .
but before heading up to the imposing fortress , take a short detour to the village of steinach , nestled in a picturesque valley .
here , a large memorial has been erected recalling the detention of luther after he refused to retract publicly his teachings even when faced with a ban by the emperor of the holy roman empire at the diet of worms .
the inscription reads : " here marks the spot where dr. martin luther was taken away to wartburg castle upon the orders of friedrich the wise , elector of saxony . "
in fact , the powerful elector had been acting to protect luther .
friedrich believed that allowing the reformer to live incognito at his castle would serve to calm feverish anti-reformation activity .
the wartburg -lrb- schlossberg 2 -rrb- , perched high on a 1230-foot cliff overlooking eisenach , is one of germany 's most famous and well-preserved castles .
it was founded by duke ludwig of thuringia in 1067 .
like all other places connected with luther , it was declared a unesco world heritage site in 1997 .
the entire castle underwent a comprehensive renovation carried out by the east german government between 1952-1966 .
this included work on the room where luther lived for 300 days disguised as junker jörg .
the original floor and paneled walls have been retained and a wooden desk also dates from the lutheran era .
names and dates etched into the stone walls bear witness to the fact that the castle has been visited by christian pilgrims since the end of the 16th century .
most of luther 's time at wartburg castle was spent in quiet study , and it was here that he set about translating the new testament from its original greek into german .
with the publication of the new testament in september 1522 , luther laid the foundations for the german language as we know it today .
the style he adopted was highly descriptive and reflected common language usage , thereby making the texts accessible to all .
in the early 1530s , luther devoted himself to translating the old testament , leading to the publication of the first complete german edition of the bible in august 1534 .
as though completing the circle of his life , luther returned to eisleben , the town of his birth , in january 1546 .
on 17 february , luther complained of serious chest pain and took to his bed .
alarmed , his friends and children gathered around him .
asked by his friend , the court preacher justus jonas : " reverend father , will you stand firm in christ and the doctrine you have preached ? "
luther responded with a clearly audible : " yes " .
it was to be his dying word .
-lrb- you can visit the house where luther died at andreaskirchplatz 7 . -rrb-
two memorial services were held at st. andrew 's church -lrb- sanktandreasplatz -rrb- in eisleben .
in the afternoon of 20 february , the entourage accompanying luther 's body began its journey to wittenberg , arriving two days later .
luther 's body was interred in the castle church , in front of the pulpit .
in 1894 , the house where luther died in eisleben was declared an official memorial site .
erfurt less than 65 kilometers away , erfurt can be easily reached in just half an hour by car .
today , some 200,000 people live in the attractive capital of the state of thuringia .
it boasts one of the best-preserved medieval city centers in germany and is especially proud of its landmark krämer bridge - the longest house bridge in europe , complete with 32 residences .

-lrb- ap photo / jens meyer -rrb- - zu unserem korr - often cited as his spiritual home , martin luther moved here in 1501 , when erfurt was the sixth largest town in germany .

in 1507 , luther was ordained as a priest here .
today , luther 's quarters in the monastery have been reconstructed to create a sense of what daily life must have been like in this strict monastic order .
the monastery is also an architectural monument to medieval religious architecture , situated right in the old town of erfurt .
badly destroyed during world war ii , it was rebuilt in 1982 as part of celebrations marking the 500th birthday of martin luther .

2003 - marktplatz von der lutherstadt wittenberg in sachsen-anhalt some 200 kilometers away from erfurt lies wittenberg , the final destination on the luther tour .
luther spent 36 years of his life here – and the town is a treasure trove for luther pilgrims .
as a 25-year-old priest , luther was inducted as teacher at wittenberg university in 1508 .
the small town on the banks of the river elbe had just 2,000 inhabitants , and the pace of life was slow .
luther was said to have described it as town " on the edge of civilization " .
the priest lived with augustinian hermits , and today , visitors to wittenberg can explore his quarters , maintained in their original form , at the luther house , luther memorial foundation of saxony-anhalt .
the museum also houses the world 's largest collection of documents charting the history of the reformation , with more than 10,000 prints , 6,000 manuscripts , thousands of portraits of luther , 2,000 coins and medallions as well as 14,000 graphics .
the museum authorities completed a comprehensive restoration of these historic pieces , and a permanent exhibition opened in march , 2003 .
reformation begins in wittenberg it was during his years in wittenberg that luther made a name for himself as a reformer .
during a visit to rome in 1510 , the theologian was appalled by what he perceived as a corrupt catholic church .
a system to raise badly-needed funds for the rebuilding of st. peter 's , which involved papal emissaries selling indulgences , was being grossly abused .
in october 1517 , luther drew up a list of 95 theses questioning the right of the pope to forgive sins .
when he nailed the document to the door of the palace church -lrb- schlossplatz -rrb- in wittenberg , his actions caused ripples in rome , and he was summoned for an audience with pope leo x. the event heralded the beginning of the protestant reformation in germany - and ultimately , protestantism in general .

during a visit to rome in 1510 , the theologian was appalled by what he perceived as a corrupt catholic church .
a system to raise badly-needed funds for the rebuilding of st. peter 's , which involved papal emissaries selling indulgences , was being grossly abused .
in october 1517 , luther drew up a list of 95 theses questioning the right of the pope to forgive sins .
when he nailed the document to the door of the palace church -lrb- schlossplatz -rrb- in wittenberg , his actions caused ripples in rome , and he was summoned for an audience with pope leo x. the event heralded the beginning of the protestant reformation in germany - and ultimately , protestantism in general .
today the palace church is wittenberg 's main attraction for luther pilgrims .
luther continued to challenge the papacy .
in 1520 , he published his famous address " an den christlichen adel deutscher nation " -lrb- address to the christian nobility of the german nation -rrb- , followed by the treatise " de captivitate babylonica ecclesiae praeludium " -lrb- a prelude concerning the babylonian captivity of the church -rrb- , which also attacked the doctrinal system of the church of rome .
on december 10 of the same year , luther burned the papal bull issued against him before a gathering of doctors , students , and citizens in wittenberg , on a spot marked today by the legendary " lutheran oak " -lrb- located at the intersection of lutherstrasse and collegienstrasse -rrb- .
in 1522 , luther gave his first sermons in german at the church of st. marien -lrb- kirchplatz -rrb- in wittenberg .
the most remarkable work of art in this , the oldest building in wittenberg , is the cycle of paintings on the reformation altar by lucas cranach the elder , dedicated in 1547 .
the group on the right-hand side of the main panel refers to luther ' communion teachings and shows luther taking his place among the apostles at the last supper .
wittenberg is also home to one of germany 's most beautiful renaissance town halls , situated on the market square and flanked by a striking luther memorial .
originally planned for eisleben , the town of luther 's birth and death , it was brought to wittenberg on the orders of the prussian king friedrich wilhelm iii .
perhaps one of the most significant of the many artistic tributes to luther in germany , the memorial is the work of the berlin sculptor gottfried schadow , while the neo-gothic dais was designed by karl friedrich schinkel .
lucas cranach the elder , a friend of luther 's , was an artist whose paintings and graphics gave strong impetus to the reformation movement .
he also served as mayor here from 1537 to 1544 , as well as running the town 's apothecary - which still stands to this day - a book shop and a flourishing studio , which helped make wittenberg an important center for various artistic activities in germany .
still a controversial figure although there are over 70 million followers of the lutheran church worldwide , dr. martin luther remains a controversial figure .
initially a supporter of the jews , he became frustrated by their unwillingness to embrace his own religion , and emerged as one of the most bitter anti-semites in history .
in his writings , he described jews as poisoners , ritual murderers and parasites , preaching that they were worse than devils , that their synagogues should be burned to the ground and that they should be expelled from germany .
his detractors may argue that luther helped set the stage for the holocaust .
but for others , luthers was a spiritual genius , a man with a remarkable ability to inspire others with his passion and dedication to the christian faith . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links luther pilgrimages a guide to the official luther pilgrimage itinerary routes to luther further tips for tours of luther landmarks unesco world heritage sites unesco world heritage sites in eastern germany martin luther comprehensive information on martin luther 9798 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

through his work translating the bible , luther is also credited with reforming the german language , helping mold the modern usage that prevails today .
the main landmarks in a luther pilgrimage can be explored in a whistle-stop , three-day tour of lutherland .
please note : the tour has been organized by geographical rather than the chronology of luther 's life .
day one - eisleben martin luther was born on november 10 , 1483 , in eisleben , a town in the foothills of the harz mountains , in the eastern part of saxony-anhalt .
his birthplace , a simple but smart building now numbered 15 , stands in a street named after the man himself -lrb- entrance at seminarstrasse 16 -rrb- .
his father hans luther , who worked in the copper mines , and his mother margarethe , baptized baby martin in eisleben 's late gothic church of st. peter and paul - now another must-see destination on the luther tour .
the population of eisleben was then nearly 4,000 , and the town flourished thanks to the local silver and copper mining industry .
today , the population numbers some 20,000 , but people are moving away in droves .
unemployment is rife and young people have little choice but to seek work elsewhere .
but for fans of martin luther , the town is well worth a visit .
the house where the revolutionary reformer was born has been revered as a memorial site since 1693 , making it the oldest museum in germany .
to preserve luther 's memory , the town was bestowed with the epithet " lutherstadt " in 1946 .
in 1997 , the luther memorial sites were declared unesco world heritage sites .
day two - eisenach continuing in luther ’ s footsteps , travel on to eisenach , just under 150 kilometers away and less than a two-hour drive .
traditionally , the picturesque town on the northern edge of the thuringian forest was staunchly religious and was sarcastically described by luther as a " nest of priests . "
in the 15th century , one in ten of the town 's 4,000 inhabitants was involved in religion , and the town had no less than three churches and seven monasteries .
the young luther came here in 1498 to study at the prestigious latin school , now known as the martin-luther-gymnasium on the predigerplatz , or " preacher 's square . "
the " lutherhaus " -lrb- lutherplatz 8 -rrb- overlooking eisenach 's market square gives visitors a chance to explore luther 's life and work .
one highlight of the exhibition is the " lutherstuben " - two small rooms where the reformer is believed to have lived as a pupil until 1501 .
a few footsteps away from the house is the church of st. george , where luther earned extra money by singing in the choir .
a silent witness to this time is the font upon which johann sebastian bach , who was born in eisenach , was baptized in 1685 .
the reformer had fond memories of his four years in eisenach , which he later referred to as " my dear town . "
the town itself remembers and honors luther with a large memorial on the karlsplatz .
wartburg castle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wartburg castle in eisenach the next port-of-call on the luther trail literally looms over eisenach - wartburg castle , where the theologian spent his final , solitary years .
but before heading up to the imposing fortress , take a short detour to the village of steinach , nestled in a picturesque valley .
here , a large memorial has been erected recalling the detention of luther after he refused to retract publicly his teachings even when faced with a ban by the emperor of the holy roman empire at the diet of worms .
the inscription reads : " here marks the spot where dr. martin luther was taken away to wartburg castle upon the orders of friedrich the wise , elector of saxony . "
in fact , the powerful elector had been acting to protect luther .
friedrich believed that allowing the reformer to live incognito at his castle would serve to calm feverish anti-reformation activity .
the wartburg -lrb- schlossberg 2 -rrb- , perched high on a 1230-foot cliff overlooking eisenach , is one of germany 's most famous and well-preserved castles .
it was founded by duke ludwig of thuringia in 1067 .
like all other places connected with luther , it was declared a unesco world heritage site in 1997 .
the entire castle underwent a comprehensive renovation carried out by the east german government between 1952-1966 .
this included work on the room where luther lived for 300 days disguised as junker jörg .
the original floor and paneled walls have been retained and a wooden desk also dates from the lutheran era .
names and dates etched into the stone walls bear witness to the fact that the castle has been visited by christian pilgrims since the end of the 16th century .
most of luther 's time at wartburg castle was spent in quiet study , and it was here that he set about translating the new testament from its original greek into german .
with the publication of the new testament in september 1522 , luther laid the foundations for the german language as we know it today .
the style he adopted was highly descriptive and reflected common language usage , thereby making the texts accessible to all .
in the early 1530s , luther devoted himself to translating the old testament , leading to the publication of the first complete german edition of the bible in august 1534 .
as though completing the circle of his life , luther returned to eisleben , the town of his birth , in january 1546 .
on 17 february , luther complained of serious chest pain and took to his bed .
alarmed , his friends and children gathered around him .
asked by his friend , the court preacher justus jonas : " reverend father , will you stand firm in christ and the doctrine you have preached ? "
luther responded with a clearly audible : " yes " .
it was to be his dying word .
-lrb- you can visit the house where luther died at andreaskirchplatz 7 . -rrb-
two memorial services were held at st. andrew 's church -lrb- sanktandreasplatz -rrb- in eisleben .
in the afternoon of 20 february , the entourage accompanying luther 's body began its journey to wittenberg , arriving two days later .
luther 's body was interred in the castle church , in front of the pulpit .
in 1894 , the house where luther died in eisleben was declared an official memorial site .
erfurt less than 65 kilometers away , erfurt can be easily reached in just half an hour by car .
today , some 200,000 people live in the attractive capital of the state of thuringia .
it boasts one of the best-preserved medieval city centers in germany and is especially proud of its landmark krämer bridge - the longest house bridge in europe , complete with 32 residences .

-lrb- ap photo / jens meyer -rrb- - zu unserem korr - often cited as his spiritual home , martin luther moved here in 1501 , when erfurt was the sixth largest town in germany .
he lived in the town 's augustinian monastery -lrb- augustinerstrasse 10 -rrb- , now one of the most important destinations on the lutheran trail , and began his studies at the university , graduating in 1505 .
in 1507 , luther was ordained as a priest here .
today , luther 's quarters in the monastery have been reconstructed to create a sense of what daily life must have been like in this strict monastic order .
the monastery is also an architectural monument to medieval religious architecture , situated right in the old town of erfurt .
badly destroyed during world war ii , it was rebuilt in 1982 as part of celebrations marking the 500th birthday of martin luther .

2003 - marktplatz von der lutherstadt wittenberg in sachsen-anhalt some 200 kilometers away from erfurt lies wittenberg , the final destination on the luther tour .
luther spent 36 years of his life here – and the town is a treasure trove for luther pilgrims .
as a 25-year-old priest , luther was inducted as teacher at wittenberg university in 1508 .
the small town on the banks of the river elbe had just 2,000 inhabitants , and the pace of life was slow .
luther was said to have described it as town " on the edge of civilization " .
the priest lived with augustinian hermits , and today , visitors to wittenberg can explore his quarters , maintained in their original form , at the luther house , luther memorial foundation of saxony-anhalt .
the museum also houses the world 's largest collection of documents charting the history of the reformation , with more than 10,000 prints , 6,000 manuscripts , thousands of portraits of luther , 2,000 coins and medallions as well as 14,000 graphics .
the museum authorities completed a comprehensive restoration of these historic pieces , and a permanent exhibition opened in march , 2003 .

"
in a highly defensive appearance before the european parliament on wednesday , italy 's prime minister alienated many with his nazi jokes .
but he did lay out a solid plan for his country 's leadership of the eu . his detractors have made no secret of their fears that italian prime minister silvio berlusconi would tarnish the office of the rotating european union presidency with his scandal-plagued leadership and questionable business dealings .
indeed , as he laid out his roadmap for italy 's six-month term at the helm of europe on wednesday , he held true to all expectations .
berlusconi presented his political platforms to the european parliament in strasbourg amid boos , jeers and protests .
one green parliamentarian compared his political ways to those of atila the hun , who ravaged europe during the 5th century .
berlusconi fired back by calling his critics " tourists " in parliamentary democracy and compared one of his most vociferous detractors to a concentration camp guard .
for weeks , martin schulz , a social democratic party member of the european parliament from germany , has served as an outspoken critic of berlusconi , pointing his finger at the italian ’ s personal legal troubles and major media investments as a serious conflict of interest .
he has n't minced words in his policy critiques , either , lambasting berlusconi for recent remarks by his reforms minister that italy 's navy should be able to fire on boats filled with illegal immigrants to keep them from landing on italian shores .
the greens , too , were hardly welcoming of the new eu president when he took to the podium wednesday as they held up signs with slogans like " everyone is equal before the law , " and " no godfather for europe . "
at one point it become too much for berlusconi .
" mr. schulz , " berlusconi quipped , " i know there is in italy a man producing a film on the nazi concentration camps .
i would like to suggest you for the role of kapo .
you 'd be perfect . "
-lrb- kapo is a reference to prisoners selected by the ss to serve as guards and complete menial jobs ; they were given favorable treatment over other prisoners and were considered traitors by many . -rrb-
later , when asked if he wanted the remark to be stricken from the record by european parliament president pat cox , berlusconi refused .
the remarks so outraged the german government that it ordered the italian ambassador in berlin to the office of chancellor gerhard schröder .
members of parliament were no less outraged , and the session was suspended afterwards .
in response to berlusconi 's attack , schulz said : " my respect for the victims of fascism will not permit me to deal with that kind of claim .
but it is very hard for me accept that a politician should be exercising the role of president of the european council if he comes out with this kind of statement when he encounters the slightest contradiction . "
berlusconi later explained that his comments were intended as an " ironic joke " and refused to apologize .
seeking to put out the wildfire on wednesday afternoon , berlusconi went a step further , but still fell short of apologizing when he told eu politicians meeting behind closed doors he " did not mean to offend the feelings of a country , feelings that have a historical motivation . "
but graham watson , the leader of the liberal democratic group in the european parliament , said berlusconi 's remarks " debase the presidency of the council and offend europe . "
a roadmap for italy 's eu presidency the bitter exchange distracted attention from the real message berlusconi came to deliver on wednesday – how italy planned to steer the eu during its term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi berlusconi -lrb- photo -rrb- said his country wanted to create a " new dynamic " in the transatlantic relationship and to push ahead with eastward expansion , calling for bulgaria and romania to be given a clear path in order to facilitate their eu membership by 2007 .
the italian prime minister also called for a " new deal " style increase in public infrastructure investment in order to stimulate economic growth – largely through rail and other public transport projects .
but he said countries should find a way to invest in infrastructure projects without resorting to stability pact-busting deficit spending .
but berlusconi ’ s major task for the next six months is to conduct negotiations after the start of an intergovernmental conference in october that will hammer out the final draft of the eu 's first constitution .
berlusconi would like to see approval of the constitution at a december summit in rome , the site where the 1957 treaty establishing the european community was signed .
highlighting the importance of europe ’ s role in the middle east , berlusconi said brussels should push along the " road map " to peace between the israelis and palestinians and contribute to the reconstruction effort in iraq in order to bring the two continents closer .
addressing recent problems with illegal immigrants entering europe from northern africa , hundreds of whom have perished in accidents on rickety boats , berlusconi called for the creation of an eu border patrol to guard its external borders as well as immigrant holding centers outside the eu .
italian officials believe that last month alone at least 3,000 illegal northern african immigrants landed on italian shores .
now , they want brussels to take action .
with strapped social systems across the union and a graying population , berlusconi also called for eu-wide measures " aimed at increasing the activity level of older workers and reducing trends toward pre-retirement " that strain federal pocketbooks .
among those measures would be a common eu approach to retirement systems . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the eu presidency according to silvio his party changed the law to to make him immune from prosecution and his criminal case was dropped .

in response to berlusconi 's attack , schulz said : " my respect for the victims of fascism will not permit me to deal with that kind of claim .
but it is very hard for me accept that a politician should be exercising the role of president of the european council if he comes out with this kind of statement when he encounters the slightest contradiction . "
berlusconi later explained that his comments were intended as an " ironic joke " and refused to apologize .
seeking to put out the wildfire on wednesday afternoon , berlusconi went a step further , but still fell short of apologizing when he told eu politicians meeting behind closed doors he " did not mean to offend the feelings of a country , feelings that have a historical motivation . "
but graham watson , the leader of the liberal democratic group in the european parliament , said berlusconi 's remarks " debase the presidency of the council and offend europe . "
a roadmap for italy 's eu presidency the bitter exchange distracted attention from the real message berlusconi came to deliver on wednesday – how italy planned to steer the eu during its term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi berlusconi -lrb- photo -rrb- said his country wanted to create a " new dynamic " in the transatlantic relationship and to push ahead with eastward expansion , calling for bulgaria and romania to be given a clear path in order to facilitate their eu membership by 2007 .
the italian prime minister also called for a " new deal " style increase in public infrastructure investment in order to stimulate economic growth – largely through rail and other public transport projects .
but he said countries should find a way to invest in infrastructure projects without resorting to stability pact-busting deficit spending .
but berlusconi ’ s major task for the next six months is to conduct negotiations after the start of an intergovernmental conference in october that will hammer out the final draft of the eu 's first constitution .
berlusconi would like to see approval of the constitution at a december summit in rome , the site where the 1957 treaty establishing the european community was signed .
highlighting the importance of europe ’ s role in the middle east , berlusconi said brussels should push along the " road map " to peace between the israelis and palestinians and contribute to the reconstruction effort in iraq in order to bring the two continents closer .
addressing recent problems with illegal immigrants entering europe from northern africa , hundreds of whom have perished in accidents on rickety boats , berlusconi called for the creation of an eu border patrol to guard its external borders as well as immigrant holding centers outside the eu .
italian officials believe that last month alone at least 3,000 illegal northern african immigrants landed on italian shores .
now , they want brussels to take action .
with strapped social systems across the union and a graying population , berlusconi also called for eu-wide measures " aimed at increasing the activity level of older workers and reducing trends toward pre-retirement " that strain federal pocketbooks .
among those measures would be a common eu approach to retirement systems . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the eu presidency according to silvio his party changed the law to to make him immune from prosecution and his criminal case was dropped .
now silvio berlusconi is at the helm of europe and some fear scandal will overshadow his term as eu president .

through his work translating the bible , luther is also credited with reforming the german language , helping mold the modern usage that prevails today .
the main landmarks in a luther pilgrimage can be explored in a whistle-stop , three-day tour of lutherland .
please note : the tour has been organized by geographical rather than the chronology of luther 's life .
day one - eisleben martin luther was born on november 10 , 1483 , in eisleben , a town in the foothills of the harz mountains , in the eastern part of saxony-anhalt .
his birthplace , a simple but smart building now numbered 15 , stands in a street named after the man himself -lrb- entrance at seminarstrasse 16 -rrb- .
his father hans luther , who worked in the copper mines , and his mother margarethe , baptized baby martin in eisleben 's late gothic church of st. peter and paul - now another must-see destination on the luther tour .
the population of eisleben was then nearly 4,000 , and the town flourished thanks to the local silver and copper mining industry .
today , the population numbers some 20,000 , but people are moving away in droves .
unemployment is rife and young people have little choice but to seek work elsewhere .
but for fans of martin luther , the town is well worth a visit .
the house where the revolutionary reformer was born has been revered as a memorial site since 1693 , making it the oldest museum in germany .
to preserve luther 's memory , the town was bestowed with the epithet " lutherstadt " in 1946 .
in 1997 , the luther memorial sites were declared unesco world heritage sites .
day two - eisenach continuing in luther ’ s footsteps , travel on to eisenach , just under 150 kilometers away and less than a two-hour drive .
traditionally , the picturesque town on the northern edge of the thuringian forest was staunchly religious and was sarcastically described by luther as a " nest of priests . "
in the 15th century , one in ten of the town 's 4,000 inhabitants was involved in religion , and the town had no less than three churches and seven monasteries .
the young luther came here in 1498 to study at the prestigious latin school , now known as the martin-luther-gymnasium on the predigerplatz , or " preacher 's square . "
the " lutherhaus " -lrb- lutherplatz 8 -rrb- overlooking eisenach 's market square gives visitors a chance to explore luther 's life and work .
one highlight of the exhibition is the " lutherstuben " - two small rooms where the reformer is believed to have lived as a pupil until 1501 .
a few footsteps away from the house is the church of st. george , where luther earned extra money by singing in the choir .
a silent witness to this time is the font upon which johann sebastian bach , who was born in eisenach , was baptized in 1685 .
the reformer had fond memories of his four years in eisenach , which he later referred to as " my dear town . "
the town itself remembers and honors luther with a large memorial on the karlsplatz .
wartburg castle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wartburg castle in eisenach the next port-of-call on the luther trail literally looms over eisenach - wartburg castle , where the theologian spent his final , solitary years .
but before heading up to the imposing fortress , take a short detour to the village of steinach , nestled in a picturesque valley .
here , a large memorial has been erected recalling the detention of luther after he refused to retract publicly his teachings even when faced with a ban by the emperor of the holy roman empire at the diet of worms .
the inscription reads : " here marks the spot where dr. martin luther was taken away to wartburg castle upon the orders of friedrich the wise , elector of saxony . "
in fact , the powerful elector had been acting to protect luther .
friedrich believed that allowing the reformer to live incognito at his castle would serve to calm feverish anti-reformation activity .
the wartburg -lrb- schlossberg 2 -rrb- , perched high on a 1230-foot cliff overlooking eisenach , is one of germany 's most famous and well-preserved castles .
it was founded by duke ludwig of thuringia in 1067 .
like all other places connected with luther , it was declared a unesco world heritage site in 1997 .
the entire castle underwent a comprehensive renovation carried out by the east german government between 1952-1966 .
this included work on the room where luther lived for 300 days disguised as junker jörg .
the original floor and paneled walls have been retained and a wooden desk also dates from the lutheran era .
names and dates etched into the stone walls bear witness to the fact that the castle has been visited by christian pilgrims since the end of the 16th century .
most of luther 's time at wartburg castle was spent in quiet study , and it was here that he set about translating the new testament from its original greek into german .
with the publication of the new testament in september 1522 , luther laid the foundations for the german language as we know it today .
the style he adopted was highly descriptive and reflected common language usage , thereby making the texts accessible to all .
in the early 1530s , luther devoted himself to translating the old testament , leading to the publication of the first complete german edition of the bible in august 1534 .
as though completing the circle of his life , luther returned to eisleben , the town of his birth , in january 1546 .
on 17 february , luther complained of serious chest pain and took to his bed .
alarmed , his friends and children gathered around him .
asked by his friend , the court preacher justus jonas : " reverend father , will you stand firm in christ and the doctrine you have preached ? "
luther responded with a clearly audible : " yes " .
it was to be his dying word .
-lrb- you can visit the house where luther died at andreaskirchplatz 7 . -rrb-
two memorial services were held at st. andrew 's church -lrb- sanktandreasplatz -rrb- in eisleben .
in the afternoon of 20 february , the entourage accompanying luther 's body began its journey to wittenberg , arriving two days later .
luther 's body was interred in the castle church , in front of the pulpit .
in 1894 , the house where luther died in eisleben was declared an official memorial site .
erfurt less than 65 kilometers away , erfurt can be easily reached in just half an hour by car .
today , some 200,000 people live in the attractive capital of the state of thuringia .
it boasts one of the best-preserved medieval city centers in germany and is especially proud of its landmark krämer bridge - the longest house bridge in europe , complete with 32 residences .

-lrb- ap photo / jens meyer -rrb- - zu unserem korr - often cited as his spiritual home , martin luther moved here in 1501 , when erfurt was the sixth largest town in germany .
he lived in the town 's augustinian monastery -lrb- augustinerstrasse 10 -rrb- , now one of the most important destinations on the lutheran trail , and began his studies at the university , graduating in 1505 .
in 1507 , luther was ordained as a priest here .
today , luther 's quarters in the monastery have been reconstructed to create a sense of what daily life must have been like in this strict monastic order .
the monastery is also an architectural monument to medieval religious architecture , situated right in the old town of erfurt .
badly destroyed during world war ii , it was rebuilt in 1982 as part of celebrations marking the 500th birthday of martin luther .

2003 - marktplatz von der lutherstadt wittenberg in sachsen-anhalt some 200 kilometers away from erfurt lies wittenberg , the final destination on the luther tour .
luther spent 36 years of his life here – and the town is a treasure trove for luther pilgrims .
as a 25-year-old priest , luther was inducted as teacher at wittenberg university in 1508 .
the small town on the banks of the river elbe had just 2,000 inhabitants , and the pace of life was slow .
luther was said to have described it as town " on the edge of civilization " .
the priest lived with augustinian hermits , and today , visitors to wittenberg can explore his quarters , maintained in their original form , at the luther house , luther memorial foundation of saxony-anhalt .
the museum also houses the world 's largest collection of documents charting the history of the reformation , with more than 10,000 prints , 6,000 manuscripts , thousands of portraits of luther , 2,000 coins and medallions as well as 14,000 graphics .
the museum authorities completed a comprehensive restoration of these historic pieces , and a permanent exhibition opened in march , 2003 .
reformation begins in wittenberg it was during his years in wittenberg that luther made a name for himself as a reformer .
during a visit to rome in 1510 , the theologian was appalled by what he perceived as a corrupt catholic church .
a system to raise badly-needed funds for the rebuilding of st. peter 's , which involved papal emissaries selling indulgences , was being grossly abused .
in october 1517 , luther drew up a list of 95 theses questioning the right of the pope to forgive sins .
when he nailed the document to the door of the palace church -lrb- schlossplatz -rrb- in wittenberg , his actions caused ripples in rome , and he was summoned for an audience with pope leo x. the event heralded the beginning of the protestant reformation in germany - and ultimately , protestantism in general .
today the palace church is wittenberg 's main attraction for luther pilgrims .
luther continued to challenge the papacy .
in 1520 , he published his famous address " an den christlichen adel deutscher nation " -lrb- address to the christian nobility of the german nation -rrb- , followed by the treatise " de captivitate babylonica ecclesiae praeludium " -lrb- a prelude concerning the babylonian captivity of the church -rrb- , which also attacked the doctrinal system of the church of rome .
on december 10 of the same year , luther burned the papal bull issued against him before a gathering of doctors , students , and citizens in wittenberg , on a spot marked today by the legendary " lutheran oak " -lrb- located at the intersection of lutherstrasse and collegienstrasse -rrb- .
in 1522 , luther gave his first sermons in german at the church of st. marien -lrb- kirchplatz -rrb- in wittenberg .
the most remarkable work of art in this , the oldest building in wittenberg , is the cycle of paintings on the reformation altar by lucas cranach the elder , dedicated in 1547 .
the group on the right-hand side of the main panel refers to luther ' communion teachings and shows luther taking his place among the apostles at the last supper .
wittenberg is also home to one of germany 's most beautiful renaissance town halls , situated on the market square and flanked by a striking luther memorial .
originally planned for eisleben , the town of luther 's birth and death , it was brought to wittenberg on the orders of the prussian king friedrich wilhelm iii .
perhaps one of the most significant of the many artistic tributes to luther in germany , the memorial is the work of the berlin sculptor gottfried schadow , while the neo-gothic dais was designed by karl friedrich schinkel .
lucas cranach the elder , a friend of luther 's , was an artist whose paintings and graphics gave strong impetus to the reformation movement .
he also served as mayor here from 1537 to 1544 , as well as running the town 's apothecary - which still stands to this day - a book shop and a flourishing studio , which helped make wittenberg an important center for various artistic activities in germany .
still a controversial figure although there are over 70 million followers of the lutheran church worldwide , dr. martin luther remains a controversial figure .
initially a supporter of the jews , he became frustrated by their unwillingness to embrace his own religion , and emerged as one of the most bitter anti-semites in history .
in his writings , he described jews as poisoners , ritual murderers and parasites , preaching that they were worse than devils , that their synagogues should be burned to the ground and that they should be expelled from germany .
his detractors may argue that luther helped set the stage for the holocaust .
but for others , luthers was a spiritual genius , a man with a remarkable ability to inspire others with his passion and dedication to the christian faith . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links luther pilgrimages a guide to the official luther pilgrimage itinerary routes to luther further tips for tours of luther landmarks unesco world heritage sites unesco world heritage sites in eastern germany martin luther comprehensive information on martin luther 9798 dw-tv europe live quadriga we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

today the palace church is wittenberg 's main attraction for luther pilgrims .
luther continued to challenge the papacy .
in 1520 , he published his famous address " an den christlichen adel deutscher nation " -lrb- address to the christian nobility of the german nation -rrb- , followed by the treatise " de captivitate babylonica ecclesiae praeludium " -lrb- a prelude concerning the babylonian captivity of the church -rrb- , which also attacked the doctrinal system of the church of rome .
on december 10 of the same year , luther burned the papal bull issued against him before a gathering of doctors , students , and citizens in wittenberg , on a spot marked today by the legendary " lutheran oak " -lrb- located at the intersection of lutherstrasse and collegienstrasse -rrb- .
in 1522 , luther gave his first sermons in german at the church of st. marien -lrb- kirchplatz -rrb- in wittenberg .
the most remarkable work of art in this , the oldest building in wittenberg , is the cycle of paintings on the reformation altar by lucas cranach the elder , dedicated in 1547 .
the group on the right-hand side of the main panel refers to luther ' communion teachings and shows luther taking his place among the apostles at the last supper .
wittenberg is also home to one of germany 's most beautiful renaissance town halls , situated on the market square and flanked by a striking luther memorial .
originally planned for eisleben , the town of luther 's birth and death , it was brought to wittenberg on the orders of the prussian king friedrich wilhelm iii .
perhaps one of the most significant of the many artistic tributes to luther in germany , the memorial is the work of the berlin sculptor gottfried schadow , while the neo-gothic dais was designed by karl friedrich schinkel .
lucas cranach the elder , a friend of luther 's , was an artist whose paintings and graphics gave strong impetus to the reformation movement .
he also served as mayor here from 1537 to 1544 , as well as running the town 's apothecary - which still stands to this day - a book shop and a flourishing studio , which helped make wittenberg an important center for various artistic activities in germany .
still a controversial figure although there are over 70 million followers of the lutheran church worldwide , dr. martin luther remains a controversial figure .
initially a supporter of the jews , he became frustrated by their unwillingness to embrace his own religion , and emerged as one of the most bitter anti-semites in history .
in his writings , he described jews as poisoners , ritual murderers and parasites , preaching that they were worse than devils , that their synagogues should be burned to the ground and that they should be expelled from germany .
his detractors may argue that luther helped set the stage for the holocaust .
but for others , luthers was a spiritual genius , a man with a remarkable ability to inspire others with his passion and dedication to the christian faith . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links luther pilgrimages a guide to the official luther pilgrimage itinerary routes to luther further tips for tours of luther landmarks unesco world heritage sites unesco world heritage sites in eastern germany martin luther comprehensive information on martin luther 9798 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

through his work translating the bible , luther is also credited with reforming the german language , helping mold the modern usage that prevails today .
the main landmarks in a luther pilgrimage can be explored in a whistle-stop , three-day tour of lutherland .
please note : the tour has been organized by geographical rather than the chronology of luther 's life .
day one - eisleben martin luther was born on november 10 , 1483 , in eisleben , a town in the foothills of the harz mountains , in the eastern part of saxony-anhalt .
his birthplace , a simple but smart building now numbered 15 , stands in a street named after the man himself -lrb- entrance at seminarstrasse 16 -rrb- .
his father hans luther , who worked in the copper mines , and his mother margarethe , baptized baby martin in eisleben 's late gothic church of st. peter and paul - now another must-see destination on the luther tour .
the population of eisleben was then nearly 4,000 , and the town flourished thanks to the local silver and copper mining industry .
today , the population numbers some 20,000 , but people are moving away in droves .
unemployment is rife and young people have little choice but to seek work elsewhere .
but for fans of martin luther , the town is well worth a visit .
the house where the revolutionary reformer was born has been revered as a memorial site since 1693 , making it the oldest museum in germany .
to preserve luther 's memory , the town was bestowed with the epithet " lutherstadt " in 1946 .
in 1997 , the luther memorial sites were declared unesco world heritage sites .
day two - eisenach continuing in luther ’ s footsteps , travel on to eisenach , just under 150 kilometers away and less than a two-hour drive .
traditionally , the picturesque town on the northern edge of the thuringian forest was staunchly religious and was sarcastically described by luther as a " nest of priests . "
in the 15th century , one in ten of the town 's 4,000 inhabitants was involved in religion , and the town had no less than three churches and seven monasteries .
the young luther came here in 1498 to study at the prestigious latin school , now known as the martin-luther-gymnasium on the predigerplatz , or " preacher 's square . "
the " lutherhaus " -lrb- lutherplatz 8 -rrb- overlooking eisenach 's market square gives visitors a chance to explore luther 's life and work .
one highlight of the exhibition is the " lutherstuben " - two small rooms where the reformer is believed to have lived as a pupil until 1501 .
a few footsteps away from the house is the church of st. george , where luther earned extra money by singing in the choir .
a silent witness to this time is the font upon which johann sebastian bach , who was born in eisenach , was baptized in 1685 .
the reformer had fond memories of his four years in eisenach , which he later referred to as " my dear town . "
the town itself remembers and honors luther with a large memorial on the karlsplatz .
wartburg castle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wartburg castle in eisenach the next port-of-call on the luther trail literally looms over eisenach - wartburg castle , where the theologian spent his final , solitary years .
but before heading up to the imposing fortress , take a short detour to the village of steinach , nestled in a picturesque valley .
here , a large memorial has been erected recalling the detention of luther after he refused to retract publicly his teachings even when faced with a ban by the emperor of the holy roman empire at the diet of worms .
the inscription reads : " here marks the spot where dr. martin luther was taken away to wartburg castle upon the orders of friedrich the wise , elector of saxony . "
in fact , the powerful elector had been acting to protect luther .
friedrich believed that allowing the reformer to live incognito at his castle would serve to calm feverish anti-reformation activity .
the wartburg -lrb- schlossberg 2 -rrb- , perched high on a 1230-foot cliff overlooking eisenach , is one of germany 's most famous and well-preserved castles .
it was founded by duke ludwig of thuringia in 1067 .
like all other places connected with luther , it was declared a unesco world heritage site in 1997 .
the entire castle underwent a comprehensive renovation carried out by the east german government between 1952-1966 .
this included work on the room where luther lived for 300 days disguised as junker jörg .
the original floor and paneled walls have been retained and a wooden desk also dates from the lutheran era .
names and dates etched into the stone walls bear witness to the fact that the castle has been visited by christian pilgrims since the end of the 16th century .
most of luther 's time at wartburg castle was spent in quiet study , and it was here that he set about translating the new testament from its original greek into german .
with the publication of the new testament in september 1522 , luther laid the foundations for the german language as we know it today .
the style he adopted was highly descriptive and reflected common language usage , thereby making the texts accessible to all .
in the early 1530s , luther devoted himself to translating the old testament , leading to the publication of the first complete german edition of the bible in august 1534 .
as though completing the circle of his life , luther returned to eisleben , the town of his birth , in january 1546 .
on 17 february , luther complained of serious chest pain and took to his bed .
alarmed , his friends and children gathered around him .
asked by his friend , the court preacher justus jonas : " reverend father , will you stand firm in christ and the doctrine you have preached ? "
luther responded with a clearly audible : " yes " .
it was to be his dying word .
-lrb- you can visit the house where luther died at andreaskirchplatz 7 . -rrb-
two memorial services were held at st. andrew 's church -lrb- sanktandreasplatz -rrb- in eisleben .
in the afternoon of 20 february , the entourage accompanying luther 's body began its journey to wittenberg , arriving two days later .
luther 's body was interred in the castle church , in front of the pulpit .
in 1894 , the house where luther died in eisleben was declared an official memorial site .
erfurt less than 65 kilometers away , erfurt can be easily reached in just half an hour by car .
today , some 200,000 people live in the attractive capital of the state of thuringia .
it boasts one of the best-preserved medieval city centers in germany and is especially proud of its landmark krämer bridge - the longest house bridge in europe , complete with 32 residences .

-lrb- ap photo / jens meyer -rrb- - zu unserem korr - often cited as his spiritual home , martin luther moved here in 1501 , when erfurt was the sixth largest town in germany .
he lived in the town 's augustinian monastery -lrb- augustinerstrasse 10 -rrb- , now one of the most important destinations on the lutheran trail , and began his studies at the university , graduating in 1505 .
in 1507 , luther was ordained as a priest here .
today , luther 's quarters in the monastery have been reconstructed to create a sense of what daily life must have been like in this strict monastic order .
the monastery is also an architectural monument to medieval religious architecture , situated right in the old town of erfurt .
badly destroyed during world war ii , it was rebuilt in 1982 as part of celebrations marking the 500th birthday of martin luther .

2003 - marktplatz von der lutherstadt wittenberg in sachsen-anhalt some 200 kilometers away from erfurt lies wittenberg , the final destination on the luther tour .
luther spent 36 years of his life here – and the town is a treasure trove for luther pilgrims .
as a 25-year-old priest , luther was inducted as teacher at wittenberg university in 1508 .
the small town on the banks of the river elbe had just 2,000 inhabitants , and the pace of life was slow .
luther was said to have described it as town " on the edge of civilization " .
the priest lived with augustinian hermits , and today , visitors to wittenberg can explore his quarters , maintained in their original form , at the luther house , luther memorial foundation of saxony-anhalt .
the museum also houses the world 's largest collection of documents charting the history of the reformation , with more than 10,000 prints , 6,000 manuscripts , thousands of portraits of luther , 2,000 coins and medallions as well as 14,000 graphics .
the museum authorities completed a comprehensive restoration of these historic pieces , and a permanent exhibition opened in march , 2003 .
reformation begins in wittenberg it was during his years in wittenberg that luther made a name for himself as a reformer .
during a visit to rome in 1510 , the theologian was appalled by what he perceived as a corrupt catholic church .
a system to raise badly-needed funds for the rebuilding of st. peter 's , which involved papal emissaries selling indulgences , was being grossly abused .
in october 1517 , luther drew up a list of 95 theses questioning the right of the pope to forgive sins .
when he nailed the document to the door of the palace church -lrb- schlossplatz -rrb- in wittenberg , his actions caused ripples in rome , and he was summoned for an audience with pope leo x. the event heralded the beginning of the protestant reformation in germany - and ultimately , protestantism in general .
today the palace church is wittenberg 's main attraction for luther pilgrims .
luther continued to challenge the papacy .
in 1520 , he published his famous address " an den christlichen adel deutscher nation " -lrb- address to the christian nobility of the german nation -rrb- , followed by the treatise " de captivitate babylonica ecclesiae praeludium " -lrb- a prelude concerning the babylonian captivity of the church -rrb- , which also attacked the doctrinal system of the church of rome .

"
in a highly defensive appearance before the european parliament on wednesday , italy 's prime minister alienated many with his nazi jokes .
but he did lay out a solid plan for his country 's leadership of the eu . his detractors have made no secret of their fears that italian prime minister silvio berlusconi would tarnish the office of the rotating european union presidency with his scandal-plagued leadership and questionable business dealings .
indeed , as he laid out his roadmap for italy 's six-month term at the helm of europe on wednesday , he held true to all expectations .
berlusconi presented his political platforms to the european parliament in strasbourg amid boos , jeers and protests .
one green parliamentarian compared his political ways to those of atila the hun , who ravaged europe during the 5th century .
berlusconi fired back by calling his critics " tourists " in parliamentary democracy and compared one of his most vociferous detractors to a concentration camp guard .
for weeks , martin schulz , a social democratic party member of the european parliament from germany , has served as an outspoken critic of berlusconi , pointing his finger at the italian ’ s personal legal troubles and major media investments as a serious conflict of interest .
he has n't minced words in his policy critiques , either , lambasting berlusconi for recent remarks by his reforms minister that italy 's navy should be able to fire on boats filled with illegal immigrants to keep them from landing on italian shores .
the greens , too , were hardly welcoming of the new eu president when he took to the podium wednesday as they held up signs with slogans like " everyone is equal before the law , " and " no godfather for europe . "
at one point it become too much for berlusconi .
" mr. schulz , " berlusconi quipped , " i know there is in italy a man producing a film on the nazi concentration camps .
i would like to suggest you for the role of kapo .
you 'd be perfect . "
-lrb- kapo is a reference to prisoners selected by the ss to serve as guards and complete menial jobs ; they were given favorable treatment over other prisoners and were considered traitors by many . -rrb-
later , when asked if he wanted the remark to be stricken from the record by european parliament president pat cox , berlusconi refused .
the remarks so outraged the german government that it ordered the italian ambassador in berlin to the office of chancellor gerhard schröder .
members of parliament were no less outraged , and the session was suspended afterwards .
in response to berlusconi 's attack , schulz said : " my respect for the victims of fascism will not permit me to deal with that kind of claim .
but it is very hard for me accept that a politician should be exercising the role of president of the european council if he comes out with this kind of statement when he encounters the slightest contradiction . "
berlusconi later explained that his comments were intended as an " ironic joke " and refused to apologize .
seeking to put out the wildfire on wednesday afternoon , berlusconi went a step further , but still fell short of apologizing when he told eu politicians meeting behind closed doors he " did not mean to offend the feelings of a country , feelings that have a historical motivation . "
but graham watson , the leader of the liberal democratic group in the european parliament , said berlusconi 's remarks " debase the presidency of the council and offend europe . "
a roadmap for italy 's eu presidency the bitter exchange distracted attention from the real message berlusconi came to deliver on wednesday – how italy planned to steer the eu during its term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi berlusconi -lrb- photo -rrb- said his country wanted to create a " new dynamic " in the transatlantic relationship and to push ahead with eastward expansion , calling for bulgaria and romania to be given a clear path in order to facilitate their eu membership by 2007 .
the italian prime minister also called for a " new deal " style increase in public infrastructure investment in order to stimulate economic growth – largely through rail and other public transport projects .
but he said countries should find a way to invest in infrastructure projects without resorting to stability pact-busting deficit spending .
but berlusconi ’ s major task for the next six months is to conduct negotiations after the start of an intergovernmental conference in october that will hammer out the final draft of the eu 's first constitution .
berlusconi would like to see approval of the constitution at a december summit in rome , the site where the 1957 treaty establishing the european community was signed .
highlighting the importance of europe ’ s role in the middle east , berlusconi said brussels should push along the " road map " to peace between the israelis and palestinians and contribute to the reconstruction effort in iraq in order to bring the two continents closer .
addressing recent problems with illegal immigrants entering europe from northern africa , hundreds of whom have perished in accidents on rickety boats , berlusconi called for the creation of an eu border patrol to guard its external borders as well as immigrant holding centers outside the eu .
italian officials believe that last month alone at least 3,000 illegal northern african immigrants landed on italian shores .
now , they want brussels to take action .
with strapped social systems across the union and a graying population , berlusconi also called for eu-wide measures " aimed at increasing the activity level of older workers and reducing trends toward pre-retirement " that strain federal pocketbooks .
among those measures would be a common eu approach to retirement systems . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the eu presidency according to silvio his party changed the law to to make him immune from prosecution and his criminal case was dropped .

"
in a highly defensive appearance before the european parliament on wednesday , italy 's prime minister alienated many with his nazi jokes .
but he did lay out a solid plan for his country 's leadership of the eu . his detractors have made no secret of their fears that italian prime minister silvio berlusconi would tarnish the office of the rotating european union presidency with his scandal-plagued leadership and questionable business dealings .
indeed , as he laid out his roadmap for italy 's six-month term at the helm of europe on wednesday , he held true to all expectations .
berlusconi presented his political platforms to the european parliament in strasbourg amid boos , jeers and protests .
one green parliamentarian compared his political ways to those of atila the hun , who ravaged europe during the 5th century .
berlusconi fired back by calling his critics " tourists " in parliamentary democracy and compared one of his most vociferous detractors to a concentration camp guard .
for weeks , martin schulz , a social democratic party member of the european parliament from germany , has served as an outspoken critic of berlusconi , pointing his finger at the italian ’ s personal legal troubles and major media investments as a serious conflict of interest .
he has n't minced words in his policy critiques , either , lambasting berlusconi for recent remarks by his reforms minister that italy 's navy should be able to fire on boats filled with illegal immigrants to keep them from landing on italian shores .
the greens , too , were hardly welcoming of the new eu president when he took to the podium wednesday as they held up signs with slogans like " everyone is equal before the law , " and " no godfather for europe . "
at one point it become too much for berlusconi .
" mr. schulz , " berlusconi quipped , " i know there is in italy a man producing a film on the nazi concentration camps .
i would like to suggest you for the role of kapo .
you 'd be perfect . "
-lrb- kapo is a reference to prisoners selected by the ss to serve as guards and complete menial jobs ; they were given favorable treatment over other prisoners and were considered traitors by many . -rrb-
later , when asked if he wanted the remark to be stricken from the record by european parliament president pat cox , berlusconi refused .
the remarks so outraged the german government that it ordered the italian ambassador in berlin to the office of chancellor gerhard schröder .
members of parliament were no less outraged , and the session was suspended afterwards .

an earnest project aided by marketing and branding experts is underway in london to jazz up germany ’ s humorless and stereotypically staid image in great britain as reflected in a recent survey . it ’ s no secret that germany ’ s image in britain is in bad shape .
whether it ’ s the tabloids taking a gibe with headlines like " herr we go – bring on the krauts " or " let ’ s blitz fritz " when england was pitted against germany in the 1996 european soccer championships , weekly television documentaries on hitler and concentration camps or papers such as the independent concluding recently that books with swastikas gracing the cover are guaranteed to be bestsellers , the british are still fed cliché-heavy doses of germany ’ s past .
the only other strong connection most british citizens have to the germans are parked in their garages : german cars have a brilliant reputation and reinforce the image of their makers as being reliable , punctual and efficient .
clueless about modern germany little wonder then that a recent survey conducted by the goethe institut , the german language and cultural center , and the british council turned out such negative results .
the poll , which quizzed young people between 16 and 25 years on their picture of modern germany , drew up mostly question marks .
although 37 percent of the british displayed a positive stance towards germany , they could only come up with beer and sport as the two things they identified with the country .
another 17 percent said they didn ’ t like germany and cited its military past , far-right tendencies and the apparent lack of manners and humor of the germans as reasons .
an astonishing 64 percent couldn ’ t name a single living famous german personality -lrb- supermodel claudia schiffer was mentioned a few times -rrb- .
another larger survey conducted for the goethe institut last year concluded that more than half the british population – 52 percent – said they didn ’ t have a clue about modern day germany .
more than hitler and nazi past alarmed by the unpopularity of its country and the widespread ignorance about it in britain , the goethe institut in london launched a campaign last year in british schools to promote itself as a fun-loving , cool nation .
" english students think the hitler theme with its smart uniforms and all is sexy , " head of the london goethe institut dr. ulrich sacker told deutsche welle .
" teachers have told me that it ’ s much easier to sell hitler than say environmental consciousness .
but what do you expect ?
every evening there ’ s at least one film on world war ii on british television . "
sacker says there ’ s just no information on german cultural and social life in britain .
" people just do not know about the other side , the more contemporary germany , the hedonistic side , the traveling spirit of the germans . "
cool britannia german style sacker now wants to bring contemporary germany to a larger british audience .
the goethe institut london has teamed up with a host of other organizations promoting german-british relations and founded a new initiative " creative capital foundation " to shape a new modern image of germany .
to start with , the foundation invited a slew of british travel journalists to the goethe institut earlier this week to expand their minds on the charms of the western german state of north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- along the river rhine .
" tourism is an important part of the process , the british usually never travel to germany , but prefer to go south , " dr. sacker explains .
" berlin was a focus last year , this time it ’ s nrw , and in 2005 it ’ ll be saxony , " sacker adds .
the foundation also organized a " british-german media bash " this week where german and british journalists , marketing and branding experts , thrashed out the role that politics , celebrities , media and advertising could play in spiking up germany ’ s dull image .
make love not war sacker opened the day-long seminar by showing two photographs of berlin ’ s famous victory column .
one from 1945 showed the monument surrounded by tanks and ruins , the other from the 1990s showed dancing revelers at the annual love parade , the world ’ s largest techno party .

" but they should get to know the berlin of love , " he added .
sacker described the initiative - modeled along the lines of cool britannia , a campaign promoted by tony blair in the 1990s to liven up britain ’ s stuffy image from an old-fashioned nation of tweed- jacket-wearers to britpop and britart – as a " brainstorming session . "
" there were some interesting suggestions , but we ’ ve decided not to market germany as a brand .
it would only reduce the strong image that already exists about the country , " he says .
" instead we ’ re going to focus on adding interesting facets and snippets like the love parade , contemporary fashion , cuisine and karneval – that ’ s the only way to get the british interested . "
there ’ s no time frame as yet for when all the recommendations and brainstorming for spiffing up germany ’ s reputation will translate into action .
there ’ s talk of " strategy " and " high-quality projects . "
but sacker says " the important thing is that none of the end projects will have a moral finger teaching the british about germany .
instead they ’ ll all be infused with humor and irony . "

"
in a highly defensive appearance before the european parliament on wednesday , italy 's prime minister alienated many with his nazi jokes .
but he did lay out a solid plan for his country 's leadership of the eu . his detractors have made no secret of their fears that italian prime minister silvio berlusconi would tarnish the office of the rotating european union presidency with his scandal-plagued leadership and questionable business dealings .
indeed , as he laid out his roadmap for italy 's six-month term at the helm of europe on wednesday , he held true to all expectations .
berlusconi presented his political platforms to the european parliament in strasbourg amid boos , jeers and protests .
one green parliamentarian compared his political ways to those of atila the hun , who ravaged europe during the 5th century .
berlusconi fired back by calling his critics " tourists " in parliamentary democracy and compared one of his most vociferous detractors to a concentration camp guard .
for weeks , martin schulz , a social democratic party member of the european parliament from germany , has served as an outspoken critic of berlusconi , pointing his finger at the italian ’ s personal legal troubles and major media investments as a serious conflict of interest .
he has n't minced words in his policy critiques , either , lambasting berlusconi for recent remarks by his reforms minister that italy 's navy should be able to fire on boats filled with illegal immigrants to keep them from landing on italian shores .
the greens , too , were hardly welcoming of the new eu president when he took to the podium wednesday as they held up signs with slogans like " everyone is equal before the law , " and " no godfather for europe . "
at one point it become too much for berlusconi .
" mr. schulz , " berlusconi quipped , " i know there is in italy a man producing a film on the nazi concentration camps .
i would like to suggest you for the role of kapo .
you 'd be perfect . "
-lrb- kapo is a reference to prisoners selected by the ss to serve as guards and complete menial jobs ; they were given favorable treatment over other prisoners and were considered traitors by many . -rrb-
later , when asked if he wanted the remark to be stricken from the record by european parliament president pat cox , berlusconi refused .
the remarks so outraged the german government that it ordered the italian ambassador in berlin to the office of chancellor gerhard schröder .
members of parliament were no less outraged , and the session was suspended afterwards .
in response to berlusconi 's attack , schulz said : " my respect for the victims of fascism will not permit me to deal with that kind of claim .
but it is very hard for me accept that a politician should be exercising the role of president of the european council if he comes out with this kind of statement when he encounters the slightest contradiction . "
berlusconi later explained that his comments were intended as an " ironic joke " and refused to apologize .
seeking to put out the wildfire on wednesday afternoon , berlusconi went a step further , but still fell short of apologizing when he told eu politicians meeting behind closed doors he " did not mean to offend the feelings of a country , feelings that have a historical motivation . "
but graham watson , the leader of the liberal democratic group in the european parliament , said berlusconi 's remarks " debase the presidency of the council and offend europe . "
a roadmap for italy 's eu presidency the bitter exchange distracted attention from the real message berlusconi came to deliver on wednesday – how italy planned to steer the eu during its term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi berlusconi -lrb- photo -rrb- said his country wanted to create a " new dynamic " in the transatlantic relationship and to push ahead with eastward expansion , calling for bulgaria and romania to be given a clear path in order to facilitate their eu membership by 2007 .
the italian prime minister also called for a " new deal " style increase in public infrastructure investment in order to stimulate economic growth – largely through rail and other public transport projects .
but he said countries should find a way to invest in infrastructure projects without resorting to stability pact-busting deficit spending .
but berlusconi ’ s major task for the next six months is to conduct negotiations after the start of an intergovernmental conference in october that will hammer out the final draft of the eu 's first constitution .
berlusconi would like to see approval of the constitution at a december summit in rome , the site where the 1957 treaty establishing the european community was signed .
highlighting the importance of europe ’ s role in the middle east , berlusconi said brussels should push along the " road map " to peace between the israelis and palestinians and contribute to the reconstruction effort in iraq in order to bring the two continents closer .
addressing recent problems with illegal immigrants entering europe from northern africa , hundreds of whom have perished in accidents on rickety boats , berlusconi called for the creation of an eu border patrol to guard its external borders as well as immigrant holding centers outside the eu .
italian officials believe that last month alone at least 3,000 illegal northern african immigrants landed on italian shores .
now , they want brussels to take action .
with strapped social systems across the union and a graying population , berlusconi also called for eu-wide measures " aimed at increasing the activity level of older workers and reducing trends toward pre-retirement " that strain federal pocketbooks .
among those measures would be a common eu approach to retirement systems . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the eu presidency according to silvio his party changed the law to to make him immune from prosecution and his criminal case was dropped .
now silvio berlusconi is at the helm of europe and some fear scandal will overshadow his term as eu president .

through his work translating the bible , luther is also credited with reforming the german language , helping mold the modern usage that prevails today .
the main landmarks in a luther pilgrimage can be explored in a whistle-stop , three-day tour of lutherland .
please note : the tour has been organized by geographical rather than the chronology of luther 's life .
day one - eisleben martin luther was born on november 10 , 1483 , in eisleben , a town in the foothills of the harz mountains , in the eastern part of saxony-anhalt .
his birthplace , a simple but smart building now numbered 15 , stands in a street named after the man himself -lrb- entrance at seminarstrasse 16 -rrb- .
his father hans luther , who worked in the copper mines , and his mother margarethe , baptized baby martin in eisleben 's late gothic church of st. peter and paul - now another must-see destination on the luther tour .
the population of eisleben was then nearly 4,000 , and the town flourished thanks to the local silver and copper mining industry .
today , the population numbers some 20,000 , but people are moving away in droves .
unemployment is rife and young people have little choice but to seek work elsewhere .
but for fans of martin luther , the town is well worth a visit .
the house where the revolutionary reformer was born has been revered as a memorial site since 1693 , making it the oldest museum in germany .
to preserve luther 's memory , the town was bestowed with the epithet " lutherstadt " in 1946 .
in 1997 , the luther memorial sites were declared unesco world heritage sites .
day two - eisenach continuing in luther ’ s footsteps , travel on to eisenach , just under 150 kilometers away and less than a two-hour drive .
traditionally , the picturesque town on the northern edge of the thuringian forest was staunchly religious and was sarcastically described by luther as a " nest of priests . "
in the 15th century , one in ten of the town 's 4,000 inhabitants was involved in religion , and the town had no less than three churches and seven monasteries .
the young luther came here in 1498 to study at the prestigious latin school , now known as the martin-luther-gymnasium on the predigerplatz , or " preacher 's square . "
the " lutherhaus " -lrb- lutherplatz 8 -rrb- overlooking eisenach 's market square gives visitors a chance to explore luther 's life and work .
one highlight of the exhibition is the " lutherstuben " - two small rooms where the reformer is believed to have lived as a pupil until 1501 .
a few footsteps away from the house is the church of st. george , where luther earned extra money by singing in the choir .
a silent witness to this time is the font upon which johann sebastian bach , who was born in eisenach , was baptized in 1685 .
the reformer had fond memories of his four years in eisenach , which he later referred to as " my dear town . "
the town itself remembers and honors luther with a large memorial on the karlsplatz .
wartburg castle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wartburg castle in eisenach the next port-of-call on the luther trail literally looms over eisenach - wartburg castle , where the theologian spent his final , solitary years .
but before heading up to the imposing fortress , take a short detour to the village of steinach , nestled in a picturesque valley .
here , a large memorial has been erected recalling the detention of luther after he refused to retract publicly his teachings even when faced with a ban by the emperor of the holy roman empire at the diet of worms .
the inscription reads : " here marks the spot where dr. martin luther was taken away to wartburg castle upon the orders of friedrich the wise , elector of saxony . "
in fact , the powerful elector had been acting to protect luther .
friedrich believed that allowing the reformer to live incognito at his castle would serve to calm feverish anti-reformation activity .
the wartburg -lrb- schlossberg 2 -rrb- , perched high on a 1230-foot cliff overlooking eisenach , is one of germany 's most famous and well-preserved castles .
it was founded by duke ludwig of thuringia in 1067 .
like all other places connected with luther , it was declared a unesco world heritage site in 1997 .
the entire castle underwent a comprehensive renovation carried out by the east german government between 1952-1966 .
this included work on the room where luther lived for 300 days disguised as junker jörg .
the original floor and paneled walls have been retained and a wooden desk also dates from the lutheran era .
names and dates etched into the stone walls bear witness to the fact that the castle has been visited by christian pilgrims since the end of the 16th century .
most of luther 's time at wartburg castle was spent in quiet study , and it was here that he set about translating the new testament from its original greek into german .
with the publication of the new testament in september 1522 , luther laid the foundations for the german language as we know it today .
the style he adopted was highly descriptive and reflected common language usage , thereby making the texts accessible to all .
in the early 1530s , luther devoted himself to translating the old testament , leading to the publication of the first complete german edition of the bible in august 1534 .
as though completing the circle of his life , luther returned to eisleben , the town of his birth , in january 1546 .
on 17 february , luther complained of serious chest pain and took to his bed .
alarmed , his friends and children gathered around him .
asked by his friend , the court preacher justus jonas : " reverend father , will you stand firm in christ and the doctrine you have preached ? "
luther responded with a clearly audible : " yes " .
it was to be his dying word .
-lrb- you can visit the house where luther died at andreaskirchplatz 7 . -rrb-
two memorial services were held at st. andrew 's church -lrb- sanktandreasplatz -rrb- in eisleben .
in the afternoon of 20 february , the entourage accompanying luther 's body began its journey to wittenberg , arriving two days later .
luther 's body was interred in the castle church , in front of the pulpit .
in 1894 , the house where luther died in eisleben was declared an official memorial site .
erfurt less than 65 kilometers away , erfurt can be easily reached in just half an hour by car .
today , some 200,000 people live in the attractive capital of the state of thuringia .
it boasts one of the best-preserved medieval city centers in germany and is especially proud of its landmark krämer bridge - the longest house bridge in europe , complete with 32 residences .

-lrb- ap photo / jens meyer -rrb- - zu unserem korr - often cited as his spiritual home , martin luther moved here in 1501 , when erfurt was the sixth largest town in germany .
he lived in the town 's augustinian monastery -lrb- augustinerstrasse 10 -rrb- , now one of the most important destinations on the lutheran trail , and began his studies at the university , graduating in 1505 .
in 1507 , luther was ordained as a priest here .
today , luther 's quarters in the monastery have been reconstructed to create a sense of what daily life must have been like in this strict monastic order .
the monastery is also an architectural monument to medieval religious architecture , situated right in the old town of erfurt .
badly destroyed during world war ii , it was rebuilt in 1982 as part of celebrations marking the 500th birthday of martin luther .

2003 - marktplatz von der lutherstadt wittenberg in sachsen-anhalt some 200 kilometers away from erfurt lies wittenberg , the final destination on the luther tour .
luther spent 36 years of his life here – and the town is a treasure trove for luther pilgrims .
as a 25-year-old priest , luther was inducted as teacher at wittenberg university in 1508 .
the small town on the banks of the river elbe had just 2,000 inhabitants , and the pace of life was slow .
luther was said to have described it as town " on the edge of civilization " .
the priest lived with augustinian hermits , and today , visitors to wittenberg can explore his quarters , maintained in their original form , at the luther house , luther memorial foundation of saxony-anhalt .
the museum also houses the world 's largest collection of documents charting the history of the reformation , with more than 10,000 prints , 6,000 manuscripts , thousands of portraits of luther , 2,000 coins and medallions as well as 14,000 graphics .
the museum authorities completed a comprehensive restoration of these historic pieces , and a permanent exhibition opened in march , 2003 .
reformation begins in wittenberg it was during his years in wittenberg that luther made a name for himself as a reformer .
during a visit to rome in 1510 , the theologian was appalled by what he perceived as a corrupt catholic church .
a system to raise badly-needed funds for the rebuilding of st. peter 's , which involved papal emissaries selling indulgences , was being grossly abused .
in october 1517 , luther drew up a list of 95 theses questioning the right of the pope to forgive sins .
when he nailed the document to the door of the palace church -lrb- schlossplatz -rrb- in wittenberg , his actions caused ripples in rome , and he was summoned for an audience with pope leo x. the event heralded the beginning of the protestant reformation in germany - and ultimately , protestantism in general .
today the palace church is wittenberg 's main attraction for luther pilgrims .
luther continued to challenge the papacy .
in 1520 , he published his famous address " an den christlichen adel deutscher nation " -lrb- address to the christian nobility of the german nation -rrb- , followed by the treatise " de captivitate babylonica ecclesiae praeludium " -lrb- a prelude concerning the babylonian captivity of the church -rrb- , which also attacked the doctrinal system of the church of rome .
on december 10 of the same year , luther burned the papal bull issued against him before a gathering of doctors , students , and citizens in wittenberg , on a spot marked today by the legendary " lutheran oak " -lrb- located at the intersection of lutherstrasse and collegienstrasse -rrb- .
in 1522 , luther gave his first sermons in german at the church of st. marien -lrb- kirchplatz -rrb- in wittenberg .
the most remarkable work of art in this , the oldest building in wittenberg , is the cycle of paintings on the reformation altar by lucas cranach the elder , dedicated in 1547 .
the group on the right-hand side of the main panel refers to luther ' communion teachings and shows luther taking his place among the apostles at the last supper .
wittenberg is also home to one of germany 's most beautiful renaissance town halls , situated on the market square and flanked by a striking luther memorial .
originally planned for eisleben , the town of luther 's birth and death , it was brought to wittenberg on the orders of the prussian king friedrich wilhelm iii .
perhaps one of the most significant of the many artistic tributes to luther in germany , the memorial is the work of the berlin sculptor gottfried schadow , while the neo-gothic dais was designed by karl friedrich schinkel .
lucas cranach the elder , a friend of luther 's , was an artist whose paintings and graphics gave strong impetus to the reformation movement .
he also served as mayor here from 1537 to 1544 , as well as running the town 's apothecary - which still stands to this day - a book shop and a flourishing studio , which helped make wittenberg an important center for various artistic activities in germany .
still a controversial figure although there are over 70 million followers of the lutheran church worldwide , dr. martin luther remains a controversial figure .
initially a supporter of the jews , he became frustrated by their unwillingness to embrace his own religion , and emerged as one of the most bitter anti-semites in history .
in his writings , he described jews as poisoners , ritual murderers and parasites , preaching that they were worse than devils , that their synagogues should be burned to the ground and that they should be expelled from germany .
his detractors may argue that luther helped set the stage for the holocaust .
but for others , luthers was a spiritual genius , a man with a remarkable ability to inspire others with his passion and dedication to the christian faith . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links luther pilgrimages a guide to the official luther pilgrimage itinerary routes to luther further tips for tours of luther landmarks unesco world heritage sites unesco world heritage sites in eastern germany martin luther comprehensive information on martin luther 9799 dw-tv europe live journal - nachrichten mit tagesthema we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the wartburg -lrb- schlossberg 2 -rrb- , perched high on a 1230-foot cliff overlooking eisenach , is one of germany 's most famous and well-preserved castles .
it was founded by duke ludwig of thuringia in 1067 .
like all other places connected with luther , it was declared a unesco world heritage site in 1997 .
the entire castle underwent a comprehensive renovation carried out by the east german government between 1952-1966 .
this included work on the room where luther lived for 300 days disguised as junker jörg .
the original floor and paneled walls have been retained and a wooden desk also dates from the lutheran era .
names and dates etched into the stone walls bear witness to the fact that the castle has been visited by christian pilgrims since the end of the 16th century .
most of luther 's time at wartburg castle was spent in quiet study , and it was here that he set about translating the new testament from its original greek into german .
with the publication of the new testament in september 1522 , luther laid the foundations for the german language as we know it today .
the style he adopted was highly descriptive and reflected common language usage , thereby making the texts accessible to all .
in the early 1530s , luther devoted himself to translating the old testament , leading to the publication of the first complete german edition of the bible in august 1534 .
as though completing the circle of his life , luther returned to eisleben , the town of his birth , in january 1546 .
on 17 february , luther complained of serious chest pain and took to his bed .
alarmed , his friends and children gathered around him .
asked by his friend , the court preacher justus jonas : " reverend father , will you stand firm in christ and the doctrine you have preached ? "
luther responded with a clearly audible : " yes " .
it was to be his dying word .

two memorial services were held at st. andrew 's church -lrb- sanktandreasplatz -rrb- in eisleben .
in the afternoon of 20 february , the entourage accompanying luther 's body began its journey to wittenberg , arriving two days later .
luther 's body was interred in the castle church , in front of the pulpit .
in 1894 , the house where luther died in eisleben was declared an official memorial site .
erfurt less than 65 kilometers away , erfurt can be easily reached in just half an hour by car .
today , some 200,000 people live in the attractive capital of the state of thuringia .
it boasts one of the best-preserved medieval city centers in germany and is especially proud of its landmark krämer bridge - the longest house bridge in europe , complete with 32 residences .

-lrb- ap photo / jens meyer -rrb- - zu unserem korr - often cited as his spiritual home , martin luther moved here in 1501 , when erfurt was the sixth largest town in germany .
he lived in the town 's augustinian monastery -lrb- augustinerstrasse 10 -rrb- , now one of the most important destinations on the lutheran trail , and began his studies at the university , graduating in 1505 .
in 1507 , luther was ordained as a priest here .
today , luther 's quarters in the monastery have been reconstructed to create a sense of what daily life must have been like in this strict monastic order .
the monastery is also an architectural monument to medieval religious architecture , situated right in the old town of erfurt .
badly destroyed during world war ii , it was rebuilt in 1982 as part of celebrations marking the 500th birthday of martin luther .

2003 - marktplatz von der lutherstadt wittenberg in sachsen-anhalt some 200 kilometers away from erfurt lies wittenberg , the final destination on the luther tour .
luther spent 36 years of his life here – and the town is a treasure trove for luther pilgrims .
as a 25-year-old priest , luther was inducted as teacher at wittenberg university in 1508 .
the small town on the banks of the river elbe had just 2,000 inhabitants , and the pace of life was slow .
luther was said to have described it as town " on the edge of civilization " .
the priest lived with augustinian hermits , and today , visitors to wittenberg can explore his quarters , maintained in their original form , at the luther house , luther memorial foundation of saxony-anhalt .
the museum also houses the world 's largest collection of documents charting the history of the reformation , with more than 10,000 prints , 6,000 manuscripts , thousands of portraits of luther , 2,000 coins and medallions as well as 14,000 graphics .
the museum authorities completed a comprehensive restoration of these historic pieces , and a permanent exhibition opened in march , 2003 .
reformation begins in wittenberg it was during his years in wittenberg that luther made a name for himself as a reformer .
during a visit to rome in 1510 , the theologian was appalled by what he perceived as a corrupt catholic church .
a system to raise badly-needed funds for the rebuilding of st. peter 's , which involved papal emissaries selling indulgences , was being grossly abused .
in october 1517 , luther drew up a list of 95 theses questioning the right of the pope to forgive sins .
when he nailed the document to the door of the palace church -lrb- schlossplatz -rrb- in wittenberg , his actions caused ripples in rome , and he was summoned for an audience with pope leo x. the event heralded the beginning of the protestant reformation in germany - and ultimately , protestantism in general .
today the palace church is wittenberg 's main attraction for luther pilgrims .
luther continued to challenge the papacy .
in 1520 , he published his famous address " an den christlichen adel deutscher nation " -lrb- address to the christian nobility of the german nation -rrb- , followed by the treatise " de captivitate babylonica ecclesiae praeludium " -lrb- a prelude concerning the babylonian captivity of the church -rrb- , which also attacked the doctrinal system of the church of rome .
on december 10 of the same year , luther burned the papal bull issued against him before a gathering of doctors , students , and citizens in wittenberg , on a spot marked today by the legendary " lutheran oak " -lrb- located at the intersection of lutherstrasse and collegienstrasse -rrb- .
in 1522 , luther gave his first sermons in german at the church of st. marien -lrb- kirchplatz -rrb- in wittenberg .
the most remarkable work of art in this , the oldest building in wittenberg , is the cycle of paintings on the reformation altar by lucas cranach the elder , dedicated in 1547 .
the group on the right-hand side of the main panel refers to luther ' communion teachings and shows luther taking his place among the apostles at the last supper .
wittenberg is also home to one of germany 's most beautiful renaissance town halls , situated on the market square and flanked by a striking luther memorial .
originally planned for eisleben , the town of luther 's birth and death , it was brought to wittenberg on the orders of the prussian king friedrich wilhelm iii .
perhaps one of the most significant of the many artistic tributes to luther in germany , the memorial is the work of the berlin sculptor gottfried schadow , while the neo-gothic dais was designed by karl friedrich schinkel .
lucas cranach the elder , a friend of luther 's , was an artist whose paintings and graphics gave strong impetus to the reformation movement .
he also served as mayor here from 1537 to 1544 , as well as running the town 's apothecary - which still stands to this day - a book shop and a flourishing studio , which helped make wittenberg an important center for various artistic activities in germany .
still a controversial figure although there are over 70 million followers of the lutheran church worldwide , dr. martin luther remains a controversial figure .
initially a supporter of the jews , he became frustrated by their unwillingness to embrace his own religion , and emerged as one of the most bitter anti-semites in history .
in his writings , he described jews as poisoners , ritual murderers and parasites , preaching that they were worse than devils , that their synagogues should be burned to the ground and that they should be expelled from germany .
his detractors may argue that luther helped set the stage for the holocaust .
but for others , luthers was a spiritual genius , a man with a remarkable ability to inspire others with his passion and dedication to the christian faith . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links luther pilgrimages a guide to the official luther pilgrimage itinerary routes to luther further tips for tours of luther landmarks unesco world heritage sites unesco world heritage sites in eastern germany martin luther comprehensive information on martin luther 9799 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

through his work translating the bible , luther is also credited with reforming the german language , helping mold the modern usage that prevails today .
the main landmarks in a luther pilgrimage can be explored in a whistle-stop , three-day tour of lutherland .
please note : the tour has been organized by geographical rather than the chronology of luther 's life .
day one - eisleben martin luther was born on november 10 , 1483 , in eisleben , a town in the foothills of the harz mountains , in the eastern part of saxony-anhalt .
his birthplace , a simple but smart building now numbered 15 , stands in a street named after the man himself -lrb- entrance at seminarstrasse 16 -rrb- .
his father hans luther , who worked in the copper mines , and his mother margarethe , baptized baby martin in eisleben 's late gothic church of st. peter and paul - now another must-see destination on the luther tour .
the population of eisleben was then nearly 4,000 , and the town flourished thanks to the local silver and copper mining industry .
today , the population numbers some 20,000 , but people are moving away in droves .
unemployment is rife and young people have little choice but to seek work elsewhere .
but for fans of martin luther , the town is well worth a visit .
the house where the revolutionary reformer was born has been revered as a memorial site since 1693 , making it the oldest museum in germany .
to preserve luther 's memory , the town was bestowed with the epithet " lutherstadt " in 1946 .
in 1997 , the luther memorial sites were declared unesco world heritage sites .
day two - eisenach continuing in luther ’ s footsteps , travel on to eisenach , just under 150 kilometers away and less than a two-hour drive .

a few footsteps away from the house is the church of st. george , where luther earned extra money by singing in the choir .
a silent witness to this time is the font upon which johann sebastian bach , who was born in eisenach , was baptized in 1685 .

friedrich believed that allowing the reformer to live incognito at his castle would serve to calm feverish anti-reformation activity .
the wartburg -lrb- schlossberg 2 -rrb- , perched high on a 1230-foot cliff overlooking eisenach , is one of germany 's most famous and well-preserved castles .
it was founded by duke ludwig of thuringia in 1067 .
like all other places connected with luther , it was declared a unesco world heritage site in 1997 .
the entire castle underwent a comprehensive renovation carried out by the east german government between 1952-1966 .
this included work on the room where luther lived for 300 days disguised as junker jörg .
the original floor and paneled walls have been retained and a wooden desk also dates from the lutheran era .
names and dates etched into the stone walls bear witness to the fact that the castle has been visited by christian pilgrims since the end of the 16th century .
most of luther 's time at wartburg castle was spent in quiet study , and it was here that he set about translating the new testament from its original greek into german .
with the publication of the new testament in september 1522 , luther laid the foundations for the german language as we know it today .
the style he adopted was highly descriptive and reflected common language usage , thereby making the texts accessible to all .
in the early 1530s , luther devoted himself to translating the old testament , leading to the publication of the first complete german edition of the bible in august 1534 .
as though completing the circle of his life , luther returned to eisleben , the town of his birth , in january 1546 .
on 17 february , luther complained of serious chest pain and took to his bed .
alarmed , his friends and children gathered around him .
asked by his friend , the court preacher justus jonas : " reverend father , will you stand firm in christ and the doctrine you have preached ? "
luther responded with a clearly audible : " yes " .
it was to be his dying word .

two memorial services were held at st. andrew 's church -lrb- sanktandreasplatz -rrb- in eisleben .
in the afternoon of 20 february , the entourage accompanying luther 's body began its journey to wittenberg , arriving two days later .
luther 's body was interred in the castle church , in front of the pulpit .
in 1894 , the house where luther died in eisleben was declared an official memorial site .
erfurt less than 65 kilometers away , erfurt can be easily reached in just half an hour by car .
today , some 200,000 people live in the attractive capital of the state of thuringia .
it boasts one of the best-preserved medieval city centers in germany and is especially proud of its landmark krämer bridge - the longest house bridge in europe , complete with 32 residences .

-lrb- ap photo / jens meyer -rrb- - zu unserem korr - often cited as his spiritual home , martin luther moved here in 1501 , when erfurt was the sixth largest town in germany .
he lived in the town 's augustinian monastery -lrb- augustinerstrasse 10 -rrb- , now one of the most important destinations on the lutheran trail , and began his studies at the university , graduating in 1505 .
in 1507 , luther was ordained as a priest here .
today , luther 's quarters in the monastery have been reconstructed to create a sense of what daily life must have been like in this strict monastic order .
the monastery is also an architectural monument to medieval religious architecture , situated right in the old town of erfurt .
badly destroyed during world war ii , it was rebuilt in 1982 as part of celebrations marking the 500th birthday of martin luther .

2003 - marktplatz von der lutherstadt wittenberg in sachsen-anhalt some 200 kilometers away from erfurt lies wittenberg , the final destination on the luther tour .
luther spent 36 years of his life here – and the town is a treasure trove for luther pilgrims .
as a 25-year-old priest , luther was inducted as teacher at wittenberg university in 1508 .
the small town on the banks of the river elbe had just 2,000 inhabitants , and the pace of life was slow .
luther was said to have described it as town " on the edge of civilization " .
the priest lived with augustinian hermits , and today , visitors to wittenberg can explore his quarters , maintained in their original form , at the luther house , luther memorial foundation of saxony-anhalt .
the museum also houses the world 's largest collection of documents charting the history of the reformation , with more than 10,000 prints , 6,000 manuscripts , thousands of portraits of luther , 2,000 coins and medallions as well as 14,000 graphics .
the museum authorities completed a comprehensive restoration of these historic pieces , and a permanent exhibition opened in march , 2003 .
reformation begins in wittenberg it was during his years in wittenberg that luther made a name for himself as a reformer .
during a visit to rome in 1510 , the theologian was appalled by what he perceived as a corrupt catholic church .
a system to raise badly-needed funds for the rebuilding of st. peter 's , which involved papal emissaries selling indulgences , was being grossly abused .
in october 1517 , luther drew up a list of 95 theses questioning the right of the pope to forgive sins .
when he nailed the document to the door of the palace church -lrb- schlossplatz -rrb- in wittenberg , his actions caused ripples in rome , and he was summoned for an audience with pope leo x. the event heralded the beginning of the protestant reformation in germany - and ultimately , protestantism in general .
today the palace church is wittenberg 's main attraction for luther pilgrims .
luther continued to challenge the papacy .
in 1520 , he published his famous address " an den christlichen adel deutscher nation " -lrb- address to the christian nobility of the german nation -rrb- , followed by the treatise " de captivitate babylonica ecclesiae praeludium " -lrb- a prelude concerning the babylonian captivity of the church -rrb- , which also attacked the doctrinal system of the church of rome .
on december 10 of the same year , luther burned the papal bull issued against him before a gathering of doctors , students , and citizens in wittenberg , on a spot marked today by the legendary " lutheran oak " -lrb- located at the intersection of lutherstrasse and collegienstrasse -rrb- .
in 1522 , luther gave his first sermons in german at the church of st. marien -lrb- kirchplatz -rrb- in wittenberg .
the most remarkable work of art in this , the oldest building in wittenberg , is the cycle of paintings on the reformation altar by lucas cranach the elder , dedicated in 1547 .
the group on the right-hand side of the main panel refers to luther ' communion teachings and shows luther taking his place among the apostles at the last supper .
wittenberg is also home to one of germany 's most beautiful renaissance town halls , situated on the market square and flanked by a striking luther memorial .
originally planned for eisleben , the town of luther 's birth and death , it was brought to wittenberg on the orders of the prussian king friedrich wilhelm iii .
perhaps one of the most significant of the many artistic tributes to luther in germany , the memorial is the work of the berlin sculptor gottfried schadow , while the neo-gothic dais was designed by karl friedrich schinkel .
lucas cranach the elder , a friend of luther 's , was an artist whose paintings and graphics gave strong impetus to the reformation movement .
he also served as mayor here from 1537 to 1544 , as well as running the town 's apothecary - which still stands to this day - a book shop and a flourishing studio , which helped make wittenberg an important center for various artistic activities in germany .
still a controversial figure although there are over 70 million followers of the lutheran church worldwide , dr. martin luther remains a controversial figure .
initially a supporter of the jews , he became frustrated by their unwillingness to embrace his own religion , and emerged as one of the most bitter anti-semites in history .
in his writings , he described jews as poisoners , ritual murderers and parasites , preaching that they were worse than devils , that their synagogues should be burned to the ground and that they should be expelled from germany .
his detractors may argue that luther helped set the stage for the holocaust .
but for others , luthers was a spiritual genius , a man with a remarkable ability to inspire others with his passion and dedication to the christian faith . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links luther pilgrimages a guide to the official luther pilgrimage itinerary routes to luther further tips for tours of luther landmarks unesco world heritage sites unesco world heritage sites in eastern germany martin luther comprehensive information on martin luther 9799 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

berlusconi fired back by calling his critics " tourists " in parliamentary democracy and compared one of his most vociferous detractors to a concentration camp guard .
for weeks , martin schulz , a social democratic party member of the european parliament from germany , has served as an outspoken critic of berlusconi , pointing his finger at the italian ’ s personal legal troubles and major media investments as a serious conflict of interest .
he has n't minced words in his policy critiques , either , lambasting berlusconi for recent remarks by his reforms minister that italy 's navy should be able to fire on boats filled with illegal immigrants to keep them from landing on italian shores .

the remarks so outraged the german government that it ordered the italian ambassador in berlin to the office of chancellor gerhard schröder .

"
in a highly defensive appearance before the european parliament on wednesday , italy 's prime minister alienated many with his nazi jokes .
but he did lay out a solid plan for his country 's leadership of the eu . his detractors have made no secret of their fears that italian prime minister silvio berlusconi would tarnish the office of the rotating european union presidency with his scandal-plagued leadership and questionable business dealings .
indeed , as he laid out his roadmap for italy 's six-month term at the helm of europe on wednesday , he held true to all expectations .
berlusconi presented his political platforms to the european parliament in strasbourg amid boos , jeers and protests .
one green parliamentarian compared his political ways to those of atila the hun , who ravaged europe during the 5th century .
berlusconi fired back by calling his critics " tourists " in parliamentary democracy and compared one of his most vociferous detractors to a concentration camp guard .
for weeks , martin schulz , a social democratic party member of the european parliament from germany , has served as an outspoken critic of berlusconi , pointing his finger at the italian ’ s personal legal troubles and major media investments as a serious conflict of interest .
he has n't minced words in his policy critiques , either , lambasting berlusconi for recent remarks by his reforms minister that italy 's navy should be able to fire on boats filled with illegal immigrants to keep them from landing on italian shores .
the greens , too , were hardly welcoming of the new eu president when he took to the podium wednesday as they held up signs with slogans like " everyone is equal before the law , " and " no godfather for europe . "
at one point it become too much for berlusconi .
" mr. schulz , " berlusconi quipped , " i know there is in italy a man producing a film on the nazi concentration camps .
i would like to suggest you for the role of kapo .
you 'd be perfect . "
-lrb- kapo is a reference to prisoners selected by the ss to serve as guards and complete menial jobs ; they were given favorable treatment over other prisoners and were considered traitors by many . -rrb-
later , when asked if he wanted the remark to be stricken from the record by european parliament president pat cox , berlusconi refused .
the remarks so outraged the german government that it ordered the italian ambassador in berlin to the office of chancellor gerhard schröder .
members of parliament were no less outraged , and the session was suspended afterwards .
in response to berlusconi 's attack , schulz said : " my respect for the victims of fascism will not permit me to deal with that kind of claim .
but it is very hard for me accept that a politician should be exercising the role of president of the european council if he comes out with this kind of statement when he encounters the slightest contradiction . "
berlusconi later explained that his comments were intended as an " ironic joke " and refused to apologize .
seeking to put out the wildfire on wednesday afternoon , berlusconi went a step further , but still fell short of apologizing when he told eu politicians meeting behind closed doors he " did not mean to offend the feelings of a country , feelings that have a historical motivation . "
but graham watson , the leader of the liberal democratic group in the european parliament , said berlusconi 's remarks " debase the presidency of the council and offend europe . "
a roadmap for italy 's eu presidency the bitter exchange distracted attention from the real message berlusconi came to deliver on wednesday – how italy planned to steer the eu during its term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi berlusconi -lrb- photo -rrb- said his country wanted to create a " new dynamic " in the transatlantic relationship and to push ahead with eastward expansion , calling for bulgaria and romania to be given a clear path in order to facilitate their eu membership by 2007 .
the italian prime minister also called for a " new deal " style increase in public infrastructure investment in order to stimulate economic growth – largely through rail and other public transport projects .
but he said countries should find a way to invest in infrastructure projects without resorting to stability pact-busting deficit spending .
but berlusconi ’ s major task for the next six months is to conduct negotiations after the start of an intergovernmental conference in october that will hammer out the final draft of the eu 's first constitution .
berlusconi would like to see approval of the constitution at a december summit in rome , the site where the 1957 treaty establishing the european community was signed .
highlighting the importance of europe ’ s role in the middle east , berlusconi said brussels should push along the " road map " to peace between the israelis and palestinians and contribute to the reconstruction effort in iraq in order to bring the two continents closer .
addressing recent problems with illegal immigrants entering europe from northern africa , hundreds of whom have perished in accidents on rickety boats , berlusconi called for the creation of an eu border patrol to guard its external borders as well as immigrant holding centers outside the eu .
italian officials believe that last month alone at least 3,000 illegal northern african immigrants landed on italian shores .
now , they want brussels to take action .

an earnest project aided by marketing and branding experts is underway in london to jazz up germany ’ s humorless and stereotypically staid image in great britain as reflected in a recent survey . it ’ s no secret that germany ’ s image in britain is in bad shape .
whether it ’ s the tabloids taking a gibe with headlines like " herr we go – bring on the krauts " or " let ’ s blitz fritz " when england was pitted against germany in the 1996 european soccer championships , weekly television documentaries on hitler and concentration camps or papers such as the independent concluding recently that books with swastikas gracing the cover are guaranteed to be bestsellers , the british are still fed cliché-heavy doses of germany ’ s past .
the only other strong connection most british citizens have to the germans are parked in their garages : german cars have a brilliant reputation and reinforce the image of their makers as being reliable , punctual and efficient .
clueless about modern germany little wonder then that a recent survey conducted by the goethe institut , the german language and cultural center , and the british council turned out such negative results .
the poll , which quizzed young people between 16 and 25 years on their picture of modern germany , drew up mostly question marks .
although 37 percent of the british displayed a positive stance towards germany , they could only come up with beer and sport as the two things they identified with the country .
another 17 percent said they didn ’ t like germany and cited its military past , far-right tendencies and the apparent lack of manners and humor of the germans as reasons .
an astonishing 64 percent couldn ’ t name a single living famous german personality -lrb- supermodel claudia schiffer was mentioned a few times -rrb- .
another larger survey conducted for the goethe institut last year concluded that more than half the british population – 52 percent – said they didn ’ t have a clue about modern day germany .
more than hitler and nazi past alarmed by the unpopularity of its country and the widespread ignorance about it in britain , the goethe institut in london launched a campaign last year in british schools to promote itself as a fun-loving , cool nation .

" people just do not know about the other side , the more contemporary germany , the hedonistic side , the traveling spirit of the germans . "
cool britannia german style sacker now wants to bring contemporary germany to a larger british audience .
the goethe institut london has teamed up with a host of other organizations promoting german-british relations and founded a new initiative " creative capital foundation " to shape a new modern image of germany .
to start with , the foundation invited a slew of british travel journalists to the goethe institut earlier this week to expand their minds on the charms of the western german state of north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- along the river rhine .
" tourism is an important part of the process , the british usually never travel to germany , but prefer to go south , " dr. sacker explains .
" berlin was a focus last year , this time it ’ s nrw , and in 2005 it ’ ll be saxony , " sacker adds .
the foundation also organized a " british-german media bash " this week where german and british journalists , marketing and branding experts , thrashed out the role that politics , celebrities , media and advertising could play in spiking up germany ’ s dull image .
make love not war sacker opened the day-long seminar by showing two photographs of berlin ’ s famous victory column .
one from 1945 showed the monument surrounded by tanks and ruins , the other from the 1990s showed dancing revelers at the annual love parade , the world ’ s largest techno party .
" the british only know the war picture , " sacker was quoted in the berliner zeitung .
" but they should get to know the berlin of love , " he added .
sacker described the initiative - modeled along the lines of cool britannia , a campaign promoted by tony blair in the 1990s to liven up britain ’ s stuffy image from an old-fashioned nation of tweed- jacket-wearers to britpop and britart – as a " brainstorming session . "
" there were some interesting suggestions , but we ’ ve decided not to market germany as a brand .
it would only reduce the strong image that already exists about the country , " he says .
" instead we ’ re going to focus on adding interesting facets and snippets like the love parade , contemporary fashion , cuisine and karneval – that ’ s the only way to get the british interested . "
there ’ s no time frame as yet for when all the recommendations and brainstorming for spiffing up germany ’ s reputation will translate into action .

but sacker says " the important thing is that none of the end projects will have a moral finger teaching the british about germany .

"
in a highly defensive appearance before the european parliament on wednesday , italy 's prime minister alienated many with his nazi jokes .
but he did lay out a solid plan for his country 's leadership of the eu . his detractors have made no secret of their fears that italian prime minister silvio berlusconi would tarnish the office of the rotating european union presidency with his scandal-plagued leadership and questionable business dealings .
indeed , as he laid out his roadmap for italy 's six-month term at the helm of europe on wednesday , he held true to all expectations .
berlusconi presented his political platforms to the european parliament in strasbourg amid boos , jeers and protests .
one green parliamentarian compared his political ways to those of atila the hun , who ravaged europe during the 5th century .
berlusconi fired back by calling his critics " tourists " in parliamentary democracy and compared one of his most vociferous detractors to a concentration camp guard .
for weeks , martin schulz , a social democratic party member of the european parliament from germany , has served as an outspoken critic of berlusconi , pointing his finger at the italian ’ s personal legal troubles and major media investments as a serious conflict of interest .
he has n't minced words in his policy critiques , either , lambasting berlusconi for recent remarks by his reforms minister that italy 's navy should be able to fire on boats filled with illegal immigrants to keep them from landing on italian shores .
the greens , too , were hardly welcoming of the new eu president when he took to the podium wednesday as they held up signs with slogans like " everyone is equal before the law , " and " no godfather for europe . "
at one point it become too much for berlusconi .
" mr. schulz , " berlusconi quipped , " i know there is in italy a man producing a film on the nazi concentration camps .
i would like to suggest you for the role of kapo .
you 'd be perfect . "
-lrb- kapo is a reference to prisoners selected by the ss to serve as guards and complete menial jobs ; they were given favorable treatment over other prisoners and were considered traitors by many . -rrb-
later , when asked if he wanted the remark to be stricken from the record by european parliament president pat cox , berlusconi refused .
the remarks so outraged the german government that it ordered the italian ambassador in berlin to the office of chancellor gerhard schröder .
members of parliament were no less outraged , and the session was suspended afterwards .
in response to berlusconi 's attack , schulz said : " my respect for the victims of fascism will not permit me to deal with that kind of claim .
but it is very hard for me accept that a politician should be exercising the role of president of the european council if he comes out with this kind of statement when he encounters the slightest contradiction . "
berlusconi later explained that his comments were intended as an " ironic joke " and refused to apologize .
seeking to put out the wildfire on wednesday afternoon , berlusconi went a step further , but still fell short of apologizing when he told eu politicians meeting behind closed doors he " did not mean to offend the feelings of a country , feelings that have a historical motivation . "
but graham watson , the leader of the liberal democratic group in the european parliament , said berlusconi 's remarks " debase the presidency of the council and offend europe . "
a roadmap for italy 's eu presidency the bitter exchange distracted attention from the real message berlusconi came to deliver on wednesday – how italy planned to steer the eu during its term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi berlusconi -lrb- photo -rrb- said his country wanted to create a " new dynamic " in the transatlantic relationship and to push ahead with eastward expansion , calling for bulgaria and romania to be given a clear path in order to facilitate their eu membership by 2007 .
the italian prime minister also called for a " new deal " style increase in public infrastructure investment in order to stimulate economic growth – largely through rail and other public transport projects .
but he said countries should find a way to invest in infrastructure projects without resorting to stability pact-busting deficit spending .
but berlusconi ’ s major task for the next six months is to conduct negotiations after the start of an intergovernmental conference in october that will hammer out the final draft of the eu 's first constitution .
berlusconi would like to see approval of the constitution at a december summit in rome , the site where the 1957 treaty establishing the european community was signed .
highlighting the importance of europe ’ s role in the middle east , berlusconi said brussels should push along the " road map " to peace between the israelis and palestinians and contribute to the reconstruction effort in iraq in order to bring the two continents closer .
addressing recent problems with illegal immigrants entering europe from northern africa , hundreds of whom have perished in accidents on rickety boats , berlusconi called for the creation of an eu border patrol to guard its external borders as well as immigrant holding centers outside the eu .
italian officials believe that last month alone at least 3,000 illegal northern african immigrants landed on italian shores .
now , they want brussels to take action .
with strapped social systems across the union and a graying population , berlusconi also called for eu-wide measures " aimed at increasing the activity level of older workers and reducing trends toward pre-retirement " that strain federal pocketbooks .
among those measures would be a common eu approach to retirement systems . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the eu presidency according to silvio his party changed the law to to make him immune from prosecution and his criminal case was dropped .
now silvio berlusconi is at the helm of europe and some fear scandal will overshadow his term as eu president .

"
in a highly defensive appearance before the european parliament on wednesday , italy 's prime minister alienated many with his nazi jokes .
but he did lay out a solid plan for his country 's leadership of the eu . his detractors have made no secret of their fears that italian prime minister silvio berlusconi would tarnish the office of the rotating european union presidency with his scandal-plagued leadership and questionable business dealings .
indeed , as he laid out his roadmap for italy 's six-month term at the helm of europe on wednesday , he held true to all expectations .
berlusconi presented his political platforms to the european parliament in strasbourg amid boos , jeers and protests .
one green parliamentarian compared his political ways to those of atila the hun , who ravaged europe during the 5th century .
berlusconi fired back by calling his critics " tourists " in parliamentary democracy and compared one of his most vociferous detractors to a concentration camp guard .
for weeks , martin schulz , a social democratic party member of the european parliament from germany , has served as an outspoken critic of berlusconi , pointing his finger at the italian ’ s personal legal troubles and major media investments as a serious conflict of interest .
he has n't minced words in his policy critiques , either , lambasting berlusconi for recent remarks by his reforms minister that italy 's navy should be able to fire on boats filled with illegal immigrants to keep them from landing on italian shores .
the greens , too , were hardly welcoming of the new eu president when he took to the podium wednesday as they held up signs with slogans like " everyone is equal before the law , " and " no godfather for europe . "
at one point it become too much for berlusconi .
" mr. schulz , " berlusconi quipped , " i know there is in italy a man producing a film on the nazi concentration camps .
i would like to suggest you for the role of kapo .
you 'd be perfect . "
-lrb- kapo is a reference to prisoners selected by the ss to serve as guards and complete menial jobs ; they were given favorable treatment over other prisoners and were considered traitors by many . -rrb-
later , when asked if he wanted the remark to be stricken from the record by european parliament president pat cox , berlusconi refused .
the remarks so outraged the german government that it ordered the italian ambassador in berlin to the office of chancellor gerhard schröder .
members of parliament were no less outraged , and the session was suspended afterwards .
in response to berlusconi 's attack , schulz said : " my respect for the victims of fascism will not permit me to deal with that kind of claim .
but it is very hard for me accept that a politician should be exercising the role of president of the european council if he comes out with this kind of statement when he encounters the slightest contradiction . "
berlusconi later explained that his comments were intended as an " ironic joke " and refused to apologize .
seeking to put out the wildfire on wednesday afternoon , berlusconi went a step further , but still fell short of apologizing when he told eu politicians meeting behind closed doors he " did not mean to offend the feelings of a country , feelings that have a historical motivation . "
but graham watson , the leader of the liberal democratic group in the european parliament , said berlusconi 's remarks " debase the presidency of the council and offend europe . "
a roadmap for italy 's eu presidency the bitter exchange distracted attention from the real message berlusconi came to deliver on wednesday – how italy planned to steer the eu during its term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi berlusconi -lrb- photo -rrb- said his country wanted to create a " new dynamic " in the transatlantic relationship and to push ahead with eastward expansion , calling for bulgaria and romania to be given a clear path in order to facilitate their eu membership by 2007 .
the italian prime minister also called for a " new deal " style increase in public infrastructure investment in order to stimulate economic growth – largely through rail and other public transport projects .
but he said countries should find a way to invest in infrastructure projects without resorting to stability pact-busting deficit spending .
but berlusconi ’ s major task for the next six months is to conduct negotiations after the start of an intergovernmental conference in october that will hammer out the final draft of the eu 's first constitution .
berlusconi would like to see approval of the constitution at a december summit in rome , the site where the 1957 treaty establishing the european community was signed .
highlighting the importance of europe ’ s role in the middle east , berlusconi said brussels should push along the " road map " to peace between the israelis and palestinians and contribute to the reconstruction effort in iraq in order to bring the two continents closer .
addressing recent problems with illegal immigrants entering europe from northern africa , hundreds of whom have perished in accidents on rickety boats , berlusconi called for the creation of an eu border patrol to guard its external borders as well as immigrant holding centers outside the eu .
italian officials believe that last month alone at least 3,000 illegal northern african immigrants landed on italian shores .
now , they want brussels to take action .
with strapped social systems across the union and a graying population , berlusconi also called for eu-wide measures " aimed at increasing the activity level of older workers and reducing trends toward pre-retirement " that strain federal pocketbooks .
among those measures would be a common eu approach to retirement systems . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the eu presidency according to silvio his party changed the law to to make him immune from prosecution and his criminal case was dropped .
now silvio berlusconi is at the helm of europe and some fear scandal will overshadow his term as eu president .

through his work translating the bible , luther is also credited with reforming the german language , helping mold the modern usage that prevails today .
the main landmarks in a luther pilgrimage can be explored in a whistle-stop , three-day tour of lutherland .
please note : the tour has been organized by geographical rather than the chronology of luther 's life .
day one - eisleben martin luther was born on november 10 , 1483 , in eisleben , a town in the foothills of the harz mountains , in the eastern part of saxony-anhalt .
his birthplace , a simple but smart building now numbered 15 , stands in a street named after the man himself -lrb- entrance at seminarstrasse 16 -rrb- .
his father hans luther , who worked in the copper mines , and his mother margarethe , baptized baby martin in eisleben 's late gothic church of st. peter and paul - now another must-see destination on the luther tour .
the population of eisleben was then nearly 4,000 , and the town flourished thanks to the local silver and copper mining industry .
today , the population numbers some 20,000 , but people are moving away in droves .
unemployment is rife and young people have little choice but to seek work elsewhere .
but for fans of martin luther , the town is well worth a visit .
the house where the revolutionary reformer was born has been revered as a memorial site since 1693 , making it the oldest museum in germany .
to preserve luther 's memory , the town was bestowed with the epithet " lutherstadt " in 1946 .
in 1997 , the luther memorial sites were declared unesco world heritage sites .
day two - eisenach continuing in luther ’ s footsteps , travel on to eisenach , just under 150 kilometers away and less than a two-hour drive .
traditionally , the picturesque town on the northern edge of the thuringian forest was staunchly religious and was sarcastically described by luther as a " nest of priests . "
in the 15th century , one in ten of the town 's 4,000 inhabitants was involved in religion , and the town had no less than three churches and seven monasteries .
the young luther came here in 1498 to study at the prestigious latin school , now known as the martin-luther-gymnasium on the predigerplatz , or " preacher 's square . "
the " lutherhaus " -lrb- lutherplatz 8 -rrb- overlooking eisenach 's market square gives visitors a chance to explore luther 's life and work .
one highlight of the exhibition is the " lutherstuben " - two small rooms where the reformer is believed to have lived as a pupil until 1501 .
a few footsteps away from the house is the church of st. george , where luther earned extra money by singing in the choir .
a silent witness to this time is the font upon which johann sebastian bach , who was born in eisenach , was baptized in 1685 .
the reformer had fond memories of his four years in eisenach , which he later referred to as " my dear town . "
the town itself remembers and honors luther with a large memorial on the karlsplatz .
wartburg castle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wartburg castle in eisenach the next port-of-call on the luther trail literally looms over eisenach - wartburg castle , where the theologian spent his final , solitary years .
but before heading up to the imposing fortress , take a short detour to the village of steinach , nestled in a picturesque valley .
here , a large memorial has been erected recalling the detention of luther after he refused to retract publicly his teachings even when faced with a ban by the emperor of the holy roman empire at the diet of worms .
the inscription reads : " here marks the spot where dr. martin luther was taken away to wartburg castle upon the orders of friedrich the wise , elector of saxony . "
in fact , the powerful elector had been acting to protect luther .
friedrich believed that allowing the reformer to live incognito at his castle would serve to calm feverish anti-reformation activity .
the wartburg -lrb- schlossberg 2 -rrb- , perched high on a 1230-foot cliff overlooking eisenach , is one of germany 's most famous and well-preserved castles .
it was founded by duke ludwig of thuringia in 1067 .
like all other places connected with luther , it was declared a unesco world heritage site in 1997 .
the entire castle underwent a comprehensive renovation carried out by the east german government between 1952-1966 .
this included work on the room where luther lived for 300 days disguised as junker jörg .
the original floor and paneled walls have been retained and a wooden desk also dates from the lutheran era .
names and dates etched into the stone walls bear witness to the fact that the castle has been visited by christian pilgrims since the end of the 16th century .
most of luther 's time at wartburg castle was spent in quiet study , and it was here that he set about translating the new testament from its original greek into german .
with the publication of the new testament in september 1522 , luther laid the foundations for the german language as we know it today .
the style he adopted was highly descriptive and reflected common language usage , thereby making the texts accessible to all .
in the early 1530s , luther devoted himself to translating the old testament , leading to the publication of the first complete german edition of the bible in august 1534 .
as though completing the circle of his life , luther returned to eisleben , the town of his birth , in january 1546 .
on 17 february , luther complained of serious chest pain and took to his bed .
alarmed , his friends and children gathered around him .
asked by his friend , the court preacher justus jonas : " reverend father , will you stand firm in christ and the doctrine you have preached ? "
luther responded with a clearly audible : " yes " .
it was to be his dying word .
-lrb- you can visit the house where luther died at andreaskirchplatz 7 . -rrb-
two memorial services were held at st. andrew 's church -lrb- sanktandreasplatz -rrb- in eisleben .
in the afternoon of 20 february , the entourage accompanying luther 's body began its journey to wittenberg , arriving two days later .
luther 's body was interred in the castle church , in front of the pulpit .
in 1894 , the house where luther died in eisleben was declared an official memorial site .
erfurt less than 65 kilometers away , erfurt can be easily reached in just half an hour by car .
today , some 200,000 people live in the attractive capital of the state of thuringia .
it boasts one of the best-preserved medieval city centers in germany and is especially proud of its landmark krämer bridge - the longest house bridge in europe , complete with 32 residences .

sie ist eine der aeltesten und zugleich die juengste der deutschen universitaeten und steht im ruf der reformfreudigkeit .
-lrb- ap photo / jens meyer -rrb- - zu unserem korr - often cited as his spiritual home , martin luther moved here in 1501 , when erfurt was the sixth largest town in germany .
he lived in the town 's augustinian monastery -lrb- augustinerstrasse 10 -rrb- , now one of the most important destinations on the lutheran trail , and began his studies at the university , graduating in 1505 .
in 1507 , luther was ordained as a priest here .
today , luther 's quarters in the monastery have been reconstructed to create a sense of what daily life must have been like in this strict monastic order .
the monastery is also an architectural monument to medieval religious architecture , situated right in the old town of erfurt .
badly destroyed during world war ii , it was rebuilt in 1982 as part of celebrations marking the 500th birthday of martin luther .
day three - wittenberg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutschland heute vom 7 .
2 .
2003 - marktplatz von der lutherstadt wittenberg in sachsen-anhalt some 200 kilometers away from erfurt lies wittenberg , the final destination on the luther tour .
luther spent 36 years of his life here – and the town is a treasure trove for luther pilgrims .
as a 25-year-old priest , luther was inducted as teacher at wittenberg university in 1508 .
the small town on the banks of the river elbe had just 2,000 inhabitants , and the pace of life was slow .
luther was said to have described it as town " on the edge of civilization " .
the priest lived with augustinian hermits , and today , visitors to wittenberg can explore his quarters , maintained in their original form , at the luther house , luther memorial foundation of saxony-anhalt .
the museum also houses the world 's largest collection of documents charting the history of the reformation , with more than 10,000 prints , 6,000 manuscripts , thousands of portraits of luther , 2,000 coins and medallions as well as 14,000 graphics .
the museum authorities completed a comprehensive restoration of these historic pieces , and a permanent exhibition opened in march , 2003 .
reformation begins in wittenberg it was during his years in wittenberg that luther made a name for himself as a reformer .
during a visit to rome in 1510 , the theologian was appalled by what he perceived as a corrupt catholic church .
a system to raise badly-needed funds for the rebuilding of st. peter 's , which involved papal emissaries selling indulgences , was being grossly abused .
in october 1517 , luther drew up a list of 95 theses questioning the right of the pope to forgive sins .
when he nailed the document to the door of the palace church -lrb- schlossplatz -rrb- in wittenberg , his actions caused ripples in rome , and he was summoned for an audience with pope leo x. the event heralded the beginning of the protestant reformation in germany - and ultimately , protestantism in general .
today the palace church is wittenberg 's main attraction for luther pilgrims .
luther continued to challenge the papacy .
in 1520 , he published his famous address " an den christlichen adel deutscher nation " -lrb- address to the christian nobility of the german nation -rrb- , followed by the treatise " de captivitate babylonica ecclesiae praeludium " -lrb- a prelude concerning the babylonian captivity of the church -rrb- , which also attacked the doctrinal system of the church of rome .
on december 10 of the same year , luther burned the papal bull issued against him before a gathering of doctors , students , and citizens in wittenberg , on a spot marked today by the legendary " lutheran oak " -lrb- located at the intersection of lutherstrasse and collegienstrasse -rrb- .
in 1522 , luther gave his first sermons in german at the church of st. marien -lrb- kirchplatz -rrb- in wittenberg .
the most remarkable work of art in this , the oldest building in wittenberg , is the cycle of paintings on the reformation altar by lucas cranach the elder , dedicated in 1547 .
the group on the right-hand side of the main panel refers to luther ' communion teachings and shows luther taking his place among the apostles at the last supper .
wittenberg is also home to one of germany 's most beautiful renaissance town halls , situated on the market square and flanked by a striking luther memorial .
originally planned for eisleben , the town of luther 's birth and death , it was brought to wittenberg on the orders of the prussian king friedrich wilhelm iii .
perhaps one of the most significant of the many artistic tributes to luther in germany , the memorial is the work of the berlin sculptor gottfried schadow , while the neo-gothic dais was designed by karl friedrich schinkel .
lucas cranach the elder , a friend of luther 's , was an artist whose paintings and graphics gave strong impetus to the reformation movement .
he also served as mayor here from 1537 to 1544 , as well as running the town 's apothecary - which still stands to this day - a book shop and a flourishing studio , which helped make wittenberg an important center for various artistic activities in germany .
still a controversial figure although there are over 70 million followers of the lutheran church worldwide , dr. martin luther remains a controversial figure .
initially a supporter of the jews , he became frustrated by their unwillingness to embrace his own religion , and emerged as one of the most bitter anti-semites in history .
in his writings , he described jews as poisoners , ritual murderers and parasites , preaching that they were worse than devils , that their synagogues should be burned to the ground and that they should be expelled from germany .
his detractors may argue that luther helped set the stage for the holocaust .
but for others , luthers was a spiritual genius , a man with a remarkable ability to inspire others with his passion and dedication to the christian faith . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links luther pilgrimages a guide to the official luther pilgrimage itinerary routes to luther further tips for tours of luther landmarks unesco world heritage sites unesco world heritage sites in eastern germany martin luther comprehensive information on martin luther dw-tv europe live euromaxx we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

through his work translating the bible , luther is also credited with reforming the german language , helping mold the modern usage that prevails today .
the main landmarks in a luther pilgrimage can be explored in a whistle-stop , three-day tour of lutherland .
please note : the tour has been organized by geographical rather than the chronology of luther 's life .
day one - eisleben martin luther was born on november 10 , 1483 , in eisleben , a town in the foothills of the harz mountains , in the eastern part of saxony-anhalt .
his birthplace , a simple but smart building now numbered 15 , stands in a street named after the man himself -lrb- entrance at seminarstrasse 16 -rrb- .
his father hans luther , who worked in the copper mines , and his mother margarethe , baptized baby martin in eisleben 's late gothic church of st. peter and paul - now another must-see destination on the luther tour .
the population of eisleben was then nearly 4,000 , and the town flourished thanks to the local silver and copper mining industry .
today , the population numbers some 20,000 , but people are moving away in droves .
unemployment is rife and young people have little choice but to seek work elsewhere .
but for fans of martin luther , the town is well worth a visit .
the house where the revolutionary reformer was born has been revered as a memorial site since 1693 , making it the oldest museum in germany .
to preserve luther 's memory , the town was bestowed with the epithet " lutherstadt " in 1946 .
in 1997 , the luther memorial sites were declared unesco world heritage sites .
day two - eisenach continuing in luther ’ s footsteps , travel on to eisenach , just under 150 kilometers away and less than a two-hour drive .
traditionally , the picturesque town on the northern edge of the thuringian forest was staunchly religious and was sarcastically described by luther as a " nest of priests . "
in the 15th century , one in ten of the town 's 4,000 inhabitants was involved in religion , and the town had no less than three churches and seven monasteries .
the young luther came here in 1498 to study at the prestigious latin school , now known as the martin-luther-gymnasium on the predigerplatz , or " preacher 's square . "
the " lutherhaus " -lrb- lutherplatz 8 -rrb- overlooking eisenach 's market square gives visitors a chance to explore luther 's life and work .
one highlight of the exhibition is the " lutherstuben " - two small rooms where the reformer is believed to have lived as a pupil until 1501 .
a few footsteps away from the house is the church of st. george , where luther earned extra money by singing in the choir .
a silent witness to this time is the font upon which johann sebastian bach , who was born in eisenach , was baptized in 1685 .
the reformer had fond memories of his four years in eisenach , which he later referred to as " my dear town . "
the town itself remembers and honors luther with a large memorial on the karlsplatz .
wartburg castle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wartburg castle in eisenach the next port-of-call on the luther trail literally looms over eisenach - wartburg castle , where the theologian spent his final , solitary years .
but before heading up to the imposing fortress , take a short detour to the village of steinach , nestled in a picturesque valley .
here , a large memorial has been erected recalling the detention of luther after he refused to retract publicly his teachings even when faced with a ban by the emperor of the holy roman empire at the diet of worms .
the inscription reads : " here marks the spot where dr. martin luther was taken away to wartburg castle upon the orders of friedrich the wise , elector of saxony . "
in fact , the powerful elector had been acting to protect luther .
friedrich believed that allowing the reformer to live incognito at his castle would serve to calm feverish anti-reformation activity .
the wartburg -lrb- schlossberg 2 -rrb- , perched high on a 1230-foot cliff overlooking eisenach , is one of germany 's most famous and well-preserved castles .
it was founded by duke ludwig of thuringia in 1067 .
like all other places connected with luther , it was declared a unesco world heritage site in 1997 .
the entire castle underwent a comprehensive renovation carried out by the east german government between 1952-1966 .
this included work on the room where luther lived for 300 days disguised as junker jörg .
the original floor and paneled walls have been retained and a wooden desk also dates from the lutheran era .
names and dates etched into the stone walls bear witness to the fact that the castle has been visited by christian pilgrims since the end of the 16th century .
most of luther 's time at wartburg castle was spent in quiet study , and it was here that he set about translating the new testament from its original greek into german .
with the publication of the new testament in september 1522 , luther laid the foundations for the german language as we know it today .
the style he adopted was highly descriptive and reflected common language usage , thereby making the texts accessible to all .
in the early 1530s , luther devoted himself to translating the old testament , leading to the publication of the first complete german edition of the bible in august 1534 .
as though completing the circle of his life , luther returned to eisleben , the town of his birth , in january 1546 .
on 17 february , luther complained of serious chest pain and took to his bed .
alarmed , his friends and children gathered around him .
asked by his friend , the court preacher justus jonas : " reverend father , will you stand firm in christ and the doctrine you have preached ? "
luther responded with a clearly audible : " yes " .
it was to be his dying word .
-lrb- you can visit the house where luther died at andreaskirchplatz 7 . -rrb-
two memorial services were held at st. andrew 's church -lrb- sanktandreasplatz -rrb- in eisleben .
in the afternoon of 20 february , the entourage accompanying luther 's body began its journey to wittenberg , arriving two days later .
luther 's body was interred in the castle church , in front of the pulpit .
in 1894 , the house where luther died in eisleben was declared an official memorial site .
erfurt less than 65 kilometers away , erfurt can be easily reached in just half an hour by car .
today , some 200,000 people live in the attractive capital of the state of thuringia .
it boasts one of the best-preserved medieval city centers in germany and is especially proud of its landmark krämer bridge - the longest house bridge in europe , complete with 32 residences .

-lrb- ap photo / jens meyer -rrb- - zu unserem korr - often cited as his spiritual home , martin luther moved here in 1501 , when erfurt was the sixth largest town in germany .
he lived in the town 's augustinian monastery -lrb- augustinerstrasse 10 -rrb- , now one of the most important destinations on the lutheran trail , and began his studies at the university , graduating in 1505 .
in 1507 , luther was ordained as a priest here .
today , luther 's quarters in the monastery have been reconstructed to create a sense of what daily life must have been like in this strict monastic order .
the monastery is also an architectural monument to medieval religious architecture , situated right in the old town of erfurt .
badly destroyed during world war ii , it was rebuilt in 1982 as part of celebrations marking the 500th birthday of martin luther .
day three - wittenberg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutschland heute vom 7 .
2 .
2003 - marktplatz von der lutherstadt wittenberg in sachsen-anhalt some 200 kilometers away from erfurt lies wittenberg , the final destination on the luther tour .
luther spent 36 years of his life here – and the town is a treasure trove for luther pilgrims .
as a 25-year-old priest , luther was inducted as teacher at wittenberg university in 1508 .
the small town on the banks of the river elbe had just 2,000 inhabitants , and the pace of life was slow .
luther was said to have described it as town " on the edge of civilization " .
the priest lived with augustinian hermits , and today , visitors to wittenberg can explore his quarters , maintained in their original form , at the luther house , luther memorial foundation of saxony-anhalt .
the museum also houses the world 's largest collection of documents charting the history of the reformation , with more than 10,000 prints , 6,000 manuscripts , thousands of portraits of luther , 2,000 coins and medallions as well as 14,000 graphics .
the museum authorities completed a comprehensive restoration of these historic pieces , and a permanent exhibition opened in march , 2003 .
reformation begins in wittenberg it was during his years in wittenberg that luther made a name for himself as a reformer .
during a visit to rome in 1510 , the theologian was appalled by what he perceived as a corrupt catholic church .
a system to raise badly-needed funds for the rebuilding of st. peter 's , which involved papal emissaries selling indulgences , was being grossly abused .
in october 1517 , luther drew up a list of 95 theses questioning the right of the pope to forgive sins .
when he nailed the document to the door of the palace church -lrb- schlossplatz -rrb- in wittenberg , his actions caused ripples in rome , and he was summoned for an audience with pope leo x. the event heralded the beginning of the protestant reformation in germany - and ultimately , protestantism in general .
today the palace church is wittenberg 's main attraction for luther pilgrims .
luther continued to challenge the papacy .
in 1520 , he published his famous address " an den christlichen adel deutscher nation " -lrb- address to the christian nobility of the german nation -rrb- , followed by the treatise " de captivitate babylonica ecclesiae praeludium " -lrb- a prelude concerning the babylonian captivity of the church -rrb- , which also attacked the doctrinal system of the church of rome .
on december 10 of the same year , luther burned the papal bull issued against him before a gathering of doctors , students , and citizens in wittenberg , on a spot marked today by the legendary " lutheran oak " -lrb- located at the intersection of lutherstrasse and collegienstrasse -rrb- .
in 1522 , luther gave his first sermons in german at the church of st. marien -lrb- kirchplatz -rrb- in wittenberg .
the most remarkable work of art in this , the oldest building in wittenberg , is the cycle of paintings on the reformation altar by lucas cranach the elder , dedicated in 1547 .
the group on the right-hand side of the main panel refers to luther ' communion teachings and shows luther taking his place among the apostles at the last supper .
wittenberg is also home to one of germany 's most beautiful renaissance town halls , situated on the market square and flanked by a striking luther memorial .
originally planned for eisleben , the town of luther 's birth and death , it was brought to wittenberg on the orders of the prussian king friedrich wilhelm iii .
perhaps one of the most significant of the many artistic tributes to luther in germany , the memorial is the work of the berlin sculptor gottfried schadow , while the neo-gothic dais was designed by karl friedrich schinkel .
lucas cranach the elder , a friend of luther 's , was an artist whose paintings and graphics gave strong impetus to the reformation movement .
he also served as mayor here from 1537 to 1544 , as well as running the town 's apothecary - which still stands to this day - a book shop and a flourishing studio , which helped make wittenberg an important center for various artistic activities in germany .
still a controversial figure although there are over 70 million followers of the lutheran church worldwide , dr. martin luther remains a controversial figure .
initially a supporter of the jews , he became frustrated by their unwillingness to embrace his own religion , and emerged as one of the most bitter anti-semites in history .
in his writings , he described jews as poisoners , ritual murderers and parasites , preaching that they were worse than devils , that their synagogues should be burned to the ground and that they should be expelled from germany .
his detractors may argue that luther helped set the stage for the holocaust .
but for others , luthers was a spiritual genius , a man with a remarkable ability to inspire others with his passion and dedication to the christian faith . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links luther pilgrimages a guide to the official luther pilgrimage itinerary routes to luther further tips for tours of luther landmarks unesco world heritage sites unesco world heritage sites in eastern germany martin luther comprehensive information on martin luther dw-tv europe live typisch deutsch we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

"
in a highly defensive appearance before the european parliament on wednesday , italy 's prime minister alienated many with his nazi jokes .
but he did lay out a solid plan for his country 's leadership of the eu . his detractors have made no secret of their fears that italian prime minister silvio berlusconi would tarnish the office of the rotating european union presidency with his scandal-plagued leadership and questionable business dealings .
indeed , as he laid out his roadmap for italy 's six-month term at the helm of europe on wednesday , he held true to all expectations .
berlusconi presented his political platforms to the european parliament in strasbourg amid boos , jeers and protests .
one green parliamentarian compared his political ways to those of atila the hun , who ravaged europe during the 5th century .
berlusconi fired back by calling his critics " tourists " in parliamentary democracy and compared one of his most vociferous detractors to a concentration camp guard .
for weeks , martin schulz , a social democratic party member of the european parliament from germany , has served as an outspoken critic of berlusconi , pointing his finger at the italian ’ s personal legal troubles and major media investments as a serious conflict of interest .
he has n't minced words in his policy critiques , either , lambasting berlusconi for recent remarks by his reforms minister that italy 's navy should be able to fire on boats filled with illegal immigrants to keep them from landing on italian shores .
the greens , too , were hardly welcoming of the new eu president when he took to the podium wednesday as they held up signs with slogans like " everyone is equal before the law , " and " no godfather for europe . "
at one point it become too much for berlusconi .
" mr. schulz , " berlusconi quipped , " i know there is in italy a man producing a film on the nazi concentration camps .
i would like to suggest you for the role of kapo .
you 'd be perfect . "
-lrb- kapo is a reference to prisoners selected by the ss to serve as guards and complete menial jobs ; they were given favorable treatment over other prisoners and were considered traitors by many . -rrb-
later , when asked if he wanted the remark to be stricken from the record by european parliament president pat cox , berlusconi refused .
the remarks so outraged the german government that it ordered the italian ambassador in berlin to the office of chancellor gerhard schröder .
members of parliament were no less outraged , and the session was suspended afterwards .
in response to berlusconi 's attack , schulz said : " my respect for the victims of fascism will not permit me to deal with that kind of claim .
but it is very hard for me accept that a politician should be exercising the role of president of the european council if he comes out with this kind of statement when he encounters the slightest contradiction . "
berlusconi later explained that his comments were intended as an " ironic joke " and refused to apologize .
seeking to put out the wildfire on wednesday afternoon , berlusconi went a step further , but still fell short of apologizing when he told eu politicians meeting behind closed doors he " did not mean to offend the feelings of a country , feelings that have a historical motivation . "

an earnest project aided by marketing and branding experts is underway in london to jazz up germany ’ s humorless and stereotypically staid image in great britain as reflected in a recent survey . it ’ s no secret that germany ’ s image in britain is in bad shape .
whether it ’ s the tabloids taking a gibe with headlines like " herr we go – bring on the krauts " or " let ’ s blitz fritz " when england was pitted against germany in the 1996 european soccer championships , weekly television documentaries on hitler and concentration camps or papers such as the independent concluding recently that books with swastikas gracing the cover are guaranteed to be bestsellers , the british are still fed cliché-heavy doses of germany ’ s past .
the only other strong connection most british citizens have to the germans are parked in their garages : german cars have a brilliant reputation and reinforce the image of their makers as being reliable , punctual and efficient .
clueless about modern germany little wonder then that a recent survey conducted by the goethe institut , the german language and cultural center , and the british council turned out such negative results .
the poll , which quizzed young people between 16 and 25 years on their picture of modern germany , drew up mostly question marks .
although 37 percent of the british displayed a positive stance towards germany , they could only come up with beer and sport as the two things they identified with the country .
another 17 percent said they didn ’ t like germany and cited its military past , far-right tendencies and the apparent lack of manners and humor of the germans as reasons .
an astonishing 64 percent couldn ’ t name a single living famous german personality -lrb- supermodel claudia schiffer was mentioned a few times -rrb- .
another larger survey conducted for the goethe institut last year concluded that more than half the british population – 52 percent – said they didn ’ t have a clue about modern day germany .
more than hitler and nazi past alarmed by the unpopularity of its country and the widespread ignorance about it in britain , the goethe institut in london launched a campaign last year in british schools to promote itself as a fun-loving , cool nation .
" english students think the hitler theme with its smart uniforms and all is sexy , " head of the london goethe institut dr. ulrich sacker told deutsche welle .
" teachers have told me that it ’ s much easier to sell hitler than say environmental consciousness .
but what do you expect ?
every evening there ’ s at least one film on world war ii on british television . "
sacker says there ’ s just no information on german cultural and social life in britain .
" people just do not know about the other side , the more contemporary germany , the hedonistic side , the traveling spirit of the germans . "
cool britannia german style sacker now wants to bring contemporary germany to a larger british audience .
the goethe institut london has teamed up with a host of other organizations promoting german-british relations and founded a new initiative " creative capital foundation " to shape a new modern image of germany .
to start with , the foundation invited a slew of british travel journalists to the goethe institut earlier this week to expand their minds on the charms of the western german state of north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- along the river rhine .
" tourism is an important part of the process , the british usually never travel to germany , but prefer to go south , " dr. sacker explains .
" berlin was a focus last year , this time it ’ s nrw , and in 2005 it ’ ll be saxony , " sacker adds .
the foundation also organized a " british-german media bash " this week where german and british journalists , marketing and branding experts , thrashed out the role that politics , celebrities , media and advertising could play in spiking up germany ’ s dull image .
make love not war sacker opened the day-long seminar by showing two photographs of berlin ’ s famous victory column .
one from 1945 showed the monument surrounded by tanks and ruins , the other from the 1990s showed dancing revelers at the annual love parade , the world ’ s largest techno party .
" the british only know the war picture , " sacker was quoted in the berliner zeitung .
" but they should get to know the berlin of love , " he added .
sacker described the initiative - modeled along the lines of cool britannia , a campaign promoted by tony blair in the 1990s to liven up britain ’ s stuffy image from an old-fashioned nation of tweed- jacket-wearers to britpop and britart – as a " brainstorming session . "
" there were some interesting suggestions , but we ’ ve decided not to market germany as a brand .
it would only reduce the strong image that already exists about the country , " he says .
" instead we ’ re going to focus on adding interesting facets and snippets like the love parade , contemporary fashion , cuisine and karneval – that ’ s the only way to get the british interested . "
there ’ s no time frame as yet for when all the recommendations and brainstorming for spiffing up germany ’ s reputation will translate into action .
there ’ s talk of " strategy " and " high-quality projects . "
but sacker says " the important thing is that none of the end projects will have a moral finger teaching the british about germany .
instead they ’ ll all be infused with humor and irony . "
so watch out britannia , germany is rolling up its sleeves and heading your way with a serious charm offensive . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more fun please , we ’ re german !
in a bid to promote itself as a fun-loving , humorous nation , germany is targetting british schools with a new campaign designed to counter the negative images surrounding the country and its history -lrb- june 29 , 2003 -rrb- .

whether it ’ s the tabloids taking a gibe with headlines like " herr we go – bring on the krauts " or " let ’ s blitz fritz " when england was pitted against germany in the 1996 european soccer championships , weekly television documentaries on hitler and concentration camps or papers such as the independent concluding recently that books with swastikas gracing the cover are guaranteed to be bestsellers , the british are still fed cliché-heavy doses of germany ’ s past .
the only other strong connection most british citizens have to the germans are parked in their garages : german cars have a brilliant reputation and reinforce the image of their makers as being reliable , punctual and efficient .
clueless about modern germany little wonder then that a recent survey conducted by the goethe institut , the german language and cultural center , and the british council turned out such negative results .
the poll , which quizzed young people between 16 and 25 years on their picture of modern germany , drew up mostly question marks .
although 37 percent of the british displayed a positive stance towards germany , they could only come up with beer and sport as the two things they identified with the country .
another 17 percent said they didn ’ t like germany and cited its military past , far-right tendencies and the apparent lack of manners and humor of the germans as reasons .
an astonishing 64 percent couldn ’ t name a single living famous german personality -lrb- supermodel claudia schiffer was mentioned a few times -rrb- .
another larger survey conducted for the goethe institut last year concluded that more than half the british population – 52 percent – said they didn ’ t have a clue about modern day germany .
more than hitler and nazi past alarmed by the unpopularity of its country and the widespread ignorance about it in britain , the goethe institut in london launched a campaign last year in british schools to promote itself as a fun-loving , cool nation .
" english students think the hitler theme with its smart uniforms and all is sexy , " head of the london goethe institut dr. ulrich sacker told deutsche welle .
" teachers have told me that it ’ s much easier to sell hitler than say environmental consciousness .
but what do you expect ?
every evening there ’ s at least one film on world war ii on british television . "
sacker says there ’ s just no information on german cultural and social life in britain .
" people just do not know about the other side , the more contemporary germany , the hedonistic side , the traveling spirit of the germans . "
cool britannia german style sacker now wants to bring contemporary germany to a larger british audience .
the goethe institut london has teamed up with a host of other organizations promoting german-british relations and founded a new initiative " creative capital foundation " to shape a new modern image of germany .
to start with , the foundation invited a slew of british travel journalists to the goethe institut earlier this week to expand their minds on the charms of the western german state of north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- along the river rhine .
" tourism is an important part of the process , the british usually never travel to germany , but prefer to go south , " dr. sacker explains .
" berlin was a focus last year , this time it ’ s nrw , and in 2005 it ’ ll be saxony , " sacker adds .
the foundation also organized a " british-german media bash " this week where german and british journalists , marketing and branding experts , thrashed out the role that politics , celebrities , media and advertising could play in spiking up germany ’ s dull image .
make love not war sacker opened the day-long seminar by showing two photographs of berlin ’ s famous victory column .
one from 1945 showed the monument surrounded by tanks and ruins , the other from the 1990s showed dancing revelers at the annual love parade , the world ’ s largest techno party .
" the british only know the war picture , " sacker was quoted in the berliner zeitung .
" but they should get to know the berlin of love , " he added .
sacker described the initiative - modeled along the lines of cool britannia , a campaign promoted by tony blair in the 1990s to liven up britain ’ s stuffy image from an old-fashioned nation of tweed- jacket-wearers to britpop and britart – as a " brainstorming session . "
" there were some interesting suggestions , but we ’ ve decided not to market germany as a brand .
it would only reduce the strong image that already exists about the country , " he says .
" instead we ’ re going to focus on adding interesting facets and snippets like the love parade , contemporary fashion , cuisine and karneval – that ’ s the only way to get the british interested . "
there ’ s no time frame as yet for when all the recommendations and brainstorming for spiffing up germany ’ s reputation will translate into action .
there ’ s talk of " strategy " and " high-quality projects . "
but sacker says " the important thing is that none of the end projects will have a moral finger teaching the british about germany .

through his work translating the bible , luther is also credited with reforming the german language , helping mold the modern usage that prevails today .
the main landmarks in a luther pilgrimage can be explored in a whistle-stop , three-day tour of lutherland .
please note : the tour has been organized by geographical rather than the chronology of luther 's life .
day one - eisleben martin luther was born on november 10 , 1483 , in eisleben , a town in the foothills of the harz mountains , in the eastern part of saxony-anhalt .
his birthplace , a simple but smart building now numbered 15 , stands in a street named after the man himself -lrb- entrance at seminarstrasse 16 -rrb- .
his father hans luther , who worked in the copper mines , and his mother margarethe , baptized baby martin in eisleben 's late gothic church of st. peter and paul - now another must-see destination on the luther tour .
the population of eisleben was then nearly 4,000 , and the town flourished thanks to the local silver and copper mining industry .
today , the population numbers some 20,000 , but people are moving away in droves .
unemployment is rife and young people have little choice but to seek work elsewhere .
but for fans of martin luther , the town is well worth a visit .
the house where the revolutionary reformer was born has been revered as a memorial site since 1693 , making it the oldest museum in germany .
to preserve luther 's memory , the town was bestowed with the epithet " lutherstadt " in 1946 .
in 1997 , the luther memorial sites were declared unesco world heritage sites .
day two - eisenach continuing in luther ’ s footsteps , travel on to eisenach , just under 150 kilometers away and less than a two-hour drive .
traditionally , the picturesque town on the northern edge of the thuringian forest was staunchly religious and was sarcastically described by luther as a " nest of priests . "
in the 15th century , one in ten of the town 's 4,000 inhabitants was involved in religion , and the town had no less than three churches and seven monasteries .
the young luther came here in 1498 to study at the prestigious latin school , now known as the martin-luther-gymnasium on the predigerplatz , or " preacher 's square . "
the " lutherhaus " -lrb- lutherplatz 8 -rrb- overlooking eisenach 's market square gives visitors a chance to explore luther 's life and work .
one highlight of the exhibition is the " lutherstuben " - two small rooms where the reformer is believed to have lived as a pupil until 1501 .
a few footsteps away from the house is the church of st. george , where luther earned extra money by singing in the choir .
a silent witness to this time is the font upon which johann sebastian bach , who was born in eisenach , was baptized in 1685 .
the reformer had fond memories of his four years in eisenach , which he later referred to as " my dear town . "
the town itself remembers and honors luther with a large memorial on the karlsplatz .
wartburg castle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wartburg castle in eisenach the next port-of-call on the luther trail literally looms over eisenach - wartburg castle , where the theologian spent his final , solitary years .
but before heading up to the imposing fortress , take a short detour to the village of steinach , nestled in a picturesque valley .
here , a large memorial has been erected recalling the detention of luther after he refused to retract publicly his teachings even when faced with a ban by the emperor of the holy roman empire at the diet of worms .
the inscription reads : " here marks the spot where dr. martin luther was taken away to wartburg castle upon the orders of friedrich the wise , elector of saxony . "
in fact , the powerful elector had been acting to protect luther .
friedrich believed that allowing the reformer to live incognito at his castle would serve to calm feverish anti-reformation activity .
the wartburg -lrb- schlossberg 2 -rrb- , perched high on a 1230-foot cliff overlooking eisenach , is one of germany 's most famous and well-preserved castles .
it was founded by duke ludwig of thuringia in 1067 .
like all other places connected with luther , it was declared a unesco world heritage site in 1997 .
the entire castle underwent a comprehensive renovation carried out by the east german government between 1952-1966 .
this included work on the room where luther lived for 300 days disguised as junker jörg .
the original floor and paneled walls have been retained and a wooden desk also dates from the lutheran era .
names and dates etched into the stone walls bear witness to the fact that the castle has been visited by christian pilgrims since the end of the 16th century .
most of luther 's time at wartburg castle was spent in quiet study , and it was here that he set about translating the new testament from its original greek into german .
with the publication of the new testament in september 1522 , luther laid the foundations for the german language as we know it today .
the style he adopted was highly descriptive and reflected common language usage , thereby making the texts accessible to all .
in the early 1530s , luther devoted himself to translating the old testament , leading to the publication of the first complete german edition of the bible in august 1534 .
as though completing the circle of his life , luther returned to eisleben , the town of his birth , in january 1546 .
on 17 february , luther complained of serious chest pain and took to his bed .
alarmed , his friends and children gathered around him .
asked by his friend , the court preacher justus jonas : " reverend father , will you stand firm in christ and the doctrine you have preached ? "
luther responded with a clearly audible : " yes " .
it was to be his dying word .
-lrb- you can visit the house where luther died at andreaskirchplatz 7 . -rrb-
two memorial services were held at st. andrew 's church -lrb- sanktandreasplatz -rrb- in eisleben .
in the afternoon of 20 february , the entourage accompanying luther 's body began its journey to wittenberg , arriving two days later .
luther 's body was interred in the castle church , in front of the pulpit .
in 1894 , the house where luther died in eisleben was declared an official memorial site .
erfurt less than 65 kilometers away , erfurt can be easily reached in just half an hour by car .
today , some 200,000 people live in the attractive capital of the state of thuringia .
it boasts one of the best-preserved medieval city centers in germany and is especially proud of its landmark krämer bridge - the longest house bridge in europe , complete with 32 residences .

-lrb- ap photo / jens meyer -rrb- - zu unserem korr - often cited as his spiritual home , martin luther moved here in 1501 , when erfurt was the sixth largest town in germany .
he lived in the town 's augustinian monastery -lrb- augustinerstrasse 10 -rrb- , now one of the most important destinations on the lutheran trail , and began his studies at the university , graduating in 1505 .
in 1507 , luther was ordained as a priest here .
today , luther 's quarters in the monastery have been reconstructed to create a sense of what daily life must have been like in this strict monastic order .
the monastery is also an architectural monument to medieval religious architecture , situated right in the old town of erfurt .
badly destroyed during world war ii , it was rebuilt in 1982 as part of celebrations marking the 500th birthday of martin luther .

2003 - marktplatz von der lutherstadt wittenberg in sachsen-anhalt some 200 kilometers away from erfurt lies wittenberg , the final destination on the luther tour .
luther spent 36 years of his life here – and the town is a treasure trove for luther pilgrims .
as a 25-year-old priest , luther was inducted as teacher at wittenberg university in 1508 .
the small town on the banks of the river elbe had just 2,000 inhabitants , and the pace of life was slow .
luther was said to have described it as town " on the edge of civilization " .
the priest lived with augustinian hermits , and today , visitors to wittenberg can explore his quarters , maintained in their original form , at the luther house , luther memorial foundation of saxony-anhalt .
the museum also houses the world 's largest collection of documents charting the history of the reformation , with more than 10,000 prints , 6,000 manuscripts , thousands of portraits of luther , 2,000 coins and medallions as well as 14,000 graphics .
the museum authorities completed a comprehensive restoration of these historic pieces , and a permanent exhibition opened in march , 2003 .
reformation begins in wittenberg it was during his years in wittenberg that luther made a name for himself as a reformer .
during a visit to rome in 1510 , the theologian was appalled by what he perceived as a corrupt catholic church .
a system to raise badly-needed funds for the rebuilding of st. peter 's , which involved papal emissaries selling indulgences , was being grossly abused .
in october 1517 , luther drew up a list of 95 theses questioning the right of the pope to forgive sins .
when he nailed the document to the door of the palace church -lrb- schlossplatz -rrb- in wittenberg , his actions caused ripples in rome , and he was summoned for an audience with pope leo x. the event heralded the beginning of the protestant reformation in germany - and ultimately , protestantism in general .
today the palace church is wittenberg 's main attraction for luther pilgrims .
luther continued to challenge the papacy .
in 1520 , he published his famous address " an den christlichen adel deutscher nation " -lrb- address to the christian nobility of the german nation -rrb- , followed by the treatise " de captivitate babylonica ecclesiae praeludium " -lrb- a prelude concerning the babylonian captivity of the church -rrb- , which also attacked the doctrinal system of the church of rome .
on december 10 of the same year , luther burned the papal bull issued against him before a gathering of doctors , students , and citizens in wittenberg , on a spot marked today by the legendary " lutheran oak " -lrb- located at the intersection of lutherstrasse and collegienstrasse -rrb- .
in 1522 , luther gave his first sermons in german at the church of st. marien -lrb- kirchplatz -rrb- in wittenberg .
the most remarkable work of art in this , the oldest building in wittenberg , is the cycle of paintings on the reformation altar by lucas cranach the elder , dedicated in 1547 .
the group on the right-hand side of the main panel refers to luther ' communion teachings and shows luther taking his place among the apostles at the last supper .
wittenberg is also home to one of germany 's most beautiful renaissance town halls , situated on the market square and flanked by a striking luther memorial .
originally planned for eisleben , the town of luther 's birth and death , it was brought to wittenberg on the orders of the prussian king friedrich wilhelm iii .
perhaps one of the most significant of the many artistic tributes to luther in germany , the memorial is the work of the berlin sculptor gottfried schadow , while the neo-gothic dais was designed by karl friedrich schinkel .
lucas cranach the elder , a friend of luther 's , was an artist whose paintings and graphics gave strong impetus to the reformation movement .
he also served as mayor here from 1537 to 1544 , as well as running the town 's apothecary - which still stands to this day - a book shop and a flourishing studio , which helped make wittenberg an important center for various artistic activities in germany .
still a controversial figure although there are over 70 million followers of the lutheran church worldwide , dr. martin luther remains a controversial figure .
initially a supporter of the jews , he became frustrated by their unwillingness to embrace his own religion , and emerged as one of the most bitter anti-semites in history .
in his writings , he described jews as poisoners , ritual murderers and parasites , preaching that they were worse than devils , that their synagogues should be burned to the ground and that they should be expelled from germany .
his detractors may argue that luther helped set the stage for the holocaust .
but for others , luthers was a spiritual genius , a man with a remarkable ability to inspire others with his passion and dedication to the christian faith . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links luther pilgrimages a guide to the official luther pilgrimage itinerary routes to luther further tips for tours of luther landmarks unesco world heritage sites unesco world heritage sites in eastern germany martin luther comprehensive information on martin luther 9800 dw-tv europe live motor mobil we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

through his work translating the bible , luther is also credited with reforming the german language , helping mold the modern usage that prevails today .
the main landmarks in a luther pilgrimage can be explored in a whistle-stop , three-day tour of lutherland .
please note : the tour has been organized by geographical rather than the chronology of luther 's life .
day one - eisleben martin luther was born on november 10 , 1483 , in eisleben , a town in the foothills of the harz mountains , in the eastern part of saxony-anhalt .
his birthplace , a simple but smart building now numbered 15 , stands in a street named after the man himself -lrb- entrance at seminarstrasse 16 -rrb- .
his father hans luther , who worked in the copper mines , and his mother margarethe , baptized baby martin in eisleben 's late gothic church of st. peter and paul - now another must-see destination on the luther tour .
the population of eisleben was then nearly 4,000 , and the town flourished thanks to the local silver and copper mining industry .
today , the population numbers some 20,000 , but people are moving away in droves .
unemployment is rife and young people have little choice but to seek work elsewhere .
but for fans of martin luther , the town is well worth a visit .
the house where the revolutionary reformer was born has been revered as a memorial site since 1693 , making it the oldest museum in germany .
to preserve luther 's memory , the town was bestowed with the epithet " lutherstadt " in 1946 .
in 1997 , the luther memorial sites were declared unesco world heritage sites .
day two - eisenach continuing in luther ’ s footsteps , travel on to eisenach , just under 150 kilometers away and less than a two-hour drive .
traditionally , the picturesque town on the northern edge of the thuringian forest was staunchly religious and was sarcastically described by luther as a " nest of priests . "
in the 15th century , one in ten of the town 's 4,000 inhabitants was involved in religion , and the town had no less than three churches and seven monasteries .
the young luther came here in 1498 to study at the prestigious latin school , now known as the martin-luther-gymnasium on the predigerplatz , or " preacher 's square . "
the " lutherhaus " -lrb- lutherplatz 8 -rrb- overlooking eisenach 's market square gives visitors a chance to explore luther 's life and work .
one highlight of the exhibition is the " lutherstuben " - two small rooms where the reformer is believed to have lived as a pupil until 1501 .
a few footsteps away from the house is the church of st. george , where luther earned extra money by singing in the choir .
a silent witness to this time is the font upon which johann sebastian bach , who was born in eisenach , was baptized in 1685 .
the reformer had fond memories of his four years in eisenach , which he later referred to as " my dear town . "
the town itself remembers and honors luther with a large memorial on the karlsplatz .
wartburg castle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wartburg castle in eisenach the next port-of-call on the luther trail literally looms over eisenach - wartburg castle , where the theologian spent his final , solitary years .
but before heading up to the imposing fortress , take a short detour to the village of steinach , nestled in a picturesque valley .
here , a large memorial has been erected recalling the detention of luther after he refused to retract publicly his teachings even when faced with a ban by the emperor of the holy roman empire at the diet of worms .
the inscription reads : " here marks the spot where dr. martin luther was taken away to wartburg castle upon the orders of friedrich the wise , elector of saxony . "
in fact , the powerful elector had been acting to protect luther .
friedrich believed that allowing the reformer to live incognito at his castle would serve to calm feverish anti-reformation activity .
the wartburg -lrb- schlossberg 2 -rrb- , perched high on a 1230-foot cliff overlooking eisenach , is one of germany 's most famous and well-preserved castles .
it was founded by duke ludwig of thuringia in 1067 .
like all other places connected with luther , it was declared a unesco world heritage site in 1997 .
the entire castle underwent a comprehensive renovation carried out by the east german government between 1952-1966 .
this included work on the room where luther lived for 300 days disguised as junker jörg .
the original floor and paneled walls have been retained and a wooden desk also dates from the lutheran era .
names and dates etched into the stone walls bear witness to the fact that the castle has been visited by christian pilgrims since the end of the 16th century .
most of luther 's time at wartburg castle was spent in quiet study , and it was here that he set about translating the new testament from its original greek into german .
with the publication of the new testament in september 1522 , luther laid the foundations for the german language as we know it today .
the style he adopted was highly descriptive and reflected common language usage , thereby making the texts accessible to all .
in the early 1530s , luther devoted himself to translating the old testament , leading to the publication of the first complete german edition of the bible in august 1534 .
as though completing the circle of his life , luther returned to eisleben , the town of his birth , in january 1546 .
on 17 february , luther complained of serious chest pain and took to his bed .
alarmed , his friends and children gathered around him .
asked by his friend , the court preacher justus jonas : " reverend father , will you stand firm in christ and the doctrine you have preached ? "
luther responded with a clearly audible : " yes " .
it was to be his dying word .
-lrb- you can visit the house where luther died at andreaskirchplatz 7 . -rrb-
two memorial services were held at st. andrew 's church -lrb- sanktandreasplatz -rrb- in eisleben .
in the afternoon of 20 february , the entourage accompanying luther 's body began its journey to wittenberg , arriving two days later .
luther 's body was interred in the castle church , in front of the pulpit .
in 1894 , the house where luther died in eisleben was declared an official memorial site .
erfurt less than 65 kilometers away , erfurt can be easily reached in just half an hour by car .
today , some 200,000 people live in the attractive capital of the state of thuringia .
it boasts one of the best-preserved medieval city centers in germany and is especially proud of its landmark krämer bridge - the longest house bridge in europe , complete with 32 residences .

-lrb- ap photo / jens meyer -rrb- - zu unserem korr - often cited as his spiritual home , martin luther moved here in 1501 , when erfurt was the sixth largest town in germany .
he lived in the town 's augustinian monastery -lrb- augustinerstrasse 10 -rrb- , now one of the most important destinations on the lutheran trail , and began his studies at the university , graduating in 1505 .
in 1507 , luther was ordained as a priest here .
today , luther 's quarters in the monastery have been reconstructed to create a sense of what daily life must have been like in this strict monastic order .
the monastery is also an architectural monument to medieval religious architecture , situated right in the old town of erfurt .
badly destroyed during world war ii , it was rebuilt in 1982 as part of celebrations marking the 500th birthday of martin luther .

2003 - marktplatz von der lutherstadt wittenberg in sachsen-anhalt some 200 kilometers away from erfurt lies wittenberg , the final destination on the luther tour .
luther spent 36 years of his life here – and the town is a treasure trove for luther pilgrims .
as a 25-year-old priest , luther was inducted as teacher at wittenberg university in 1508 .
the small town on the banks of the river elbe had just 2,000 inhabitants , and the pace of life was slow .
luther was said to have described it as town " on the edge of civilization " .
the priest lived with augustinian hermits , and today , visitors to wittenberg can explore his quarters , maintained in their original form , at the luther house , luther memorial foundation of saxony-anhalt .
the museum also houses the world 's largest collection of documents charting the history of the reformation , with more than 10,000 prints , 6,000 manuscripts , thousands of portraits of luther , 2,000 coins and medallions as well as 14,000 graphics .
the museum authorities completed a comprehensive restoration of these historic pieces , and a permanent exhibition opened in march , 2003 .
reformation begins in wittenberg it was during his years in wittenberg that luther made a name for himself as a reformer .
during a visit to rome in 1510 , the theologian was appalled by what he perceived as a corrupt catholic church .
a system to raise badly-needed funds for the rebuilding of st. peter 's , which involved papal emissaries selling indulgences , was being grossly abused .
in october 1517 , luther drew up a list of 95 theses questioning the right of the pope to forgive sins .
when he nailed the document to the door of the palace church -lrb- schlossplatz -rrb- in wittenberg , his actions caused ripples in rome , and he was summoned for an audience with pope leo x. the event heralded the beginning of the protestant reformation in germany - and ultimately , protestantism in general .
today the palace church is wittenberg 's main attraction for luther pilgrims .
luther continued to challenge the papacy .
in 1520 , he published his famous address " an den christlichen adel deutscher nation " -lrb- address to the christian nobility of the german nation -rrb- , followed by the treatise " de captivitate babylonica ecclesiae praeludium " -lrb- a prelude concerning the babylonian captivity of the church -rrb- , which also attacked the doctrinal system of the church of rome .
on december 10 of the same year , luther burned the papal bull issued against him before a gathering of doctors , students , and citizens in wittenberg , on a spot marked today by the legendary " lutheran oak " -lrb- located at the intersection of lutherstrasse and collegienstrasse -rrb- .
in 1522 , luther gave his first sermons in german at the church of st. marien -lrb- kirchplatz -rrb- in wittenberg .
the most remarkable work of art in this , the oldest building in wittenberg , is the cycle of paintings on the reformation altar by lucas cranach the elder , dedicated in 1547 .
the group on the right-hand side of the main panel refers to luther ' communion teachings and shows luther taking his place among the apostles at the last supper .
wittenberg is also home to one of germany 's most beautiful renaissance town halls , situated on the market square and flanked by a striking luther memorial .
originally planned for eisleben , the town of luther 's birth and death , it was brought to wittenberg on the orders of the prussian king friedrich wilhelm iii .
perhaps one of the most significant of the many artistic tributes to luther in germany , the memorial is the work of the berlin sculptor gottfried schadow , while the neo-gothic dais was designed by karl friedrich schinkel .
lucas cranach the elder , a friend of luther 's , was an artist whose paintings and graphics gave strong impetus to the reformation movement .
he also served as mayor here from 1537 to 1544 , as well as running the town 's apothecary - which still stands to this day - a book shop and a flourishing studio , which helped make wittenberg an important center for various artistic activities in germany .
still a controversial figure although there are over 70 million followers of the lutheran church worldwide , dr. martin luther remains a controversial figure .
initially a supporter of the jews , he became frustrated by their unwillingness to embrace his own religion , and emerged as one of the most bitter anti-semites in history .
in his writings , he described jews as poisoners , ritual murderers and parasites , preaching that they were worse than devils , that their synagogues should be burned to the ground and that they should be expelled from germany .
his detractors may argue that luther helped set the stage for the holocaust .
but for others , luthers was a spiritual genius , a man with a remarkable ability to inspire others with his passion and dedication to the christian faith . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links luther pilgrimages a guide to the official luther pilgrimage itinerary routes to luther further tips for tours of luther landmarks unesco world heritage sites unesco world heritage sites in eastern germany martin luther comprehensive information on martin luther 9800 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

"
in a highly defensive appearance before the european parliament on wednesday , italy 's prime minister alienated many with his nazi jokes .
but he did lay out a solid plan for his country 's leadership of the eu . his detractors have made no secret of their fears that italian prime minister silvio berlusconi would tarnish the office of the rotating european union presidency with his scandal-plagued leadership and questionable business dealings .
indeed , as he laid out his roadmap for italy 's six-month term at the helm of europe on wednesday , he held true to all expectations .
berlusconi presented his political platforms to the european parliament in strasbourg amid boos , jeers and protests .
one green parliamentarian compared his political ways to those of atila the hun , who ravaged europe during the 5th century .
berlusconi fired back by calling his critics " tourists " in parliamentary democracy and compared one of his most vociferous detractors to a concentration camp guard .
for weeks , martin schulz , a social democratic party member of the european parliament from germany , has served as an outspoken critic of berlusconi , pointing his finger at the italian ’ s personal legal troubles and major media investments as a serious conflict of interest .
he has n't minced words in his policy critiques , either , lambasting berlusconi for recent remarks by his reforms minister that italy 's navy should be able to fire on boats filled with illegal immigrants to keep them from landing on italian shores .
the greens , too , were hardly welcoming of the new eu president when he took to the podium wednesday as they held up signs with slogans like " everyone is equal before the law , " and " no godfather for europe . "
at one point it become too much for berlusconi .
" mr. schulz , " berlusconi quipped , " i know there is in italy a man producing a film on the nazi concentration camps .
i would like to suggest you for the role of kapo .
you 'd be perfect . "
-lrb- kapo is a reference to prisoners selected by the ss to serve as guards and complete menial jobs ; they were given favorable treatment over other prisoners and were considered traitors by many . -rrb-
later , when asked if he wanted the remark to be stricken from the record by european parliament president pat cox , berlusconi refused .
the remarks so outraged the german government that it ordered the italian ambassador in berlin to the office of chancellor gerhard schröder .
members of parliament were no less outraged , and the session was suspended afterwards .
in response to berlusconi 's attack , schulz said : " my respect for the victims of fascism will not permit me to deal with that kind of claim .
but it is very hard for me accept that a politician should be exercising the role of president of the european council if he comes out with this kind of statement when he encounters the slightest contradiction . "
berlusconi later explained that his comments were intended as an " ironic joke " and refused to apologize .
seeking to put out the wildfire on wednesday afternoon , berlusconi went a step further , but still fell short of apologizing when he told eu politicians meeting behind closed doors he " did not mean to offend the feelings of a country , feelings that have a historical motivation . "
but graham watson , the leader of the liberal democratic group in the european parliament , said berlusconi 's remarks " debase the presidency of the council and offend europe . "
a roadmap for italy 's eu presidency the bitter exchange distracted attention from the real message berlusconi came to deliver on wednesday – how italy planned to steer the eu during its term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi berlusconi -lrb- photo -rrb- said his country wanted to create a " new dynamic " in the transatlantic relationship and to push ahead with eastward expansion , calling for bulgaria and romania to be given a clear path in order to facilitate their eu membership by 2007 .
the italian prime minister also called for a " new deal " style increase in public infrastructure investment in order to stimulate economic growth – largely through rail and other public transport projects .
but he said countries should find a way to invest in infrastructure projects without resorting to stability pact-busting deficit spending .
but berlusconi ’ s major task for the next six months is to conduct negotiations after the start of an intergovernmental conference in october that will hammer out the final draft of the eu 's first constitution .
berlusconi would like to see approval of the constitution at a december summit in rome , the site where the 1957 treaty establishing the european community was signed .
highlighting the importance of europe ’ s role in the middle east , berlusconi said brussels should push along the " road map " to peace between the israelis and palestinians and contribute to the reconstruction effort in iraq in order to bring the two continents closer .
addressing recent problems with illegal immigrants entering europe from northern africa , hundreds of whom have perished in accidents on rickety boats , berlusconi called for the creation of an eu border patrol to guard its external borders as well as immigrant holding centers outside the eu .
italian officials believe that last month alone at least 3,000 illegal northern african immigrants landed on italian shores .
now , they want brussels to take action .
with strapped social systems across the union and a graying population , berlusconi also called for eu-wide measures " aimed at increasing the activity level of older workers and reducing trends toward pre-retirement " that strain federal pocketbooks .
among those measures would be a common eu approach to retirement systems . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the eu presidency according to silvio his party changed the law to to make him immune from prosecution and his criminal case was dropped .

an earnest project aided by marketing and branding experts is underway in london to jazz up germany ’ s humorless and stereotypically staid image in great britain as reflected in a recent survey . it ’ s no secret that germany ’ s image in britain is in bad shape .
whether it ’ s the tabloids taking a gibe with headlines like " herr we go – bring on the krauts " or " let ’ s blitz fritz " when england was pitted against germany in the 1996 european soccer championships , weekly television documentaries on hitler and concentration camps or papers such as the independent concluding recently that books with swastikas gracing the cover are guaranteed to be bestsellers , the british are still fed cliché-heavy doses of germany ’ s past .
the only other strong connection most british citizens have to the germans are parked in their garages : german cars have a brilliant reputation and reinforce the image of their makers as being reliable , punctual and efficient .
clueless about modern germany little wonder then that a recent survey conducted by the goethe institut , the german language and cultural center , and the british council turned out such negative results .
the poll , which quizzed young people between 16 and 25 years on their picture of modern germany , drew up mostly question marks .
although 37 percent of the british displayed a positive stance towards germany , they could only come up with beer and sport as the two things they identified with the country .
another 17 percent said they didn ’ t like germany and cited its military past , far-right tendencies and the apparent lack of manners and humor of the germans as reasons .
an astonishing 64 percent couldn ’ t name a single living famous german personality -lrb- supermodel claudia schiffer was mentioned a few times -rrb- .
another larger survey conducted for the goethe institut last year concluded that more than half the british population – 52 percent – said they didn ’ t have a clue about modern day germany .
more than hitler and nazi past alarmed by the unpopularity of its country and the widespread ignorance about it in britain , the goethe institut in london launched a campaign last year in british schools to promote itself as a fun-loving , cool nation .
" english students think the hitler theme with its smart uniforms and all is sexy , " head of the london goethe institut dr. ulrich sacker told deutsche welle .
" teachers have told me that it ’ s much easier to sell hitler than say environmental consciousness .
but what do you expect ?
every evening there ’ s at least one film on world war ii on british television . "
sacker says there ’ s just no information on german cultural and social life in britain .
" people just do not know about the other side , the more contemporary germany , the hedonistic side , the traveling spirit of the germans . "
cool britannia german style sacker now wants to bring contemporary germany to a larger british audience .
the goethe institut london has teamed up with a host of other organizations promoting german-british relations and founded a new initiative " creative capital foundation " to shape a new modern image of germany .
to start with , the foundation invited a slew of british travel journalists to the goethe institut earlier this week to expand their minds on the charms of the western german state of north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- along the river rhine .
" tourism is an important part of the process , the british usually never travel to germany , but prefer to go south , " dr. sacker explains .
" berlin was a focus last year , this time it ’ s nrw , and in 2005 it ’ ll be saxony , " sacker adds .
the foundation also organized a " british-german media bash " this week where german and british journalists , marketing and branding experts , thrashed out the role that politics , celebrities , media and advertising could play in spiking up germany ’ s dull image .
make love not war sacker opened the day-long seminar by showing two photographs of berlin ’ s famous victory column .
one from 1945 showed the monument surrounded by tanks and ruins , the other from the 1990s showed dancing revelers at the annual love parade , the world ’ s largest techno party .
" the british only know the war picture , " sacker was quoted in the berliner zeitung .
" but they should get to know the berlin of love , " he added .
sacker described the initiative - modeled along the lines of cool britannia , a campaign promoted by tony blair in the 1990s to liven up britain ’ s stuffy image from an old-fashioned nation of tweed- jacket-wearers to britpop and britart – as a " brainstorming session . "
" there were some interesting suggestions , but we ’ ve decided not to market germany as a brand .
it would only reduce the strong image that already exists about the country , " he says .
" instead we ’ re going to focus on adding interesting facets and snippets like the love parade , contemporary fashion , cuisine and karneval – that ’ s the only way to get the british interested . "
there ’ s no time frame as yet for when all the recommendations and brainstorming for spiffing up germany ’ s reputation will translate into action .
there ’ s talk of " strategy " and " high-quality projects . "
but sacker says " the important thing is that none of the end projects will have a moral finger teaching the british about germany .
instead they ’ ll all be infused with humor and irony . "
so watch out britannia , germany is rolling up its sleeves and heading your way with a serious charm offensive . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more fun please , we ’ re german !
in a bid to promote itself as a fun-loving , humorous nation , germany is targetting british schools with a new campaign designed to counter the negative images surrounding the country and its history -lrb- june 29 , 2003 -rrb- .

in a highly defensive appearance before the european parliament on wednesday , italy 's prime minister alienated many with his nazi jokes .
but he did lay out a solid plan for his country 's leadership of the eu . his detractors have made no secret of their fears that italian prime minister silvio berlusconi would tarnish the office of the rotating european union presidency with his scandal-plagued leadership and questionable business dealings .

berlusconi presented his political platforms to the european parliament in strasbourg amid boos , jeers and protests .

berlusconi fired back by calling his critics " tourists " in parliamentary democracy and compared one of his most vociferous detractors to a concentration camp guard .
for weeks , martin schulz , a social democratic party member of the european parliament from germany , has served as an outspoken critic of berlusconi , pointing his finger at the italian ’ s personal legal troubles and major media investments as a serious conflict of interest .
he has n't minced words in his policy critiques , either , lambasting berlusconi for recent remarks by his reforms minister that italy 's navy should be able to fire on boats filled with illegal immigrants to keep them from landing on italian shores .

later , when asked if he wanted the remark to be stricken from the record by european parliament president pat cox , berlusconi refused .
the remarks so outraged the german government that it ordered the italian ambassador in berlin to the office of chancellor gerhard schröder .
members of parliament were no less outraged , and the session was suspended afterwards .
in response to berlusconi 's attack , schulz said : " my respect for the victims of fascism will not permit me to deal with that kind of claim .

berlusconi later explained that his comments were intended as an " ironic joke " and refused to apologize .

through his work translating the bible , luther is also credited with reforming the german language , helping mold the modern usage that prevails today .
the main landmarks in a luther pilgrimage can be explored in a whistle-stop , three-day tour of lutherland .
please note : the tour has been organized by geographical rather than the chronology of luther 's life .
day one - eisleben martin luther was born on november 10 , 1483 , in eisleben , a town in the foothills of the harz mountains , in the eastern part of saxony-anhalt .
his birthplace , a simple but smart building now numbered 15 , stands in a street named after the man himself -lrb- entrance at seminarstrasse 16 -rrb- .
his father hans luther , who worked in the copper mines , and his mother margarethe , baptized baby martin in eisleben 's late gothic church of st. peter and paul - now another must-see destination on the luther tour .
the population of eisleben was then nearly 4,000 , and the town flourished thanks to the local silver and copper mining industry .
today , the population numbers some 20,000 , but people are moving away in droves .
unemployment is rife and young people have little choice but to seek work elsewhere .
but for fans of martin luther , the town is well worth a visit .
the house where the revolutionary reformer was born has been revered as a memorial site since 1693 , making it the oldest museum in germany .
to preserve luther 's memory , the town was bestowed with the epithet " lutherstadt " in 1946 .
in 1997 , the luther memorial sites were declared unesco world heritage sites .
day two - eisenach continuing in luther ’ s footsteps , travel on to eisenach , just under 150 kilometers away and less than a two-hour drive .
traditionally , the picturesque town on the northern edge of the thuringian forest was staunchly religious and was sarcastically described by luther as a " nest of priests . "
in the 15th century , one in ten of the town 's 4,000 inhabitants was involved in religion , and the town had no less than three churches and seven monasteries .
the young luther came here in 1498 to study at the prestigious latin school , now known as the martin-luther-gymnasium on the predigerplatz , or " preacher 's square . "
the " lutherhaus " -lrb- lutherplatz 8 -rrb- overlooking eisenach 's market square gives visitors a chance to explore luther 's life and work .
one highlight of the exhibition is the " lutherstuben " - two small rooms where the reformer is believed to have lived as a pupil until 1501 .
a few footsteps away from the house is the church of st. george , where luther earned extra money by singing in the choir .
a silent witness to this time is the font upon which johann sebastian bach , who was born in eisenach , was baptized in 1685 .
the reformer had fond memories of his four years in eisenach , which he later referred to as " my dear town . "
the town itself remembers and honors luther with a large memorial on the karlsplatz .
wartburg castle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wartburg castle in eisenach the next port-of-call on the luther trail literally looms over eisenach - wartburg castle , where the theologian spent his final , solitary years .
but before heading up to the imposing fortress , take a short detour to the village of steinach , nestled in a picturesque valley .
here , a large memorial has been erected recalling the detention of luther after he refused to retract publicly his teachings even when faced with a ban by the emperor of the holy roman empire at the diet of worms .
the inscription reads : " here marks the spot where dr. martin luther was taken away to wartburg castle upon the orders of friedrich the wise , elector of saxony . "
in fact , the powerful elector had been acting to protect luther .
friedrich believed that allowing the reformer to live incognito at his castle would serve to calm feverish anti-reformation activity .
the wartburg -lrb- schlossberg 2 -rrb- , perched high on a 1230-foot cliff overlooking eisenach , is one of germany 's most famous and well-preserved castles .
it was founded by duke ludwig of thuringia in 1067 .
like all other places connected with luther , it was declared a unesco world heritage site in 1997 .
the entire castle underwent a comprehensive renovation carried out by the east german government between 1952-1966 .
this included work on the room where luther lived for 300 days disguised as junker jörg .
the original floor and paneled walls have been retained and a wooden desk also dates from the lutheran era .
names and dates etched into the stone walls bear witness to the fact that the castle has been visited by christian pilgrims since the end of the 16th century .
most of luther 's time at wartburg castle was spent in quiet study , and it was here that he set about translating the new testament from its original greek into german .
with the publication of the new testament in september 1522 , luther laid the foundations for the german language as we know it today .
the style he adopted was highly descriptive and reflected common language usage , thereby making the texts accessible to all .
in the early 1530s , luther devoted himself to translating the old testament , leading to the publication of the first complete german edition of the bible in august 1534 .
as though completing the circle of his life , luther returned to eisleben , the town of his birth , in january 1546 .
on 17 february , luther complained of serious chest pain and took to his bed .
alarmed , his friends and children gathered around him .
asked by his friend , the court preacher justus jonas : " reverend father , will you stand firm in christ and the doctrine you have preached ? "
luther responded with a clearly audible : " yes " .
it was to be his dying word .
-lrb- you can visit the house where luther died at andreaskirchplatz 7 . -rrb-
two memorial services were held at st. andrew 's church -lrb- sanktandreasplatz -rrb- in eisleben .
in the afternoon of 20 february , the entourage accompanying luther 's body began its journey to wittenberg , arriving two days later .
luther 's body was interred in the castle church , in front of the pulpit .
in 1894 , the house where luther died in eisleben was declared an official memorial site .
erfurt less than 65 kilometers away , erfurt can be easily reached in just half an hour by car .
today , some 200,000 people live in the attractive capital of the state of thuringia .
it boasts one of the best-preserved medieval city centers in germany and is especially proud of its landmark krämer bridge - the longest house bridge in europe , complete with 32 residences .

he lived in the town 's augustinian monastery -lrb- augustinerstrasse 10 -rrb- , now one of the most important destinations on the lutheran trail , and began his studies at the university , graduating in 1505 .
in 1507 , luther was ordained as a priest here .
today , luther 's quarters in the monastery have been reconstructed to create a sense of what daily life must have been like in this strict monastic order .
the monastery is also an architectural monument to medieval religious architecture , situated right in the old town of erfurt .
badly destroyed during world war ii , it was rebuilt in 1982 as part of celebrations marking the 500th birthday of martin luther .

2003 - marktplatz von der lutherstadt wittenberg in sachsen-anhalt some 200 kilometers away from erfurt lies wittenberg , the final destination on the luther tour .
luther spent 36 years of his life here – and the town is a treasure trove for luther pilgrims .
as a 25-year-old priest , luther was inducted as teacher at wittenberg university in 1508 .
the small town on the banks of the river elbe had just 2,000 inhabitants , and the pace of life was slow .
luther was said to have described it as town " on the edge of civilization " .
the priest lived with augustinian hermits , and today , visitors to wittenberg can explore his quarters , maintained in their original form , at the luther house , luther memorial foundation of saxony-anhalt .
the museum also houses the world 's largest collection of documents charting the history of the reformation , with more than 10,000 prints , 6,000 manuscripts , thousands of portraits of luther , 2,000 coins and medallions as well as 14,000 graphics .
the museum authorities completed a comprehensive restoration of these historic pieces , and a permanent exhibition opened in march , 2003 .
reformation begins in wittenberg it was during his years in wittenberg that luther made a name for himself as a reformer .
during a visit to rome in 1510 , the theologian was appalled by what he perceived as a corrupt catholic church .
a system to raise badly-needed funds for the rebuilding of st. peter 's , which involved papal emissaries selling indulgences , was being grossly abused .
in october 1517 , luther drew up a list of 95 theses questioning the right of the pope to forgive sins .
when he nailed the document to the door of the palace church -lrb- schlossplatz -rrb- in wittenberg , his actions caused ripples in rome , and he was summoned for an audience with pope leo x. the event heralded the beginning of the protestant reformation in germany - and ultimately , protestantism in general .
today the palace church is wittenberg 's main attraction for luther pilgrims .
luther continued to challenge the papacy .
in 1520 , he published his famous address " an den christlichen adel deutscher nation " -lrb- address to the christian nobility of the german nation -rrb- , followed by the treatise " de captivitate babylonica ecclesiae praeludium " -lrb- a prelude concerning the babylonian captivity of the church -rrb- , which also attacked the doctrinal system of the church of rome .
on december 10 of the same year , luther burned the papal bull issued against him before a gathering of doctors , students , and citizens in wittenberg , on a spot marked today by the legendary " lutheran oak " -lrb- located at the intersection of lutherstrasse and collegienstrasse -rrb- .
in 1522 , luther gave his first sermons in german at the church of st. marien -lrb- kirchplatz -rrb- in wittenberg .
the most remarkable work of art in this , the oldest building in wittenberg , is the cycle of paintings on the reformation altar by lucas cranach the elder , dedicated in 1547 .
the group on the right-hand side of the main panel refers to luther ' communion teachings and shows luther taking his place among the apostles at the last supper .
wittenberg is also home to one of germany 's most beautiful renaissance town halls , situated on the market square and flanked by a striking luther memorial .
originally planned for eisleben , the town of luther 's birth and death , it was brought to wittenberg on the orders of the prussian king friedrich wilhelm iii .
perhaps one of the most significant of the many artistic tributes to luther in germany , the memorial is the work of the berlin sculptor gottfried schadow , while the neo-gothic dais was designed by karl friedrich schinkel .
lucas cranach the elder , a friend of luther 's , was an artist whose paintings and graphics gave strong impetus to the reformation movement .
he also served as mayor here from 1537 to 1544 , as well as running the town 's apothecary - which still stands to this day - a book shop and a flourishing studio , which helped make wittenberg an important center for various artistic activities in germany .
still a controversial figure although there are over 70 million followers of the lutheran church worldwide , dr. martin luther remains a controversial figure .
initially a supporter of the jews , he became frustrated by their unwillingness to embrace his own religion , and emerged as one of the most bitter anti-semites in history .
in his writings , he described jews as poisoners , ritual murderers and parasites , preaching that they were worse than devils , that their synagogues should be burned to the ground and that they should be expelled from germany .
his detractors may argue that luther helped set the stage for the holocaust .
but for others , luthers was a spiritual genius , a man with a remarkable ability to inspire others with his passion and dedication to the christian faith . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links luther pilgrimages a guide to the official luther pilgrimage itinerary routes to luther further tips for tours of luther landmarks unesco world heritage sites unesco world heritage sites in eastern germany martin luther comprehensive information on martin luther 9800 dw-tv europe live made in germany - the business magazine we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

"
in a highly defensive appearance before the european parliament on wednesday , italy 's prime minister alienated many with his nazi jokes .
but he did lay out a solid plan for his country 's leadership of the eu . his detractors have made no secret of their fears that italian prime minister silvio berlusconi would tarnish the office of the rotating european union presidency with his scandal-plagued leadership and questionable business dealings .
indeed , as he laid out his roadmap for italy 's six-month term at the helm of europe on wednesday , he held true to all expectations .
berlusconi presented his political platforms to the european parliament in strasbourg amid boos , jeers and protests .
one green parliamentarian compared his political ways to those of atila the hun , who ravaged europe during the 5th century .
berlusconi fired back by calling his critics " tourists " in parliamentary democracy and compared one of his most vociferous detractors to a concentration camp guard .
for weeks , martin schulz , a social democratic party member of the european parliament from germany , has served as an outspoken critic of berlusconi , pointing his finger at the italian ’ s personal legal troubles and major media investments as a serious conflict of interest .
he has n't minced words in his policy critiques , either , lambasting berlusconi for recent remarks by his reforms minister that italy 's navy should be able to fire on boats filled with illegal immigrants to keep them from landing on italian shores .
the greens , too , were hardly welcoming of the new eu president when he took to the podium wednesday as they held up signs with slogans like " everyone is equal before the law , " and " no godfather for europe . "
at one point it become too much for berlusconi .
" mr. schulz , " berlusconi quipped , " i know there is in italy a man producing a film on the nazi concentration camps .
i would like to suggest you for the role of kapo .
you 'd be perfect . "
-lrb- kapo is a reference to prisoners selected by the ss to serve as guards and complete menial jobs ; they were given favorable treatment over other prisoners and were considered traitors by many . -rrb-
later , when asked if he wanted the remark to be stricken from the record by european parliament president pat cox , berlusconi refused .
the remarks so outraged the german government that it ordered the italian ambassador in berlin to the office of chancellor gerhard schröder .
members of parliament were no less outraged , and the session was suspended afterwards .
in response to berlusconi 's attack , schulz said : " my respect for the victims of fascism will not permit me to deal with that kind of claim .
but it is very hard for me accept that a politician should be exercising the role of president of the european council if he comes out with this kind of statement when he encounters the slightest contradiction . "
berlusconi later explained that his comments were intended as an " ironic joke " and refused to apologize .
seeking to put out the wildfire on wednesday afternoon , berlusconi went a step further , but still fell short of apologizing when he told eu politicians meeting behind closed doors he " did not mean to offend the feelings of a country , feelings that have a historical motivation . "
but graham watson , the leader of the liberal democratic group in the european parliament , said berlusconi 's remarks " debase the presidency of the council and offend europe . "
a roadmap for italy 's eu presidency the bitter exchange distracted attention from the real message berlusconi came to deliver on wednesday – how italy planned to steer the eu during its term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi berlusconi -lrb- photo -rrb- said his country wanted to create a " new dynamic " in the transatlantic relationship and to push ahead with eastward expansion , calling for bulgaria and romania to be given a clear path in order to facilitate their eu membership by 2007 .
the italian prime minister also called for a " new deal " style increase in public infrastructure investment in order to stimulate economic growth – largely through rail and other public transport projects .
but he said countries should find a way to invest in infrastructure projects without resorting to stability pact-busting deficit spending .
but berlusconi ’ s major task for the next six months is to conduct negotiations after the start of an intergovernmental conference in october that will hammer out the final draft of the eu 's first constitution .
berlusconi would like to see approval of the constitution at a december summit in rome , the site where the 1957 treaty establishing the european community was signed .
highlighting the importance of europe ’ s role in the middle east , berlusconi said brussels should push along the " road map " to peace between the israelis and palestinians and contribute to the reconstruction effort in iraq in order to bring the two continents closer .
addressing recent problems with illegal immigrants entering europe from northern africa , hundreds of whom have perished in accidents on rickety boats , berlusconi called for the creation of an eu border patrol to guard its external borders as well as immigrant holding centers outside the eu .
italian officials believe that last month alone at least 3,000 illegal northern african immigrants landed on italian shores .
now , they want brussels to take action .
with strapped social systems across the union and a graying population , berlusconi also called for eu-wide measures " aimed at increasing the activity level of older workers and reducing trends toward pre-retirement " that strain federal pocketbooks .
among those measures would be a common eu approach to retirement systems . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the eu presidency according to silvio his party changed the law to to make him immune from prosecution and his criminal case was dropped .

an earnest project aided by marketing and branding experts is underway in london to jazz up germany ’ s humorless and stereotypically staid image in great britain as reflected in a recent survey . it ’ s no secret that germany ’ s image in britain is in bad shape .
whether it ’ s the tabloids taking a gibe with headlines like " herr we go – bring on the krauts " or " let ’ s blitz fritz " when england was pitted against germany in the 1996 european soccer championships , weekly television documentaries on hitler and concentration camps or papers such as the independent concluding recently that books with swastikas gracing the cover are guaranteed to be bestsellers , the british are still fed cliché-heavy doses of germany ’ s past .
the only other strong connection most british citizens have to the germans are parked in their garages : german cars have a brilliant reputation and reinforce the image of their makers as being reliable , punctual and efficient .
clueless about modern germany little wonder then that a recent survey conducted by the goethe institut , the german language and cultural center , and the british council turned out such negative results .
the poll , which quizzed young people between 16 and 25 years on their picture of modern germany , drew up mostly question marks .
although 37 percent of the british displayed a positive stance towards germany , they could only come up with beer and sport as the two things they identified with the country .
another 17 percent said they didn ’ t like germany and cited its military past , far-right tendencies and the apparent lack of manners and humor of the germans as reasons .
an astonishing 64 percent couldn ’ t name a single living famous german personality -lrb- supermodel claudia schiffer was mentioned a few times -rrb- .
another larger survey conducted for the goethe institut last year concluded that more than half the british population – 52 percent – said they didn ’ t have a clue about modern day germany .
more than hitler and nazi past alarmed by the unpopularity of its country and the widespread ignorance about it in britain , the goethe institut in london launched a campaign last year in british schools to promote itself as a fun-loving , cool nation .
" english students think the hitler theme with its smart uniforms and all is sexy , " head of the london goethe institut dr. ulrich sacker told deutsche welle .
" teachers have told me that it ’ s much easier to sell hitler than say environmental consciousness .
but what do you expect ?
every evening there ’ s at least one film on world war ii on british television . "
sacker says there ’ s just no information on german cultural and social life in britain .
" people just do not know about the other side , the more contemporary germany , the hedonistic side , the traveling spirit of the germans . "
cool britannia german style sacker now wants to bring contemporary germany to a larger british audience .
the goethe institut london has teamed up with a host of other organizations promoting german-british relations and founded a new initiative " creative capital foundation " to shape a new modern image of germany .
to start with , the foundation invited a slew of british travel journalists to the goethe institut earlier this week to expand their minds on the charms of the western german state of north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- along the river rhine .
" tourism is an important part of the process , the british usually never travel to germany , but prefer to go south , " dr. sacker explains .
" berlin was a focus last year , this time it ’ s nrw , and in 2005 it ’ ll be saxony , " sacker adds .
the foundation also organized a " british-german media bash " this week where german and british journalists , marketing and branding experts , thrashed out the role that politics , celebrities , media and advertising could play in spiking up germany ’ s dull image .
make love not war sacker opened the day-long seminar by showing two photographs of berlin ’ s famous victory column .
one from 1945 showed the monument surrounded by tanks and ruins , the other from the 1990s showed dancing revelers at the annual love parade , the world ’ s largest techno party .
" the british only know the war picture , " sacker was quoted in the berliner zeitung .
" but they should get to know the berlin of love , " he added .
sacker described the initiative - modeled along the lines of cool britannia , a campaign promoted by tony blair in the 1990s to liven up britain ’ s stuffy image from an old-fashioned nation of tweed- jacket-wearers to britpop and britart – as a " brainstorming session . "
" there were some interesting suggestions , but we ’ ve decided not to market germany as a brand .
it would only reduce the strong image that already exists about the country , " he says .
" instead we ’ re going to focus on adding interesting facets and snippets like the love parade , contemporary fashion , cuisine and karneval – that ’ s the only way to get the british interested . "
there ’ s no time frame as yet for when all the recommendations and brainstorming for spiffing up germany ’ s reputation will translate into action .
there ’ s talk of " strategy " and " high-quality projects . "
but sacker says " the important thing is that none of the end projects will have a moral finger teaching the british about germany .
instead they ’ ll all be infused with humor and irony . "
so watch out britannia , germany is rolling up its sleeves and heading your way with a serious charm offensive . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more fun please , we ’ re german !

through his work translating the bible , luther is also credited with reforming the german language , helping mold the modern usage that prevails today .
the main landmarks in a luther pilgrimage can be explored in a whistle-stop , three-day tour of lutherland .
please note : the tour has been organized by geographical rather than the chronology of luther 's life .
day one - eisleben martin luther was born on november 10 , 1483 , in eisleben , a town in the foothills of the harz mountains , in the eastern part of saxony-anhalt .
his birthplace , a simple but smart building now numbered 15 , stands in a street named after the man himself -lrb- entrance at seminarstrasse 16 -rrb- .
his father hans luther , who worked in the copper mines , and his mother margarethe , baptized baby martin in eisleben 's late gothic church of st. peter and paul - now another must-see destination on the luther tour .
the population of eisleben was then nearly 4,000 , and the town flourished thanks to the local silver and copper mining industry .
today , the population numbers some 20,000 , but people are moving away in droves .
unemployment is rife and young people have little choice but to seek work elsewhere .
but for fans of martin luther , the town is well worth a visit .
the house where the revolutionary reformer was born has been revered as a memorial site since 1693 , making it the oldest museum in germany .
to preserve luther 's memory , the town was bestowed with the epithet " lutherstadt " in 1946 .
in 1997 , the luther memorial sites were declared unesco world heritage sites .
day two - eisenach continuing in luther ’ s footsteps , travel on to eisenach , just under 150 kilometers away and less than a two-hour drive .
traditionally , the picturesque town on the northern edge of the thuringian forest was staunchly religious and was sarcastically described by luther as a " nest of priests . "
in the 15th century , one in ten of the town 's 4,000 inhabitants was involved in religion , and the town had no less than three churches and seven monasteries .
the young luther came here in 1498 to study at the prestigious latin school , now known as the martin-luther-gymnasium on the predigerplatz , or " preacher 's square . "
the " lutherhaus " -lrb- lutherplatz 8 -rrb- overlooking eisenach 's market square gives visitors a chance to explore luther 's life and work .
one highlight of the exhibition is the " lutherstuben " - two small rooms where the reformer is believed to have lived as a pupil until 1501 .
a few footsteps away from the house is the church of st. george , where luther earned extra money by singing in the choir .
a silent witness to this time is the font upon which johann sebastian bach , who was born in eisenach , was baptized in 1685 .
the reformer had fond memories of his four years in eisenach , which he later referred to as " my dear town . "
the town itself remembers and honors luther with a large memorial on the karlsplatz .
wartburg castle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wartburg castle in eisenach the next port-of-call on the luther trail literally looms over eisenach - wartburg castle , where the theologian spent his final , solitary years .
but before heading up to the imposing fortress , take a short detour to the village of steinach , nestled in a picturesque valley .
here , a large memorial has been erected recalling the detention of luther after he refused to retract publicly his teachings even when faced with a ban by the emperor of the holy roman empire at the diet of worms .
the inscription reads : " here marks the spot where dr. martin luther was taken away to wartburg castle upon the orders of friedrich the wise , elector of saxony . "
in fact , the powerful elector had been acting to protect luther .
friedrich believed that allowing the reformer to live incognito at his castle would serve to calm feverish anti-reformation activity .
the wartburg -lrb- schlossberg 2 -rrb- , perched high on a 1230-foot cliff overlooking eisenach , is one of germany 's most famous and well-preserved castles .
it was founded by duke ludwig of thuringia in 1067 .
like all other places connected with luther , it was declared a unesco world heritage site in 1997 .
the entire castle underwent a comprehensive renovation carried out by the east german government between 1952-1966 .
this included work on the room where luther lived for 300 days disguised as junker jörg .
the original floor and paneled walls have been retained and a wooden desk also dates from the lutheran era .
names and dates etched into the stone walls bear witness to the fact that the castle has been visited by christian pilgrims since the end of the 16th century .
most of luther 's time at wartburg castle was spent in quiet study , and it was here that he set about translating the new testament from its original greek into german .
with the publication of the new testament in september 1522 , luther laid the foundations for the german language as we know it today .
the style he adopted was highly descriptive and reflected common language usage , thereby making the texts accessible to all .
in the early 1530s , luther devoted himself to translating the old testament , leading to the publication of the first complete german edition of the bible in august 1534 .
as though completing the circle of his life , luther returned to eisleben , the town of his birth , in january 1546 .
on 17 february , luther complained of serious chest pain and took to his bed .
alarmed , his friends and children gathered around him .
asked by his friend , the court preacher justus jonas : " reverend father , will you stand firm in christ and the doctrine you have preached ? "
luther responded with a clearly audible : " yes " .
it was to be his dying word .
-lrb- you can visit the house where luther died at andreaskirchplatz 7 . -rrb-
two memorial services were held at st. andrew 's church -lrb- sanktandreasplatz -rrb- in eisleben .
in the afternoon of 20 february , the entourage accompanying luther 's body began its journey to wittenberg , arriving two days later .
luther 's body was interred in the castle church , in front of the pulpit .
in 1894 , the house where luther died in eisleben was declared an official memorial site .
erfurt less than 65 kilometers away , erfurt can be easily reached in just half an hour by car .
today , some 200,000 people live in the attractive capital of the state of thuringia .
it boasts one of the best-preserved medieval city centers in germany and is especially proud of its landmark krämer bridge - the longest house bridge in europe , complete with 32 residences .

-lrb- ap photo / jens meyer -rrb- - zu unserem korr - often cited as his spiritual home , martin luther moved here in 1501 , when erfurt was the sixth largest town in germany .
he lived in the town 's augustinian monastery -lrb- augustinerstrasse 10 -rrb- , now one of the most important destinations on the lutheran trail , and began his studies at the university , graduating in 1505 .
in 1507 , luther was ordained as a priest here .
today , luther 's quarters in the monastery have been reconstructed to create a sense of what daily life must have been like in this strict monastic order .
the monastery is also an architectural monument to medieval religious architecture , situated right in the old town of erfurt .
badly destroyed during world war ii , it was rebuilt in 1982 as part of celebrations marking the 500th birthday of martin luther .

2003 - marktplatz von der lutherstadt wittenberg in sachsen-anhalt some 200 kilometers away from erfurt lies wittenberg , the final destination on the luther tour .
luther spent 36 years of his life here – and the town is a treasure trove for luther pilgrims .
as a 25-year-old priest , luther was inducted as teacher at wittenberg university in 1508 .
the small town on the banks of the river elbe had just 2,000 inhabitants , and the pace of life was slow .
luther was said to have described it as town " on the edge of civilization " .
the priest lived with augustinian hermits , and today , visitors to wittenberg can explore his quarters , maintained in their original form , at the luther house , luther memorial foundation of saxony-anhalt .
the museum also houses the world 's largest collection of documents charting the history of the reformation , with more than 10,000 prints , 6,000 manuscripts , thousands of portraits of luther , 2,000 coins and medallions as well as 14,000 graphics .
the museum authorities completed a comprehensive restoration of these historic pieces , and a permanent exhibition opened in march , 2003 .
reformation begins in wittenberg it was during his years in wittenberg that luther made a name for himself as a reformer .
during a visit to rome in 1510 , the theologian was appalled by what he perceived as a corrupt catholic church .
a system to raise badly-needed funds for the rebuilding of st. peter 's , which involved papal emissaries selling indulgences , was being grossly abused .
in october 1517 , luther drew up a list of 95 theses questioning the right of the pope to forgive sins .
when he nailed the document to the door of the palace church -lrb- schlossplatz -rrb- in wittenberg , his actions caused ripples in rome , and he was summoned for an audience with pope leo x. the event heralded the beginning of the protestant reformation in germany - and ultimately , protestantism in general .
today the palace church is wittenberg 's main attraction for luther pilgrims .
luther continued to challenge the papacy .
in 1520 , he published his famous address " an den christlichen adel deutscher nation " -lrb- address to the christian nobility of the german nation -rrb- , followed by the treatise " de captivitate babylonica ecclesiae praeludium " -lrb- a prelude concerning the babylonian captivity of the church -rrb- , which also attacked the doctrinal system of the church of rome .
on december 10 of the same year , luther burned the papal bull issued against him before a gathering of doctors , students , and citizens in wittenberg , on a spot marked today by the legendary " lutheran oak " -lrb- located at the intersection of lutherstrasse and collegienstrasse -rrb- .
in 1522 , luther gave his first sermons in german at the church of st. marien -lrb- kirchplatz -rrb- in wittenberg .
the most remarkable work of art in this , the oldest building in wittenberg , is the cycle of paintings on the reformation altar by lucas cranach the elder , dedicated in 1547 .
the group on the right-hand side of the main panel refers to luther ' communion teachings and shows luther taking his place among the apostles at the last supper .
wittenberg is also home to one of germany 's most beautiful renaissance town halls , situated on the market square and flanked by a striking luther memorial .
originally planned for eisleben , the town of luther 's birth and death , it was brought to wittenberg on the orders of the prussian king friedrich wilhelm iii .
perhaps one of the most significant of the many artistic tributes to luther in germany , the memorial is the work of the berlin sculptor gottfried schadow , while the neo-gothic dais was designed by karl friedrich schinkel .
lucas cranach the elder , a friend of luther 's , was an artist whose paintings and graphics gave strong impetus to the reformation movement .
he also served as mayor here from 1537 to 1544 , as well as running the town 's apothecary - which still stands to this day - a book shop and a flourishing studio , which helped make wittenberg an important center for various artistic activities in germany .
still a controversial figure although there are over 70 million followers of the lutheran church worldwide , dr. martin luther remains a controversial figure .
initially a supporter of the jews , he became frustrated by their unwillingness to embrace his own religion , and emerged as one of the most bitter anti-semites in history .
in his writings , he described jews as poisoners , ritual murderers and parasites , preaching that they were worse than devils , that their synagogues should be burned to the ground and that they should be expelled from germany .
his detractors may argue that luther helped set the stage for the holocaust .
but for others , luthers was a spiritual genius , a man with a remarkable ability to inspire others with his passion and dedication to the christian faith . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links luther pilgrimages a guide to the official luther pilgrimage itinerary routes to luther further tips for tours of luther landmarks unesco world heritage sites unesco world heritage sites in eastern germany martin luther comprehensive information on martin luther 9800 dw-tv europe live projekt zukunft we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

through his work translating the bible , luther is also credited with reforming the german language , helping mold the modern usage that prevails today .
the main landmarks in a luther pilgrimage can be explored in a whistle-stop , three-day tour of lutherland .
please note : the tour has been organized by geographical rather than the chronology of luther 's life .
day one - eisleben martin luther was born on november 10 , 1483 , in eisleben , a town in the foothills of the harz mountains , in the eastern part of saxony-anhalt .
his birthplace , a simple but smart building now numbered 15 , stands in a street named after the man himself -lrb- entrance at seminarstrasse 16 -rrb- .
his father hans luther , who worked in the copper mines , and his mother margarethe , baptized baby martin in eisleben 's late gothic church of st. peter and paul - now another must-see destination on the luther tour .
the population of eisleben was then nearly 4,000 , and the town flourished thanks to the local silver and copper mining industry .
today , the population numbers some 20,000 , but people are moving away in droves .
unemployment is rife and young people have little choice but to seek work elsewhere .
but for fans of martin luther , the town is well worth a visit .
the house where the revolutionary reformer was born has been revered as a memorial site since 1693 , making it the oldest museum in germany .
to preserve luther 's memory , the town was bestowed with the epithet " lutherstadt " in 1946 .
in 1997 , the luther memorial sites were declared unesco world heritage sites .
day two - eisenach continuing in luther ’ s footsteps , travel on to eisenach , just under 150 kilometers away and less than a two-hour drive .
traditionally , the picturesque town on the northern edge of the thuringian forest was staunchly religious and was sarcastically described by luther as a " nest of priests . "
in the 15th century , one in ten of the town 's 4,000 inhabitants was involved in religion , and the town had no less than three churches and seven monasteries .
the young luther came here in 1498 to study at the prestigious latin school , now known as the martin-luther-gymnasium on the predigerplatz , or " preacher 's square . "
the " lutherhaus " -lrb- lutherplatz 8 -rrb- overlooking eisenach 's market square gives visitors a chance to explore luther 's life and work .
one highlight of the exhibition is the " lutherstuben " - two small rooms where the reformer is believed to have lived as a pupil until 1501 .
a few footsteps away from the house is the church of st. george , where luther earned extra money by singing in the choir .
a silent witness to this time is the font upon which johann sebastian bach , who was born in eisenach , was baptized in 1685 .
the reformer had fond memories of his four years in eisenach , which he later referred to as " my dear town . "
the town itself remembers and honors luther with a large memorial on the karlsplatz .
wartburg castle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wartburg castle in eisenach the next port-of-call on the luther trail literally looms over eisenach - wartburg castle , where the theologian spent his final , solitary years .
but before heading up to the imposing fortress , take a short detour to the village of steinach , nestled in a picturesque valley .
here , a large memorial has been erected recalling the detention of luther after he refused to retract publicly his teachings even when faced with a ban by the emperor of the holy roman empire at the diet of worms .
the inscription reads : " here marks the spot where dr. martin luther was taken away to wartburg castle upon the orders of friedrich the wise , elector of saxony . "
in fact , the powerful elector had been acting to protect luther .
friedrich believed that allowing the reformer to live incognito at his castle would serve to calm feverish anti-reformation activity .
the wartburg -lrb- schlossberg 2 -rrb- , perched high on a 1230-foot cliff overlooking eisenach , is one of germany 's most famous and well-preserved castles .
it was founded by duke ludwig of thuringia in 1067 .
like all other places connected with luther , it was declared a unesco world heritage site in 1997 .
the entire castle underwent a comprehensive renovation carried out by the east german government between 1952-1966 .
this included work on the room where luther lived for 300 days disguised as junker jörg .
the original floor and paneled walls have been retained and a wooden desk also dates from the lutheran era .
names and dates etched into the stone walls bear witness to the fact that the castle has been visited by christian pilgrims since the end of the 16th century .
most of luther 's time at wartburg castle was spent in quiet study , and it was here that he set about translating the new testament from its original greek into german .
with the publication of the new testament in september 1522 , luther laid the foundations for the german language as we know it today .
the style he adopted was highly descriptive and reflected common language usage , thereby making the texts accessible to all .
in the early 1530s , luther devoted himself to translating the old testament , leading to the publication of the first complete german edition of the bible in august 1534 .
as though completing the circle of his life , luther returned to eisleben , the town of his birth , in january 1546 .
on 17 february , luther complained of serious chest pain and took to his bed .
alarmed , his friends and children gathered around him .
asked by his friend , the court preacher justus jonas : " reverend father , will you stand firm in christ and the doctrine you have preached ? "
luther responded with a clearly audible : " yes " .
it was to be his dying word .
-lrb- you can visit the house where luther died at andreaskirchplatz 7 . -rrb-
two memorial services were held at st. andrew 's church -lrb- sanktandreasplatz -rrb- in eisleben .
in the afternoon of 20 february , the entourage accompanying luther 's body began its journey to wittenberg , arriving two days later .
luther 's body was interred in the castle church , in front of the pulpit .
in 1894 , the house where luther died in eisleben was declared an official memorial site .
erfurt less than 65 kilometers away , erfurt can be easily reached in just half an hour by car .
today , some 200,000 people live in the attractive capital of the state of thuringia .
it boasts one of the best-preserved medieval city centers in germany and is especially proud of its landmark krämer bridge - the longest house bridge in europe , complete with 32 residences .

-lrb- ap photo / jens meyer -rrb- - zu unserem korr - often cited as his spiritual home , martin luther moved here in 1501 , when erfurt was the sixth largest town in germany .
he lived in the town 's augustinian monastery -lrb- augustinerstrasse 10 -rrb- , now one of the most important destinations on the lutheran trail , and began his studies at the university , graduating in 1505 .
in 1507 , luther was ordained as a priest here .
today , luther 's quarters in the monastery have been reconstructed to create a sense of what daily life must have been like in this strict monastic order .
the monastery is also an architectural monument to medieval religious architecture , situated right in the old town of erfurt .
badly destroyed during world war ii , it was rebuilt in 1982 as part of celebrations marking the 500th birthday of martin luther .

unison , the local government union , claims janitors , cleaners and catering workers face being transferred to private companies if the scheme is approved .
the ppp plan will cost £ 74m to put into practice .
it would see two new secondary schools built in dunoon and helensburgh and a further 26 upgraded .
unison officials said they are concerned that there has not been an in-house bid for school services and believe it could have a knock on effect for jobs and the local economy .
however , argyll and bute council has accused the union of a deliberate attempt to throw a spanner in the works at a late stage in negotiations .
nearby inverclyde council recently ditched ppp proposals which would have meant £ 100m worth of investment in schools refurbishment .
a row broke out when the new liberal democrat authority decided it was too expensive to go ahead .
there have since been protests by angry parents as inverclyde council has not come up with alternative funding .

the house of commons ' public accounts committee said the loss , due to error and fraud , was " unacceptable " .
losses from income support and jobseeker 's allowance had been cut by 24 % since 1997-98 , but the rate of reduction has fallen back .
the committee said that the department for work and pensions -lrb- dwp -rrb- needs to reduce the complexity of the current system , even if it means less well-targeted and " perhaps more expensive " benefits .
' simpler system needed ' the committee chairman , conservative mp edward leigh , said : " the taxpayer is being ripped off by benefit fraudsters to the tune of £ 2 billion a year .
" the dwp have lost momentum in reducing this unacceptable level of fraud . "
commenting ahead of the public accounts committee report , called tackling benefit fraud , the shadow work and pensions secretary david willetts mp said : " this is a very serious report from the committee £ 2bn of welfare fraud is an absolute scandal .
" the tragedy of today 's benefit system is that billions of pounds goes to people who are not entitled to help while billions more is not claimed by families and pensioners who are entitled to it .
the taxpayer is being ripped off by benefit fraudsters to the tune of £ 2 billion a year pac chairman edward leigh " we need a simpler and fairer system otherwise the problems can only get worse . "
work and pensions minister chris pond said the government remained committed to achieving its target of reducing fraud and error by 50 % by 2006 .
earlier this year , the national audit office found efforts to tackle benefit fraud may be being hampered because fewer cases are being investigated .
it said the number of cases being investigated dropped by 12 % between 2001 and 2002 .

officials said it was not immediately clear what had happened at the plant , but there were no danger of radiation leakage and no reported injuries .
one report said the fire had started in an incinerator outside the reactor building used to burn low-level radiation items like workers clothing .
a local government spokesman said smoke emerging from the building quickly cleared and fire fighters did not need to turn on their hoses .
the nuclear plant , near tsuruga , 350 kilometres -lrb- 220 miles -rrb- west of the capital tokyo , is a research reactor which stopped generating power three months ago and is undergoing decommissioning .
the fugen reactor is owned by the government-funded japan nuclear cycle development institute .
the bbc tokyo correspondent says it has suffered a number of safety alerts over the past year , including a leak of radioactive steam .
japan 's nuclear industry has been hit by a series of accidents and safety scandals in recent years - including the country 's worst ever nuclear accident in 1999 , when two people were killed because of lax safety standards .
nuclear plants owned by tokyo electric power company -lrb- tepco -rrb- have been shut down this summer for safety checks , leading to fears of power shortages in the capital .

officials said it was not immediately clear what had happened at the plant , but there were no danger of radiation leakage and no reported injuries .
one report said the fire had started in an incinerator outside the reactor building used to burn low-level radiation items like workers clothing .
a local government spokesman said smoke emerging from the building quickly cleared and fire fighters did not need to turn on their hoses .
the nuclear plant , near tsuruga , 350 kilometres -lrb- 220 miles -rrb- west of the capital tokyo , is a research reactor which stopped generating power three months ago and is undergoing decommissioning .
the fugen reactor is owned by the government-funded japan nuclear cycle development institute .
the bbc tokyo correspondent says it has suffered a number of safety alerts over the past year , including a leak of radioactive steam .
japan 's nuclear industry has been hit by a series of accidents and safety scandals in recent years - including the country 's worst ever nuclear accident in 1999 , when two people were killed because of lax safety standards .
nuclear plants owned by tokyo electric power company -lrb- tepco -rrb- have been shut down this summer for safety checks , leading to fears of power shortages in the capital .

matthew martin killed his father , 56-year-old michael martin , with a pickaxe at his home in almondsbury only three months after his release from exeter prison in 1999 .
the new north road jail was among a number of agencies involved in the care and treatment of matthew martin .
the inquiry on thursday said no single action or omission was to blame , but it highlighted a number of shortcomings in matthew martin 's care and treatment , both during and after his short time in jail .
we give our assurance that the recommendations in the report will be fully implemented ian sinnett , prison healthcare cluster manager michael martin had been afraid of his 25-year-old son for some time - he had hidden knives from him and even programmed 999 into his mobile phone .
but despite his father 's numerous pleas for help , the paranoid schizophrenic slipped through the healthcare system - which could have stopped the killing , the independent inquiry concluded .
officials at the devon jail said new procedures were being introduced to try to prevent such a tragedy happening again .
prison healthcare cluster manager ian sinnett said : " we would like to offer our deepest sympathy to mr martin 's family .
" we give our assurance that the recommendations in the report will be fully implemented .
" some reports that prisoners prepare with their solicitors are confidential between them , and we are implementing procedures where we can ask them early for their consent for healthcare professionals to have that information .
appropriate assessment " in addition , there is £ 168,000 of new funding to develop mental health in-reach services which will ensure the appropriate assessment , treatment and through care of prisoners with mental health needs .
" it will specifically address those who pose particular risks . "
matthew martin pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility at bristol crown court in 2000 and was sent to a secure unit under the mental health act .
the inquiry report listed a number of blunders , including missing prison records , a shortage of social workers and martin being " mysteriously " deleted from a computer database which would have triggered a check on him .
the report said he was also released back into the community from exeter prison after being on remand for firing an airgun in plymouth with no psychiatric assessment , no home address , no medication and no planned medical appointments .

friday sees the opening of a new stretch of track , with full scheduled services starting on saturday .
the railway could eventually link the east coast main line with the settle-to-carlisle pennines route 40 miles away .
it is being operated by the wensleydale railway company which has raised £ 1.2m to provide a commercial service in an area where busy country roads are the only alternative means of transport .
the company is clear it is not the product of rail enthusiasts but a genuine commercial operation .
the 12 miles of revamped track can hardly offer a comprehensive service .
work was needed on the disused track initially it is likely to attract more tourists than locals , but could eventually provide a major link .
with maintenance costs just a fraction of those on busier routes , the wensleydale railway could be looked on enviously by bigger but beleaguered commuter train operators .
most services will be diesel-powered , although on bank holidays steam may also return .
built in 1848 , the railway largely ceased to operate in the 1950s with burgeoning car use .
some of the track has been so rarely used - by the occasional freight train - that local people have adopted it as an unofficial footpath .
local business the company is taking a 99-year lease on the line , effectively making it one of the uk 's longest rail franchises .
scott handley , the railway 's chief executive , said : " lots of people want to see the railway back in wensleydale as they know it will make a difference to their lives .
when people visit wensleydale at the moment they take their cars and do n't spend as much as they might with local businesses .
" we know that by taking them by train , local firms will benefit . "

the couple - who are requesting joint custody of their adopted three-year-old son , roan - said in a statement they are parting on friendly terms .
" we 're committed to being great parents and having a friendship , as parents , moving forward , " the statement said .
" we intend to keep our son 's happiness as our foremost priority and thank you for allowing us to keep this a private family matter . "
stone , 45 , and bronstein , 52 , married on 14 february , 1998 .
" there will be no drama here .
they both have the interests of their three-year-old at heart and are trying to resolve this in a very private manner , " bronstein 's lawyer nordin blacker said .
" they are trying to achieve an amicable and mutual dissolution of their marriage and are committed to being parents of their child and to doing this in as friendly and non-controversial a manner as possible . "
bronstein , who is executive editor of the san francisco chronicle , indicated in papers filed at california superior court that a financial settlement would be negotiated separately .
rumours rumours about the marriage had been circulating around hollywood for some months , and on thursday the new york post reported the couple were already living apart , with stone moving to los angeles .
the paper claimed the pair split after she returned from making her latest film , a different loyalty , in london and moscow .
stone shot into the spotlight thanks to the 1992 sexual thriller basic instinct , in which she played a killer suspected of luring her prey by seducing them .
but since then her career has cooled , and in 2001 she suffered a stroke .
she said afterwards she almost died after internal bleeding caused by a tear in an artery at the base of her skull .
in the same year , bronstein was attacked by a komodo dragon during a visit to los angeles zoo , and needed emergency surgery on his toe .
stone has been married once before , to film producer michael greenberg .

the medieval library at chartres , france , was destroyed in an allied bombing raid on the evening of 26 may , 1944 .
the collection , then housed in an annexe of chartres town hall , comprised around 2,000 medieval books and parchments , many of which dated to the 12th century .
the library was considered a national treasure and a good proportion of the works were unpublished .
after the fire was quelled , volunteers moved in to save what they could from the smouldering ruins .
although thousands of texts were recovered , the fierce inferno carbonised the majority , rendering them unreadable .
but digital technology called multispectral imaging may now be able to reveal text on even the most badly burned manuscripts , allowing scholars to study them again .
non-invasive technique a key member of the team using multispectral imaging to decipher burned scrolls from the roman town of herculaneum , which was buried by the eruption of the volcano vesuvius in ad 79 , says the technique could be ideal for reading the damaged chartres manuscripts .
" the beauty of -lsb- multispectral imaging -rsb- is that it is not invasive , " professor richard janko of the university of michigan , us , told bbc news online .
" it 's worth a trial -lsb- on the chartres texts -rsb- .
it could do a lot for the study of medieval literature , " he added .
" the library at chartres was possibly the greatest medieval library , " said associate professor constant mews , an expert in medieval literature at monash university in victoria , australia .
multispectral imaging is widely used on satellites that produce detailed images of the earth .
but it is now gaining ground as a technique in archaeological restoration .
researchers take several images of a manuscript with a special multispectral camera .
the photos are then passed through different filters to produce a set of images viewed at different wavelengths of light .
these wavelengths range from colours in the visible spectrum to infrared and ultraviolet light - which are invisible to the naked eye .
this image set is then processed to show up subtle features on the page , revealing text previously concealed from human vision .
like the manuscripts from chartres , the herculaneum scrolls were carbonised by intense heat .
but manuscripts from chartres were also dowsed in water from fire hoses , which has had a particularly damaging effect on the rolled-up parchments .
" the action of water after the fire vitrified the parchments , making them like glass .
they are also very breakable , " said dominique poirel , a research engineer at the institut de recherche et d 'histoire des textes in paris , france .
it is not known whether this will pose any obstacle to reading the parchments with multispectral imaging .
fateful raid there are two alternative accounts of the events that led to the destruction of the library .
some contemporary newspaper reports say a british plane , hit by german fire , dropped its bombs on the library as it fell from the sky .
but another version of the story maintains that a german pilot released his bombs over chartres by accident , prompting other pilots in his formation to do the same .
one of these bombs hit the library , causing the fire .
at the beginning of hostilities in 1939 , the precious manuscripts were moved to chateau de villebon , a country house about 20 kilometres outside chartres and deemed a safe location .
but in 1940 , an official in the town 's new german administration ordered the texts be returned to the library premises .
ironically , this was a propaganda move designed to reassure the town 's inhabitants that they had nothing to fear from nazi occupation .
the centrepiece of the collection was the heptateuchon , a treatise on the arts by the 12th century philosopher thierry de chartres .
mr poirel said that while some pages of the heptateuchon were still intact , much of it had been damaged by fire .
mr poirel said he had not yet looked into the possibility of using multispectral imaging to decipher texts from the medieval library but added : " if there were some reason to -lsb- request funding -rsb- we would . "

researchers take several images of a manuscript with a special multispectral camera .

like the manuscripts from chartres , the herculaneum scrolls were carbonised by intense heat .
but manuscripts from chartres were also dowsed in water from fire hoses , which has had a particularly damaging effect on the rolled-up parchments .
" the action of water after the fire vitrified the parchments , making them like glass .

some contemporary newspaper reports say a british plane , hit by german fire , dropped its bombs on the library as it fell from the sky .

one of these bombs hit the library , causing the fire .

aston villa supporters want to raise funds to make an offer for the shareholding of chairman and chief executive doug ellis .
last season , aston villa finished a lowly sixteenth in the premiership , which added to the frustration of fans who complain the club has underachieved since winning the european cup in 1982 .
in april , some of those supporters formed a group called villa fans combined -lrb- vfc -rrb- , with the stated aim of bringing about a " root and branch change " in the club 's boardroom .
vfc commissioned businessman howard hodgson to prepare a report on the workings of the club , which he presented to a meeting of vfc supporters on saturday .
if we could combine a section of the existing supporter-shareholders with a buyout of some of mr ellis ' holding , there could be quite a change at the club howard hodgson mr hodgson told bbc news online : " i 've always understood the fans ' frustration and their calls for the board to go , but i equally see that this is not only not achievable but also quite unfair on the board .
" you ca n't just expect the board to go - unless it is an enron type situation , which this is n't - and the board is unlikely to be removed lock , stock and barrel . "
aston villa directors have offered to meet with vfc and mr hodgson sees two aims for that meeting .
" first , to try and persuade the board to seriously consider supporting the nomination of a supporters representative as a non-executive director .
" secondly , over time supporters would like to purchase shares from mr ellis .
" these shares would be held by a ' corporation ' of supporters so the fans are in a position to have a larger say in how the club is run . "
' no better alternative ' however , mr hodgson has warned fans that gaining a seat on the board will not be easy .
" there is already the aston villa supporters ' trust which has started down this path and has looked at how it has operated at other clubs .
" trying to get all the supporters moving in the same direction and putting their hands in their pockets is not an easy thing to achieve .
aston villa directors doug ellis -lrb- pictured -rrb- chairman , chief executive , largest shareholder mark ansell deputy chief executive , finance director steven stride operations director anthony hales non-executive director peter ellis non-executive director david owen non-executive director " but there is no better alternative because if the supporters do n't attempt to get a block of shares , it means eventually that mr ellis will be replaced by another mr ellis - one man in control .
" ideally , if we could combine a section of the existing supporter-shareholders with a buyout of some of mr ellis ' holding , there could be quite a change at the club . "
mr hodgson added : " what the vfc meetings and the report have shown is how many clever people there are out there .
" we 've been approached by a corporate lawyer and a corporate finance expert who have offered their services free of charge .
we are getting quite a strong political team together .
" in the past there has been too much arguing among the various supporters groups when unity is required .
" i do n't want an organisation like the supporters ' trust to think it is not a part of this because we would welcome its participation . "
although villa fans have long campaigned for the entire board to resign , mr hodgson believes there should be a more democratic board and ownership , but with doug ellis becoming a non-executive chairman and other directors staying at the club .
" you have to be objective rather than just say the board must go , because short of a 1917 style soviet revolution that is not going to be achieved .
" change has to be in co-operation with the board and if people are n't prepared to do that then they are not really going to get anywhere . "
aston villa declined to comment to bbc news online , however a director did confirm an offer of a meeting with vfc had been issued .

aston villa supporters want to raise funds to make an offer for the shareholding of chairman and chief executive doug ellis .
last season , aston villa finished a lowly sixteenth in the premiership , which added to the frustration of fans who complain the club has underachieved since winning the european cup in 1982 .
in april , some of those supporters formed a group called villa fans combined -lrb- vfc -rrb- , with the stated aim of bringing about a " root and branch change " in the club 's boardroom .
vfc commissioned businessman howard hodgson to prepare a report on the workings of the club , which he presented to a meeting of vfc supporters on saturday .
if we could combine a section of the existing supporter-shareholders with a buyout of some of mr ellis ' holding , there could be quite a change at the club howard hodgson mr hodgson told bbc news online : " i 've always understood the fans ' frustration and their calls for the board to go , but i equally see that this is not only not achievable but also quite unfair on the board .
" you ca n't just expect the board to go - unless it is an enron type situation , which this is n't - and the board is unlikely to be removed lock , stock and barrel . "
aston villa directors have offered to meet with vfc and mr hodgson sees two aims for that meeting .
" first , to try and persuade the board to seriously consider supporting the nomination of a supporters representative as a non-executive director .
" secondly , over time supporters would like to purchase shares from mr ellis .
" these shares would be held by a ' corporation ' of supporters so the fans are in a position to have a larger say in how the club is run . "
' no better alternative ' however , mr hodgson has warned fans that gaining a seat on the board will not be easy .
" there is already the aston villa supporters ' trust which has started down this path and has looked at how it has operated at other clubs .
" trying to get all the supporters moving in the same direction and putting their hands in their pockets is not an easy thing to achieve .

" ideally , if we could combine a section of the existing supporter-shareholders with a buyout of some of mr ellis ' holding , there could be quite a change at the club . "
mr hodgson added : " what the vfc meetings and the report have shown is how many clever people there are out there .
" we 've been approached by a corporate lawyer and a corporate finance expert who have offered their services free of charge .
we are getting quite a strong political team together .

" i do n't want an organisation like the supporters ' trust to think it is not a part of this because we would welcome its participation . "
although villa fans have long campaigned for the entire board to resign , mr hodgson believes there should be a more democratic board and ownership , but with doug ellis becoming a non-executive chairman and other directors staying at the club .

unison , the local government union , claims janitors , cleaners and catering workers face being transferred to private companies if the scheme is approved .
the ppp plan will cost £ 74m to put into practice .
it would see two new secondary schools built in dunoon and helensburgh and a further 26 upgraded .
unison officials said they are concerned that there has not been an in-house bid for school services and believe it could have a knock on effect for jobs and the local economy .
however , argyll and bute council has accused the union of a deliberate attempt to throw a spanner in the works at a late stage in negotiations .
nearby inverclyde council recently ditched ppp proposals which would have meant £ 100m worth of investment in schools refurbishment .
a row broke out when the new liberal democrat authority decided it was too expensive to go ahead .
there have since been protests by angry parents as inverclyde council has not come up with alternative funding .
