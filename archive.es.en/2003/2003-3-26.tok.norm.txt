as the united nations negotiates an aid and reconstruction resolution in the coming days , europe is determined to get the u.n. heavily involved in post-saddam iraq , and the u.s. out as quickly as possible . as coalition forces meet with continued fierce resistance in the iraqi desert , united nations security council members are beginning discreet negotiations on an aid and reconstruction resolution on post-saddam iraq .
at stake is a war-ravaged nation and the region 's post-war stability .
security council members france , russia , germany and syria , all heavily anti-war , do n't want the united states to control the post-war administration in iraq , even if only for a short period .
security council members will meet wednesday evening on a request from the arab league . u.s. officials have said in recent days that they agree that the united nations must back any sort of post-war regime in baghdad . they maintain they want to stay in iraq only as long as it takes to stabilize the country . blair stresses importance on u.n. in post-war iraq in part to heal the rift , british prime minister tony blair is meeting with u.s. president george w. bush on wednesday at camp david . " it is common ground between us that the united nations has got to be involved in post-conflict iraq , " blair told a london news conference on the eve of his departure .
" i can assure you that it is our desire to ensure that the u.n. are centrally involved . " some think that a bush agreement on u.n. involvement could close over some of the rifts opened in the u.n. and europe by the coalition forces ' invasion of iraq . one thing is for sure , says transatlantic analyst steven everts at the centre for european reform in london : " without that , it 's not going to happen .
you will see a repetition and exacerbation of the disputes . " " the way the reconstruction is going to be handled will be totally dependent on what blair can get out of bush in terms of the u.n. mandate and role , " everts told dw-world .
" if bush thinks the war is going great than he will resist blair 's pressure to put the u.n. in a political role in iraq . " blair 's next and final stop in the u.s. on thursday will be kofi annan 's office at the united nations .
agreement on a resolution in the new york city-based body will be a massive undertaking , if current negotiations on the resumption of the oil-for-food program are any indication . oil-for-food aid on the negotiating block the program , which allows iraq to purchase humanitarian aid using its oil revenues , was temporarily suspended with the onset of the war , a week ago .
u.n. security council members are working on a resolution that would have the u.n. work only temporarily with the united states following the end of the war .
france , russia , china and syria , all staunch opponents of the war , are wary of fashioning a resolution that would have the u.n. fully cooperate with the u.s. and great britain , and thus give indirect support to the coalition invasion of iraq . germany , which currently heads the planning committee responsible for reconstruction , is optimistic an agreement can be reached as early as wednesday .
" we are trying to find a solution that would reflect a compromise to which everybody has to contribute because there are very differing interests involved , " german u.n. ambassador gunter pleuger told the associated press . aid , fast in the meantime , european governments are lining up with pledges of immediate humanitarian aid .
the german government has promised 50 million euro -lrb- $ 53.4 million -rrb- in immediate aid to relieve the immense humanitarian crisis currently facing iraqis .
chancellor gerhard schröder last friday also signed onto a pledge by the european commission to provide 100 million euro in aid . thousands of iraqis are going hungry and suffering from dehydration as u.s. and british troops battle with guerrilla soldiers in the southern cities of basra and umm qasr .
the suspension of the oil-for food program , on which 16 million of the 25 million iraqis are dependent has added to the humanitarian crisis brought on by war . military officials said wednesday that the first seven-truck food convoy from kuwait had arrived at umm qasr and that ships would be allowed in shortly .
the u.s. navy has been working to clear iraq 's only deep-water port of mines . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de humanitarian crisis looms in iraq aid agencies are warning that a humanitarian crisis could unfold in iraq if emergency supplies are not brought in soon .
a french aid organization has accused the united states of using food as a weapon .

germany 's highest court ruled that the parliament does not have to vote on the deployment of air crews to turkey , a nato member .
but the opposition will push a bill that requires a vote on such missions in the future . german chancellor gerhard schröder , under legal fire for his decision to provide military support to nato during the war against iraq , won the support of the country 's highest court late tuesday for deciding to help the alliance member turkey monitor its airspace for potential threats from iraq .
the federal constitutional court threw out a request from a small opposition party , the free democrats , that the justices require the nation 's parliament to vote on the deployment of the surveillance plane crews .
the justices said they would not require the parliament to vote because the country needed to be a reliable partner in foreign policy issues .
they said that requiring the vote now could cause extensive damage to germany 's standing in the international community , particularly if the country were required to remove the aircrews from the planes .
the government expressed satisfaction with the ruling .
" i welcome this decision very much because it gives the federal government the leeway it needs in foreign-policy issues - particularly during this difficult time , " german defense minister peter struck said .
new law will be urged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle the leader of the free democrats , guido westerwelle -lrb- photo -rrb- , said he would accept the decision for now , but would launch a parliamentary effort to require lawmakers to vote on every foreign deployment of german troops .
currently , the parliament is required to vote on foreign deployments that are not being carried out by the north atlantic treaty organization , whose 19 members have pledged to defend one another .
the issue of nato assistance to turkey triggered one of the worst crises in nato 's 53-year history .
germany , france and belgium , opponents of a possible u.s. war against iraq at the time , vetoed the america request to assist turkey in february .
all three maintained that such preparations would indicate that a war against iraq was inevitable .
the alliance 's leadership worked out a compromise after six days of talks , and nato eventually sent four of the awacs -lrb- airborne warning and control systems -rrb- planes to turkey to watch over the country 's airspace .
germany is providing one-third of the air crews , about 20 servicemembers .
if the country pulled out those crew members , the alliance could not continue the mission .
after accepting the compromise , chancellor schröder was forced to defend the decision amid criticism from the free democrats and other opposition members who maintained that the deployment was a foreign military mission that the parliament must consider .
" we still doubt where the deployment of awacs planes is legal , " michael glos of the opposition party christian social union said last week .
those doubts stem from the planes ' ability to watch over turkey 's airspace and simultaneously look deeply into iraq 's , glos said .
chancellor defends decision schröder rejected the call for a vote , saying the planes were under the control of nato 's supreme allied commander europe and not the united states .
" therefore , no vote by the parliament is necessary , " he told the nation 's lawmakers last week .
despite his support of the mission in the parliament , the chancellor still has doubts about the air crews ' role in turkey .
these doubts stem from the possibility that turkey will send an invasion force into northern iraq and trigger a conflict with the kurds who have enjoyed autonomy there since the first persian gulf war ended in 1991 .
on saturday , schröder convened his security cabinet to discuss the issue after he heard media reports that turkey had begun to deploy troops .
after the meeting , foreign minister joschka fischer issued a threat to the turkish government .
" if turkey becomes involved in the war , then it ’ s a new situation for us , and it would cause the removal of german servicemembers from the awacs aircraft , " fischer said .
small numbers of turkish troops have been in northern iraq since the 1990s , operating against rebel turkish kurds who have retreated there .
turkey is concerned that a kurdish state could emerge after the war against iraq and would reignite the armed kurdish separatism in southeastern turkey that cost 30,000 lives in the 1980s and 1990s .
iraqi kurdish groups fear turkey might move to crush their autonomy .
opposition arises over base use separately , schröder has been under pressure over support he is providing the united states in its war against iraq .
at issue is his decision to allow the united states to use its military bases in germany and german airspace to conduct operations against iraq .
on wednesday , the day before the united states opened its war to overthrow saddam hussein , schröder defended his decisions in an address to parliament .
" there may indeed be different opinions on international law , " the chancellor said .
" but because of our obligations to -lrb- nato -rrb- , we will permit the use of the bases , will not ban the use of german airspace , and we will naturally provide security for the facilities of our friends .

" some think that a bush agreement on u.n. involvement could close over some of the rifts opened in the u.n. and europe by the coalition forces ' invasion of iraq . one thing is for sure , says transatlantic analyst steven everts at the centre for european reform in london : " without that , it 's not going to happen .
you will see a repetition and exacerbation of the disputes . " " the way the reconstruction is going to be handled will be totally dependent on what blair can get out of bush in terms of the u.n. mandate and role , " everts told dw-world .
" if bush thinks the war is going great than he will resist blair 's pressure to put the u.n. in a political role in iraq . " blair 's next and final stop in the u.s. on thursday will be kofi annan 's office at the united nations .
agreement on a resolution in the new york city-based body will be a massive undertaking , if current negotiations on the resumption of the oil-for-food program are any indication . oil-for-food aid on the negotiating block the program , which allows iraq to purchase humanitarian aid using its oil revenues , was temporarily suspended with the onset of the war , a week ago .
u.n. security council members are working on a resolution that would have the u.n. work only temporarily with the united states following the end of the war .
france , russia , china and syria , all staunch opponents of the war , are wary of fashioning a resolution that would have the u.n. fully cooperate with the u.s. and great britain , and thus give indirect support to the coalition invasion of iraq . germany , which currently heads the planning committee responsible for reconstruction , is optimistic an agreement can be reached as early as wednesday .
" we are trying to find a solution that would reflect a compromise to which everybody has to contribute because there are very differing interests involved , " german u.n. ambassador gunter pleuger told the associated press . aid , fast in the meantime , european governments are lining up with pledges of immediate humanitarian aid .
the german government has promised 50 million euro -lrb- $ 53.4 million -rrb- in immediate aid to relieve the immense humanitarian crisis currently facing iraqis .
chancellor gerhard schröder last friday also signed onto a pledge by the european commission to provide 100 million euro in aid . thousands of iraqis are going hungry and suffering from dehydration as u.s. and british troops battle with guerrilla soldiers in the southern cities of basra and umm qasr .
the suspension of the oil-for food program , on which 16 million of the 25 million iraqis are dependent has added to the humanitarian crisis brought on by war . military officials said wednesday that the first seven-truck food convoy from kuwait had arrived at umm qasr and that ships would be allowed in shortly .

the pentagon and u.s. media are very pleased with the way " embedded " correspondents are covering the war .
in europe , the media community is more skeptical . this was a new form of on-the-scene reporting .
a wounded u.s. marine , josh menard , was lying on a stretcher this week and talking to kerry sanders , a reporter from the u.s. television network nbc .
" i 'm all right , " said the 21-year-old corporal , whose left hand had been ripped open by an iraqi bullet .
" it just hurts pretty bad . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers as the war enters its second week , america 's media corps are expressing their satisfaction with the results of the sweeping pentagon public relations effort .
but some observers , including those in germany , are raising doubts about a form of reporting that has journalists living and possibly dying with the people they are covering .
the idea represents a sea change in pentagon officials ' thinking about war reporting .
having watched critical television reports about the vietnam war in the 1960s and early 1970s undermine support for u.s. forces , the leadership decided to keep most reporters at a safe distance from the troops during the first persian gulf war in 1991 and the nato war over kosovo in 1999 .
today , openness is the priority .
" here 's why embedding is important to me , " col. rick thomas , chief of u.s. military public affairs in kuwait , told the british newspaper the financial times .
" as the public affairs officer , i have a deep and abiding obligation to tell the families of our servicemembers what they are doing . ...
my objective is that through the journalists ' eyes and through their words and images , mothers and fathers will understand the courage , dedication and sacrifices of their sons and daughters . "
rules dictate reporters ' way of working but before reporters can send out their dispatches , they have to make sure their reports are in line with a 50-point set of pentagon rules .
these rules include a prohibition on " information on effectiveness of enemy camouflage , cover , deception , targeting , direct and indirect fire , intelligence collection , or security measures . " the rules also prohibit disclosure of anything involving future operations and discussion of " unique " tactics employed by the military .
a veteran german television journalist , jörg armbruster , said in a recent interview with dw-world that he had deep doubts about the new approach .
" i think it is very problematic when you ca n't distinguish between the soldiers and reporters , " said armbruster , who was covering iraq from baghdad until the war began .
such concerns are shared by andy rooney , the veteran cbs television commentator who flew on bombing missions over germany in world war ii as a correspondent for military newspaper the stars and stripes .
" it 's very difficult to write anything critical about a guy you 're going to have breakfast with the next morning , " rooney told the newspaper usa today .
the famous world war ii correspondent " ernie pyle did n't write any stories about cowards in world war ii , even though there were some .
i suspect in this war , we 're going to get a lot of stories about heroes . "
armbruster also raised questions about the value of reporting conducted under the cover of the pentagon 's rules .
" the war can not be reported under such conditions , " he said .
despite the restrictions , members of the u.s. media are pleased with the program so far .
" in our view , it 's working out very , very , very , very well , " marcy mcginnis , senior vice president of news coverage for cbs news , told the associated press .
program could backfire while german journalists like armbruster question the value of the program itself , the director of the european media institute in düsseldorf said he suspected that the pentagon could face another vietnam-like disaster if the war went offtrack .
jo groebel said the war began with a letdown for the pentagon leaders hungry for images of iraqis celebrating their liberation from saddam hussein 's regime .
" the big celebration has not happened yet , " groebel told the german news agency dpa .
" that is a visual disappointment . "
a succession of such setbacks would undermine support of the government 's war effort , he said .

rules dictate reporters ' way of working but before reporters can send out their dispatches , they have to make sure their reports are in line with a 50-point set of pentagon rules .
these rules include a prohibition on " information on effectiveness of enemy camouflage , cover , deception , targeting , direct and indirect fire , intelligence collection , or security measures . " the rules also prohibit disclosure of anything involving future operations and discussion of " unique " tactics employed by the military .
a veteran german television journalist , jörg armbruster , said in a recent interview with dw-world that he had deep doubts about the new approach .
" i think it is very problematic when you ca n't distinguish between the soldiers and reporters , " said armbruster , who was covering iraq from baghdad until the war began .
such concerns are shared by andy rooney , the veteran cbs television commentator who flew on bombing missions over germany in world war ii as a correspondent for military newspaper the stars and stripes .
" it 's very difficult to write anything critical about a guy you 're going to have breakfast with the next morning , " rooney told the newspaper usa today .
the famous world war ii correspondent " ernie pyle did n't write any stories about cowards in world war ii , even though there were some .
i suspect in this war , we 're going to get a lot of stories about heroes . "
armbruster also raised questions about the value of reporting conducted under the cover of the pentagon 's rules .
" the war can not be reported under such conditions , " he said .
despite the restrictions , members of the u.s. media are pleased with the program so far .
" in our view , it 's working out very , very , very , very well , " marcy mcginnis , senior vice president of news coverage for cbs news , told the associated press .

jo groebel said the war began with a letdown for the pentagon leaders hungry for images of iraqis celebrating their liberation from saddam hussein 's regime .

as the united nations negotiates an aid and reconstruction resolution in the coming days , europe is determined to get the u.n. heavily involved in post-saddam iraq , and the u.s. out as quickly as possible . as coalition forces meet with continued fierce resistance in the iraqi desert , united nations security council members are beginning discreet negotiations on an aid and reconstruction resolution on post-saddam iraq .
at stake is a war-ravaged nation and the region 's post-war stability .
security council members france , russia , germany and syria , all heavily anti-war , do n't want the united states to control the post-war administration in iraq , even if only for a short period .
security council members will meet wednesday evening on a request from the arab league . u.s. officials have said in recent days that they agree that the united nations must back any sort of post-war regime in baghdad . they maintain they want to stay in iraq only as long as it takes to stabilize the country . blair stresses importance on u.n. in post-war iraq in part to heal the rift , british prime minister tony blair is meeting with u.s. president george w. bush on wednesday at camp david . " it is common ground between us that the united nations has got to be involved in post-conflict iraq , " blair told a london news conference on the eve of his departure .
" i can assure you that it is our desire to ensure that the u.n. are centrally involved . " some think that a bush agreement on u.n. involvement could close over some of the rifts opened in the u.n. and europe by the coalition forces ' invasion of iraq . one thing is for sure , says transatlantic analyst steven everts at the centre for european reform in london : " without that , it 's not going to happen .
you will see a repetition and exacerbation of the disputes . " " the way the reconstruction is going to be handled will be totally dependent on what blair can get out of bush in terms of the u.n. mandate and role , " everts told dw-world .
" if bush thinks the war is going great than he will resist blair 's pressure to put the u.n. in a political role in iraq . " blair 's next and final stop in the u.s. on thursday will be kofi annan 's office at the united nations .
agreement on a resolution in the new york city-based body will be a massive undertaking , if current negotiations on the resumption of the oil-for-food program are any indication . oil-for-food aid on the negotiating block the program , which allows iraq to purchase humanitarian aid using its oil revenues , was temporarily suspended with the onset of the war , a week ago .
u.n. security council members are working on a resolution that would have the u.n. work only temporarily with the united states following the end of the war .
france , russia , china and syria , all staunch opponents of the war , are wary of fashioning a resolution that would have the u.n. fully cooperate with the u.s. and great britain , and thus give indirect support to the coalition invasion of iraq . germany , which currently heads the planning committee responsible for reconstruction , is optimistic an agreement can be reached as early as wednesday .
" we are trying to find a solution that would reflect a compromise to which everybody has to contribute because there are very differing interests involved , " german u.n. ambassador gunter pleuger told the associated press . aid , fast in the meantime , european governments are lining up with pledges of immediate humanitarian aid .
the german government has promised 50 million euro -lrb- $ 53.4 million -rrb- in immediate aid to relieve the immense humanitarian crisis currently facing iraqis .
chancellor gerhard schröder last friday also signed onto a pledge by the european commission to provide 100 million euro in aid . thousands of iraqis are going hungry and suffering from dehydration as u.s. and british troops battle with guerrilla soldiers in the southern cities of basra and umm qasr .
the suspension of the oil-for food program , on which 16 million of the 25 million iraqis are dependent has added to the humanitarian crisis brought on by war . military officials said wednesday that the first seven-truck food convoy from kuwait had arrived at umm qasr and that ships would be allowed in shortly .
the u.s. navy has been working to clear iraq 's only deep-water port of mines . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de humanitarian crisis looms in iraq aid agencies are warning that a humanitarian crisis could unfold in iraq if emergency supplies are not brought in soon .
a french aid organization has accused the united states of using food as a weapon .

the pentagon and u.s. media are very pleased with the way " embedded " correspondents are covering the war .
in europe , the media community is more skeptical . this was a new form of on-the-scene reporting .
a wounded u.s. marine , josh menard , was lying on a stretcher this week and talking to kerry sanders , a reporter from the u.s. television network nbc .
" i 'm all right , " said the 21-year-old corporal , whose left hand had been ripped open by an iraqi bullet .
" it just hurts pretty bad . "
then , sanders popped the question : " got any family members you want to look in the camera and tell them you 're feeling all right ? "
menard certainly did .
" mom , dad : i 'm all right , and we 'll be back when we get back , " the marine said .
pentagon changes thinking sanders ' stretcher-side interview near the iraqi city of nasiriyah was made possible by two sweeping developments - a change in pentagon thinking about the media and major advances in video technology .

but some observers , including those in germany , are raising doubts about a form of reporting that has journalists living and possibly dying with the people they are covering .
the idea represents a sea change in pentagon officials ' thinking about war reporting .
having watched critical television reports about the vietnam war in the 1960s and early 1970s undermine support for u.s. forces , the leadership decided to keep most reporters at a safe distance from the troops during the first persian gulf war in 1991 and the nato war over kosovo in 1999 .

the pentagon and u.s. media are very pleased with the way " embedded " correspondents are covering the war .
in europe , the media community is more skeptical . this was a new form of on-the-scene reporting .
a wounded u.s. marine , josh menard , was lying on a stretcher this week and talking to kerry sanders , a reporter from the u.s. television network nbc .
" i 'm all right , " said the 21-year-old corporal , whose left hand had been ripped open by an iraqi bullet .
" it just hurts pretty bad . "
then , sanders popped the question : " got any family members you want to look in the camera and tell them you 're feeling all right ? "
menard certainly did .
" mom , dad : i 'm all right , and we 'll be back when we get back , " the marine said .
pentagon changes thinking sanders ' stretcher-side interview near the iraqi city of nasiriyah was made possible by two sweeping developments - a change in pentagon thinking about the media and major advances in video technology .
" embedded " is the buzz word used to describe the more than 600 journalists covering the war from the gun-muzzle perspective of u.s. fighting forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers as the war enters its second week , america 's media corps are expressing their satisfaction with the results of the sweeping pentagon public relations effort .
but some observers , including those in germany , are raising doubts about a form of reporting that has journalists living and possibly dying with the people they are covering .
the idea represents a sea change in pentagon officials ' thinking about war reporting .
having watched critical television reports about the vietnam war in the 1960s and early 1970s undermine support for u.s. forces , the leadership decided to keep most reporters at a safe distance from the troops during the first persian gulf war in 1991 and the nato war over kosovo in 1999 .
today , openness is the priority .
" here 's why embedding is important to me , " col. rick thomas , chief of u.s. military public affairs in kuwait , told the british newspaper the financial times .
" as the public affairs officer , i have a deep and abiding obligation to tell the families of our servicemembers what they are doing . ...
my objective is that through the journalists ' eyes and through their words and images , mothers and fathers will understand the courage , dedication and sacrifices of their sons and daughters . "
rules dictate reporters ' way of working but before reporters can send out their dispatches , they have to make sure their reports are in line with a 50-point set of pentagon rules .
these rules include a prohibition on " information on effectiveness of enemy camouflage , cover , deception , targeting , direct and indirect fire , intelligence collection , or security measures . " the rules also prohibit disclosure of anything involving future operations and discussion of " unique " tactics employed by the military .

germany 's highest court ruled that the parliament does not have to vote on the deployment of air crews to turkey , a nato member .
but the opposition will push a bill that requires a vote on such missions in the future . german chancellor gerhard schröder , under legal fire for his decision to provide military support to nato during the war against iraq , won the support of the country 's highest court late tuesday for deciding to help the alliance member turkey monitor its airspace for potential threats from iraq .
the federal constitutional court threw out a request from a small opposition party , the free democrats , that the justices require the nation 's parliament to vote on the deployment of the surveillance plane crews .
the justices said they would not require the parliament to vote because the country needed to be a reliable partner in foreign policy issues .
they said that requiring the vote now could cause extensive damage to germany 's standing in the international community , particularly if the country were required to remove the aircrews from the planes .
the government expressed satisfaction with the ruling .
" i welcome this decision very much because it gives the federal government the leeway it needs in foreign-policy issues - particularly during this difficult time , " german defense minister peter struck said .
new law will be urged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle the leader of the free democrats , guido westerwelle -lrb- photo -rrb- , said he would accept the decision for now , but would launch a parliamentary effort to require lawmakers to vote on every foreign deployment of german troops .
currently , the parliament is required to vote on foreign deployments that are not being carried out by the north atlantic treaty organization , whose 19 members have pledged to defend one another .
the issue of nato assistance to turkey triggered one of the worst crises in nato 's 53-year history .
germany , france and belgium , opponents of a possible u.s. war against iraq at the time , vetoed the america request to assist turkey in february .
all three maintained that such preparations would indicate that a war against iraq was inevitable .
the alliance 's leadership worked out a compromise after six days of talks , and nato eventually sent four of the awacs -lrb- airborne warning and control systems -rrb- planes to turkey to watch over the country 's airspace .
germany is providing one-third of the air crews , about 20 servicemembers .
if the country pulled out those crew members , the alliance could not continue the mission .
after accepting the compromise , chancellor schröder was forced to defend the decision amid criticism from the free democrats and other opposition members who maintained that the deployment was a foreign military mission that the parliament must consider .
" we still doubt where the deployment of awacs planes is legal , " michael glos of the opposition party christian social union said last week .
those doubts stem from the planes ' ability to watch over turkey 's airspace and simultaneously look deeply into iraq 's , glos said .
chancellor defends decision schröder rejected the call for a vote , saying the planes were under the control of nato 's supreme allied commander europe and not the united states .
" therefore , no vote by the parliament is necessary , " he told the nation 's lawmakers last week .
despite his support of the mission in the parliament , the chancellor still has doubts about the air crews ' role in turkey .
these doubts stem from the possibility that turkey will send an invasion force into northern iraq and trigger a conflict with the kurds who have enjoyed autonomy there since the first persian gulf war ended in 1991 .
on saturday , schröder convened his security cabinet to discuss the issue after he heard media reports that turkey had begun to deploy troops .
after the meeting , foreign minister joschka fischer issued a threat to the turkish government .
" if turkey becomes involved in the war , then it ’ s a new situation for us , and it would cause the removal of german servicemembers from the awacs aircraft , " fischer said .
small numbers of turkish troops have been in northern iraq since the 1990s , operating against rebel turkish kurds who have retreated there .
turkey is concerned that a kurdish state could emerge after the war against iraq and would reignite the armed kurdish separatism in southeastern turkey that cost 30,000 lives in the 1980s and 1990s .
iraqi kurdish groups fear turkey might move to crush their autonomy .
opposition arises over base use separately , schröder has been under pressure over support he is providing the united states in its war against iraq .
at issue is his decision to allow the united states to use its military bases in germany and german airspace to conduct operations against iraq .
on wednesday , the day before the united states opened its war to overthrow saddam hussein , schröder defended his decisions in an address to parliament .
" there may indeed be different opinions on international law , " the chancellor said .
" but because of our obligations to -lrb- nato -rrb- , we will permit the use of the bases , will not ban the use of german airspace , and we will naturally provide security for the facilities of our friends .

the pentagon and u.s. media are very pleased with the way " embedded " correspondents are covering the war .
in europe , the media community is more skeptical . this was a new form of on-the-scene reporting .
a wounded u.s. marine , josh menard , was lying on a stretcher this week and talking to kerry sanders , a reporter from the u.s. television network nbc .
" i 'm all right , " said the 21-year-old corporal , whose left hand had been ripped open by an iraqi bullet .
" it just hurts pretty bad . "
then , sanders popped the question : " got any family members you want to look in the camera and tell them you 're feeling all right ? "
menard certainly did .
" mom , dad : i 'm all right , and we 'll be back when we get back , " the marine said .
pentagon changes thinking sanders ' stretcher-side interview near the iraqi city of nasiriyah was made possible by two sweeping developments - a change in pentagon thinking about the media and major advances in video technology .
" embedded " is the buzz word used to describe the more than 600 journalists covering the war from the gun-muzzle perspective of u.s. fighting forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers as the war enters its second week , america 's media corps are expressing their satisfaction with the results of the sweeping pentagon public relations effort .
but some observers , including those in germany , are raising doubts about a form of reporting that has journalists living and possibly dying with the people they are covering .
the idea represents a sea change in pentagon officials ' thinking about war reporting .
having watched critical television reports about the vietnam war in the 1960s and early 1970s undermine support for u.s. forces , the leadership decided to keep most reporters at a safe distance from the troops during the first persian gulf war in 1991 and the nato war over kosovo in 1999 .
today , openness is the priority .
" here 's why embedding is important to me , " col. rick thomas , chief of u.s. military public affairs in kuwait , told the british newspaper the financial times .
" as the public affairs officer , i have a deep and abiding obligation to tell the families of our servicemembers what they are doing . ...
my objective is that through the journalists ' eyes and through their words and images , mothers and fathers will understand the courage , dedication and sacrifices of their sons and daughters . "
rules dictate reporters ' way of working but before reporters can send out their dispatches , they have to make sure their reports are in line with a 50-point set of pentagon rules .
these rules include a prohibition on " information on effectiveness of enemy camouflage , cover , deception , targeting , direct and indirect fire , intelligence collection , or security measures . " the rules also prohibit disclosure of anything involving future operations and discussion of " unique " tactics employed by the military .
a veteran german television journalist , jörg armbruster , said in a recent interview with dw-world that he had deep doubts about the new approach .
" i think it is very problematic when you ca n't distinguish between the soldiers and reporters , " said armbruster , who was covering iraq from baghdad until the war began .
such concerns are shared by andy rooney , the veteran cbs television commentator who flew on bombing missions over germany in world war ii as a correspondent for military newspaper the stars and stripes .
" it 's very difficult to write anything critical about a guy you 're going to have breakfast with the next morning , " rooney told the newspaper usa today .
the famous world war ii correspondent " ernie pyle did n't write any stories about cowards in world war ii , even though there were some .
i suspect in this war , we 're going to get a lot of stories about heroes . "
armbruster also raised questions about the value of reporting conducted under the cover of the pentagon 's rules .
" the war can not be reported under such conditions , " he said .
despite the restrictions , members of the u.s. media are pleased with the program so far .
" in our view , it 's working out very , very , very , very well , " marcy mcginnis , senior vice president of news coverage for cbs news , told the associated press .
program could backfire while german journalists like armbruster question the value of the program itself , the director of the european media institute in düsseldorf said he suspected that the pentagon could face another vietnam-like disaster if the war went offtrack .
jo groebel said the war began with a letdown for the pentagon leaders hungry for images of iraqis celebrating their liberation from saddam hussein 's regime .
" the big celebration has not happened yet , " groebel told the german news agency dpa .
" that is a visual disappointment . "
a succession of such setbacks would undermine support of the government 's war effort , he said .
" things are starting to get tricky and could trigger a change of public opinion in the united states , " groebel said .
the embedding would not have been possible without a techonological revolution that has given journalists an array of digital cameras , satellite phones and lightweight laptops to transmit their stories and images .
preston mendenhall , the international editor for msnbc.com , recently set off for northern iraq outfitted with $ 15,000 in satellite phones and computers .
with this equipment , he can file in a flash .
" you get a connection , set up the camera , point it at yourself and just do it — you 're live , " mendenhall told the associated press in an interview conducted by satellite phone .
" but if there 's any weapons of mass destruction , i 'm outta here . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversy over media coverage of prisoners of war only days after the start war in iraq , prisoners of war have been taken on both sides .

germany 's highest court ruled that the parliament does not have to vote on the deployment of air crews to turkey , a nato member .
but the opposition will push a bill that requires a vote on such missions in the future . german chancellor gerhard schröder , under legal fire for his decision to provide military support to nato during the war against iraq , won the support of the country 's highest court late tuesday for deciding to help the alliance member turkey monitor its airspace for potential threats from iraq .
the federal constitutional court threw out a request from a small opposition party , the free democrats , that the justices require the nation 's parliament to vote on the deployment of the surveillance plane crews .
the justices said they would not require the parliament to vote because the country needed to be a reliable partner in foreign policy issues .
they said that requiring the vote now could cause extensive damage to germany 's standing in the international community , particularly if the country were required to remove the aircrews from the planes .
the government expressed satisfaction with the ruling .
" i welcome this decision very much because it gives the federal government the leeway it needs in foreign-policy issues - particularly during this difficult time , " german defense minister peter struck said .
new law will be urged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle the leader of the free democrats , guido westerwelle -lrb- photo -rrb- , said he would accept the decision for now , but would launch a parliamentary effort to require lawmakers to vote on every foreign deployment of german troops .
currently , the parliament is required to vote on foreign deployments that are not being carried out by the north atlantic treaty organization , whose 19 members have pledged to defend one another .
the issue of nato assistance to turkey triggered one of the worst crises in nato 's 53-year history .
germany , france and belgium , opponents of a possible u.s. war against iraq at the time , vetoed the america request to assist turkey in february .
all three maintained that such preparations would indicate that a war against iraq was inevitable .
the alliance 's leadership worked out a compromise after six days of talks , and nato eventually sent four of the awacs -lrb- airborne warning and control systems -rrb- planes to turkey to watch over the country 's airspace .
germany is providing one-third of the air crews , about 20 servicemembers .
if the country pulled out those crew members , the alliance could not continue the mission .
after accepting the compromise , chancellor schröder was forced to defend the decision amid criticism from the free democrats and other opposition members who maintained that the deployment was a foreign military mission that the parliament must consider .
" we still doubt where the deployment of awacs planes is legal , " michael glos of the opposition party christian social union said last week .
those doubts stem from the planes ' ability to watch over turkey 's airspace and simultaneously look deeply into iraq 's , glos said .
chancellor defends decision schröder rejected the call for a vote , saying the planes were under the control of nato 's supreme allied commander europe and not the united states .
" therefore , no vote by the parliament is necessary , " he told the nation 's lawmakers last week .
despite his support of the mission in the parliament , the chancellor still has doubts about the air crews ' role in turkey .
these doubts stem from the possibility that turkey will send an invasion force into northern iraq and trigger a conflict with the kurds who have enjoyed autonomy there since the first persian gulf war ended in 1991 .
on saturday , schröder convened his security cabinet to discuss the issue after he heard media reports that turkey had begun to deploy troops .
after the meeting , foreign minister joschka fischer issued a threat to the turkish government .
" if turkey becomes involved in the war , then it ’ s a new situation for us , and it would cause the removal of german servicemembers from the awacs aircraft , " fischer said .
small numbers of turkish troops have been in northern iraq since the 1990s , operating against rebel turkish kurds who have retreated there .
turkey is concerned that a kurdish state could emerge after the war against iraq and would reignite the armed kurdish separatism in southeastern turkey that cost 30,000 lives in the 1980s and 1990s .
iraqi kurdish groups fear turkey might move to crush their autonomy .
opposition arises over base use separately , schröder has been under pressure over support he is providing the united states in its war against iraq .
at issue is his decision to allow the united states to use its military bases in germany and german airspace to conduct operations against iraq .
on wednesday , the day before the united states opened its war to overthrow saddam hussein , schröder defended his decisions in an address to parliament .
" there may indeed be different opinions on international law , " the chancellor said .
" but because of our obligations to -lrb- nato -rrb- , we will permit the use of the bases , will not ban the use of german airspace , and we will naturally provide security for the facilities of our friends .

the pentagon and u.s. media are very pleased with the way " embedded " correspondents are covering the war .
in europe , the media community is more skeptical . this was a new form of on-the-scene reporting .
a wounded u.s. marine , josh menard , was lying on a stretcher this week and talking to kerry sanders , a reporter from the u.s. television network nbc .
" i 'm all right , " said the 21-year-old corporal , whose left hand had been ripped open by an iraqi bullet .
" it just hurts pretty bad . "
then , sanders popped the question : " got any family members you want to look in the camera and tell them you 're feeling all right ? "
menard certainly did .
" mom , dad : i 'm all right , and we 'll be back when we get back , " the marine said .
pentagon changes thinking sanders ' stretcher-side interview near the iraqi city of nasiriyah was made possible by two sweeping developments - a change in pentagon thinking about the media and major advances in video technology .
" embedded " is the buzz word used to describe the more than 600 journalists covering the war from the gun-muzzle perspective of u.s. fighting forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers as the war enters its second week , america 's media corps are expressing their satisfaction with the results of the sweeping pentagon public relations effort .
but some observers , including those in germany , are raising doubts about a form of reporting that has journalists living and possibly dying with the people they are covering .
the idea represents a sea change in pentagon officials ' thinking about war reporting .
having watched critical television reports about the vietnam war in the 1960s and early 1970s undermine support for u.s. forces , the leadership decided to keep most reporters at a safe distance from the troops during the first persian gulf war in 1991 and the nato war over kosovo in 1999 .
today , openness is the priority .
" here 's why embedding is important to me , " col. rick thomas , chief of u.s. military public affairs in kuwait , told the british newspaper the financial times .
" as the public affairs officer , i have a deep and abiding obligation to tell the families of our servicemembers what they are doing . ...
my objective is that through the journalists ' eyes and through their words and images , mothers and fathers will understand the courage , dedication and sacrifices of their sons and daughters . "
rules dictate reporters ' way of working but before reporters can send out their dispatches , they have to make sure their reports are in line with a 50-point set of pentagon rules .
these rules include a prohibition on " information on effectiveness of enemy camouflage , cover , deception , targeting , direct and indirect fire , intelligence collection , or security measures . " the rules also prohibit disclosure of anything involving future operations and discussion of " unique " tactics employed by the military .
a veteran german television journalist , jörg armbruster , said in a recent interview with dw-world that he had deep doubts about the new approach .
" i think it is very problematic when you ca n't distinguish between the soldiers and reporters , " said armbruster , who was covering iraq from baghdad until the war began .
such concerns are shared by andy rooney , the veteran cbs television commentator who flew on bombing missions over germany in world war ii as a correspondent for military newspaper the stars and stripes .
" it 's very difficult to write anything critical about a guy you 're going to have breakfast with the next morning , " rooney told the newspaper usa today .
the famous world war ii correspondent " ernie pyle did n't write any stories about cowards in world war ii , even though there were some .
i suspect in this war , we 're going to get a lot of stories about heroes . "
armbruster also raised questions about the value of reporting conducted under the cover of the pentagon 's rules .
" the war can not be reported under such conditions , " he said .
despite the restrictions , members of the u.s. media are pleased with the program so far .
" in our view , it 's working out very , very , very , very well , " marcy mcginnis , senior vice president of news coverage for cbs news , told the associated press .
program could backfire while german journalists like armbruster question the value of the program itself , the director of the european media institute in düsseldorf said he suspected that the pentagon could face another vietnam-like disaster if the war went offtrack .
jo groebel said the war began with a letdown for the pentagon leaders hungry for images of iraqis celebrating their liberation from saddam hussein 's regime .
" the big celebration has not happened yet , " groebel told the german news agency dpa .
" that is a visual disappointment . "
a succession of such setbacks would undermine support of the government 's war effort , he said .
" things are starting to get tricky and could trigger a change of public opinion in the united states , " groebel said .
the embedding would not have been possible without a techonological revolution that has given journalists an array of digital cameras , satellite phones and lightweight laptops to transmit their stories and images .

germany 's highest court ruled that the parliament does not have to vote on the deployment of air crews to turkey , a nato member .
but the opposition will push a bill that requires a vote on such missions in the future . german chancellor gerhard schröder , under legal fire for his decision to provide military support to nato during the war against iraq , won the support of the country 's highest court late tuesday for deciding to help the alliance member turkey monitor its airspace for potential threats from iraq .
the federal constitutional court threw out a request from a small opposition party , the free democrats , that the justices require the nation 's parliament to vote on the deployment of the surveillance plane crews .
the justices said they would not require the parliament to vote because the country needed to be a reliable partner in foreign policy issues .
they said that requiring the vote now could cause extensive damage to germany 's standing in the international community , particularly if the country were required to remove the aircrews from the planes .
the government expressed satisfaction with the ruling .
" i welcome this decision very much because it gives the federal government the leeway it needs in foreign-policy issues - particularly during this difficult time , " german defense minister peter struck said .
new law will be urged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle the leader of the free democrats , guido westerwelle -lrb- photo -rrb- , said he would accept the decision for now , but would launch a parliamentary effort to require lawmakers to vote on every foreign deployment of german troops .
currently , the parliament is required to vote on foreign deployments that are not being carried out by the north atlantic treaty organization , whose 19 members have pledged to defend one another .
the issue of nato assistance to turkey triggered one of the worst crises in nato 's 53-year history .
germany , france and belgium , opponents of a possible u.s. war against iraq at the time , vetoed the america request to assist turkey in february .
all three maintained that such preparations would indicate that a war against iraq was inevitable .
the alliance 's leadership worked out a compromise after six days of talks , and nato eventually sent four of the awacs -lrb- airborne warning and control systems -rrb- planes to turkey to watch over the country 's airspace .
germany is providing one-third of the air crews , about 20 servicemembers .
if the country pulled out those crew members , the alliance could not continue the mission .
after accepting the compromise , chancellor schröder was forced to defend the decision amid criticism from the free democrats and other opposition members who maintained that the deployment was a foreign military mission that the parliament must consider .
" we still doubt where the deployment of awacs planes is legal , " michael glos of the opposition party christian social union said last week .
those doubts stem from the planes ' ability to watch over turkey 's airspace and simultaneously look deeply into iraq 's , glos said .
chancellor defends decision schröder rejected the call for a vote , saying the planes were under the control of nato 's supreme allied commander europe and not the united states .
" therefore , no vote by the parliament is necessary , " he told the nation 's lawmakers last week .
despite his support of the mission in the parliament , the chancellor still has doubts about the air crews ' role in turkey .
these doubts stem from the possibility that turkey will send an invasion force into northern iraq and trigger a conflict with the kurds who have enjoyed autonomy there since the first persian gulf war ended in 1991 .
on saturday , schröder convened his security cabinet to discuss the issue after he heard media reports that turkey had begun to deploy troops .
after the meeting , foreign minister joschka fischer issued a threat to the turkish government .
" if turkey becomes involved in the war , then it ’ s a new situation for us , and it would cause the removal of german servicemembers from the awacs aircraft , " fischer said .
small numbers of turkish troops have been in northern iraq since the 1990s , operating against rebel turkish kurds who have retreated there .
turkey is concerned that a kurdish state could emerge after the war against iraq and would reignite the armed kurdish separatism in southeastern turkey that cost 30,000 lives in the 1980s and 1990s .
iraqi kurdish groups fear turkey might move to crush their autonomy .
opposition arises over base use separately , schröder has been under pressure over support he is providing the united states in its war against iraq .
at issue is his decision to allow the united states to use its military bases in germany and german airspace to conduct operations against iraq .
on wednesday , the day before the united states opened its war to overthrow saddam hussein , schröder defended his decisions in an address to parliament .
" there may indeed be different opinions on international law , " the chancellor said .
" but because of our obligations to -lrb- nato -rrb- , we will permit the use of the bases , will not ban the use of german airspace , and we will naturally provide security for the facilities of our friends .

as the united nations negotiates an aid and reconstruction resolution in the coming days , europe is determined to get the u.n. heavily involved in post-saddam iraq , and the u.s. out as quickly as possible . as coalition forces meet with continued fierce resistance in the iraqi desert , united nations security council members are beginning discreet negotiations on an aid and reconstruction resolution on post-saddam iraq .
at stake is a war-ravaged nation and the region 's post-war stability .
security council members france , russia , germany and syria , all heavily anti-war , do n't want the united states to control the post-war administration in iraq , even if only for a short period .
security council members will meet wednesday evening on a request from the arab league . u.s. officials have said in recent days that they agree that the united nations must back any sort of post-war regime in baghdad . they maintain they want to stay in iraq only as long as it takes to stabilize the country . blair stresses importance on u.n. in post-war iraq in part to heal the rift , british prime minister tony blair is meeting with u.s. president george w. bush on wednesday at camp david . " it is common ground between us that the united nations has got to be involved in post-conflict iraq , " blair told a london news conference on the eve of his departure .
" i can assure you that it is our desire to ensure that the u.n. are centrally involved . " some think that a bush agreement on u.n. involvement could close over some of the rifts opened in the u.n. and europe by the coalition forces ' invasion of iraq . one thing is for sure , says transatlantic analyst steven everts at the centre for european reform in london : " without that , it 's not going to happen .
you will see a repetition and exacerbation of the disputes . " " the way the reconstruction is going to be handled will be totally dependent on what blair can get out of bush in terms of the u.n. mandate and role , " everts told dw-world .
" if bush thinks the war is going great than he will resist blair 's pressure to put the u.n. in a political role in iraq . " blair 's next and final stop in the u.s. on thursday will be kofi annan 's office at the united nations .
agreement on a resolution in the new york city-based body will be a massive undertaking , if current negotiations on the resumption of the oil-for-food program are any indication . oil-for-food aid on the negotiating block the program , which allows iraq to purchase humanitarian aid using its oil revenues , was temporarily suspended with the onset of the war , a week ago .

germany 's highest court ruled that the parliament does not have to vote on the deployment of air crews to turkey , a nato member .
but the opposition will push a bill that requires a vote on such missions in the future . german chancellor gerhard schröder , under legal fire for his decision to provide military support to nato during the war against iraq , won the support of the country 's highest court late tuesday for deciding to help the alliance member turkey monitor its airspace for potential threats from iraq .
the federal constitutional court threw out a request from a small opposition party , the free democrats , that the justices require the nation 's parliament to vote on the deployment of the surveillance plane crews .
the justices said they would not require the parliament to vote because the country needed to be a reliable partner in foreign policy issues .
they said that requiring the vote now could cause extensive damage to germany 's standing in the international community , particularly if the country were required to remove the aircrews from the planes .
the government expressed satisfaction with the ruling .
" i welcome this decision very much because it gives the federal government the leeway it needs in foreign-policy issues - particularly during this difficult time , " german defense minister peter struck said .
new law will be urged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle the leader of the free democrats , guido westerwelle -lrb- photo -rrb- , said he would accept the decision for now , but would launch a parliamentary effort to require lawmakers to vote on every foreign deployment of german troops .
currently , the parliament is required to vote on foreign deployments that are not being carried out by the north atlantic treaty organization , whose 19 members have pledged to defend one another .
the issue of nato assistance to turkey triggered one of the worst crises in nato 's 53-year history .
germany , france and belgium , opponents of a possible u.s. war against iraq at the time , vetoed the america request to assist turkey in february .
all three maintained that such preparations would indicate that a war against iraq was inevitable .
the alliance 's leadership worked out a compromise after six days of talks , and nato eventually sent four of the awacs -lrb- airborne warning and control systems -rrb- planes to turkey to watch over the country 's airspace .
germany is providing one-third of the air crews , about 20 servicemembers .
if the country pulled out those crew members , the alliance could not continue the mission .
after accepting the compromise , chancellor schröder was forced to defend the decision amid criticism from the free democrats and other opposition members who maintained that the deployment was a foreign military mission that the parliament must consider .
" we still doubt where the deployment of awacs planes is legal , " michael glos of the opposition party christian social union said last week .
those doubts stem from the planes ' ability to watch over turkey 's airspace and simultaneously look deeply into iraq 's , glos said .
chancellor defends decision schröder rejected the call for a vote , saying the planes were under the control of nato 's supreme allied commander europe and not the united states .
" therefore , no vote by the parliament is necessary , " he told the nation 's lawmakers last week .
despite his support of the mission in the parliament , the chancellor still has doubts about the air crews ' role in turkey .
these doubts stem from the possibility that turkey will send an invasion force into northern iraq and trigger a conflict with the kurds who have enjoyed autonomy there since the first persian gulf war ended in 1991 .
on saturday , schröder convened his security cabinet to discuss the issue after he heard media reports that turkey had begun to deploy troops .
after the meeting , foreign minister joschka fischer issued a threat to the turkish government .
" if turkey becomes involved in the war , then it ’ s a new situation for us , and it would cause the removal of german servicemembers from the awacs aircraft , " fischer said .
small numbers of turkish troops have been in northern iraq since the 1990s , operating against rebel turkish kurds who have retreated there .
turkey is concerned that a kurdish state could emerge after the war against iraq and would reignite the armed kurdish separatism in southeastern turkey that cost 30,000 lives in the 1980s and 1990s .
iraqi kurdish groups fear turkey might move to crush their autonomy .
opposition arises over base use separately , schröder has been under pressure over support he is providing the united states in its war against iraq .
at issue is his decision to allow the united states to use its military bases in germany and german airspace to conduct operations against iraq .
on wednesday , the day before the united states opened its war to overthrow saddam hussein , schröder defended his decisions in an address to parliament .
" there may indeed be different opinions on international law , " the chancellor said .

the pentagon and u.s. media are very pleased with the way " embedded " correspondents are covering the war .
in europe , the media community is more skeptical . this was a new form of on-the-scene reporting .
a wounded u.s. marine , josh menard , was lying on a stretcher this week and talking to kerry sanders , a reporter from the u.s. television network nbc .
" i 'm all right , " said the 21-year-old corporal , whose left hand had been ripped open by an iraqi bullet .
" it just hurts pretty bad . "
then , sanders popped the question : " got any family members you want to look in the camera and tell them you 're feeling all right ? "
menard certainly did .
" mom , dad : i 'm all right , and we 'll be back when we get back , " the marine said .
pentagon changes thinking sanders ' stretcher-side interview near the iraqi city of nasiriyah was made possible by two sweeping developments - a change in pentagon thinking about the media and major advances in video technology .
" embedded " is the buzz word used to describe the more than 600 journalists covering the war from the gun-muzzle perspective of u.s. fighting forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers as the war enters its second week , america 's media corps are expressing their satisfaction with the results of the sweeping pentagon public relations effort .
but some observers , including those in germany , are raising doubts about a form of reporting that has journalists living and possibly dying with the people they are covering .
the idea represents a sea change in pentagon officials ' thinking about war reporting .
having watched critical television reports about the vietnam war in the 1960s and early 1970s undermine support for u.s. forces , the leadership decided to keep most reporters at a safe distance from the troops during the first persian gulf war in 1991 and the nato war over kosovo in 1999 .
today , openness is the priority .
" here 's why embedding is important to me , " col. rick thomas , chief of u.s. military public affairs in kuwait , told the british newspaper the financial times .
" as the public affairs officer , i have a deep and abiding obligation to tell the families of our servicemembers what they are doing . ...
my objective is that through the journalists ' eyes and through their words and images , mothers and fathers will understand the courage , dedication and sacrifices of their sons and daughters . "
rules dictate reporters ' way of working but before reporters can send out their dispatches , they have to make sure their reports are in line with a 50-point set of pentagon rules .
these rules include a prohibition on " information on effectiveness of enemy camouflage , cover , deception , targeting , direct and indirect fire , intelligence collection , or security measures . " the rules also prohibit disclosure of anything involving future operations and discussion of " unique " tactics employed by the military .
a veteran german television journalist , jörg armbruster , said in a recent interview with dw-world that he had deep doubts about the new approach .
" i think it is very problematic when you ca n't distinguish between the soldiers and reporters , " said armbruster , who was covering iraq from baghdad until the war began .
such concerns are shared by andy rooney , the veteran cbs television commentator who flew on bombing missions over germany in world war ii as a correspondent for military newspaper the stars and stripes .
" it 's very difficult to write anything critical about a guy you 're going to have breakfast with the next morning , " rooney told the newspaper usa today .
the famous world war ii correspondent " ernie pyle did n't write any stories about cowards in world war ii , even though there were some .
i suspect in this war , we 're going to get a lot of stories about heroes . "
armbruster also raised questions about the value of reporting conducted under the cover of the pentagon 's rules .
" the war can not be reported under such conditions , " he said .
despite the restrictions , members of the u.s. media are pleased with the program so far .
" in our view , it 's working out very , very , very , very well , " marcy mcginnis , senior vice president of news coverage for cbs news , told the associated press .
program could backfire while german journalists like armbruster question the value of the program itself , the director of the european media institute in düsseldorf said he suspected that the pentagon could face another vietnam-like disaster if the war went offtrack .
jo groebel said the war began with a letdown for the pentagon leaders hungry for images of iraqis celebrating their liberation from saddam hussein 's regime .
" the big celebration has not happened yet , " groebel told the german news agency dpa .
" that is a visual disappointment . "
a succession of such setbacks would undermine support of the government 's war effort , he said .
" things are starting to get tricky and could trigger a change of public opinion in the united states , " groebel said .
the embedding would not have been possible without a techonological revolution that has given journalists an array of digital cameras , satellite phones and lightweight laptops to transmit their stories and images .
preston mendenhall , the international editor for msnbc.com , recently set off for northern iraq outfitted with $ 15,000 in satellite phones and computers .
with this equipment , he can file in a flash .
" you get a connection , set up the camera , point it at yourself and just do it — you 're live , " mendenhall told the associated press in an interview conducted by satellite phone .

as the united nations negotiates an aid and reconstruction resolution in the coming days , europe is determined to get the u.n. heavily involved in post-saddam iraq , and the u.s. out as quickly as possible . as coalition forces meet with continued fierce resistance in the iraqi desert , united nations security council members are beginning discreet negotiations on an aid and reconstruction resolution on post-saddam iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.03.2003 war coverage draws skepticism in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the scene : an embedded journalist , mike gooding , onboard the aircraft carrier harry s. truman .
the pentagon and u.s. media are very pleased with the way " embedded " correspondents are covering the war .
in europe , the media community is more skeptical . this was a new form of on-the-scene reporting .
a wounded u.s. marine , josh menard , was lying on a stretcher this week and talking to kerry sanders , a reporter from the u.s. television network nbc .
" i 'm all right , " said the 21-year-old corporal , whose left hand had been ripped open by an iraqi bullet .
" it just hurts pretty bad . "
then , sanders popped the question : " got any family members you want to look in the camera and tell them you 're feeling all right ? "
menard certainly did .
" mom , dad : i 'm all right , and we 'll be back when we get back , " the marine said .
pentagon changes thinking sanders ' stretcher-side interview near the iraqi city of nasiriyah was made possible by two sweeping developments - a change in pentagon thinking about the media and major advances in video technology .
" embedded " is the buzz word used to describe the more than 600 journalists covering the war from the gun-muzzle perspective of u.s. fighting forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers as the war enters its second week , america 's media corps are expressing their satisfaction with the results of the sweeping pentagon public relations effort .
but some observers , including those in germany , are raising doubts about a form of reporting that has journalists living and possibly dying with the people they are covering .
the idea represents a sea change in pentagon officials ' thinking about war reporting .
having watched critical television reports about the vietnam war in the 1960s and early 1970s undermine support for u.s. forces , the leadership decided to keep most reporters at a safe distance from the troops during the first persian gulf war in 1991 and the nato war over kosovo in 1999 .
today , openness is the priority .
" here 's why embedding is important to me , " col. rick thomas , chief of u.s. military public affairs in kuwait , told the british newspaper the financial times .

germany 's highest court ruled that the parliament does not have to vote on the deployment of air crews to turkey , a nato member .
but the opposition will push a bill that requires a vote on such missions in the future . german chancellor gerhard schröder , under legal fire for his decision to provide military support to nato during the war against iraq , won the support of the country 's highest court late tuesday for deciding to help the alliance member turkey monitor its airspace for potential threats from iraq .
the federal constitutional court threw out a request from a small opposition party , the free democrats , that the justices require the nation 's parliament to vote on the deployment of the surveillance plane crews .
the justices said they would not require the parliament to vote because the country needed to be a reliable partner in foreign policy issues .
they said that requiring the vote now could cause extensive damage to germany 's standing in the international community , particularly if the country were required to remove the aircrews from the planes .
the government expressed satisfaction with the ruling .
" i welcome this decision very much because it gives the federal government the leeway it needs in foreign-policy issues - particularly during this difficult time , " german defense minister peter struck said .
new law will be urged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle the leader of the free democrats , guido westerwelle -lrb- photo -rrb- , said he would accept the decision for now , but would launch a parliamentary effort to require lawmakers to vote on every foreign deployment of german troops .
currently , the parliament is required to vote on foreign deployments that are not being carried out by the north atlantic treaty organization , whose 19 members have pledged to defend one another .
the issue of nato assistance to turkey triggered one of the worst crises in nato 's 53-year history .
germany , france and belgium , opponents of a possible u.s. war against iraq at the time , vetoed the america request to assist turkey in february .
all three maintained that such preparations would indicate that a war against iraq was inevitable .
the alliance 's leadership worked out a compromise after six days of talks , and nato eventually sent four of the awacs -lrb- airborne warning and control systems -rrb- planes to turkey to watch over the country 's airspace .
germany is providing one-third of the air crews , about 20 servicemembers .
if the country pulled out those crew members , the alliance could not continue the mission .
after accepting the compromise , chancellor schröder was forced to defend the decision amid criticism from the free democrats and other opposition members who maintained that the deployment was a foreign military mission that the parliament must consider .
" we still doubt where the deployment of awacs planes is legal , " michael glos of the opposition party christian social union said last week .
those doubts stem from the planes ' ability to watch over turkey 's airspace and simultaneously look deeply into iraq 's , glos said .
chancellor defends decision schröder rejected the call for a vote , saying the planes were under the control of nato 's supreme allied commander europe and not the united states .
" therefore , no vote by the parliament is necessary , " he told the nation 's lawmakers last week .
despite his support of the mission in the parliament , the chancellor still has doubts about the air crews ' role in turkey .
these doubts stem from the possibility that turkey will send an invasion force into northern iraq and trigger a conflict with the kurds who have enjoyed autonomy there since the first persian gulf war ended in 1991 .
on saturday , schröder convened his security cabinet to discuss the issue after he heard media reports that turkey had begun to deploy troops .
after the meeting , foreign minister joschka fischer issued a threat to the turkish government .
" if turkey becomes involved in the war , then it ’ s a new situation for us , and it would cause the removal of german servicemembers from the awacs aircraft , " fischer said .
small numbers of turkish troops have been in northern iraq since the 1990s , operating against rebel turkish kurds who have retreated there .
turkey is concerned that a kurdish state could emerge after the war against iraq and would reignite the armed kurdish separatism in southeastern turkey that cost 30,000 lives in the 1980s and 1990s .
iraqi kurdish groups fear turkey might move to crush their autonomy .
opposition arises over base use separately , schröder has been under pressure over support he is providing the united states in its war against iraq .
at issue is his decision to allow the united states to use its military bases in germany and german airspace to conduct operations against iraq .
on wednesday , the day before the united states opened its war to overthrow saddam hussein , schröder defended his decisions in an address to parliament .
" there may indeed be different opinions on international law , " the chancellor said .
" but because of our obligations to -lrb- nato -rrb- , we will permit the use of the bases , will not ban the use of german airspace , and we will naturally provide security for the facilities of our friends .

if the country pulled out those crew members , the alliance could not continue the mission .
after accepting the compromise , chancellor schröder was forced to defend the decision amid criticism from the free democrats and other opposition members who maintained that the deployment was a foreign military mission that the parliament must consider .
" we still doubt where the deployment of awacs planes is legal , " michael glos of the opposition party christian social union said last week .
those doubts stem from the planes ' ability to watch over turkey 's airspace and simultaneously look deeply into iraq 's , glos said .
chancellor defends decision schröder rejected the call for a vote , saying the planes were under the control of nato 's supreme allied commander europe and not the united states .
" therefore , no vote by the parliament is necessary , " he told the nation 's lawmakers last week .
despite his support of the mission in the parliament , the chancellor still has doubts about the air crews ' role in turkey .
these doubts stem from the possibility that turkey will send an invasion force into northern iraq and trigger a conflict with the kurds who have enjoyed autonomy there since the first persian gulf war ended in 1991 .
on saturday , schröder convened his security cabinet to discuss the issue after he heard media reports that turkey had begun to deploy troops .
after the meeting , foreign minister joschka fischer issued a threat to the turkish government .
" if turkey becomes involved in the war , then it ’ s a new situation for us , and it would cause the removal of german servicemembers from the awacs aircraft , " fischer said .
small numbers of turkish troops have been in northern iraq since the 1990s , operating against rebel turkish kurds who have retreated there .
turkey is concerned that a kurdish state could emerge after the war against iraq and would reignite the armed kurdish separatism in southeastern turkey that cost 30,000 lives in the 1980s and 1990s .
iraqi kurdish groups fear turkey might move to crush their autonomy .
opposition arises over base use separately , schröder has been under pressure over support he is providing the united states in its war against iraq .
at issue is his decision to allow the united states to use its military bases in germany and german airspace to conduct operations against iraq .
on wednesday , the day before the united states opened its war to overthrow saddam hussein , schröder defended his decisions in an address to parliament .
" there may indeed be different opinions on international law , " the chancellor said .

germany 's highest court ruled that the parliament does not have to vote on the deployment of air crews to turkey , a nato member .
but the opposition will push a bill that requires a vote on such missions in the future . german chancellor gerhard schröder , under legal fire for his decision to provide military support to nato during the war against iraq , won the support of the country 's highest court late tuesday for deciding to help the alliance member turkey monitor its airspace for potential threats from iraq .
the federal constitutional court threw out a request from a small opposition party , the free democrats , that the justices require the nation 's parliament to vote on the deployment of the surveillance plane crews .
the justices said they would not require the parliament to vote because the country needed to be a reliable partner in foreign policy issues .
they said that requiring the vote now could cause extensive damage to germany 's standing in the international community , particularly if the country were required to remove the aircrews from the planes .
the government expressed satisfaction with the ruling .
" i welcome this decision very much because it gives the federal government the leeway it needs in foreign-policy issues - particularly during this difficult time , " german defense minister peter struck said .
new law will be urged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle the leader of the free democrats , guido westerwelle -lrb- photo -rrb- , said he would accept the decision for now , but would launch a parliamentary effort to require lawmakers to vote on every foreign deployment of german troops .
currently , the parliament is required to vote on foreign deployments that are not being carried out by the north atlantic treaty organization , whose 19 members have pledged to defend one another .
the issue of nato assistance to turkey triggered one of the worst crises in nato 's 53-year history .
germany , france and belgium , opponents of a possible u.s. war against iraq at the time , vetoed the america request to assist turkey in february .
all three maintained that such preparations would indicate that a war against iraq was inevitable .

as the united nations negotiates an aid and reconstruction resolution in the coming days , europe is determined to get the u.n. heavily involved in post-saddam iraq , and the u.s. out as quickly as possible . as coalition forces meet with continued fierce resistance in the iraqi desert , united nations security council members are beginning discreet negotiations on an aid and reconstruction resolution on post-saddam iraq .
at stake is a war-ravaged nation and the region 's post-war stability .
security council members france , russia , germany and syria , all heavily anti-war , do n't want the united states to control the post-war administration in iraq , even if only for a short period .
security council members will meet wednesday evening on a request from the arab league . u.s. officials have said in recent days that they agree that the united nations must back any sort of post-war regime in baghdad . they maintain they want to stay in iraq only as long as it takes to stabilize the country . blair stresses importance on u.n. in post-war iraq in part to heal the rift , british prime minister tony blair is meeting with u.s. president george w. bush on wednesday at camp david . " it is common ground between us that the united nations has got to be involved in post-conflict iraq , " blair told a london news conference on the eve of his departure .
" i can assure you that it is our desire to ensure that the u.n. are centrally involved . " some think that a bush agreement on u.n. involvement could close over some of the rifts opened in the u.n. and europe by the coalition forces ' invasion of iraq . one thing is for sure , says transatlantic analyst steven everts at the centre for european reform in london : " without that , it 's not going to happen .

u.n. security council members are working on a resolution that would have the u.n. work only temporarily with the united states following the end of the war .
france , russia , china and syria , all staunch opponents of the war , are wary of fashioning a resolution that would have the u.n. fully cooperate with the u.s. and great britain , and thus give indirect support to the coalition invasion of iraq . germany , which currently heads the planning committee responsible for reconstruction , is optimistic an agreement can be reached as early as wednesday .
" we are trying to find a solution that would reflect a compromise to which everybody has to contribute because there are very differing interests involved , " german u.n. ambassador gunter pleuger told the associated press . aid , fast in the meantime , european governments are lining up with pledges of immediate humanitarian aid .

" some think that a bush agreement on u.n. involvement could close over some of the rifts opened in the u.n. and europe by the coalition forces ' invasion of iraq . one thing is for sure , says transatlantic analyst steven everts at the centre for european reform in london : " without that , it 's not going to happen .
you will see a repetition and exacerbation of the disputes . " " the way the reconstruction is going to be handled will be totally dependent on what blair can get out of bush in terms of the u.n. mandate and role , " everts told dw-world .
" if bush thinks the war is going great than he will resist blair 's pressure to put the u.n. in a political role in iraq . " blair 's next and final stop in the u.s. on thursday will be kofi annan 's office at the united nations .
agreement on a resolution in the new york city-based body will be a massive undertaking , if current negotiations on the resumption of the oil-for-food program are any indication . oil-for-food aid on the negotiating block the program , which allows iraq to purchase humanitarian aid using its oil revenues , was temporarily suspended with the onset of the war , a week ago .
u.n. security council members are working on a resolution that would have the u.n. work only temporarily with the united states following the end of the war .
france , russia , china and syria , all staunch opponents of the war , are wary of fashioning a resolution that would have the u.n. fully cooperate with the u.s. and great britain , and thus give indirect support to the coalition invasion of iraq . germany , which currently heads the planning committee responsible for reconstruction , is optimistic an agreement can be reached as early as wednesday .
" we are trying to find a solution that would reflect a compromise to which everybody has to contribute because there are very differing interests involved , " german u.n. ambassador gunter pleuger told the associated press . aid , fast in the meantime , european governments are lining up with pledges of immediate humanitarian aid .
the german government has promised 50 million euro -lrb- $ 53.4 million -rrb- in immediate aid to relieve the immense humanitarian crisis currently facing iraqis .
chancellor gerhard schröder last friday also signed onto a pledge by the european commission to provide 100 million euro in aid . thousands of iraqis are going hungry and suffering from dehydration as u.s. and british troops battle with guerrilla soldiers in the southern cities of basra and umm qasr .
the suspension of the oil-for food program , on which 16 million of the 25 million iraqis are dependent has added to the humanitarian crisis brought on by war . military officials said wednesday that the first seven-truck food convoy from kuwait had arrived at umm qasr and that ships would be allowed in shortly .

the pentagon and u.s. media are very pleased with the way " embedded " correspondents are covering the war .
in europe , the media community is more skeptical . this was a new form of on-the-scene reporting .
a wounded u.s. marine , josh menard , was lying on a stretcher this week and talking to kerry sanders , a reporter from the u.s. television network nbc .
" i 'm all right , " said the 21-year-old corporal , whose left hand had been ripped open by an iraqi bullet .

but some observers , including those in germany , are raising doubts about a form of reporting that has journalists living and possibly dying with the people they are covering .
the idea represents a sea change in pentagon officials ' thinking about war reporting .
having watched critical television reports about the vietnam war in the 1960s and early 1970s undermine support for u.s. forces , the leadership decided to keep most reporters at a safe distance from the troops during the first persian gulf war in 1991 and the nato war over kosovo in 1999 .
today , openness is the priority .
" here 's why embedding is important to me , " col. rick thomas , chief of u.s. military public affairs in kuwait , told the british newspaper the financial times .
" as the public affairs officer , i have a deep and abiding obligation to tell the families of our servicemembers what they are doing . ...
my objective is that through the journalists ' eyes and through their words and images , mothers and fathers will understand the courage , dedication and sacrifices of their sons and daughters . "
rules dictate reporters ' way of working but before reporters can send out their dispatches , they have to make sure their reports are in line with a 50-point set of pentagon rules .
these rules include a prohibition on " information on effectiveness of enemy camouflage , cover , deception , targeting , direct and indirect fire , intelligence collection , or security measures . " the rules also prohibit disclosure of anything involving future operations and discussion of " unique " tactics employed by the military .
a veteran german television journalist , jörg armbruster , said in a recent interview with dw-world that he had deep doubts about the new approach .
" i think it is very problematic when you ca n't distinguish between the soldiers and reporters , " said armbruster , who was covering iraq from baghdad until the war began .
such concerns are shared by andy rooney , the veteran cbs television commentator who flew on bombing missions over germany in world war ii as a correspondent for military newspaper the stars and stripes .
" it 's very difficult to write anything critical about a guy you 're going to have breakfast with the next morning , " rooney told the newspaper usa today .
the famous world war ii correspondent " ernie pyle did n't write any stories about cowards in world war ii , even though there were some .
i suspect in this war , we 're going to get a lot of stories about heroes . "
armbruster also raised questions about the value of reporting conducted under the cover of the pentagon 's rules .
" the war can not be reported under such conditions , " he said .
despite the restrictions , members of the u.s. media are pleased with the program so far .
" in our view , it 's working out very , very , very , very well , " marcy mcginnis , senior vice president of news coverage for cbs news , told the associated press .
program could backfire while german journalists like armbruster question the value of the program itself , the director of the european media institute in düsseldorf said he suspected that the pentagon could face another vietnam-like disaster if the war went offtrack .
jo groebel said the war began with a letdown for the pentagon leaders hungry for images of iraqis celebrating their liberation from saddam hussein 's regime .
" the big celebration has not happened yet , " groebel told the german news agency dpa .
" that is a visual disappointment . "
a succession of such setbacks would undermine support of the government 's war effort , he said .

today , openness is the priority .
" here 's why embedding is important to me , " col. rick thomas , chief of u.s. military public affairs in kuwait , told the british newspaper the financial times .
" as the public affairs officer , i have a deep and abiding obligation to tell the families of our servicemembers what they are doing . ...
my objective is that through the journalists ' eyes and through their words and images , mothers and fathers will understand the courage , dedication and sacrifices of their sons and daughters . "
rules dictate reporters ' way of working but before reporters can send out their dispatches , they have to make sure their reports are in line with a 50-point set of pentagon rules .
these rules include a prohibition on " information on effectiveness of enemy camouflage , cover , deception , targeting , direct and indirect fire , intelligence collection , or security measures . " the rules also prohibit disclosure of anything involving future operations and discussion of " unique " tactics employed by the military .
a veteran german television journalist , jörg armbruster , said in a recent interview with dw-world that he had deep doubts about the new approach .
" i think it is very problematic when you ca n't distinguish between the soldiers and reporters , " said armbruster , who was covering iraq from baghdad until the war began .
such concerns are shared by andy rooney , the veteran cbs television commentator who flew on bombing missions over germany in world war ii as a correspondent for military newspaper the stars and stripes .
" it 's very difficult to write anything critical about a guy you 're going to have breakfast with the next morning , " rooney told the newspaper usa today .
the famous world war ii correspondent " ernie pyle did n't write any stories about cowards in world war ii , even though there were some .
i suspect in this war , we 're going to get a lot of stories about heroes . "
armbruster also raised questions about the value of reporting conducted under the cover of the pentagon 's rules .
" the war can not be reported under such conditions , " he said .
despite the restrictions , members of the u.s. media are pleased with the program so far .
" in our view , it 's working out very , very , very , very well , " marcy mcginnis , senior vice president of news coverage for cbs news , told the associated press .
program could backfire while german journalists like armbruster question the value of the program itself , the director of the european media institute in düsseldorf said he suspected that the pentagon could face another vietnam-like disaster if the war went offtrack .
jo groebel said the war began with a letdown for the pentagon leaders hungry for images of iraqis celebrating their liberation from saddam hussein 's regime .
" the big celebration has not happened yet , " groebel told the german news agency dpa .
" that is a visual disappointment . "
a succession of such setbacks would undermine support of the government 's war effort , he said .
" things are starting to get tricky and could trigger a change of public opinion in the united states , " groebel said .
the embedding would not have been possible without a techonological revolution that has given journalists an array of digital cameras , satellite phones and lightweight laptops to transmit their stories and images .
preston mendenhall , the international editor for msnbc.com , recently set off for northern iraq outfitted with $ 15,000 in satellite phones and computers .
with this equipment , he can file in a flash .
" you get a connection , set up the camera , point it at yourself and just do it — you 're live , " mendenhall told the associated press in an interview conducted by satellite phone .

germany 's highest court ruled that the parliament does not have to vote on the deployment of air crews to turkey , a nato member .
but the opposition will push a bill that requires a vote on such missions in the future . german chancellor gerhard schröder , under legal fire for his decision to provide military support to nato during the war against iraq , won the support of the country 's highest court late tuesday for deciding to help the alliance member turkey monitor its airspace for potential threats from iraq .
the federal constitutional court threw out a request from a small opposition party , the free democrats , that the justices require the nation 's parliament to vote on the deployment of the surveillance plane crews .
the justices said they would not require the parliament to vote because the country needed to be a reliable partner in foreign policy issues .
they said that requiring the vote now could cause extensive damage to germany 's standing in the international community , particularly if the country were required to remove the aircrews from the planes .
the government expressed satisfaction with the ruling .
" i welcome this decision very much because it gives the federal government the leeway it needs in foreign-policy issues - particularly during this difficult time , " german defense minister peter struck said .
new law will be urged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle the leader of the free democrats , guido westerwelle -lrb- photo -rrb- , said he would accept the decision for now , but would launch a parliamentary effort to require lawmakers to vote on every foreign deployment of german troops .
currently , the parliament is required to vote on foreign deployments that are not being carried out by the north atlantic treaty organization , whose 19 members have pledged to defend one another .
the issue of nato assistance to turkey triggered one of the worst crises in nato 's 53-year history .
germany , france and belgium , opponents of a possible u.s. war against iraq at the time , vetoed the america request to assist turkey in february .
all three maintained that such preparations would indicate that a war against iraq was inevitable .
the alliance 's leadership worked out a compromise after six days of talks , and nato eventually sent four of the awacs -lrb- airborne warning and control systems -rrb- planes to turkey to watch over the country 's airspace .
germany is providing one-third of the air crews , about 20 servicemembers .
if the country pulled out those crew members , the alliance could not continue the mission .
after accepting the compromise , chancellor schröder was forced to defend the decision amid criticism from the free democrats and other opposition members who maintained that the deployment was a foreign military mission that the parliament must consider .
" we still doubt where the deployment of awacs planes is legal , " michael glos of the opposition party christian social union said last week .
those doubts stem from the planes ' ability to watch over turkey 's airspace and simultaneously look deeply into iraq 's , glos said .
chancellor defends decision schröder rejected the call for a vote , saying the planes were under the control of nato 's supreme allied commander europe and not the united states .
" therefore , no vote by the parliament is necessary , " he told the nation 's lawmakers last week .
despite his support of the mission in the parliament , the chancellor still has doubts about the air crews ' role in turkey .
these doubts stem from the possibility that turkey will send an invasion force into northern iraq and trigger a conflict with the kurds who have enjoyed autonomy there since the first persian gulf war ended in 1991 .
on saturday , schröder convened his security cabinet to discuss the issue after he heard media reports that turkey had begun to deploy troops .
after the meeting , foreign minister joschka fischer issued a threat to the turkish government .
" if turkey becomes involved in the war , then it ’ s a new situation for us , and it would cause the removal of german servicemembers from the awacs aircraft , " fischer said .
small numbers of turkish troops have been in northern iraq since the 1990s , operating against rebel turkish kurds who have retreated there .
turkey is concerned that a kurdish state could emerge after the war against iraq and would reignite the armed kurdish separatism in southeastern turkey that cost 30,000 lives in the 1980s and 1990s .
iraqi kurdish groups fear turkey might move to crush their autonomy .
opposition arises over base use separately , schröder has been under pressure over support he is providing the united states in its war against iraq .
at issue is his decision to allow the united states to use its military bases in germany and german airspace to conduct operations against iraq .
on wednesday , the day before the united states opened its war to overthrow saddam hussein , schröder defended his decisions in an address to parliament .
" there may indeed be different opinions on international law , " the chancellor said .
" but because of our obligations to -lrb- nato -rrb- , we will permit the use of the bases , will not ban the use of german airspace , and we will naturally provide security for the facilities of our friends .

as the united nations negotiates an aid and reconstruction resolution in the coming days , europe is determined to get the u.n. heavily involved in post-saddam iraq , and the u.s. out as quickly as possible . as coalition forces meet with continued fierce resistance in the iraqi desert , united nations security council members are beginning discreet negotiations on an aid and reconstruction resolution on post-saddam iraq .
at stake is a war-ravaged nation and the region 's post-war stability .
security council members france , russia , germany and syria , all heavily anti-war , do n't want the united states to control the post-war administration in iraq , even if only for a short period .
security council members will meet wednesday evening on a request from the arab league . u.s. officials have said in recent days that they agree that the united nations must back any sort of post-war regime in baghdad . they maintain they want to stay in iraq only as long as it takes to stabilize the country . blair stresses importance on u.n. in post-war iraq in part to heal the rift , british prime minister tony blair is meeting with u.s. president george w. bush on wednesday at camp david . " it is common ground between us that the united nations has got to be involved in post-conflict iraq , " blair told a london news conference on the eve of his departure .
" i can assure you that it is our desire to ensure that the u.n. are centrally involved . " some think that a bush agreement on u.n. involvement could close over some of the rifts opened in the u.n. and europe by the coalition forces ' invasion of iraq . one thing is for sure , says transatlantic analyst steven everts at the centre for european reform in london : " without that , it 's not going to happen .
you will see a repetition and exacerbation of the disputes . " " the way the reconstruction is going to be handled will be totally dependent on what blair can get out of bush in terms of the u.n. mandate and role , " everts told dw-world .
" if bush thinks the war is going great than he will resist blair 's pressure to put the u.n. in a political role in iraq . " blair 's next and final stop in the u.s. on thursday will be kofi annan 's office at the united nations .

" i 'm all right , " said the 21-year-old corporal , whose left hand had been ripped open by an iraqi bullet .
" it just hurts pretty bad . "
then , sanders popped the question : " got any family members you want to look in the camera and tell them you 're feeling all right ? "
menard certainly did .
" mom , dad : i 'm all right , and we 'll be back when we get back , " the marine said .
pentagon changes thinking sanders ' stretcher-side interview near the iraqi city of nasiriyah was made possible by two sweeping developments - a change in pentagon thinking about the media and major advances in video technology .
" embedded " is the buzz word used to describe the more than 600 journalists covering the war from the gun-muzzle perspective of u.s. fighting forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers as the war enters its second week , america 's media corps are expressing their satisfaction with the results of the sweeping pentagon public relations effort .
but some observers , including those in germany , are raising doubts about a form of reporting that has journalists living and possibly dying with the people they are covering .
the idea represents a sea change in pentagon officials ' thinking about war reporting .
having watched critical television reports about the vietnam war in the 1960s and early 1970s undermine support for u.s. forces , the leadership decided to keep most reporters at a safe distance from the troops during the first persian gulf war in 1991 and the nato war over kosovo in 1999 .
today , openness is the priority .
" here 's why embedding is important to me , " col. rick thomas , chief of u.s. military public affairs in kuwait , told the british newspaper the financial times .
" as the public affairs officer , i have a deep and abiding obligation to tell the families of our servicemembers what they are doing . ...
my objective is that through the journalists ' eyes and through their words and images , mothers and fathers will understand the courage , dedication and sacrifices of their sons and daughters . "
rules dictate reporters ' way of working but before reporters can send out their dispatches , they have to make sure their reports are in line with a 50-point set of pentagon rules .
these rules include a prohibition on " information on effectiveness of enemy camouflage , cover , deception , targeting , direct and indirect fire , intelligence collection , or security measures . " the rules also prohibit disclosure of anything involving future operations and discussion of " unique " tactics employed by the military .
a veteran german television journalist , jörg armbruster , said in a recent interview with dw-world that he had deep doubts about the new approach .
" i think it is very problematic when you ca n't distinguish between the soldiers and reporters , " said armbruster , who was covering iraq from baghdad until the war began .
such concerns are shared by andy rooney , the veteran cbs television commentator who flew on bombing missions over germany in world war ii as a correspondent for military newspaper the stars and stripes .
" it 's very difficult to write anything critical about a guy you 're going to have breakfast with the next morning , " rooney told the newspaper usa today .
the famous world war ii correspondent " ernie pyle did n't write any stories about cowards in world war ii , even though there were some .
i suspect in this war , we 're going to get a lot of stories about heroes . "
armbruster also raised questions about the value of reporting conducted under the cover of the pentagon 's rules .
" the war can not be reported under such conditions , " he said .
despite the restrictions , members of the u.s. media are pleased with the program so far .
" in our view , it 's working out very , very , very , very well , " marcy mcginnis , senior vice president of news coverage for cbs news , told the associated press .
program could backfire while german journalists like armbruster question the value of the program itself , the director of the european media institute in düsseldorf said he suspected that the pentagon could face another vietnam-like disaster if the war went offtrack .
jo groebel said the war began with a letdown for the pentagon leaders hungry for images of iraqis celebrating their liberation from saddam hussein 's regime .
" the big celebration has not happened yet , " groebel told the german news agency dpa .
" that is a visual disappointment . "
a succession of such setbacks would undermine support of the government 's war effort , he said .
" things are starting to get tricky and could trigger a change of public opinion in the united states , " groebel said .
the embedding would not have been possible without a techonological revolution that has given journalists an array of digital cameras , satellite phones and lightweight laptops to transmit their stories and images .
preston mendenhall , the international editor for msnbc.com , recently set off for northern iraq outfitted with $ 15,000 in satellite phones and computers .
with this equipment , he can file in a flash .

as the united nations negotiates an aid and reconstruction resolution in the coming days , europe is determined to get the u.n. heavily involved in post-saddam iraq , and the u.s. out as quickly as possible . as coalition forces meet with continued fierce resistance in the iraqi desert , united nations security council members are beginning discreet negotiations on an aid and reconstruction resolution on post-saddam iraq .

u.n. security council members are working on a resolution that would have the u.n. work only temporarily with the united states following the end of the war .
france , russia , china and syria , all staunch opponents of the war , are wary of fashioning a resolution that would have the u.n. fully cooperate with the u.s. and great britain , and thus give indirect support to the coalition invasion of iraq . germany , which currently heads the planning committee responsible for reconstruction , is optimistic an agreement can be reached as early as wednesday .

rules dictate reporters ' way of working but before reporters can send out their dispatches , they have to make sure their reports are in line with a 50-point set of pentagon rules .
these rules include a prohibition on " information on effectiveness of enemy camouflage , cover , deception , targeting , direct and indirect fire , intelligence collection , or security measures .

a veteran german television journalist , jörg armbruster , said in a recent interview with dw-world that he had deep doubts about the new approach .

the famous world war ii correspondent " ernie pyle did n't write any stories about cowards in world war ii , even though there were some .

jo groebel said the war began with a letdown for the pentagon leaders hungry for images of iraqis celebrating their liberation from saddam hussein 's regime .

the pentagon and u.s. media are very pleased with the way " embedded " correspondents are covering the war .
in europe , the media community is more skeptical . this was a new form of on-the-scene reporting .
a wounded u.s. marine , josh menard , was lying on a stretcher this week and talking to kerry sanders , a reporter from the u.s. television network nbc .
" i 'm all right , " said the 21-year-old corporal , whose left hand had been ripped open by an iraqi bullet .
" it just hurts pretty bad . "
then , sanders popped the question : " got any family members you want to look in the camera and tell them you 're feeling all right ? "
menard certainly did .
" mom , dad : i 'm all right , and we 'll be back when we get back , " the marine said .
pentagon changes thinking sanders ' stretcher-side interview near the iraqi city of nasiriyah was made possible by two sweeping developments - a change in pentagon thinking about the media and major advances in video technology .
" embedded " is the buzz word used to describe the more than 600 journalists covering the war from the gun-muzzle perspective of u.s. fighting forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers as the war enters its second week , america 's media corps are expressing their satisfaction with the results of the sweeping pentagon public relations effort .
but some observers , including those in germany , are raising doubts about a form of reporting that has journalists living and possibly dying with the people they are covering .
the idea represents a sea change in pentagon officials ' thinking about war reporting .
having watched critical television reports about the vietnam war in the 1960s and early 1970s undermine support for u.s. forces , the leadership decided to keep most reporters at a safe distance from the troops during the first persian gulf war in 1991 and the nato war over kosovo in 1999 .

pentagon changes thinking sanders ' stretcher-side interview near the iraqi city of nasiriyah was made possible by two sweeping developments - a change in pentagon thinking about the media and major advances in video technology .
" embedded " is the buzz word used to describe the more than 600 journalists covering the war from the gun-muzzle perspective of u.s. fighting forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers as the war enters its second week , america 's media corps are expressing their satisfaction with the results of the sweeping pentagon public relations effort .
but some observers , including those in germany , are raising doubts about a form of reporting that has journalists living and possibly dying with the people they are covering .
the idea represents a sea change in pentagon officials ' thinking about war reporting .
having watched critical television reports about the vietnam war in the 1960s and early 1970s undermine support for u.s. forces , the leadership decided to keep most reporters at a safe distance from the troops during the first persian gulf war in 1991 and the nato war over kosovo in 1999 .
today , openness is the priority .
" here 's why embedding is important to me , " col. rick thomas , chief of u.s. military public affairs in kuwait , told the british newspaper the financial times .
" as the public affairs officer , i have a deep and abiding obligation to tell the families of our servicemembers what they are doing . ...
my objective is that through the journalists ' eyes and through their words and images , mothers and fathers will understand the courage , dedication and sacrifices of their sons and daughters . "
rules dictate reporters ' way of working but before reporters can send out their dispatches , they have to make sure their reports are in line with a 50-point set of pentagon rules .
these rules include a prohibition on " information on effectiveness of enemy camouflage , cover , deception , targeting , direct and indirect fire , intelligence collection , or security measures . " the rules also prohibit disclosure of anything involving future operations and discussion of " unique " tactics employed by the military .
a veteran german television journalist , jörg armbruster , said in a recent interview with dw-world that he had deep doubts about the new approach .
" i think it is very problematic when you ca n't distinguish between the soldiers and reporters , " said armbruster , who was covering iraq from baghdad until the war began .
such concerns are shared by andy rooney , the veteran cbs television commentator who flew on bombing missions over germany in world war ii as a correspondent for military newspaper the stars and stripes .
" it 's very difficult to write anything critical about a guy you 're going to have breakfast with the next morning , " rooney told the newspaper usa today .
the famous world war ii correspondent " ernie pyle did n't write any stories about cowards in world war ii , even though there were some .
i suspect in this war , we 're going to get a lot of stories about heroes . "
armbruster also raised questions about the value of reporting conducted under the cover of the pentagon 's rules .
" the war can not be reported under such conditions , " he said .
despite the restrictions , members of the u.s. media are pleased with the program so far .
" in our view , it 's working out very , very , very , very well , " marcy mcginnis , senior vice president of news coverage for cbs news , told the associated press .
program could backfire while german journalists like armbruster question the value of the program itself , the director of the european media institute in düsseldorf said he suspected that the pentagon could face another vietnam-like disaster if the war went offtrack .
jo groebel said the war began with a letdown for the pentagon leaders hungry for images of iraqis celebrating their liberation from saddam hussein 's regime .
" the big celebration has not happened yet , " groebel told the german news agency dpa .
" that is a visual disappointment . "
a succession of such setbacks would undermine support of the government 's war effort , he said .
" things are starting to get tricky and could trigger a change of public opinion in the united states , " groebel said .
the embedding would not have been possible without a techonological revolution that has given journalists an array of digital cameras , satellite phones and lightweight laptops to transmit their stories and images .
preston mendenhall , the international editor for msnbc.com , recently set off for northern iraq outfitted with $ 15,000 in satellite phones and computers .
with this equipment , he can file in a flash .
" you get a connection , set up the camera , point it at yourself and just do it — you 're live , " mendenhall told the associated press in an interview conducted by satellite phone .

germany 's highest court ruled that the parliament does not have to vote on the deployment of air crews to turkey , a nato member .
but the opposition will push a bill that requires a vote on such missions in the future . german chancellor gerhard schröder , under legal fire for his decision to provide military support to nato during the war against iraq , won the support of the country 's highest court late tuesday for deciding to help the alliance member turkey monitor its airspace for potential threats from iraq .
the federal constitutional court threw out a request from a small opposition party , the free democrats , that the justices require the nation 's parliament to vote on the deployment of the surveillance plane crews .
the justices said they would not require the parliament to vote because the country needed to be a reliable partner in foreign policy issues .
they said that requiring the vote now could cause extensive damage to germany 's standing in the international community , particularly if the country were required to remove the aircrews from the planes .
the government expressed satisfaction with the ruling .
" i welcome this decision very much because it gives the federal government the leeway it needs in foreign-policy issues - particularly during this difficult time , " german defense minister peter struck said .
new law will be urged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle the leader of the free democrats , guido westerwelle -lrb- photo -rrb- , said he would accept the decision for now , but would launch a parliamentary effort to require lawmakers to vote on every foreign deployment of german troops .
currently , the parliament is required to vote on foreign deployments that are not being carried out by the north atlantic treaty organization , whose 19 members have pledged to defend one another .
the issue of nato assistance to turkey triggered one of the worst crises in nato 's 53-year history .
germany , france and belgium , opponents of a possible u.s. war against iraq at the time , vetoed the america request to assist turkey in february .
all three maintained that such preparations would indicate that a war against iraq was inevitable .
the alliance 's leadership worked out a compromise after six days of talks , and nato eventually sent four of the awacs -lrb- airborne warning and control systems -rrb- planes to turkey to watch over the country 's airspace .
germany is providing one-third of the air crews , about 20 servicemembers .
if the country pulled out those crew members , the alliance could not continue the mission .
after accepting the compromise , chancellor schröder was forced to defend the decision amid criticism from the free democrats and other opposition members who maintained that the deployment was a foreign military mission that the parliament must consider .
" we still doubt where the deployment of awacs planes is legal , " michael glos of the opposition party christian social union said last week .
those doubts stem from the planes ' ability to watch over turkey 's airspace and simultaneously look deeply into iraq 's , glos said .
chancellor defends decision schröder rejected the call for a vote , saying the planes were under the control of nato 's supreme allied commander europe and not the united states .
" therefore , no vote by the parliament is necessary , " he told the nation 's lawmakers last week .
despite his support of the mission in the parliament , the chancellor still has doubts about the air crews ' role in turkey .
these doubts stem from the possibility that turkey will send an invasion force into northern iraq and trigger a conflict with the kurds who have enjoyed autonomy there since the first persian gulf war ended in 1991 .
on saturday , schröder convened his security cabinet to discuss the issue after he heard media reports that turkey had begun to deploy troops .
after the meeting , foreign minister joschka fischer issued a threat to the turkish government .
" if turkey becomes involved in the war , then it ’ s a new situation for us , and it would cause the removal of german servicemembers from the awacs aircraft , " fischer said .
small numbers of turkish troops have been in northern iraq since the 1990s , operating against rebel turkish kurds who have retreated there .
turkey is concerned that a kurdish state could emerge after the war against iraq and would reignite the armed kurdish separatism in southeastern turkey that cost 30,000 lives in the 1980s and 1990s .
iraqi kurdish groups fear turkey might move to crush their autonomy .
opposition arises over base use separately , schröder has been under pressure over support he is providing the united states in its war against iraq .
at issue is his decision to allow the united states to use its military bases in germany and german airspace to conduct operations against iraq .
on wednesday , the day before the united states opened its war to overthrow saddam hussein , schröder defended his decisions in an address to parliament .
" there may indeed be different opinions on international law , " the chancellor said .
" but because of our obligations to -lrb- nato -rrb- , we will permit the use of the bases , will not ban the use of german airspace , and we will naturally provide security for the facilities of our friends .

germany , france and belgium , opponents of a possible u.s. war against iraq at the time , vetoed the america request to assist turkey in february .
all three maintained that such preparations would indicate that a war against iraq was inevitable .
the alliance 's leadership worked out a compromise after six days of talks , and nato eventually sent four of the awacs -lrb- airborne warning and control systems -rrb- planes to turkey to watch over the country 's airspace .
germany is providing one-third of the air crews , about 20 servicemembers .
if the country pulled out those crew members , the alliance could not continue the mission .
after accepting the compromise , chancellor schröder was forced to defend the decision amid criticism from the free democrats and other opposition members who maintained that the deployment was a foreign military mission that the parliament must consider .
" we still doubt where the deployment of awacs planes is legal , " michael glos of the opposition party christian social union said last week .
those doubts stem from the planes ' ability to watch over turkey 's airspace and simultaneously look deeply into iraq 's , glos said .
chancellor defends decision schröder rejected the call for a vote , saying the planes were under the control of nato 's supreme allied commander europe and not the united states .
" therefore , no vote by the parliament is necessary , " he told the nation 's lawmakers last week .
despite his support of the mission in the parliament , the chancellor still has doubts about the air crews ' role in turkey .
these doubts stem from the possibility that turkey will send an invasion force into northern iraq and trigger a conflict with the kurds who have enjoyed autonomy there since the first persian gulf war ended in 1991 .
on saturday , schröder convened his security cabinet to discuss the issue after he heard media reports that turkey had begun to deploy troops .
after the meeting , foreign minister joschka fischer issued a threat to the turkish government .
" if turkey becomes involved in the war , then it ’ s a new situation for us , and it would cause the removal of german servicemembers from the awacs aircraft , " fischer said .
small numbers of turkish troops have been in northern iraq since the 1990s , operating against rebel turkish kurds who have retreated there .
turkey is concerned that a kurdish state could emerge after the war against iraq and would reignite the armed kurdish separatism in southeastern turkey that cost 30,000 lives in the 1980s and 1990s .
iraqi kurdish groups fear turkey might move to crush their autonomy .
opposition arises over base use separately , schröder has been under pressure over support he is providing the united states in its war against iraq .
at issue is his decision to allow the united states to use its military bases in germany and german airspace to conduct operations against iraq .
on wednesday , the day before the united states opened its war to overthrow saddam hussein , schröder defended his decisions in an address to parliament .
" there may indeed be different opinions on international law , " the chancellor said .
" but because of our obligations to -lrb- nato -rrb- , we will permit the use of the bases , will not ban the use of german airspace , and we will naturally provide security for the facilities of our friends .

germany 's highest court ruled that the parliament does not have to vote on the deployment of air crews to turkey , a nato member .
but the opposition will push a bill that requires a vote on such missions in the future . german chancellor gerhard schröder , under legal fire for his decision to provide military support to nato during the war against iraq , won the support of the country 's highest court late tuesday for deciding to help the alliance member turkey monitor its airspace for potential threats from iraq .
the federal constitutional court threw out a request from a small opposition party , the free democrats , that the justices require the nation 's parliament to vote on the deployment of the surveillance plane crews .
the justices said they would not require the parliament to vote because the country needed to be a reliable partner in foreign policy issues .
they said that requiring the vote now could cause extensive damage to germany 's standing in the international community , particularly if the country were required to remove the aircrews from the planes .
the government expressed satisfaction with the ruling .
" i welcome this decision very much because it gives the federal government the leeway it needs in foreign-policy issues - particularly during this difficult time , " german defense minister peter struck said .

but while some potential visitors are staying away , parts of the country are benefiting as people change their travel plans .
recent research by the association of british travel agents -lrb- abta -rrb- suggests about 570,000 uk residents will this year swap a holiday abroad for a domestic break as a result of security fears .
at the same time , inbound tourism is falling with the top end of the market , made up of the highest spenders , all but collapsing .
bob cotton , chief executive of the british hospitality association told bbc news online : " london is particularly weak and this has been caused as much as anything by the corporate sector falling off .
" it has got worse over the last three or four months and we 've now seen this spread out to other cities in britain .
jobs threatened " conversely , the further you move away from the cities , in places like devon , cornwall and the lake district , the rural areas are enjoying the best trading they 've ever had .
" but in central london , 300,000 people are employed in tourism .
these jobs are under pressure unless the city business picks up . "
the first gulf war -lrb- 1991 -rrb- and the events of 2001 had an effect on the number of foreign visitors to britain , as shown below 1990 - 18m visitors 1991 - 17.1m 1992 - 18.5m 2000 - 25.2m 2001 - 22.8m 2002 - 24.2m the tourism industry has become used to both world and domestic events affecting trade , particularly in terms of foreign visitors .
elliott frisby from the british tourist authority said : " we 've noticed trends in foreign markets .
" the japanese are quite easily put off flying by events like the war .
" the united states remains our most important foreign market but japanese tourism was down by about 40 % in 2001 when we had foot-and-mouth and 11 september .
" americans are nervous about travelling in the immediate period but the strong relationship between britain and the us helps .
they look to travel to britain more than any other european country .
" they consider britain as their first choice destination and this is helped by a recognition of the support britain gives to the united states , particularly in the aftermath of 11 september . "
a familiar situation on wednesday a new body to promote british tourism was launched .
visitbritain will effectively replace the existing bristish tourist authority and the english tourism council .
one of its first tasks will be to launch an englsih domestic marketing campaign to encourage people to holiday in their own country .
rural attractions like stonehenge are as popular as ever a spokesman for the english tourism council -lrb- etc -rrb- said : " tourism in the uk is n't wholly dependent on inbound custom , but overseas visitors tend to be higher spenders than domestic tourists .
" in 2002 , the value to britain of tourism was £ 75.9bn and four-fifths of that came from domestic tourism .
" that does , though , still leave 20 % of our tourist income dependent on foreign visitors .
" at times like this you do see a bit more domestic tourism .
some uk residents who are motivated by security concerns may switch their holiday plans especially from areas such as the eastern mediterranean . "
the main concern for tourism is the length of time the war continues .
" if it is as short as the 1991 gulf war then things should n't be affected too much " , said the etc spokesman .
" if the conflict lasts into early summer , it would have an impact on inbound tourism . "
for bob cotton , there is a recognition that the industry is becoming all too familiar with these problems .
he said : " the feeling in the industry at the moment is that we 've been here before and we know how to deal with it .
" people feel its time to batten down the hatches now but prepare for when the upturn comes .
the trade will come back . "

the 1,846-tonne rms mulheim was travelling from cork to lubeck , germany , when she ran aground on saturday .
the maritime and coastguard agency says there is no practical way to move the ship , which would be " left to the mercy of the seas " .
but vicky garner , campaign director of surfers against sewage , said salvage companies had told her the vessel could be dismantled and sold for scrap .
she said : " you would not leave a crashed lorry across a road , so we do n't see why you should leave a ship on a beach if it can be carried away .
salvagers inspect hull damage " it will rust away and bits and pieces can float off , causing a hazard to shipping , fishing and people on beaches . "
she added : " it will probably be expensive to move , but the environment could suffer for years .
" we believe the owners should be responsible for removing the vessel as any pollution should be cleared by the polluter . "
work is being carried out to clear the mulheim of pollutants , paints and diesel by wednesday .
it is then hoped that work will begin to salvage more than 2,000 tonnes of shredded plastic from its hold .
donald macdonald , counter-pollution and salvage officer for the maritime and coastguard agency , said the ship would then be left where it was .
he said : " we are doing as much as possible to protect the environment and get as much off her in the time we have got .
" but there 's no way we can move her and she will be left to the mercy of the seas . "

the british telecom communication tower was the first purpose-built tower to transmit high frequency radio waves .
it was designed to allow for the rapid expansion of telephone communications and to overcome the difficulty of laying cables in london .
its construction began in 1961 but there were fears at the time that its height and modern style would be out of keeping with the tone of the area .
the cylindrical shape of the tower reduced wind resistance and gave it stability and style .
the tower , incorporating observation galleries and a restaurant , stands at 620 feet above street level , including a 40-feet high london weather centre radar mast .

the restaurant closed in 1980 when the owner 's lease expired .
it has subsequently been refurbished and is now used for corporate entertainment .
its new status was granted by sir neil cossons , the chairman of english heritage , on wednesday morning at the tower .
arts minister baroness blackstone was also there .
she said : " it is an icon for sixties design and science , and we should be proud of it . "
listed buildings are graded according to their architectural or historical importance , with grade i denoting those of exceptional interest .
grade ii buildings are deemed particularly important , and like grade i buildings may be eligible for english heritage grants for urgent major repairs .

the 1,846-tonne rms mulheim was travelling from cork to lubeck , germany , when she ran aground on saturday .
the maritime and coastguard agency says there is no practical way to move the ship , which would be " left to the mercy of the seas " .
but vicky garner , campaign director of surfers against sewage , said salvage companies had told her the vessel could be dismantled and sold for scrap .
she said : " you would not leave a crashed lorry across a road , so we do n't see why you should leave a ship on a beach if it can be carried away .
salvagers inspect hull damage " it will rust away and bits and pieces can float off , causing a hazard to shipping , fishing and people on beaches . "
she added : " it will probably be expensive to move , but the environment could suffer for years .
" we believe the owners should be responsible for removing the vessel as any pollution should be cleared by the polluter . "
work is being carried out to clear the mulheim of pollutants , paints and diesel by wednesday .
it is then hoped that work will begin to salvage more than 2,000 tonnes of shredded plastic from its hold .
donald macdonald , counter-pollution and salvage officer for the maritime and coastguard agency , said the ship would then be left where it was .
he said : " we are doing as much as possible to protect the environment and get as much off her in the time we have got .

the rescue operation on the scottish islands has been launched by a coalition of animal welfare groups .
scottish natural heritage -lrb- snh -rrb- is seeking to cull the first of 5,000 hedgehogs next week in an effort to help preserve rare wading birds on the uists in the western isles .
it said it would go ahead with the cull by lethal injection because transportation is cruel .
however , the uist hedgehog rescue coalition is offering islanders £ 5 for every live hedgehog delivered to its collection point for transportation to the mainland .
resettlement on the mainland hedgehog specialists are set to brief islanders on north and south uist and benbecula on how to catch and care for the animals .
those behind the coalition include advocates for animals , the mammal society , the tiggywinkles wildlife hospital and the british hedgehog preservation society .
after paying for the hedgehog collection , the animals will be flow off for resettlement on the mainland .
snh said its research shows that transported animals often end up starving to death in unfamiliar surroundings .
it is determined to press ahead with the cull of the first 200 hedgehogs .
preying on eggs snh said the move was regrettable but necessary to preserve the eggs of rare birds .
a handful of hedgehogs were first introduced to the uists in 1974 to help control slugs and snails in islanders ' gardens .
their numbers mushroomed but so did the threat to important populations of waders including dunlin , lapwing , redshank and snipe .
recent surveys have shown that the numbers of some species of wading birds dropped by nearly 60 % in the last five years .
snh said the hedgehogs were jeopardising the populations of some birds by preying on their eggs .
