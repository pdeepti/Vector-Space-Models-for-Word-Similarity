french officials on wednesday accused a german citizen of being a leading member of the al qaeda terrorist network with ties to osama bin laden .
the man is also suspected of involvement in a deadly bombing in tunisia . christian ganczarski , a 36-year-old german citizen of polish descent , was arrested on june 2 at paris ’ charles de gaulle airport .
although he has not yet been officially charged , french authorities appear convinced he is a high-ranking member of the islamic extremist group al qaeda . " -lrb- intelligence -rrb- services know that he is a top leader of al qaeda , in contact with osama bin laden himself , and has been in afghanistan and bosnia , " french interior minister nicolas sarkozy told parliament .
" this individual is a specialist in computers and in radio communication services . " but according to the reuters news agency , a judicial source close to the investigation contested the officials ' account - saying french prosecutors had no evidence of any close link between ganczarski and bin laden , founder of al qaeda network .
authorities are now concentrating on ganczarski ’ s possible role in the bombing of a synagogue in djerba , tunisia , last year that killed 21 tourists , including 14 germans . questioned and released german police questioned ganczarski last year about the djerba attack after it was established he had telephoned with one of the suicide bombers shortly before the attack .
he was detained but then later released when no direct involvement in the incident could be found .
shortly thereafter he moved to saudi arabia . although during his time in training camps in afghanistan he was known as “ ibrahim the german , ” ganczarski is of polish descent .
born in southern poland in 1966 , he later moved to germany with his parents and became a naturalized citizen .
he and his wife are converts to islam .
trained as a locksmith , he eventually became know as a “ computer expert ” in extremist circles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mounir el motassadeq germany has been a focal point for investigations into al qaeda terrorist activity ever since it was discovered that several of the key figures in the sept .

mehdi , who has lived in germany for years , was allegedly plotting attacks on the island of la reunion in the indian ocean and against u.s. military bases in germany .

but in the last minutes of the european championship qualifier germany pulled out a 2-0 victory . it came down to the final seconds .
would powerhouse germany be spared an embarrassing draw with the modest faroe islands team ?
the three-time world champions needed a win in wednesday night ’ s 2004 european championship qualifier match in the north atlantic to hold on to their top seat in group five .
but the goals remained elusive until the 89th minute when substitute striker miroslav klose pulled his team into the lead with one minute left on the clock .
then striker fredi bobic doubled the advantage two minutes into extended time , saving the german team from humiliation .
a close call on paper though , it should have been an easy win .
germany was given 8-1 and 10-2 odds against the faroe islands team , a group of amateur players which has yet to make it beyond qualifier matches .
but the faroese gave it their all , and with the home-team advantage and a jam-packed torshavn stadium , the germans struggled to overcome the islanders defense .
wednesday ’ s match was not the first time germany ’ s supposedly strong national team failed to dominate a supposedly lesser opponent . after the disappointing 1-1 draw with scotland last saturday , german team coach rudi völler was just relieved to come out a winner .

" unfortunately we lost in the last minute .

a ruling by germany 's federal court of justice is forcing utility companies to buy renewable energy , even though it costs over ten times more than conventionally-produced power . germany 's federal court of justice in karlsruhe has ruled that the country 's renewable energies law eeg does not violate any constitutional rights .
the legislation guarantees wind turbine operators and solar energy producers much higher market prices for their ecological power .
the ruling came about after the regional electricity company schleswag in northern germany took its case to court .
it had refused to comply with the law , claiming that it violated its entrepreneurial freedom .
the company did not want to be forced to feed in power generated by several wind turbine operators in the region .
the minimum price requirements also posed an illegal subsidy , schleswag said .
the eeg stipulates that german utility companies pay a minimum of € 0.48 -lrb- $ 0.56 -rrb- per kilowatt hour to purchase energy generated by wind power , compared to € 0.03 to € 0.05 for conventionally produced electricity .
the judges in karlsruhe said in their ruling that despite the liberalization of the german energy market , utility companies still carried a particular responsibility to environmentally-friendly energy production .
the european court of justice in luxembourg already in 2001 ruled that the eeg did not represent indirect government subsidizing .
the world leader in wind energy federal environment minister jürgen trittin welcomed the court 's decision on wednesday .
he said he expected the major power providers to give up their resistance to renewable energies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin " renewable energies are a central element of the federal government 's environmental and energy policies , " trittin said in a statement .
" i assume that utility companies will get used to it . "
according to the environment ministry , the proportion of renewable energy in electric power consumption has jumped from 4.6 percent in 1998 to around 9 percent currently .
one-third of wind energy worldwide is produced in germany with its 14,000 wind turbines .
" the economy , the labor force and the environment can profit from a strong expansion in renewable energies , " trittin said .
berlin 's pet project according to a recent study by shell , renewable energies will contribute at least 50 percent of the worldwide energy use by 2050 .
germany - together with japan , denmark and the united states - belongs to the world leaders in expanding its renewable energies market .
this sector has been a pet project of trittin 's , who is a member of the environmentally-friendly greens party .
since the coalition government of social democrats and greens took power in 1998 , state-aided programs sparked a boom in wind and solar energy units .
wind turbines in particular began popping up everywhere .
many operators went public and collected hundreds of millions of euros for their expansion plans on the stock market .
but the gold rush seems to be coming to an end , as this sector is simply running out of space .
although there are new projects for wind turbine parks planned off the north sea coast , the financing is still not settled .
the solar boom is also waning .
last year , only about 65,000 new solar energy units were set up , half as many as in 2001 .

would powerhouse germany be spared an embarrassing draw with the modest faroe islands team ?
the three-time world champions needed a win in wednesday night ’ s 2004 european championship qualifier match in the north atlantic to hold on to their top seat in group five .
but the goals remained elusive until the 89th minute when substitute striker miroslav klose pulled his team into the lead with one minute left on the clock .
then striker fredi bobic doubled the advantage two minutes into extended time , saving the german team from humiliation .
a close call on paper though , it should have been an easy win .
germany was given 8-1 and 10-2 odds against the faroe islands team , a group of amateur players which has yet to make it beyond qualifier matches .
but the faroese gave it their all , and with the home-team advantage and a jam-packed torshavn stadium , the germans struggled to overcome the islanders defense .
wednesday ’ s match was not the first time germany ’ s supposedly strong national team failed to dominate a supposedly lesser opponent . after the disappointing 1-1 draw with scotland last saturday , german team coach rudi völler was just relieved to come out a winner .
a sigh of relief " i am very happy .
the match was as problematic as i expected , " völler told reporters after the game .
" we could not score , but i knew it was just a question of time . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi völler völler added that he couldn ’ t reproach his players : " it ’ s hard to shine against opponents who concentrate on defending . "
the german coach praised the faroese goalie jakup mikkelsen for effectively thwarting the opponent ’ s goal attempts : " the way he played , he could play in the bundesliga or in any league in the world . "
playing with heart " we played with our hearts and showed the world , that we can keep up with the best , " the faroe coach henrik larsen said .
" unfortunately we lost in the last minute .
but i am very pleased with my team . "
that ’ s something german fans can ’ t say for their team .
the near-draw with the soccer minnows coupled with the draw against scotland is almost too much for a nation expected to always be a soccer powerhouse .
the top-selling daily bild newspaper on thursday called the team ’ s performance " shameful " and referred to the 2-0 victory as germany ’ s " luckiest win ever . "
franz beckenbauer , former world cup winning coach and player , expressed his doubts about the team after watching them scrape by .
" we are back to where we were before the world cup , " he said reminding viewers of germany ’ s struggle to qualify for last year ’ s final .
völler , for his part , was cautiously optimistic .
" we are in a good position now but we haven ’ t won the qualification -lrb- group -rrb- yet .
if we are to win , we have to play better than we have so far , " he said looking ahead at the match against iceland . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reticent germans face possible curse of the faroes everyone expected the germans to beat scotland on saturday but the resulting draw in the european championship qualifiers adds an ominous feeling to their next match against the tiny faroe islands -lrb- june 11 , 2003 -rrb- .

european and american defense ministers will attempt to fashion a “ new ” nato on thursday and friday , as the transatlantic alliance tries to keep its relevance in the face of changing security threats . nato officials in brussels are expected to discuss taking over peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and supporting poland 's efforts in iraq , but at the top of the agenda for the two-day meeting will be streamlining nato 's unwieldy command structure , which has remained largely unchanged since the cold war . " this is a new nato , a nato able to meet its commitments when times get tough , " nato secretary-general george robertson said as the ministers started their deliberations . at a summit in prague last november , nato leaders agreed the structure needed to be reformed in response to the collapse of communism and the defense alliance ’ s expansion to include former enemies in eastern europe .
but disagreement over the closure of some regional bases could yet scupper any agreement . spain and greece have fought efforts to revamp nato because they stand to lose alliance facilities and the jobs and prestige that come with them .
both countries oppose proposals to reduce the number of major nato installations to three joint regional headquarters and six smaller commands .
the plan would close a number of nato facilities , including a greek one in larissa and a spanish airbase in madrid . despite the rancor over the possible closures , most observers expect agreement over the new command structure after some intense political horse trading .
nato officials are also expected to discuss the progress of creating a rapid reaction force that could be available for missions worldwide . rapid reaction force by 2004 at the latest , nato hopes to have a flexible 20,000-troop force that could be readied for deployment anywhere in the world within 30 days .
a smaller amount of highly mobile soldiers are supposed to be ready for action within five days after received marching orders .
nato officials want the new force to be able to respond to a number of challenges , including global terrorism , peacekeeping and more serious military engagements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck " there are n't conventional wars anymore - instead we have to deal with terrorist threats , " said german defense minsiter peter struck on thursday . nato has been under considerable pressure to reinvent itself after the collapse of the soviet union , its traditional foe .
the terrorist attacks in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 , also encouraged the alliance to rethink its role .
one of the biggest changes in its 54-year history is its new willingness to take up missions beyond the borders of the 19 member countries . bridge building the alliance is taking the first steps in that direction by agreeing to take over command of the peacekeeping operations in afghanistan this summer and to help poland manage a zone of military control in postwar iraq . after an ugly internal split over the u.s.-led war in iraq , nato also hopes reinventing itself will heighten its relevance in international security matters as the european union discusses beefing up its own future military capabilities .
important for washington is that any eu force strengthens nato and is not promoted at the expense of the transatlantic alliance . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato to lend poland a hand in iraq the 19-member nato alliance has agreed to help poland establish an international peacekeeping contingent in iraq .

burning cds offline : a german firm has pioneered new technology it hopes will put music retailers - those old school brick-and-mortar shops - back in the game . a german firm based in lübeck , imhg , has developed new technology for use in music retail stores that allows customers to burn their own cd 's .
a pilot shop employing the technology just opened in lübeck , and more retail venues are expected to adopt the concept by the end of the year . the music industry , music labels and retail stores alike have been battling a common foe : the rise of online file-swapping sites .
services like kazaa allow music devotees to download their favorite songs for free and often illegally - all from the comfort of their own home . industry-wide profits have fallen by 10 percent and major labels are running scared .
" the music industry is in a crisis , " says a spokewoman for universal , sophie greiner .
" partly because many people are downloading their music from the internet . " fighting back music labels have since fought back , taking the most notorious of the online swapping sights , napster , to court and shutting it down .
-lrb- napster was based on a central registry of available files on its servers that connected users with other users with copies of the music they wanted to download .
other services like morpheus , which employ decentralized technology allowing users to track down and download music from other computers , have thus far escaped prosecution and persist to this day . -rrb-
the labels have attempted to start their own online services , offering music downloads for a fee . but music retailers were left out in the cold , watching many of their customers turn to online music venues , both file-sharing and those offered by labels , rather than visiting brick-and-mortar shops .
" as a retailer , you have to take some action when the record companies themselves start to sell music over the internet - otherwise you 'll get lost in the shuffle , " says oliver salzmann , founder of imhg , the lübeck-based company which invented the new technology . salzmann speaks from experience - his family also owns a large department store , pressezentrum , in lübeck , which specializes in music and technology products .
after watching the profits in his own music department fall , salzmann and his father martin felt they had to do something . browsing with a pda the salzmann 's developed a new retail concept , which allows customers to browse the store 's musical selections using an adapted personal digital assistant -lrb- pda -rrb- , or handheld computer to the less technologically inclined .
by running a scanner over the cds , they can download thirty second samplers from an inventory of up to 20,000 songs , select up to 15 titles at a cost of 99 cents each and proceed to the check-out , where their selections will be burned onto a cd .
the cd and jewel case cost an additional € 2 . a pilot store employing the service was launched last week at the salzmann 's store in lübeck .
but by the end of the year they hope to license their creation to other large department stores and say they are already in talks with several major german retailers .
a smaller version of the technology may even be installed in other locations , like at gas stations . unlike the dubious legality of online music sharing sites , this service is entirely legitimate .
imhg has contracts with three large labels - sony , universal and edel - and hopes to line up more by the end of the year .
the business model is simple : the retailers and record labels split the profits , fifty-fifty , of each song downloaded , while imhg makes its money from licensing its technology and technical support . but given the wide-spread popularity of internet music sites , will this approach be enough to bring customers back into the store ?
salzmann thinks the service will appeal to the less technologically inclined and to those who appreciate the assistance offered at a traditional music store . " many do n't want to deal with the logistics of going online and burning their own cd , " says salzmann .
" what 's more , we offer a very professional looking product . " changing the way we buy music imhg 's technology is the latest innovation in an industry that is struggling to change the way we buy music .
" the rise of online file-sharing sites showed us that customers want to search for individual songs and put them in a particular order , " says greiner .
the music industry has since been scrambling to meet the demand , but recent ventures show there are profits for those who try . apple recently launched its own legal online music library by striking similar agreements with record labels , offering apple users -lrb- thus far only within the united states -rrb- the opportunity to download songs for 99 cents .

" the music industry is in a crisis , " says a spokewoman for universal , sophie greiner .
" partly because many people are downloading their music from the internet . " fighting back music labels have since fought back , taking the most notorious of the online swapping sights , napster , to court and shutting it down .
-lrb- napster was based on a central registry of available files on its servers that connected users with other users with copies of the music they wanted to download .
other services like morpheus , which employ decentralized technology allowing users to track down and download music from other computers , have thus far escaped prosecution and persist to this day . -rrb-
the labels have attempted to start their own online services , offering music downloads for a fee . but music retailers were left out in the cold , watching many of their customers turn to online music venues , both file-sharing and those offered by labels , rather than visiting brick-and-mortar shops .
" as a retailer , you have to take some action when the record companies themselves start to sell music over the internet - otherwise you 'll get lost in the shuffle , " says oliver salzmann , founder of imhg , the lübeck-based company which invented the new technology . salzmann speaks from experience - his family also owns a large department store , pressezentrum , in lübeck , which specializes in music and technology products .
after watching the profits in his own music department fall , salzmann and his father martin felt they had to do something . browsing with a pda the salzmann 's developed a new retail concept , which allows customers to browse the store 's musical selections using an adapted personal digital assistant -lrb- pda -rrb- , or handheld computer to the less technologically inclined .
by running a scanner over the cds , they can download thirty second samplers from an inventory of up to 20,000 songs , select up to 15 titles at a cost of 99 cents each and proceed to the check-out , where their selections will be burned onto a cd .
the cd and jewel case cost an additional € 2 . a pilot store employing the service was launched last week at the salzmann 's store in lübeck .
but by the end of the year they hope to license their creation to other large department stores and say they are already in talks with several major german retailers .
a smaller version of the technology may even be installed in other locations , like at gas stations . unlike the dubious legality of online music sharing sites , this service is entirely legitimate .
imhg has contracts with three large labels - sony , universal and edel - and hopes to line up more by the end of the year .
the business model is simple : the retailers and record labels split the profits , fifty-fifty , of each song downloaded , while imhg makes its money from licensing its technology and technical support . but given the wide-spread popularity of internet music sites , will this approach be enough to bring customers back into the store ?
salzmann thinks the service will appeal to the less technologically inclined and to those who appreciate the assistance offered at a traditional music store . " many do n't want to deal with the logistics of going online and burning their own cd , " says salzmann .
" what 's more , we offer a very professional looking product . " changing the way we buy music imhg 's technology is the latest innovation in an industry that is struggling to change the way we buy music .
" the rise of online file-sharing sites showed us that customers want to search for individual songs and put them in a particular order , " says greiner .
the music industry has since been scrambling to meet the demand , but recent ventures show there are profits for those who try . apple recently launched its own legal online music library by striking similar agreements with record labels , offering apple users -lrb- thus far only within the united states -rrb- the opportunity to download songs for 99 cents .
the venture exceeded all expectations , with more than 2 million songs purchased and downloaded within the first 16 days .
as imhg branches out across germany and eventually worldwide , salzmann is hoping for similar success . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de technology stalks hollywood new online technology threatens the film industry 's status quo for copyrights and distribution .

european and american defense ministers will attempt to fashion a “ new ” nato on thursday and friday , as the transatlantic alliance tries to keep its relevance in the face of changing security threats . nato officials in brussels are expected to discuss taking over peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and supporting poland 's efforts in iraq , but at the top of the agenda for the two-day meeting will be streamlining nato 's unwieldy command structure , which has remained largely unchanged since the cold war . " this is a new nato , a nato able to meet its commitments when times get tough , " nato secretary-general george robertson said as the ministers started their deliberations . at a summit in prague last november , nato leaders agreed the structure needed to be reformed in response to the collapse of communism and the defense alliance ’ s expansion to include former enemies in eastern europe .
but disagreement over the closure of some regional bases could yet scupper any agreement . spain and greece have fought efforts to revamp nato because they stand to lose alliance facilities and the jobs and prestige that come with them .
both countries oppose proposals to reduce the number of major nato installations to three joint regional headquarters and six smaller commands .
the plan would close a number of nato facilities , including a greek one in larissa and a spanish airbase in madrid . despite the rancor over the possible closures , most observers expect agreement over the new command structure after some intense political horse trading .
nato officials are also expected to discuss the progress of creating a rapid reaction force that could be available for missions worldwide . rapid reaction force by 2004 at the latest , nato hopes to have a flexible 20,000-troop force that could be readied for deployment anywhere in the world within 30 days .

a ruling by germany 's federal court of justice is forcing utility companies to buy renewable energy , even though it costs over ten times more than conventionally-produced power . germany 's federal court of justice in karlsruhe has ruled that the country 's renewable energies law eeg does not violate any constitutional rights .
the legislation guarantees wind turbine operators and solar energy producers much higher market prices for their ecological power .
the ruling came about after the regional electricity company schleswag in northern germany took its case to court .
it had refused to comply with the law , claiming that it violated its entrepreneurial freedom .
the company did not want to be forced to feed in power generated by several wind turbine operators in the region .
the minimum price requirements also posed an illegal subsidy , schleswag said .
the eeg stipulates that german utility companies pay a minimum of € 0.48 -lrb- $ 0.56 -rrb- per kilowatt hour to purchase energy generated by wind power , compared to € 0.03 to € 0.05 for conventionally produced electricity .
the judges in karlsruhe said in their ruling that despite the liberalization of the german energy market , utility companies still carried a particular responsibility to environmentally-friendly energy production .
the european court of justice in luxembourg already in 2001 ruled that the eeg did not represent indirect government subsidizing .
the world leader in wind energy federal environment minister jürgen trittin welcomed the court 's decision on wednesday .
he said he expected the major power providers to give up their resistance to renewable energies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin " renewable energies are a central element of the federal government 's environmental and energy policies , " trittin said in a statement .
" i assume that utility companies will get used to it . "
according to the environment ministry , the proportion of renewable energy in electric power consumption has jumped from 4.6 percent in 1998 to around 9 percent currently .
one-third of wind energy worldwide is produced in germany with its 14,000 wind turbines .
" the economy , the labor force and the environment can profit from a strong expansion in renewable energies , " trittin said .
berlin 's pet project according to a recent study by shell , renewable energies will contribute at least 50 percent of the worldwide energy use by 2050 .
germany - together with japan , denmark and the united states - belongs to the world leaders in expanding its renewable energies market .
this sector has been a pet project of trittin 's , who is a member of the environmentally-friendly greens party .
since the coalition government of social democrats and greens took power in 1998 , state-aided programs sparked a boom in wind and solar energy units .
wind turbines in particular began popping up everywhere .
many operators went public and collected hundreds of millions of euros for their expansion plans on the stock market .
but the gold rush seems to be coming to an end , as this sector is simply running out of space .
although there are new projects for wind turbine parks planned off the north sea coast , the financing is still not settled .
the solar boom is also waning .
last year , only about 65,000 new solar energy units were set up , half as many as in 2001 .
germany - with its over 16 million square feet of solar panels - is the number two in the photo-voltaic sector after japan .
but the proportion of solar energy in germany 's power production is still less than one percent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the wind of change blows through germany viable sources of renewable energy have long been the ' holy grail ' of environmentalists across the globe .

european and american defense ministers will attempt to fashion a “ new ” nato on thursday and friday , as the transatlantic alliance tries to keep its relevance in the face of changing security threats . nato officials in brussels are expected to discuss taking over peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and supporting poland 's efforts in iraq , but at the top of the agenda for the two-day meeting will be streamlining nato 's unwieldy command structure , which has remained largely unchanged since the cold war . " this is a new nato , a nato able to meet its commitments when times get tough , " nato secretary-general george robertson said as the ministers started their deliberations . at a summit in prague last november , nato leaders agreed the structure needed to be reformed in response to the collapse of communism and the defense alliance ’ s expansion to include former enemies in eastern europe .
but disagreement over the closure of some regional bases could yet scupper any agreement . spain and greece have fought efforts to revamp nato because they stand to lose alliance facilities and the jobs and prestige that come with them .
both countries oppose proposals to reduce the number of major nato installations to three joint regional headquarters and six smaller commands .
the plan would close a number of nato facilities , including a greek one in larissa and a spanish airbase in madrid . despite the rancor over the possible closures , most observers expect agreement over the new command structure after some intense political horse trading .
nato officials are also expected to discuss the progress of creating a rapid reaction force that could be available for missions worldwide . rapid reaction force by 2004 at the latest , nato hopes to have a flexible 20,000-troop force that could be readied for deployment anywhere in the world within 30 days .

french officials on wednesday accused a german citizen of being a leading member of the al qaeda terrorist network with ties to osama bin laden .
the man is also suspected of involvement in a deadly bombing in tunisia . christian ganczarski , a 36-year-old german citizen of polish descent , was arrested on june 2 at paris ’ charles de gaulle airport .

" but according to the reuters news agency , a judicial source close to the investigation contested the officials ' account - saying french prosecutors had no evidence of any close link between ganczarski and bin laden , founder of al qaeda network .
authorities are now concentrating on ganczarski ’ s possible role in the bombing of a synagogue in djerba , tunisia , last year that killed 21 tourists , including 14 germans . questioned and released german police questioned ganczarski last year about the djerba attack after it was established he had telephoned with one of the suicide bombers shortly before the attack .
he was detained but then later released when no direct involvement in the incident could be found .

born in southern poland in 1966 , he later moved to germany with his parents and became a naturalized citizen .
he and his wife are converts to islam .

burning cds offline : a german firm has pioneered new technology it hopes will put music retailers - those old school brick-and-mortar shops - back in the game . a german firm based in lübeck , imhg , has developed new technology for use in music retail stores that allows customers to burn their own cd 's .
a pilot shop employing the technology just opened in lübeck , and more retail venues are expected to adopt the concept by the end of the year . the music industry , music labels and retail stores alike have been battling a common foe : the rise of online file-swapping sites .
services like kazaa allow music devotees to download their favorite songs for free and often illegally - all from the comfort of their own home . industry-wide profits have fallen by 10 percent and major labels are running scared .
" the music industry is in a crisis , " says a spokewoman for universal , sophie greiner .
" partly because many people are downloading their music from the internet . " fighting back music labels have since fought back , taking the most notorious of the online swapping sights , napster , to court and shutting it down .
-lrb- napster was based on a central registry of available files on its servers that connected users with other users with copies of the music they wanted to download .
other services like morpheus , which employ decentralized technology allowing users to track down and download music from other computers , have thus far escaped prosecution and persist to this day . -rrb-
the labels have attempted to start their own online services , offering music downloads for a fee . but music retailers were left out in the cold , watching many of their customers turn to online music venues , both file-sharing and those offered by labels , rather than visiting brick-and-mortar shops .
" as a retailer , you have to take some action when the record companies themselves start to sell music over the internet - otherwise you 'll get lost in the shuffle , " says oliver salzmann , founder of imhg , the lübeck-based company which invented the new technology . salzmann speaks from experience - his family also owns a large department store , pressezentrum , in lübeck , which specializes in music and technology products .
after watching the profits in his own music department fall , salzmann and his father martin felt they had to do something . browsing with a pda the salzmann 's developed a new retail concept , which allows customers to browse the store 's musical selections using an adapted personal digital assistant -lrb- pda -rrb- , or handheld computer to the less technologically inclined .
by running a scanner over the cds , they can download thirty second samplers from an inventory of up to 20,000 songs , select up to 15 titles at a cost of 99 cents each and proceed to the check-out , where their selections will be burned onto a cd .
the cd and jewel case cost an additional € 2 . a pilot store employing the service was launched last week at the salzmann 's store in lübeck .
but by the end of the year they hope to license their creation to other large department stores and say they are already in talks with several major german retailers .
a smaller version of the technology may even be installed in other locations , like at gas stations . unlike the dubious legality of online music sharing sites , this service is entirely legitimate .
imhg has contracts with three large labels - sony , universal and edel - and hopes to line up more by the end of the year .
the business model is simple : the retailers and record labels split the profits , fifty-fifty , of each song downloaded , while imhg makes its money from licensing its technology and technical support . but given the wide-spread popularity of internet music sites , will this approach be enough to bring customers back into the store ?
salzmann thinks the service will appeal to the less technologically inclined and to those who appreciate the assistance offered at a traditional music store . " many do n't want to deal with the logistics of going online and burning their own cd , " says salzmann .
" what 's more , we offer a very professional looking product . " changing the way we buy music imhg 's technology is the latest innovation in an industry that is struggling to change the way we buy music .
" the rise of online file-sharing sites showed us that customers want to search for individual songs and put them in a particular order , " says greiner .
the music industry has since been scrambling to meet the demand , but recent ventures show there are profits for those who try . apple recently launched its own legal online music library by striking similar agreements with record labels , offering apple users -lrb- thus far only within the united states -rrb- the opportunity to download songs for 99 cents .
the venture exceeded all expectations , with more than 2 million songs purchased and downloaded within the first 16 days .
as imhg branches out across germany and eventually worldwide , salzmann is hoping for similar success . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de technology stalks hollywood new online technology threatens the film industry 's status quo for copyrights and distribution .

" as a retailer , you have to take some action when the record companies themselves start to sell music over the internet - otherwise you 'll get lost in the shuffle , " says oliver salzmann , founder of imhg , the lübeck-based company which invented the new technology . salzmann speaks from experience - his family also owns a large department store , pressezentrum , in lübeck , which specializes in music and technology products .
after watching the profits in his own music department fall , salzmann and his father martin felt they had to do something . browsing with a pda the salzmann 's developed a new retail concept , which allows customers to browse the store 's musical selections using an adapted personal digital assistant -lrb- pda -rrb- , or handheld computer to the less technologically inclined .
by running a scanner over the cds , they can download thirty second samplers from an inventory of up to 20,000 songs , select up to 15 titles at a cost of 99 cents each and proceed to the check-out , where their selections will be burned onto a cd .
the cd and jewel case cost an additional € 2 . a pilot store employing the service was launched last week at the salzmann 's store in lübeck .
but by the end of the year they hope to license their creation to other large department stores and say they are already in talks with several major german retailers .
a smaller version of the technology may even be installed in other locations , like at gas stations . unlike the dubious legality of online music sharing sites , this service is entirely legitimate .
imhg has contracts with three large labels - sony , universal and edel - and hopes to line up more by the end of the year .
the business model is simple : the retailers and record labels split the profits , fifty-fifty , of each song downloaded , while imhg makes its money from licensing its technology and technical support . but given the wide-spread popularity of internet music sites , will this approach be enough to bring customers back into the store ?
salzmann thinks the service will appeal to the less technologically inclined and to those who appreciate the assistance offered at a traditional music store . " many do n't want to deal with the logistics of going online and burning their own cd , " says salzmann .
" what 's more , we offer a very professional looking product . " changing the way we buy music imhg 's technology is the latest innovation in an industry that is struggling to change the way we buy music .
" the rise of online file-sharing sites showed us that customers want to search for individual songs and put them in a particular order , " says greiner .
the music industry has since been scrambling to meet the demand , but recent ventures show there are profits for those who try . apple recently launched its own legal online music library by striking similar agreements with record labels , offering apple users -lrb- thus far only within the united states -rrb- the opportunity to download songs for 99 cents .
the venture exceeded all expectations , with more than 2 million songs purchased and downloaded within the first 16 days .
as imhg branches out across germany and eventually worldwide , salzmann is hoping for similar success . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de technology stalks hollywood new online technology threatens the film industry 's status quo for copyrights and distribution .

european and american defense ministers will attempt to fashion a “ new ” nato on thursday and friday , as the transatlantic alliance tries to keep its relevance in the face of changing security threats . nato officials in brussels are expected to discuss taking over peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and supporting poland 's efforts in iraq , but at the top of the agenda for the two-day meeting will be streamlining nato 's unwieldy command structure , which has remained largely unchanged since the cold war . " this is a new nato , a nato able to meet its commitments when times get tough , " nato secretary-general george robertson said as the ministers started their deliberations . at a summit in prague last november , nato leaders agreed the structure needed to be reformed in response to the collapse of communism and the defense alliance ’ s expansion to include former enemies in eastern europe .
but disagreement over the closure of some regional bases could yet scupper any agreement . spain and greece have fought efforts to revamp nato because they stand to lose alliance facilities and the jobs and prestige that come with them .
both countries oppose proposals to reduce the number of major nato installations to three joint regional headquarters and six smaller commands .
the plan would close a number of nato facilities , including a greek one in larissa and a spanish airbase in madrid . despite the rancor over the possible closures , most observers expect agreement over the new command structure after some intense political horse trading .
nato officials are also expected to discuss the progress of creating a rapid reaction force that could be available for missions worldwide . rapid reaction force by 2004 at the latest , nato hopes to have a flexible 20,000-troop force that could be readied for deployment anywhere in the world within 30 days .
a smaller amount of highly mobile soldiers are supposed to be ready for action within five days after received marching orders .
nato officials want the new force to be able to respond to a number of challenges , including global terrorism , peacekeeping and more serious military engagements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck " there are n't conventional wars anymore - instead we have to deal with terrorist threats , " said german defense minsiter peter struck on thursday . nato has been under considerable pressure to reinvent itself after the collapse of the soviet union , its traditional foe .
the terrorist attacks in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 , also encouraged the alliance to rethink its role .
one of the biggest changes in its 54-year history is its new willingness to take up missions beyond the borders of the 19 member countries . bridge building the alliance is taking the first steps in that direction by agreeing to take over command of the peacekeeping operations in afghanistan this summer and to help poland manage a zone of military control in postwar iraq . after an ugly internal split over the u.s.-led war in iraq , nato also hopes reinventing itself will heighten its relevance in international security matters as the european union discusses beefing up its own future military capabilities .
important for washington is that any eu force strengthens nato and is not promoted at the expense of the transatlantic alliance . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato to lend poland a hand in iraq the 19-member nato alliance has agreed to help poland establish an international peacekeeping contingent in iraq .

a ruling by germany 's federal court of justice is forcing utility companies to buy renewable energy , even though it costs over ten times more than conventionally-produced power . germany 's federal court of justice in karlsruhe has ruled that the country 's renewable energies law eeg does not violate any constitutional rights .
the legislation guarantees wind turbine operators and solar energy producers much higher market prices for their ecological power .
the ruling came about after the regional electricity company schleswag in northern germany took its case to court .
it had refused to comply with the law , claiming that it violated its entrepreneurial freedom .
the company did not want to be forced to feed in power generated by several wind turbine operators in the region .
the minimum price requirements also posed an illegal subsidy , schleswag said .
the eeg stipulates that german utility companies pay a minimum of € 0.48 -lrb- $ 0.56 -rrb- per kilowatt hour to purchase energy generated by wind power , compared to € 0.03 to € 0.05 for conventionally produced electricity .
the judges in karlsruhe said in their ruling that despite the liberalization of the german energy market , utility companies still carried a particular responsibility to environmentally-friendly energy production .
the european court of justice in luxembourg already in 2001 ruled that the eeg did not represent indirect government subsidizing .
the world leader in wind energy federal environment minister jürgen trittin welcomed the court 's decision on wednesday .
he said he expected the major power providers to give up their resistance to renewable energies .

" i assume that utility companies will get used to it . "
according to the environment ministry , the proportion of renewable energy in electric power consumption has jumped from 4.6 percent in 1998 to around 9 percent currently .
one-third of wind energy worldwide is produced in germany with its 14,000 wind turbines .
" the economy , the labor force and the environment can profit from a strong expansion in renewable energies , " trittin said .
berlin 's pet project according to a recent study by shell , renewable energies will contribute at least 50 percent of the worldwide energy use by 2050 .
germany - together with japan , denmark and the united states - belongs to the world leaders in expanding its renewable energies market .
this sector has been a pet project of trittin 's , who is a member of the environmentally-friendly greens party .
since the coalition government of social democrats and greens took power in 1998 , state-aided programs sparked a boom in wind and solar energy units .
wind turbines in particular began popping up everywhere .
many operators went public and collected hundreds of millions of euros for their expansion plans on the stock market .
but the gold rush seems to be coming to an end , as this sector is simply running out of space .
although there are new projects for wind turbine parks planned off the north sea coast , the financing is still not settled .
the solar boom is also waning .
last year , only about 65,000 new solar energy units were set up , half as many as in 2001 .

european and american defense ministers will attempt to fashion a “ new ” nato on thursday and friday , as the transatlantic alliance tries to keep its relevance in the face of changing security threats . nato officials in brussels are expected to discuss taking over peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and supporting poland 's efforts in iraq , but at the top of the agenda for the two-day meeting will be streamlining nato 's unwieldy command structure , which has remained largely unchanged since the cold war . " this is a new nato , a nato able to meet its commitments when times get tough , " nato secretary-general george robertson said as the ministers started their deliberations . at a summit in prague last november , nato leaders agreed the structure needed to be reformed in response to the collapse of communism and the defense alliance ’ s expansion to include former enemies in eastern europe .
but disagreement over the closure of some regional bases could yet scupper any agreement . spain and greece have fought efforts to revamp nato because they stand to lose alliance facilities and the jobs and prestige that come with them .
both countries oppose proposals to reduce the number of major nato installations to three joint regional headquarters and six smaller commands .
the plan would close a number of nato facilities , including a greek one in larissa and a spanish airbase in madrid . despite the rancor over the possible closures , most observers expect agreement over the new command structure after some intense political horse trading .
nato officials are also expected to discuss the progress of creating a rapid reaction force that could be available for missions worldwide . rapid reaction force by 2004 at the latest , nato hopes to have a flexible 20,000-troop force that could be readied for deployment anywhere in the world within 30 days .

the german soccer team was spared from what could have been an embarrassing draw with the mostly amateur faroe islanders .
but in the last minutes of the european championship qualifier germany pulled out a 2-0 victory . it came down to the final seconds .
would powerhouse germany be spared an embarrassing draw with the modest faroe islands team ?
the three-time world champions needed a win in wednesday night ’ s 2004 european championship qualifier match in the north atlantic to hold on to their top seat in group five .
but the goals remained elusive until the 89th minute when substitute striker miroslav klose pulled his team into the lead with one minute left on the clock .
then striker fredi bobic doubled the advantage two minutes into extended time , saving the german team from humiliation .
a close call on paper though , it should have been an easy win .
germany was given 8-1 and 10-2 odds against the faroe islands team , a group of amateur players which has yet to make it beyond qualifier matches .
but the faroese gave it their all , and with the home-team advantage and a jam-packed torshavn stadium , the germans struggled to overcome the islanders defense .
wednesday ’ s match was not the first time germany ’ s supposedly strong national team failed to dominate a supposedly lesser opponent . after the disappointing 1-1 draw with scotland last saturday , german team coach rudi völler was just relieved to come out a winner .
a sigh of relief " i am very happy .
the match was as problematic as i expected , " völler told reporters after the game .
" we could not score , but i knew it was just a question of time . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi völler völler added that he couldn ’ t reproach his players : " it ’ s hard to shine against opponents who concentrate on defending . "
the german coach praised the faroese goalie jakup mikkelsen for effectively thwarting the opponent ’ s goal attempts : " the way he played , he could play in the bundesliga or in any league in the world . "
playing with heart " we played with our hearts and showed the world , that we can keep up with the best , " the faroe coach henrik larsen said .
" unfortunately we lost in the last minute .
but i am very pleased with my team . "
that ’ s something german fans can ’ t say for their team .
the near-draw with the soccer minnows coupled with the draw against scotland is almost too much for a nation expected to always be a soccer powerhouse .
the top-selling daily bild newspaper on thursday called the team ’ s performance " shameful " and referred to the 2-0 victory as germany ’ s " luckiest win ever . "
franz beckenbauer , former world cup winning coach and player , expressed his doubts about the team after watching them scrape by .
" we are back to where we were before the world cup , " he said reminding viewers of germany ’ s struggle to qualify for last year ’ s final .
völler , for his part , was cautiously optimistic .
" we are in a good position now but we haven ’ t won the qualification -lrb- group -rrb- yet .

the german soccer team was spared from what could have been an embarrassing draw with the mostly amateur faroe islanders .
but in the last minutes of the european championship qualifier germany pulled out a 2-0 victory . it came down to the final seconds .
would powerhouse germany be spared an embarrassing draw with the modest faroe islands team ?
the three-time world champions needed a win in wednesday night ’ s 2004 european championship qualifier match in the north atlantic to hold on to their top seat in group five .
but the goals remained elusive until the 89th minute when substitute striker miroslav klose pulled his team into the lead with one minute left on the clock .
then striker fredi bobic doubled the advantage two minutes into extended time , saving the german team from humiliation .
a close call on paper though , it should have been an easy win .
germany was given 8-1 and 10-2 odds against the faroe islands team , a group of amateur players which has yet to make it beyond qualifier matches .
but the faroese gave it their all , and with the home-team advantage and a jam-packed torshavn stadium , the germans struggled to overcome the islanders defense .
wednesday ’ s match was not the first time germany ’ s supposedly strong national team failed to dominate a supposedly lesser opponent . after the disappointing 1-1 draw with scotland last saturday , german team coach rudi völler was just relieved to come out a winner .
a sigh of relief " i am very happy .
the match was as problematic as i expected , " völler told reporters after the game .
" we could not score , but i knew it was just a question of time . "

a ruling by germany 's federal court of justice is forcing utility companies to buy renewable energy , even though it costs over ten times more than conventionally-produced power . germany 's federal court of justice in karlsruhe has ruled that the country 's renewable energies law eeg does not violate any constitutional rights .
the legislation guarantees wind turbine operators and solar energy producers much higher market prices for their ecological power .
the ruling came about after the regional electricity company schleswag in northern germany took its case to court .
it had refused to comply with the law , claiming that it violated its entrepreneurial freedom .
the company did not want to be forced to feed in power generated by several wind turbine operators in the region .
the minimum price requirements also posed an illegal subsidy , schleswag said .
the eeg stipulates that german utility companies pay a minimum of € 0.48 -lrb- $ 0.56 -rrb- per kilowatt hour to purchase energy generated by wind power , compared to € 0.03 to € 0.05 for conventionally produced electricity .
the judges in karlsruhe said in their ruling that despite the liberalization of the german energy market , utility companies still carried a particular responsibility to environmentally-friendly energy production .
the european court of justice in luxembourg already in 2001 ruled that the eeg did not represent indirect government subsidizing .
the world leader in wind energy federal environment minister jürgen trittin welcomed the court 's decision on wednesday .
he said he expected the major power providers to give up their resistance to renewable energies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin " renewable energies are a central element of the federal government 's environmental and energy policies , " trittin said in a statement .
" i assume that utility companies will get used to it . "
according to the environment ministry , the proportion of renewable energy in electric power consumption has jumped from 4.6 percent in 1998 to around 9 percent currently .
one-third of wind energy worldwide is produced in germany with its 14,000 wind turbines .
" the economy , the labor force and the environment can profit from a strong expansion in renewable energies , " trittin said .
berlin 's pet project according to a recent study by shell , renewable energies will contribute at least 50 percent of the worldwide energy use by 2050 .
germany - together with japan , denmark and the united states - belongs to the world leaders in expanding its renewable energies market .
this sector has been a pet project of trittin 's , who is a member of the environmentally-friendly greens party .
since the coalition government of social democrats and greens took power in 1998 , state-aided programs sparked a boom in wind and solar energy units .
wind turbines in particular began popping up everywhere .
many operators went public and collected hundreds of millions of euros for their expansion plans on the stock market .
but the gold rush seems to be coming to an end , as this sector is simply running out of space .
although there are new projects for wind turbine parks planned off the north sea coast , the financing is still not settled .
the solar boom is also waning .
last year , only about 65,000 new solar energy units were set up , half as many as in 2001 .
germany - with its over 16 million square feet of solar panels - is the number two in the photo-voltaic sector after japan .

a ruling by germany 's federal court of justice is forcing utility companies to buy renewable energy , even though it costs over ten times more than conventionally-produced power . germany 's federal court of justice in karlsruhe has ruled that the country 's renewable energies law eeg does not violate any constitutional rights .
the legislation guarantees wind turbine operators and solar energy producers much higher market prices for their ecological power .
the ruling came about after the regional electricity company schleswag in northern germany took its case to court .
it had refused to comply with the law , claiming that it violated its entrepreneurial freedom .
the company did not want to be forced to feed in power generated by several wind turbine operators in the region .
the minimum price requirements also posed an illegal subsidy , schleswag said .
the eeg stipulates that german utility companies pay a minimum of € 0.48 -lrb- $ 0.56 -rrb- per kilowatt hour to purchase energy generated by wind power , compared to € 0.03 to € 0.05 for conventionally produced electricity .
the judges in karlsruhe said in their ruling that despite the liberalization of the german energy market , utility companies still carried a particular responsibility to environmentally-friendly energy production .
the european court of justice in luxembourg already in 2001 ruled that the eeg did not represent indirect government subsidizing .
the world leader in wind energy federal environment minister jürgen trittin welcomed the court 's decision on wednesday .
he said he expected the major power providers to give up their resistance to renewable energies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin " renewable energies are a central element of the federal government 's environmental and energy policies , " trittin said in a statement .
" i assume that utility companies will get used to it . "
according to the environment ministry , the proportion of renewable energy in electric power consumption has jumped from 4.6 percent in 1998 to around 9 percent currently .
one-third of wind energy worldwide is produced in germany with its 14,000 wind turbines .
" the economy , the labor force and the environment can profit from a strong expansion in renewable energies , " trittin said .
berlin 's pet project according to a recent study by shell , renewable energies will contribute at least 50 percent of the worldwide energy use by 2050 .
germany - together with japan , denmark and the united states - belongs to the world leaders in expanding its renewable energies market .

european and american defense ministers will attempt to fashion a “ new ” nato on thursday and friday , as the transatlantic alliance tries to keep its relevance in the face of changing security threats . nato officials in brussels are expected to discuss taking over peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and supporting poland 's efforts in iraq , but at the top of the agenda for the two-day meeting will be streamlining nato 's unwieldy command structure , which has remained largely unchanged since the cold war . " this is a new nato , a nato able to meet its commitments when times get tough , " nato secretary-general george robertson said as the ministers started their deliberations . at a summit in prague last november , nato leaders agreed the structure needed to be reformed in response to the collapse of communism and the defense alliance ’ s expansion to include former enemies in eastern europe .
but disagreement over the closure of some regional bases could yet scupper any agreement . spain and greece have fought efforts to revamp nato because they stand to lose alliance facilities and the jobs and prestige that come with them .
both countries oppose proposals to reduce the number of major nato installations to three joint regional headquarters and six smaller commands .
the plan would close a number of nato facilities , including a greek one in larissa and a spanish airbase in madrid . despite the rancor over the possible closures , most observers expect agreement over the new command structure after some intense political horse trading .
nato officials are also expected to discuss the progress of creating a rapid reaction force that could be available for missions worldwide . rapid reaction force by 2004 at the latest , nato hopes to have a flexible 20,000-troop force that could be readied for deployment anywhere in the world within 30 days .
a smaller amount of highly mobile soldiers are supposed to be ready for action within five days after received marching orders .
nato officials want the new force to be able to respond to a number of challenges , including global terrorism , peacekeeping and more serious military engagements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck " there are n't conventional wars anymore - instead we have to deal with terrorist threats , " said german defense minsiter peter struck on thursday . nato has been under considerable pressure to reinvent itself after the collapse of the soviet union , its traditional foe .
the terrorist attacks in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 , also encouraged the alliance to rethink its role .
one of the biggest changes in its 54-year history is its new willingness to take up missions beyond the borders of the 19 member countries . bridge building the alliance is taking the first steps in that direction by agreeing to take over command of the peacekeeping operations in afghanistan this summer and to help poland manage a zone of military control in postwar iraq . after an ugly internal split over the u.s.-led war in iraq , nato also hopes reinventing itself will heighten its relevance in international security matters as the european union discusses beefing up its own future military capabilities .

european and american defense ministers will attempt to fashion a “ new ” nato on thursday and friday , as the transatlantic alliance tries to keep its relevance in the face of changing security threats . nato officials in brussels are expected to discuss taking over peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and supporting poland 's efforts in iraq , but at the top of the agenda for the two-day meeting will be streamlining nato 's unwieldy command structure , which has remained largely unchanged since the cold war . " this is a new nato , a nato able to meet its commitments when times get tough , " nato secretary-general george robertson said as the ministers started their deliberations . at a summit in prague last november , nato leaders agreed the structure needed to be reformed in response to the collapse of communism and the defense alliance ’ s expansion to include former enemies in eastern europe .
but disagreement over the closure of some regional bases could yet scupper any agreement . spain and greece have fought efforts to revamp nato because they stand to lose alliance facilities and the jobs and prestige that come with them .
both countries oppose proposals to reduce the number of major nato installations to three joint regional headquarters and six smaller commands .

burning cds offline : a german firm has pioneered new technology it hopes will put music retailers - those old school brick-and-mortar shops - back in the game . a german firm based in lübeck , imhg , has developed new technology for use in music retail stores that allows customers to burn their own cd 's .
a pilot shop employing the technology just opened in lübeck , and more retail venues are expected to adopt the concept by the end of the year . the music industry , music labels and retail stores alike have been battling a common foe : the rise of online file-swapping sites .
services like kazaa allow music devotees to download their favorite songs for free and often illegally - all from the comfort of their own home . industry-wide profits have fallen by 10 percent and major labels are running scared .
" the music industry is in a crisis , " says a spokewoman for universal , sophie greiner .
" partly because many people are downloading their music from the internet . " fighting back music labels have since fought back , taking the most notorious of the online swapping sights , napster , to court and shutting it down .
-lrb- napster was based on a central registry of available files on its servers that connected users with other users with copies of the music they wanted to download .
other services like morpheus , which employ decentralized technology allowing users to track down and download music from other computers , have thus far escaped prosecution and persist to this day . -rrb-
the labels have attempted to start their own online services , offering music downloads for a fee . but music retailers were left out in the cold , watching many of their customers turn to online music venues , both file-sharing and those offered by labels , rather than visiting brick-and-mortar shops .
" as a retailer , you have to take some action when the record companies themselves start to sell music over the internet - otherwise you 'll get lost in the shuffle , " says oliver salzmann , founder of imhg , the lübeck-based company which invented the new technology . salzmann speaks from experience - his family also owns a large department store , pressezentrum , in lübeck , which specializes in music and technology products .
after watching the profits in his own music department fall , salzmann and his father martin felt they had to do something . browsing with a pda the salzmann 's developed a new retail concept , which allows customers to browse the store 's musical selections using an adapted personal digital assistant -lrb- pda -rrb- , or handheld computer to the less technologically inclined .
by running a scanner over the cds , they can download thirty second samplers from an inventory of up to 20,000 songs , select up to 15 titles at a cost of 99 cents each and proceed to the check-out , where their selections will be burned onto a cd .
the cd and jewel case cost an additional € 2 . a pilot store employing the service was launched last week at the salzmann 's store in lübeck .
but by the end of the year they hope to license their creation to other large department stores and say they are already in talks with several major german retailers .
a smaller version of the technology may even be installed in other locations , like at gas stations . unlike the dubious legality of online music sharing sites , this service is entirely legitimate .
imhg has contracts with three large labels - sony , universal and edel - and hopes to line up more by the end of the year .
the business model is simple : the retailers and record labels split the profits , fifty-fifty , of each song downloaded , while imhg makes its money from licensing its technology and technical support . but given the wide-spread popularity of internet music sites , will this approach be enough to bring customers back into the store ?
salzmann thinks the service will appeal to the less technologically inclined and to those who appreciate the assistance offered at a traditional music store . " many do n't want to deal with the logistics of going online and burning their own cd , " says salzmann .
" what 's more , we offer a very professional looking product . " changing the way we buy music imhg 's technology is the latest innovation in an industry that is struggling to change the way we buy music .
" the rise of online file-sharing sites showed us that customers want to search for individual songs and put them in a particular order , " says greiner .
the music industry has since been scrambling to meet the demand , but recent ventures show there are profits for those who try . apple recently launched its own legal online music library by striking similar agreements with record labels , offering apple users -lrb- thus far only within the united states -rrb- the opportunity to download songs for 99 cents .
the venture exceeded all expectations , with more than 2 million songs purchased and downloaded within the first 16 days .
as imhg branches out across germany and eventually worldwide , salzmann is hoping for similar success . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de technology stalks hollywood new online technology threatens the film industry 's status quo for copyrights and distribution .

burning cds offline : a german firm has pioneered new technology it hopes will put music retailers - those old school brick-and-mortar shops - back in the game . a german firm based in lübeck , imhg , has developed new technology for use in music retail stores that allows customers to burn their own cd 's .
a pilot shop employing the technology just opened in lübeck , and more retail venues are expected to adopt the concept by the end of the year . the music industry , music labels and retail stores alike have been battling a common foe : the rise of online file-swapping sites .
services like kazaa allow music devotees to download their favorite songs for free and often illegally - all from the comfort of their own home . industry-wide profits have fallen by 10 percent and major labels are running scared .
" the music industry is in a crisis , " says a spokewoman for universal , sophie greiner .
" partly because many people are downloading their music from the internet . " fighting back music labels have since fought back , taking the most notorious of the online swapping sights , napster , to court and shutting it down .
-lrb- napster was based on a central registry of available files on its servers that connected users with other users with copies of the music they wanted to download .
other services like morpheus , which employ decentralized technology allowing users to track down and download music from other computers , have thus far escaped prosecution and persist to this day . -rrb-
the labels have attempted to start their own online services , offering music downloads for a fee . but music retailers were left out in the cold , watching many of their customers turn to online music venues , both file-sharing and those offered by labels , rather than visiting brick-and-mortar shops .
" as a retailer , you have to take some action when the record companies themselves start to sell music over the internet - otherwise you 'll get lost in the shuffle , " says oliver salzmann , founder of imhg , the lübeck-based company which invented the new technology . salzmann speaks from experience - his family also owns a large department store , pressezentrum , in lübeck , which specializes in music and technology products .
after watching the profits in his own music department fall , salzmann and his father martin felt they had to do something . browsing with a pda the salzmann 's developed a new retail concept , which allows customers to browse the store 's musical selections using an adapted personal digital assistant -lrb- pda -rrb- , or handheld computer to the less technologically inclined .

the man is also suspected of involvement in a deadly bombing in tunisia . christian ganczarski , a 36-year-old german citizen of polish descent , was arrested on june 2 at paris ’ charles de gaulle airport .

the german soccer team was spared from what could have been an embarrassing draw with the mostly amateur faroe islanders .
but in the last minutes of the european championship qualifier germany pulled out a 2-0 victory . it came down to the final seconds .
would powerhouse germany be spared an embarrassing draw with the modest faroe islands team ?
the three-time world champions needed a win in wednesday night ’ s 2004 european championship qualifier match in the north atlantic to hold on to their top seat in group five .
but the goals remained elusive until the 89th minute when substitute striker miroslav klose pulled his team into the lead with one minute left on the clock .
then striker fredi bobic doubled the advantage two minutes into extended time , saving the german team from humiliation .
a close call on paper though , it should have been an easy win .
germany was given 8-1 and 10-2 odds against the faroe islands team , a group of amateur players which has yet to make it beyond qualifier matches .
but the faroese gave it their all , and with the home-team advantage and a jam-packed torshavn stadium , the germans struggled to overcome the islanders defense .
wednesday ’ s match was not the first time germany ’ s supposedly strong national team failed to dominate a supposedly lesser opponent . after the disappointing 1-1 draw with scotland last saturday , german team coach rudi völler was just relieved to come out a winner .

playing with heart " we played with our hearts and showed the world , that we can keep up with the best , " the faroe coach henrik larsen said .
" unfortunately we lost in the last minute .
but i am very pleased with my team . "
that ’ s something german fans can ’ t say for their team .
the near-draw with the soccer minnows coupled with the draw against scotland is almost too much for a nation expected to always be a soccer powerhouse .

the german soccer team was spared from what could have been an embarrassing draw with the mostly amateur faroe islanders .
but in the last minutes of the european championship qualifier germany pulled out a 2-0 victory . it came down to the final seconds .
would powerhouse germany be spared an embarrassing draw with the modest faroe islands team ?
the three-time world champions needed a win in wednesday night ’ s 2004 european championship qualifier match in the north atlantic to hold on to their top seat in group five .
but the goals remained elusive until the 89th minute when substitute striker miroslav klose pulled his team into the lead with one minute left on the clock .
then striker fredi bobic doubled the advantage two minutes into extended time , saving the german team from humiliation .
a close call on paper though , it should have been an easy win .
germany was given 8-1 and 10-2 odds against the faroe islands team , a group of amateur players which has yet to make it beyond qualifier matches .
but the faroese gave it their all , and with the home-team advantage and a jam-packed torshavn stadium , the germans struggled to overcome the islanders defense .
wednesday ’ s match was not the first time germany ’ s supposedly strong national team failed to dominate a supposedly lesser opponent . after the disappointing 1-1 draw with scotland last saturday , german team coach rudi völler was just relieved to come out a winner .
a sigh of relief " i am very happy .
the match was as problematic as i expected , " völler told reporters after the game .
" we could not score , but i knew it was just a question of time . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi völler völler added that he couldn ’ t reproach his players : " it ’ s hard to shine against opponents who concentrate on defending . "
the german coach praised the faroese goalie jakup mikkelsen for effectively thwarting the opponent ’ s goal attempts : " the way he played , he could play in the bundesliga or in any league in the world . "
playing with heart " we played with our hearts and showed the world , that we can keep up with the best , " the faroe coach henrik larsen said .
" unfortunately we lost in the last minute .
but i am very pleased with my team . "
that ’ s something german fans can ’ t say for their team .
the near-draw with the soccer minnows coupled with the draw against scotland is almost too much for a nation expected to always be a soccer powerhouse .
the top-selling daily bild newspaper on thursday called the team ’ s performance " shameful " and referred to the 2-0 victory as germany ’ s " luckiest win ever . "
franz beckenbauer , former world cup winning coach and player , expressed his doubts about the team after watching them scrape by .
" we are back to where we were before the world cup , " he said reminding viewers of germany ’ s struggle to qualify for last year ’ s final .
völler , for his part , was cautiously optimistic .
" we are in a good position now but we haven ’ t won the qualification -lrb- group -rrb- yet .
if we are to win , we have to play better than we have so far , " he said looking ahead at the match against iceland . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reticent germans face possible curse of the faroes everyone expected the germans to beat scotland on saturday but the resulting draw in the european championship qualifiers adds an ominous feeling to their next match against the tiny faroe islands -lrb- june 11 , 2003 -rrb- .

burning cds offline : a german firm has pioneered new technology it hopes will put music retailers - those old school brick-and-mortar shops - back in the game . a german firm based in lübeck , imhg , has developed new technology for use in music retail stores that allows customers to burn their own cd 's .
a pilot shop employing the technology just opened in lübeck , and more retail venues are expected to adopt the concept by the end of the year . the music industry , music labels and retail stores alike have been battling a common foe : the rise of online file-swapping sites .
services like kazaa allow music devotees to download their favorite songs for free and often illegally - all from the comfort of their own home . industry-wide profits have fallen by 10 percent and major labels are running scared .
" the music industry is in a crisis , " says a spokewoman for universal , sophie greiner .
" partly because many people are downloading their music from the internet . " fighting back music labels have since fought back , taking the most notorious of the online swapping sights , napster , to court and shutting it down .
-lrb- napster was based on a central registry of available files on its servers that connected users with other users with copies of the music they wanted to download .
other services like morpheus , which employ decentralized technology allowing users to track down and download music from other computers , have thus far escaped prosecution and persist to this day . -rrb-
the labels have attempted to start their own online services , offering music downloads for a fee . but music retailers were left out in the cold , watching many of their customers turn to online music venues , both file-sharing and those offered by labels , rather than visiting brick-and-mortar shops .
" as a retailer , you have to take some action when the record companies themselves start to sell music over the internet - otherwise you 'll get lost in the shuffle , " says oliver salzmann , founder of imhg , the lübeck-based company which invented the new technology . salzmann speaks from experience - his family also owns a large department store , pressezentrum , in lübeck , which specializes in music and technology products .
after watching the profits in his own music department fall , salzmann and his father martin felt they had to do something . browsing with a pda the salzmann 's developed a new retail concept , which allows customers to browse the store 's musical selections using an adapted personal digital assistant -lrb- pda -rrb- , or handheld computer to the less technologically inclined .
by running a scanner over the cds , they can download thirty second samplers from an inventory of up to 20,000 songs , select up to 15 titles at a cost of 99 cents each and proceed to the check-out , where their selections will be burned onto a cd .
the cd and jewel case cost an additional € 2 . a pilot store employing the service was launched last week at the salzmann 's store in lübeck .
but by the end of the year they hope to license their creation to other large department stores and say they are already in talks with several major german retailers .
a smaller version of the technology may even be installed in other locations , like at gas stations . unlike the dubious legality of online music sharing sites , this service is entirely legitimate .
imhg has contracts with three large labels - sony , universal and edel - and hopes to line up more by the end of the year .
the business model is simple : the retailers and record labels split the profits , fifty-fifty , of each song downloaded , while imhg makes its money from licensing its technology and technical support . but given the wide-spread popularity of internet music sites , will this approach be enough to bring customers back into the store ?
salzmann thinks the service will appeal to the less technologically inclined and to those who appreciate the assistance offered at a traditional music store . " many do n't want to deal with the logistics of going online and burning their own cd , " says salzmann .
" what 's more , we offer a very professional looking product . " changing the way we buy music imhg 's technology is the latest innovation in an industry that is struggling to change the way we buy music .
" the rise of online file-sharing sites showed us that customers want to search for individual songs and put them in a particular order , " says greiner .
the music industry has since been scrambling to meet the demand , but recent ventures show there are profits for those who try . apple recently launched its own legal online music library by striking similar agreements with record labels , offering apple users -lrb- thus far only within the united states -rrb- the opportunity to download songs for 99 cents .
the venture exceeded all expectations , with more than 2 million songs purchased and downloaded within the first 16 days .

a smaller version of the technology may even be installed in other locations , like at gas stations . unlike the dubious legality of online music sharing sites , this service is entirely legitimate .
imhg has contracts with three large labels - sony , universal and edel - and hopes to line up more by the end of the year .
the business model is simple : the retailers and record labels split the profits , fifty-fifty , of each song downloaded , while imhg makes its money from licensing its technology and technical support . but given the wide-spread popularity of internet music sites , will this approach be enough to bring customers back into the store ?
salzmann thinks the service will appeal to the less technologically inclined and to those who appreciate the assistance offered at a traditional music store . " many do n't want to deal with the logistics of going online and burning their own cd , " says salzmann .
" what 's more , we offer a very professional looking product . " changing the way we buy music imhg 's technology is the latest innovation in an industry that is struggling to change the way we buy music .
" the rise of online file-sharing sites showed us that customers want to search for individual songs and put them in a particular order , " says greiner .
the music industry has since been scrambling to meet the demand , but recent ventures show there are profits for those who try . apple recently launched its own legal online music library by striking similar agreements with record labels , offering apple users -lrb- thus far only within the united states -rrb- the opportunity to download songs for 99 cents .
the venture exceeded all expectations , with more than 2 million songs purchased and downloaded within the first 16 days .
as imhg branches out across germany and eventually worldwide , salzmann is hoping for similar success . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de technology stalks hollywood new online technology threatens the film industry 's status quo for copyrights and distribution .

a ruling by germany 's federal court of justice is forcing utility companies to buy renewable energy , even though it costs over ten times more than conventionally-produced power . germany 's federal court of justice in karlsruhe has ruled that the country 's renewable energies law eeg does not violate any constitutional rights .
the legislation guarantees wind turbine operators and solar energy producers much higher market prices for their ecological power .
the ruling came about after the regional electricity company schleswag in northern germany took its case to court .
it had refused to comply with the law , claiming that it violated its entrepreneurial freedom .
the company did not want to be forced to feed in power generated by several wind turbine operators in the region .
the minimum price requirements also posed an illegal subsidy , schleswag said .
the eeg stipulates that german utility companies pay a minimum of € 0.48 -lrb- $ 0.56 -rrb- per kilowatt hour to purchase energy generated by wind power , compared to € 0.03 to € 0.05 for conventionally produced electricity .
the judges in karlsruhe said in their ruling that despite the liberalization of the german energy market , utility companies still carried a particular responsibility to environmentally-friendly energy production .
the european court of justice in luxembourg already in 2001 ruled that the eeg did not represent indirect government subsidizing .
the world leader in wind energy federal environment minister jürgen trittin welcomed the court 's decision on wednesday .
he said he expected the major power providers to give up their resistance to renewable energies .

" i assume that utility companies will get used to it . "
according to the environment ministry , the proportion of renewable energy in electric power consumption has jumped from 4.6 percent in 1998 to around 9 percent currently .
one-third of wind energy worldwide is produced in germany with its 14,000 wind turbines .
" the economy , the labor force and the environment can profit from a strong expansion in renewable energies , " trittin said .
berlin 's pet project according to a recent study by shell , renewable energies will contribute at least 50 percent of the worldwide energy use by 2050 .
germany - together with japan , denmark and the united states - belongs to the world leaders in expanding its renewable energies market .
this sector has been a pet project of trittin 's , who is a member of the environmentally-friendly greens party .
since the coalition government of social democrats and greens took power in 1998 , state-aided programs sparked a boom in wind and solar energy units .
wind turbines in particular began popping up everywhere .
many operators went public and collected hundreds of millions of euros for their expansion plans on the stock market .
but the gold rush seems to be coming to an end , as this sector is simply running out of space .
although there are new projects for wind turbine parks planned off the north sea coast , the financing is still not settled .
the solar boom is also waning .
last year , only about 65,000 new solar energy units were set up , half as many as in 2001 .
germany - with its over 16 million square feet of solar panels - is the number two in the photo-voltaic sector after japan .

a ruling by germany 's federal court of justice is forcing utility companies to buy renewable energy , even though it costs over ten times more than conventionally-produced power . germany 's federal court of justice in karlsruhe has ruled that the country 's renewable energies law eeg does not violate any constitutional rights .
the legislation guarantees wind turbine operators and solar energy producers much higher market prices for their ecological power .
the ruling came about after the regional electricity company schleswag in northern germany took its case to court .
it had refused to comply with the law , claiming that it violated its entrepreneurial freedom .
the company did not want to be forced to feed in power generated by several wind turbine operators in the region .
the minimum price requirements also posed an illegal subsidy , schleswag said .
the eeg stipulates that german utility companies pay a minimum of € 0.48 -lrb- $ 0.56 -rrb- per kilowatt hour to purchase energy generated by wind power , compared to € 0.03 to € 0.05 for conventionally produced electricity .
the judges in karlsruhe said in their ruling that despite the liberalization of the german energy market , utility companies still carried a particular responsibility to environmentally-friendly energy production .
the european court of justice in luxembourg already in 2001 ruled that the eeg did not represent indirect government subsidizing .
the world leader in wind energy federal environment minister jürgen trittin welcomed the court 's decision on wednesday .
he said he expected the major power providers to give up their resistance to renewable energies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin " renewable energies are a central element of the federal government 's environmental and energy policies , " trittin said in a statement .
" i assume that utility companies will get used to it . "
according to the environment ministry , the proportion of renewable energy in electric power consumption has jumped from 4.6 percent in 1998 to around 9 percent currently .
one-third of wind energy worldwide is produced in germany with its 14,000 wind turbines .
" the economy , the labor force and the environment can profit from a strong expansion in renewable energies , " trittin said .
berlin 's pet project according to a recent study by shell , renewable energies will contribute at least 50 percent of the worldwide energy use by 2050 .
germany - together with japan , denmark and the united states - belongs to the world leaders in expanding its renewable energies market .
this sector has been a pet project of trittin 's , who is a member of the environmentally-friendly greens party .
since the coalition government of social democrats and greens took power in 1998 , state-aided programs sparked a boom in wind and solar energy units .
wind turbines in particular began popping up everywhere .
many operators went public and collected hundreds of millions of euros for their expansion plans on the stock market .
but the gold rush seems to be coming to an end , as this sector is simply running out of space .
although there are new projects for wind turbine parks planned off the north sea coast , the financing is still not settled .
the solar boom is also waning .
last year , only about 65,000 new solar energy units were set up , half as many as in 2001 .

european and american defense ministers will attempt to fashion a “ new ” nato on thursday and friday , as the transatlantic alliance tries to keep its relevance in the face of changing security threats . nato officials in brussels are expected to discuss taking over peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and supporting poland 's efforts in iraq , but at the top of the agenda for the two-day meeting will be streamlining nato 's unwieldy command structure , which has remained largely unchanged since the cold war . " this is a new nato , a nato able to meet its commitments when times get tough , " nato secretary-general george robertson said as the ministers started their deliberations . at a summit in prague last november , nato leaders agreed the structure needed to be reformed in response to the collapse of communism and the defense alliance ’ s expansion to include former enemies in eastern europe .
but disagreement over the closure of some regional bases could yet scupper any agreement . spain and greece have fought efforts to revamp nato because they stand to lose alliance facilities and the jobs and prestige that come with them .
both countries oppose proposals to reduce the number of major nato installations to three joint regional headquarters and six smaller commands .
the plan would close a number of nato facilities , including a greek one in larissa and a spanish airbase in madrid . despite the rancor over the possible closures , most observers expect agreement over the new command structure after some intense political horse trading .
nato officials are also expected to discuss the progress of creating a rapid reaction force that could be available for missions worldwide . rapid reaction force by 2004 at the latest , nato hopes to have a flexible 20,000-troop force that could be readied for deployment anywhere in the world within 30 days .
a smaller amount of highly mobile soldiers are supposed to be ready for action within five days after received marching orders .
nato officials want the new force to be able to respond to a number of challenges , including global terrorism , peacekeeping and more serious military engagements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck " there are n't conventional wars anymore - instead we have to deal with terrorist threats , " said german defense minsiter peter struck on thursday . nato has been under considerable pressure to reinvent itself after the collapse of the soviet union , its traditional foe .

the german soccer team was spared from what could have been an embarrassing draw with the mostly amateur faroe islanders .
but in the last minutes of the european championship qualifier germany pulled out a 2-0 victory . it came down to the final seconds .
would powerhouse germany be spared an embarrassing draw with the modest faroe islands team ?
the three-time world champions needed a win in wednesday night ’ s 2004 european championship qualifier match in the north atlantic to hold on to their top seat in group five .
but the goals remained elusive until the 89th minute when substitute striker miroslav klose pulled his team into the lead with one minute left on the clock .
then striker fredi bobic doubled the advantage two minutes into extended time , saving the german team from humiliation .
a close call on paper though , it should have been an easy win .
germany was given 8-1 and 10-2 odds against the faroe islands team , a group of amateur players which has yet to make it beyond qualifier matches .
but the faroese gave it their all , and with the home-team advantage and a jam-packed torshavn stadium , the germans struggled to overcome the islanders defense .
wednesday ’ s match was not the first time germany ’ s supposedly strong national team failed to dominate a supposedly lesser opponent . after the disappointing 1-1 draw with scotland last saturday , german team coach rudi völler was just relieved to come out a winner .
a sigh of relief " i am very happy .
the match was as problematic as i expected , " völler told reporters after the game .
" we could not score , but i knew it was just a question of time . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi völler völler added that he couldn ’ t reproach his players : " it ’ s hard to shine against opponents who concentrate on defending . "
the german coach praised the faroese goalie jakup mikkelsen for effectively thwarting the opponent ’ s goal attempts : " the way he played , he could play in the bundesliga or in any league in the world . "
playing with heart " we played with our hearts and showed the world , that we can keep up with the best , " the faroe coach henrik larsen said .
" unfortunately we lost in the last minute .
but i am very pleased with my team . "
that ’ s something german fans can ’ t say for their team .
the near-draw with the soccer minnows coupled with the draw against scotland is almost too much for a nation expected to always be a soccer powerhouse .
the top-selling daily bild newspaper on thursday called the team ’ s performance " shameful " and referred to the 2-0 victory as germany ’ s " luckiest win ever . "
franz beckenbauer , former world cup winning coach and player , expressed his doubts about the team after watching them scrape by .
" we are back to where we were before the world cup , " he said reminding viewers of germany ’ s struggle to qualify for last year ’ s final .

would powerhouse germany be spared an embarrassing draw with the modest faroe islands team ?
the three-time world champions needed a win in wednesday night ’ s 2004 european championship qualifier match in the north atlantic to hold on to their top seat in group five .
but the goals remained elusive until the 89th minute when substitute striker miroslav klose pulled his team into the lead with one minute left on the clock .
then striker fredi bobic doubled the advantage two minutes into extended time , saving the german team from humiliation .
a close call on paper though , it should have been an easy win .
germany was given 8-1 and 10-2 odds against the faroe islands team , a group of amateur players which has yet to make it beyond qualifier matches .
but the faroese gave it their all , and with the home-team advantage and a jam-packed torshavn stadium , the germans struggled to overcome the islanders defense .
wednesday ’ s match was not the first time germany ’ s supposedly strong national team failed to dominate a supposedly lesser opponent . after the disappointing 1-1 draw with scotland last saturday , german team coach rudi völler was just relieved to come out a winner .
a sigh of relief " i am very happy .

playing with heart " we played with our hearts and showed the world , that we can keep up with the best , " the faroe coach henrik larsen said .
" unfortunately we lost in the last minute .
but i am very pleased with my team . "
that ’ s something german fans can ’ t say for their team .
the near-draw with the soccer minnows coupled with the draw against scotland is almost too much for a nation expected to always be a soccer powerhouse .
the top-selling daily bild newspaper on thursday called the team ’ s performance " shameful " and referred to the 2-0 victory as germany ’ s " luckiest win ever . "
franz beckenbauer , former world cup winning coach and player , expressed his doubts about the team after watching them scrape by .
" we are back to where we were before the world cup , " he said reminding viewers of germany ’ s struggle to qualify for last year ’ s final .
völler , for his part , was cautiously optimistic .
" we are in a good position now but we haven ’ t won the qualification -lrb- group -rrb- yet .

european and american defense ministers will attempt to fashion a “ new ” nato on thursday and friday , as the transatlantic alliance tries to keep its relevance in the face of changing security threats . nato officials in brussels are expected to discuss taking over peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and supporting poland 's efforts in iraq , but at the top of the agenda for the two-day meeting will be streamlining nato 's unwieldy command structure , which has remained largely unchanged since the cold war . " this is a new nato , a nato able to meet its commitments when times get tough , " nato secretary-general george robertson said as the ministers started their deliberations . at a summit in prague last november , nato leaders agreed the structure needed to be reformed in response to the collapse of communism and the defense alliance ’ s expansion to include former enemies in eastern europe .
but disagreement over the closure of some regional bases could yet scupper any agreement . spain and greece have fought efforts to revamp nato because they stand to lose alliance facilities and the jobs and prestige that come with them .
both countries oppose proposals to reduce the number of major nato installations to three joint regional headquarters and six smaller commands .
the plan would close a number of nato facilities , including a greek one in larissa and a spanish airbase in madrid . despite the rancor over the possible closures , most observers expect agreement over the new command structure after some intense political horse trading .
nato officials are also expected to discuss the progress of creating a rapid reaction force that could be available for missions worldwide . rapid reaction force by 2004 at the latest , nato hopes to have a flexible 20,000-troop force that could be readied for deployment anywhere in the world within 30 days .
a smaller amount of highly mobile soldiers are supposed to be ready for action within five days after received marching orders .
nato officials want the new force to be able to respond to a number of challenges , including global terrorism , peacekeeping and more serious military engagements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck " there are n't conventional wars anymore - instead we have to deal with terrorist threats , " said german defense minsiter peter struck on thursday . nato has been under considerable pressure to reinvent itself after the collapse of the soviet union , its traditional foe .

the german soccer team was spared from what could have been an embarrassing draw with the mostly amateur faroe islanders .
but in the last minutes of the european championship qualifier germany pulled out a 2-0 victory . it came down to the final seconds .
would powerhouse germany be spared an embarrassing draw with the modest faroe islands team ?
the three-time world champions needed a win in wednesday night ’ s 2004 european championship qualifier match in the north atlantic to hold on to their top seat in group five .
but the goals remained elusive until the 89th minute when substitute striker miroslav klose pulled his team into the lead with one minute left on the clock .
then striker fredi bobic doubled the advantage two minutes into extended time , saving the german team from humiliation .
a close call on paper though , it should have been an easy win .
germany was given 8-1 and 10-2 odds against the faroe islands team , a group of amateur players which has yet to make it beyond qualifier matches .
but the faroese gave it their all , and with the home-team advantage and a jam-packed torshavn stadium , the germans struggled to overcome the islanders defense .
wednesday ’ s match was not the first time germany ’ s supposedly strong national team failed to dominate a supposedly lesser opponent . after the disappointing 1-1 draw with scotland last saturday , german team coach rudi völler was just relieved to come out a winner .
a sigh of relief " i am very happy .
the match was as problematic as i expected , " völler told reporters after the game .
" we could not score , but i knew it was just a question of time . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi völler völler added that he couldn ’ t reproach his players : " it ’ s hard to shine against opponents who concentrate on defending . "
the german coach praised the faroese goalie jakup mikkelsen for effectively thwarting the opponent ’ s goal attempts : " the way he played , he could play in the bundesliga or in any league in the world . "
playing with heart " we played with our hearts and showed the world , that we can keep up with the best , " the faroe coach henrik larsen said .
" unfortunately we lost in the last minute .
but i am very pleased with my team . "
that ’ s something german fans can ’ t say for their team .
the near-draw with the soccer minnows coupled with the draw against scotland is almost too much for a nation expected to always be a soccer powerhouse .
the top-selling daily bild newspaper on thursday called the team ’ s performance " shameful " and referred to the 2-0 victory as germany ’ s " luckiest win ever . "
franz beckenbauer , former world cup winning coach and player , expressed his doubts about the team after watching them scrape by .
" we are back to where we were before the world cup , " he said reminding viewers of germany ’ s struggle to qualify for last year ’ s final .
völler , for his part , was cautiously optimistic .
" we are in a good position now but we haven ’ t won the qualification -lrb- group -rrb- yet .
if we are to win , we have to play better than we have so far , " he said looking ahead at the match against iceland . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reticent germans face possible curse of the faroes everyone expected the germans to beat scotland on saturday but the resulting draw in the european championship qualifiers adds an ominous feeling to their next match against the tiny faroe islands -lrb- june 11 , 2003 -rrb- .

a ruling by germany 's federal court of justice is forcing utility companies to buy renewable energy , even though it costs over ten times more than conventionally-produced power . germany 's federal court of justice in karlsruhe has ruled that the country 's renewable energies law eeg does not violate any constitutional rights .
the legislation guarantees wind turbine operators and solar energy producers much higher market prices for their ecological power .
the ruling came about after the regional electricity company schleswag in northern germany took its case to court .
it had refused to comply with the law , claiming that it violated its entrepreneurial freedom .
the company did not want to be forced to feed in power generated by several wind turbine operators in the region .
the minimum price requirements also posed an illegal subsidy , schleswag said .
the eeg stipulates that german utility companies pay a minimum of € 0.48 -lrb- $ 0.56 -rrb- per kilowatt hour to purchase energy generated by wind power , compared to € 0.03 to € 0.05 for conventionally produced electricity .
the judges in karlsruhe said in their ruling that despite the liberalization of the german energy market , utility companies still carried a particular responsibility to environmentally-friendly energy production .
the european court of justice in luxembourg already in 2001 ruled that the eeg did not represent indirect government subsidizing .
the world leader in wind energy federal environment minister jürgen trittin welcomed the court 's decision on wednesday .
he said he expected the major power providers to give up their resistance to renewable energies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin " renewable energies are a central element of the federal government 's environmental and energy policies , " trittin said in a statement .
" i assume that utility companies will get used to it . "
according to the environment ministry , the proportion of renewable energy in electric power consumption has jumped from 4.6 percent in 1998 to around 9 percent currently .
one-third of wind energy worldwide is produced in germany with its 14,000 wind turbines .
" the economy , the labor force and the environment can profit from a strong expansion in renewable energies , " trittin said .
berlin 's pet project according to a recent study by shell , renewable energies will contribute at least 50 percent of the worldwide energy use by 2050 .
germany - together with japan , denmark and the united states - belongs to the world leaders in expanding its renewable energies market .
this sector has been a pet project of trittin 's , who is a member of the environmentally-friendly greens party .
since the coalition government of social democrats and greens took power in 1998 , state-aided programs sparked a boom in wind and solar energy units .
wind turbines in particular began popping up everywhere .
many operators went public and collected hundreds of millions of euros for their expansion plans on the stock market .
but the gold rush seems to be coming to an end , as this sector is simply running out of space .
although there are new projects for wind turbine parks planned off the north sea coast , the financing is still not settled .
the solar boom is also waning .
last year , only about 65,000 new solar energy units were set up , half as many as in 2001 .
germany - with its over 16 million square feet of solar panels - is the number two in the photo-voltaic sector after japan .

burning cds offline : a german firm has pioneered new technology it hopes will put music retailers - those old school brick-and-mortar shops - back in the game . a german firm based in lübeck , imhg , has developed new technology for use in music retail stores that allows customers to burn their own cd 's .
a pilot shop employing the technology just opened in lübeck , and more retail venues are expected to adopt the concept by the end of the year . the music industry , music labels and retail stores alike have been battling a common foe : the rise of online file-swapping sites .
services like kazaa allow music devotees to download their favorite songs for free and often illegally - all from the comfort of their own home . industry-wide profits have fallen by 10 percent and major labels are running scared .
" the music industry is in a crisis , " says a spokewoman for universal , sophie greiner .
" partly because many people are downloading their music from the internet . " fighting back music labels have since fought back , taking the most notorious of the online swapping sights , napster , to court and shutting it down .
-lrb- napster was based on a central registry of available files on its servers that connected users with other users with copies of the music they wanted to download .
other services like morpheus , which employ decentralized technology allowing users to track down and download music from other computers , have thus far escaped prosecution and persist to this day . -rrb-
the labels have attempted to start their own online services , offering music downloads for a fee . but music retailers were left out in the cold , watching many of their customers turn to online music venues , both file-sharing and those offered by labels , rather than visiting brick-and-mortar shops .
" as a retailer , you have to take some action when the record companies themselves start to sell music over the internet - otherwise you 'll get lost in the shuffle , " says oliver salzmann , founder of imhg , the lübeck-based company which invented the new technology . salzmann speaks from experience - his family also owns a large department store , pressezentrum , in lübeck , which specializes in music and technology products .
after watching the profits in his own music department fall , salzmann and his father martin felt they had to do something . browsing with a pda the salzmann 's developed a new retail concept , which allows customers to browse the store 's musical selections using an adapted personal digital assistant -lrb- pda -rrb- , or handheld computer to the less technologically inclined .
by running a scanner over the cds , they can download thirty second samplers from an inventory of up to 20,000 songs , select up to 15 titles at a cost of 99 cents each and proceed to the check-out , where their selections will be burned onto a cd .
the cd and jewel case cost an additional € 2 . a pilot store employing the service was launched last week at the salzmann 's store in lübeck .
but by the end of the year they hope to license their creation to other large department stores and say they are already in talks with several major german retailers .
a smaller version of the technology may even be installed in other locations , like at gas stations . unlike the dubious legality of online music sharing sites , this service is entirely legitimate .
imhg has contracts with three large labels - sony , universal and edel - and hopes to line up more by the end of the year .
the business model is simple : the retailers and record labels split the profits , fifty-fifty , of each song downloaded , while imhg makes its money from licensing its technology and technical support . but given the wide-spread popularity of internet music sites , will this approach be enough to bring customers back into the store ?
salzmann thinks the service will appeal to the less technologically inclined and to those who appreciate the assistance offered at a traditional music store . " many do n't want to deal with the logistics of going online and burning their own cd , " says salzmann .
" what 's more , we offer a very professional looking product . " changing the way we buy music imhg 's technology is the latest innovation in an industry that is struggling to change the way we buy music .
" the rise of online file-sharing sites showed us that customers want to search for individual songs and put them in a particular order , " says greiner .
the music industry has since been scrambling to meet the demand , but recent ventures show there are profits for those who try . apple recently launched its own legal online music library by striking similar agreements with record labels , offering apple users -lrb- thus far only within the united states -rrb- the opportunity to download songs for 99 cents .
the venture exceeded all expectations , with more than 2 million songs purchased and downloaded within the first 16 days .
as imhg branches out across germany and eventually worldwide , salzmann is hoping for similar success . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de technology stalks hollywood new online technology threatens the film industry 's status quo for copyrights and distribution .

french officials on wednesday accused a german citizen of being a leading member of the al qaeda terrorist network with ties to osama bin laden .
the man is also suspected of involvement in a deadly bombing in tunisia . christian ganczarski , a 36-year-old german citizen of polish descent , was arrested on june 2 at paris ’ charles de gaulle airport .

" -lrb- intelligence -rrb- services know that he is a top leader of al qaeda , in contact with osama bin laden himself , and has been in afghanistan and bosnia , " french interior minister nicolas sarkozy told parliament .
" this individual is a specialist in computers and in radio communication services . " but according to the reuters news agency , a judicial source close to the investigation contested the officials ' account - saying french prosecutors had no evidence of any close link between ganczarski and bin laden , founder of al qaeda network .
authorities are now concentrating on ganczarski ’ s possible role in the bombing of a synagogue in djerba , tunisia , last year that killed 21 tourists , including 14 germans . questioned and released german police questioned ganczarski last year about the djerba attack after it was established he had telephoned with one of the suicide bombers shortly before the attack .
he was detained but then later released when no direct involvement in the incident could be found .

a ruling by germany 's federal court of justice is forcing utility companies to buy renewable energy , even though it costs over ten times more than conventionally-produced power . germany 's federal court of justice in karlsruhe has ruled that the country 's renewable energies law eeg does not violate any constitutional rights .
the legislation guarantees wind turbine operators and solar energy producers much higher market prices for their ecological power .
the ruling came about after the regional electricity company schleswag in northern germany took its case to court .
it had refused to comply with the law , claiming that it violated its entrepreneurial freedom .
the company did not want to be forced to feed in power generated by several wind turbine operators in the region .
the minimum price requirements also posed an illegal subsidy , schleswag said .
the eeg stipulates that german utility companies pay a minimum of € 0.48 -lrb- $ 0.56 -rrb- per kilowatt hour to purchase energy generated by wind power , compared to € 0.03 to € 0.05 for conventionally produced electricity .
the judges in karlsruhe said in their ruling that despite the liberalization of the german energy market , utility companies still carried a particular responsibility to environmentally-friendly energy production .
the european court of justice in luxembourg already in 2001 ruled that the eeg did not represent indirect government subsidizing .
the world leader in wind energy federal environment minister jürgen trittin welcomed the court 's decision on wednesday .
he said he expected the major power providers to give up their resistance to renewable energies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin " renewable energies are a central element of the federal government 's environmental and energy policies , " trittin said in a statement .
" i assume that utility companies will get used to it . "
according to the environment ministry , the proportion of renewable energy in electric power consumption has jumped from 4.6 percent in 1998 to around 9 percent currently .
one-third of wind energy worldwide is produced in germany with its 14,000 wind turbines .
" the economy , the labor force and the environment can profit from a strong expansion in renewable energies , " trittin said .
berlin 's pet project according to a recent study by shell , renewable energies will contribute at least 50 percent of the worldwide energy use by 2050 .
germany - together with japan , denmark and the united states - belongs to the world leaders in expanding its renewable energies market .
this sector has been a pet project of trittin 's , who is a member of the environmentally-friendly greens party .
since the coalition government of social democrats and greens took power in 1998 , state-aided programs sparked a boom in wind and solar energy units .
wind turbines in particular began popping up everywhere .
many operators went public and collected hundreds of millions of euros for their expansion plans on the stock market .
but the gold rush seems to be coming to an end , as this sector is simply running out of space .
although there are new projects for wind turbine parks planned off the north sea coast , the financing is still not settled .
the solar boom is also waning .
last year , only about 65,000 new solar energy units were set up , half as many as in 2001 .
germany - with its over 16 million square feet of solar panels - is the number two in the photo-voltaic sector after japan .
but the proportion of solar energy in germany 's power production is still less than one percent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the wind of change blows through germany viable sources of renewable energy have long been the ' holy grail ' of environmentalists across the globe .

french officials on wednesday accused a german citizen of being a leading member of the al qaeda terrorist network with ties to osama bin laden .
the man is also suspected of involvement in a deadly bombing in tunisia . christian ganczarski , a 36-year-old german citizen of polish descent , was arrested on june 2 at paris ’ charles de gaulle airport .

" -lrb- intelligence -rrb- services know that he is a top leader of al qaeda , in contact with osama bin laden himself , and has been in afghanistan and bosnia , " french interior minister nicolas sarkozy told parliament .
" this individual is a specialist in computers and in radio communication services . " but according to the reuters news agency , a judicial source close to the investigation contested the officials ' account - saying french prosecutors had no evidence of any close link between ganczarski and bin laden , founder of al qaeda network .
authorities are now concentrating on ganczarski ’ s possible role in the bombing of a synagogue in djerba , tunisia , last year that killed 21 tourists , including 14 germans . questioned and released german police questioned ganczarski last year about the djerba attack after it was established he had telephoned with one of the suicide bombers shortly before the attack .
he was detained but then later released when no direct involvement in the incident could be found .
shortly thereafter he moved to saudi arabia . although during his time in training camps in afghanistan he was known as “ ibrahim the german , ” ganczarski is of polish descent .

burning cds offline : a german firm has pioneered new technology it hopes will put music retailers - those old school brick-and-mortar shops - back in the game . a german firm based in lübeck , imhg , has developed new technology for use in music retail stores that allows customers to burn their own cd 's .
a pilot shop employing the technology just opened in lübeck , and more retail venues are expected to adopt the concept by the end of the year . the music industry , music labels and retail stores alike have been battling a common foe : the rise of online file-swapping sites .
services like kazaa allow music devotees to download their favorite songs for free and often illegally - all from the comfort of their own home . industry-wide profits have fallen by 10 percent and major labels are running scared .
" the music industry is in a crisis , " says a spokewoman for universal , sophie greiner .
" partly because many people are downloading their music from the internet . " fighting back music labels have since fought back , taking the most notorious of the online swapping sights , napster , to court and shutting it down .
-lrb- napster was based on a central registry of available files on its servers that connected users with other users with copies of the music they wanted to download .
other services like morpheus , which employ decentralized technology allowing users to track down and download music from other computers , have thus far escaped prosecution and persist to this day . -rrb-
the labels have attempted to start their own online services , offering music downloads for a fee . but music retailers were left out in the cold , watching many of their customers turn to online music venues , both file-sharing and those offered by labels , rather than visiting brick-and-mortar shops .
" as a retailer , you have to take some action when the record companies themselves start to sell music over the internet - otherwise you 'll get lost in the shuffle , " says oliver salzmann , founder of imhg , the lübeck-based company which invented the new technology . salzmann speaks from experience - his family also owns a large department store , pressezentrum , in lübeck , which specializes in music and technology products .
after watching the profits in his own music department fall , salzmann and his father martin felt they had to do something . browsing with a pda the salzmann 's developed a new retail concept , which allows customers to browse the store 's musical selections using an adapted personal digital assistant -lrb- pda -rrb- , or handheld computer to the less technologically inclined .
by running a scanner over the cds , they can download thirty second samplers from an inventory of up to 20,000 songs , select up to 15 titles at a cost of 99 cents each and proceed to the check-out , where their selections will be burned onto a cd .
the cd and jewel case cost an additional € 2 . a pilot store employing the service was launched last week at the salzmann 's store in lübeck .
but by the end of the year they hope to license their creation to other large department stores and say they are already in talks with several major german retailers .
a smaller version of the technology may even be installed in other locations , like at gas stations . unlike the dubious legality of online music sharing sites , this service is entirely legitimate .
imhg has contracts with three large labels - sony , universal and edel - and hopes to line up more by the end of the year .
the business model is simple : the retailers and record labels split the profits , fifty-fifty , of each song downloaded , while imhg makes its money from licensing its technology and technical support . but given the wide-spread popularity of internet music sites , will this approach be enough to bring customers back into the store ?
salzmann thinks the service will appeal to the less technologically inclined and to those who appreciate the assistance offered at a traditional music store . " many do n't want to deal with the logistics of going online and burning their own cd , " says salzmann .
" what 's more , we offer a very professional looking product . " changing the way we buy music imhg 's technology is the latest innovation in an industry that is struggling to change the way we buy music .
" the rise of online file-sharing sites showed us that customers want to search for individual songs and put them in a particular order , " says greiner .
the music industry has since been scrambling to meet the demand , but recent ventures show there are profits for those who try . apple recently launched its own legal online music library by striking similar agreements with record labels , offering apple users -lrb- thus far only within the united states -rrb- the opportunity to download songs for 99 cents .

the german soccer team was spared from what could have been an embarrassing draw with the mostly amateur faroe islanders .
but in the last minutes of the european championship qualifier germany pulled out a 2-0 victory . it came down to the final seconds .
would powerhouse germany be spared an embarrassing draw with the modest faroe islands team ?
the three-time world champions needed a win in wednesday night ’ s 2004 european championship qualifier match in the north atlantic to hold on to their top seat in group five .
but the goals remained elusive until the 89th minute when substitute striker miroslav klose pulled his team into the lead with one minute left on the clock .
then striker fredi bobic doubled the advantage two minutes into extended time , saving the german team from humiliation .
a close call on paper though , it should have been an easy win .
germany was given 8-1 and 10-2 odds against the faroe islands team , a group of amateur players which has yet to make it beyond qualifier matches .
but the faroese gave it their all , and with the home-team advantage and a jam-packed torshavn stadium , the germans struggled to overcome the islanders defense .
wednesday ’ s match was not the first time germany ’ s supposedly strong national team failed to dominate a supposedly lesser opponent . after the disappointing 1-1 draw with scotland last saturday , german team coach rudi völler was just relieved to come out a winner .
a sigh of relief " i am very happy .
the match was as problematic as i expected , " völler told reporters after the game .
" we could not score , but i knew it was just a question of time . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi völler völler added that he couldn ’ t reproach his players : " it ’ s hard to shine against opponents who concentrate on defending . "
the german coach praised the faroese goalie jakup mikkelsen for effectively thwarting the opponent ’ s goal attempts : " the way he played , he could play in the bundesliga or in any league in the world . "
playing with heart " we played with our hearts and showed the world , that we can keep up with the best , " the faroe coach henrik larsen said .
" unfortunately we lost in the last minute .
but i am very pleased with my team . "
that ’ s something german fans can ’ t say for their team .
the near-draw with the soccer minnows coupled with the draw against scotland is almost too much for a nation expected to always be a soccer powerhouse .
the top-selling daily bild newspaper on thursday called the team ’ s performance " shameful " and referred to the 2-0 victory as germany ’ s " luckiest win ever . "
franz beckenbauer , former world cup winning coach and player , expressed his doubts about the team after watching them scrape by .
" we are back to where we were before the world cup , " he said reminding viewers of germany ’ s struggle to qualify for last year ’ s final .
völler , for his part , was cautiously optimistic .
" we are in a good position now but we haven ’ t won the qualification -lrb- group -rrb- yet .
if we are to win , we have to play better than we have so far , " he said looking ahead at the match against iceland . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reticent germans face possible curse of the faroes everyone expected the germans to beat scotland on saturday but the resulting draw in the european championship qualifiers adds an ominous feeling to their next match against the tiny faroe islands -lrb- june 11 , 2003 -rrb- .

french officials on wednesday accused a german citizen of being a leading member of the al qaeda terrorist network with ties to osama bin laden .
the man is also suspected of involvement in a deadly bombing in tunisia . christian ganczarski , a 36-year-old german citizen of polish descent , was arrested on june 2 at paris ’ charles de gaulle airport .
although he has not yet been officially charged , french authorities appear convinced he is a high-ranking member of the islamic extremist group al qaeda . " -lrb- intelligence -rrb- services know that he is a top leader of al qaeda , in contact with osama bin laden himself , and has been in afghanistan and bosnia , " french interior minister nicolas sarkozy told parliament .
" this individual is a specialist in computers and in radio communication services . " but according to the reuters news agency , a judicial source close to the investigation contested the officials ' account - saying french prosecutors had no evidence of any close link between ganczarski and bin laden , founder of al qaeda network .
authorities are now concentrating on ganczarski ’ s possible role in the bombing of a synagogue in djerba , tunisia , last year that killed 21 tourists , including 14 germans . questioned and released german police questioned ganczarski last year about the djerba attack after it was established he had telephoned with one of the suicide bombers shortly before the attack .
he was detained but then later released when no direct involvement in the incident could be found .
shortly thereafter he moved to saudi arabia . although during his time in training camps in afghanistan he was known as “ ibrahim the german , ” ganczarski is of polish descent .
born in southern poland in 1966 , he later moved to germany with his parents and became a naturalized citizen .
he and his wife are converts to islam .
trained as a locksmith , he eventually became know as a “ computer expert ” in extremist circles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mounir el motassadeq germany has been a focal point for investigations into al qaeda terrorist activity ever since it was discovered that several of the key figures in the sept .

mehdi , who has lived in germany for years , was allegedly plotting attacks on the island of la reunion in the indian ocean and against u.s. military bases in germany .

burning cds offline : a german firm has pioneered new technology it hopes will put music retailers - those old school brick-and-mortar shops - back in the game . a german firm based in lübeck , imhg , has developed new technology for use in music retail stores that allows customers to burn their own cd 's .
a pilot shop employing the technology just opened in lübeck , and more retail venues are expected to adopt the concept by the end of the year . the music industry , music labels and retail stores alike have been battling a common foe : the rise of online file-swapping sites .
services like kazaa allow music devotees to download their favorite songs for free and often illegally - all from the comfort of their own home . industry-wide profits have fallen by 10 percent and major labels are running scared .
" the music industry is in a crisis , " says a spokewoman for universal , sophie greiner .
" partly because many people are downloading their music from the internet . " fighting back music labels have since fought back , taking the most notorious of the online swapping sights , napster , to court and shutting it down .
-lrb- napster was based on a central registry of available files on its servers that connected users with other users with copies of the music they wanted to download .
other services like morpheus , which employ decentralized technology allowing users to track down and download music from other computers , have thus far escaped prosecution and persist to this day . -rrb-
the labels have attempted to start their own online services , offering music downloads for a fee . but music retailers were left out in the cold , watching many of their customers turn to online music venues , both file-sharing and those offered by labels , rather than visiting brick-and-mortar shops .
" as a retailer , you have to take some action when the record companies themselves start to sell music over the internet - otherwise you 'll get lost in the shuffle , " says oliver salzmann , founder of imhg , the lübeck-based company which invented the new technology . salzmann speaks from experience - his family also owns a large department store , pressezentrum , in lübeck , which specializes in music and technology products .
after watching the profits in his own music department fall , salzmann and his father martin felt they had to do something . browsing with a pda the salzmann 's developed a new retail concept , which allows customers to browse the store 's musical selections using an adapted personal digital assistant -lrb- pda -rrb- , or handheld computer to the less technologically inclined .
by running a scanner over the cds , they can download thirty second samplers from an inventory of up to 20,000 songs , select up to 15 titles at a cost of 99 cents each and proceed to the check-out , where their selections will be burned onto a cd .
the cd and jewel case cost an additional € 2 . a pilot store employing the service was launched last week at the salzmann 's store in lübeck .
but by the end of the year they hope to license their creation to other large department stores and say they are already in talks with several major german retailers .
a smaller version of the technology may even be installed in other locations , like at gas stations . unlike the dubious legality of online music sharing sites , this service is entirely legitimate .
imhg has contracts with three large labels - sony , universal and edel - and hopes to line up more by the end of the year .
the business model is simple : the retailers and record labels split the profits , fifty-fifty , of each song downloaded , while imhg makes its money from licensing its technology and technical support . but given the wide-spread popularity of internet music sites , will this approach be enough to bring customers back into the store ?
salzmann thinks the service will appeal to the less technologically inclined and to those who appreciate the assistance offered at a traditional music store . " many do n't want to deal with the logistics of going online and burning their own cd , " says salzmann .
" what 's more , we offer a very professional looking product . " changing the way we buy music imhg 's technology is the latest innovation in an industry that is struggling to change the way we buy music .
" the rise of online file-sharing sites showed us that customers want to search for individual songs and put them in a particular order , " says greiner .
the music industry has since been scrambling to meet the demand , but recent ventures show there are profits for those who try . apple recently launched its own legal online music library by striking similar agreements with record labels , offering apple users -lrb- thus far only within the united states -rrb- the opportunity to download songs for 99 cents .

a ruling by germany 's federal court of justice is forcing utility companies to buy renewable energy , even though it costs over ten times more than conventionally-produced power . germany 's federal court of justice in karlsruhe has ruled that the country 's renewable energies law eeg does not violate any constitutional rights .
the legislation guarantees wind turbine operators and solar energy producers much higher market prices for their ecological power .
the ruling came about after the regional electricity company schleswag in northern germany took its case to court .
it had refused to comply with the law , claiming that it violated its entrepreneurial freedom .
the company did not want to be forced to feed in power generated by several wind turbine operators in the region .
the minimum price requirements also posed an illegal subsidy , schleswag said .
the eeg stipulates that german utility companies pay a minimum of € 0.48 -lrb- $ 0.56 -rrb- per kilowatt hour to purchase energy generated by wind power , compared to € 0.03 to € 0.05 for conventionally produced electricity .
the judges in karlsruhe said in their ruling that despite the liberalization of the german energy market , utility companies still carried a particular responsibility to environmentally-friendly energy production .
the european court of justice in luxembourg already in 2001 ruled that the eeg did not represent indirect government subsidizing .
the world leader in wind energy federal environment minister jürgen trittin welcomed the court 's decision on wednesday .
he said he expected the major power providers to give up their resistance to renewable energies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin " renewable energies are a central element of the federal government 's environmental and energy policies , " trittin said in a statement .
" i assume that utility companies will get used to it . "
according to the environment ministry , the proportion of renewable energy in electric power consumption has jumped from 4.6 percent in 1998 to around 9 percent currently .
one-third of wind energy worldwide is produced in germany with its 14,000 wind turbines .
" the economy , the labor force and the environment can profit from a strong expansion in renewable energies , " trittin said .
berlin 's pet project according to a recent study by shell , renewable energies will contribute at least 50 percent of the worldwide energy use by 2050 .
germany - together with japan , denmark and the united states - belongs to the world leaders in expanding its renewable energies market .
this sector has been a pet project of trittin 's , who is a member of the environmentally-friendly greens party .
since the coalition government of social democrats and greens took power in 1998 , state-aided programs sparked a boom in wind and solar energy units .
wind turbines in particular began popping up everywhere .
many operators went public and collected hundreds of millions of euros for their expansion plans on the stock market .
but the gold rush seems to be coming to an end , as this sector is simply running out of space .
although there are new projects for wind turbine parks planned off the north sea coast , the financing is still not settled .
the solar boom is also waning .
last year , only about 65,000 new solar energy units were set up , half as many as in 2001 .

european and american defense ministers will attempt to fashion a “ new ” nato on thursday and friday , as the transatlantic alliance tries to keep its relevance in the face of changing security threats . nato officials in brussels are expected to discuss taking over peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and supporting poland 's efforts in iraq , but at the top of the agenda for the two-day meeting will be streamlining nato 's unwieldy command structure , which has remained largely unchanged since the cold war . " this is a new nato , a nato able to meet its commitments when times get tough , " nato secretary-general george robertson said as the ministers started their deliberations . at a summit in prague last november , nato leaders agreed the structure needed to be reformed in response to the collapse of communism and the defense alliance ’ s expansion to include former enemies in eastern europe .
but disagreement over the closure of some regional bases could yet scupper any agreement . spain and greece have fought efforts to revamp nato because they stand to lose alliance facilities and the jobs and prestige that come with them .
both countries oppose proposals to reduce the number of major nato installations to three joint regional headquarters and six smaller commands .
the plan would close a number of nato facilities , including a greek one in larissa and a spanish airbase in madrid . despite the rancor over the possible closures , most observers expect agreement over the new command structure after some intense political horse trading .
nato officials are also expected to discuss the progress of creating a rapid reaction force that could be available for missions worldwide . rapid reaction force by 2004 at the latest , nato hopes to have a flexible 20,000-troop force that could be readied for deployment anywhere in the world within 30 days .
a smaller amount of highly mobile soldiers are supposed to be ready for action within five days after received marching orders .
nato officials want the new force to be able to respond to a number of challenges , including global terrorism , peacekeeping and more serious military engagements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck " there are n't conventional wars anymore - instead we have to deal with terrorist threats , " said german defense minsiter peter struck on thursday . nato has been under considerable pressure to reinvent itself after the collapse of the soviet union , its traditional foe .
the terrorist attacks in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 , also encouraged the alliance to rethink its role .
one of the biggest changes in its 54-year history is its new willingness to take up missions beyond the borders of the 19 member countries . bridge building the alliance is taking the first steps in that direction by agreeing to take over command of the peacekeeping operations in afghanistan this summer and to help poland manage a zone of military control in postwar iraq . after an ugly internal split over the u.s.-led war in iraq , nato also hopes reinventing itself will heighten its relevance in international security matters as the european union discusses beefing up its own future military capabilities .
important for washington is that any eu force strengthens nato and is not promoted at the expense of the transatlantic alliance . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato to lend poland a hand in iraq the 19-member nato alliance has agreed to help poland establish an international peacekeeping contingent in iraq .

european and american defense ministers will attempt to fashion a “ new ” nato on thursday and friday , as the transatlantic alliance tries to keep its relevance in the face of changing security threats . nato officials in brussels are expected to discuss taking over peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and supporting poland 's efforts in iraq , but at the top of the agenda for the two-day meeting will be streamlining nato 's unwieldy command structure , which has remained largely unchanged since the cold war . " this is a new nato , a nato able to meet its commitments when times get tough , " nato secretary-general george robertson said as the ministers started their deliberations . at a summit in prague last november , nato leaders agreed the structure needed to be reformed in response to the collapse of communism and the defense alliance ’ s expansion to include former enemies in eastern europe .
but disagreement over the closure of some regional bases could yet scupper any agreement . spain and greece have fought efforts to revamp nato because they stand to lose alliance facilities and the jobs and prestige that come with them .
both countries oppose proposals to reduce the number of major nato installations to three joint regional headquarters and six smaller commands .
the plan would close a number of nato facilities , including a greek one in larissa and a spanish airbase in madrid . despite the rancor over the possible closures , most observers expect agreement over the new command structure after some intense political horse trading .
nato officials are also expected to discuss the progress of creating a rapid reaction force that could be available for missions worldwide . rapid reaction force by 2004 at the latest , nato hopes to have a flexible 20,000-troop force that could be readied for deployment anywhere in the world within 30 days .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.06.2003 pushing green energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany produces one-third of the world 's wind energy .
a ruling by germany 's federal court of justice is forcing utility companies to buy renewable energy , even though it costs over ten times more than conventionally-produced power . germany 's federal court of justice in karlsruhe has ruled that the country 's renewable energies law eeg does not violate any constitutional rights .
the legislation guarantees wind turbine operators and solar energy producers much higher market prices for their ecological power .
the ruling came about after the regional electricity company schleswag in northern germany took its case to court .
it had refused to comply with the law , claiming that it violated its entrepreneurial freedom .
the company did not want to be forced to feed in power generated by several wind turbine operators in the region .
the minimum price requirements also posed an illegal subsidy , schleswag said .
the eeg stipulates that german utility companies pay a minimum of € 0.48 -lrb- $ 0.56 -rrb- per kilowatt hour to purchase energy generated by wind power , compared to € 0.03 to € 0.05 for conventionally produced electricity .
the judges in karlsruhe said in their ruling that despite the liberalization of the german energy market , utility companies still carried a particular responsibility to environmentally-friendly energy production .
the european court of justice in luxembourg already in 2001 ruled that the eeg did not represent indirect government subsidizing .
the world leader in wind energy federal environment minister jürgen trittin welcomed the court 's decision on wednesday .
he said he expected the major power providers to give up their resistance to renewable energies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin " renewable energies are a central element of the federal government 's environmental and energy policies , " trittin said in a statement .
" i assume that utility companies will get used to it . "
according to the environment ministry , the proportion of renewable energy in electric power consumption has jumped from 4.6 percent in 1998 to around 9 percent currently .
one-third of wind energy worldwide is produced in germany with its 14,000 wind turbines .
" the economy , the labor force and the environment can profit from a strong expansion in renewable energies , " trittin said .
berlin 's pet project according to a recent study by shell , renewable energies will contribute at least 50 percent of the worldwide energy use by 2050 .
germany - together with japan , denmark and the united states - belongs to the world leaders in expanding its renewable energies market .
this sector has been a pet project of trittin 's , who is a member of the environmentally-friendly greens party .
since the coalition government of social democrats and greens took power in 1998 , state-aided programs sparked a boom in wind and solar energy units .
wind turbines in particular began popping up everywhere .
many operators went public and collected hundreds of millions of euros for their expansion plans on the stock market .
but the gold rush seems to be coming to an end , as this sector is simply running out of space .
although there are new projects for wind turbine parks planned off the north sea coast , the financing is still not settled .
the solar boom is also waning .
last year , only about 65,000 new solar energy units were set up , half as many as in 2001 .
germany - with its over 16 million square feet of solar panels - is the number two in the photo-voltaic sector after japan .
but the proportion of solar energy in germany 's power production is still less than one percent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the wind of change blows through germany viable sources of renewable energy have long been the ' holy grail ' of environmentalists across the globe .

european and american defense ministers will attempt to fashion a “ new ” nato on thursday and friday , as the transatlantic alliance tries to keep its relevance in the face of changing security threats . nato officials in brussels are expected to discuss taking over peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and supporting poland 's efforts in iraq , but at the top of the agenda for the two-day meeting will be streamlining nato 's unwieldy command structure , which has remained largely unchanged since the cold war . " this is a new nato , a nato able to meet its commitments when times get tough , " nato secretary-general george robertson said as the ministers started their deliberations . at a summit in prague last november , nato leaders agreed the structure needed to be reformed in response to the collapse of communism and the defense alliance ’ s expansion to include former enemies in eastern europe .

the plan would close a number of nato facilities , including a greek one in larissa and a spanish airbase in madrid . despite the rancor over the possible closures , most observers expect agreement over the new command structure after some intense political horse trading .
nato officials are also expected to discuss the progress of creating a rapid reaction force that could be available for missions worldwide . rapid reaction force by 2004 at the latest , nato hopes to have a flexible 20,000-troop force that could be readied for deployment anywhere in the world within 30 days .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.06.2003 pushing green energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany produces one-third of the world 's wind energy .
a ruling by germany 's federal court of justice is forcing utility companies to buy renewable energy , even though it costs over ten times more than conventionally-produced power . germany 's federal court of justice in karlsruhe has ruled that the country 's renewable energies law eeg does not violate any constitutional rights .
the legislation guarantees wind turbine operators and solar energy producers much higher market prices for their ecological power .
the ruling came about after the regional electricity company schleswag in northern germany took its case to court .
it had refused to comply with the law , claiming that it violated its entrepreneurial freedom .
the company did not want to be forced to feed in power generated by several wind turbine operators in the region .
the minimum price requirements also posed an illegal subsidy , schleswag said .
the eeg stipulates that german utility companies pay a minimum of € 0.48 -lrb- $ 0.56 -rrb- per kilowatt hour to purchase energy generated by wind power , compared to € 0.03 to € 0.05 for conventionally produced electricity .
the judges in karlsruhe said in their ruling that despite the liberalization of the german energy market , utility companies still carried a particular responsibility to environmentally-friendly energy production .
the european court of justice in luxembourg already in 2001 ruled that the eeg did not represent indirect government subsidizing .
the world leader in wind energy federal environment minister jürgen trittin welcomed the court 's decision on wednesday .
he said he expected the major power providers to give up their resistance to renewable energies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin " renewable energies are a central element of the federal government 's environmental and energy policies , " trittin said in a statement .
" i assume that utility companies will get used to it . "
according to the environment ministry , the proportion of renewable energy in electric power consumption has jumped from 4.6 percent in 1998 to around 9 percent currently .
one-third of wind energy worldwide is produced in germany with its 14,000 wind turbines .
" the economy , the labor force and the environment can profit from a strong expansion in renewable energies , " trittin said .
berlin 's pet project according to a recent study by shell , renewable energies will contribute at least 50 percent of the worldwide energy use by 2050 .
germany - together with japan , denmark and the united states - belongs to the world leaders in expanding its renewable energies market .
this sector has been a pet project of trittin 's , who is a member of the environmentally-friendly greens party .
since the coalition government of social democrats and greens took power in 1998 , state-aided programs sparked a boom in wind and solar energy units .
wind turbines in particular began popping up everywhere .
many operators went public and collected hundreds of millions of euros for their expansion plans on the stock market .
but the gold rush seems to be coming to an end , as this sector is simply running out of space .
although there are new projects for wind turbine parks planned off the north sea coast , the financing is still not settled .
the solar boom is also waning .
last year , only about 65,000 new solar energy units were set up , half as many as in 2001 .
germany - with its over 16 million square feet of solar panels - is the number two in the photo-voltaic sector after japan .
but the proportion of solar energy in germany 's power production is still less than one percent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the wind of change blows through germany viable sources of renewable energy have long been the ' holy grail ' of environmentalists across the globe .

burning cds offline : a german firm has pioneered new technology it hopes will put music retailers - those old school brick-and-mortar shops - back in the game . a german firm based in lübeck , imhg , has developed new technology for use in music retail stores that allows customers to burn their own cd 's .
a pilot shop employing the technology just opened in lübeck , and more retail venues are expected to adopt the concept by the end of the year . the music industry , music labels and retail stores alike have been battling a common foe : the rise of online file-swapping sites .
services like kazaa allow music devotees to download their favorite songs for free and often illegally - all from the comfort of their own home . industry-wide profits have fallen by 10 percent and major labels are running scared .
" the music industry is in a crisis , " says a spokewoman for universal , sophie greiner .
" partly because many people are downloading their music from the internet . " fighting back music labels have since fought back , taking the most notorious of the online swapping sights , napster , to court and shutting it down .
-lrb- napster was based on a central registry of available files on its servers that connected users with other users with copies of the music they wanted to download .
other services like morpheus , which employ decentralized technology allowing users to track down and download music from other computers , have thus far escaped prosecution and persist to this day . -rrb-
the labels have attempted to start their own online services , offering music downloads for a fee . but music retailers were left out in the cold , watching many of their customers turn to online music venues , both file-sharing and those offered by labels , rather than visiting brick-and-mortar shops .
" as a retailer , you have to take some action when the record companies themselves start to sell music over the internet - otherwise you 'll get lost in the shuffle , " says oliver salzmann , founder of imhg , the lübeck-based company which invented the new technology . salzmann speaks from experience - his family also owns a large department store , pressezentrum , in lübeck , which specializes in music and technology products .
after watching the profits in his own music department fall , salzmann and his father martin felt they had to do something . browsing with a pda the salzmann 's developed a new retail concept , which allows customers to browse the store 's musical selections using an adapted personal digital assistant -lrb- pda -rrb- , or handheld computer to the less technologically inclined .
by running a scanner over the cds , they can download thirty second samplers from an inventory of up to 20,000 songs , select up to 15 titles at a cost of 99 cents each and proceed to the check-out , where their selections will be burned onto a cd .
the cd and jewel case cost an additional € 2 . a pilot store employing the service was launched last week at the salzmann 's store in lübeck .
but by the end of the year they hope to license their creation to other large department stores and say they are already in talks with several major german retailers .
a smaller version of the technology may even be installed in other locations , like at gas stations . unlike the dubious legality of online music sharing sites , this service is entirely legitimate .
imhg has contracts with three large labels - sony , universal and edel - and hopes to line up more by the end of the year .
the business model is simple : the retailers and record labels split the profits , fifty-fifty , of each song downloaded , while imhg makes its money from licensing its technology and technical support . but given the wide-spread popularity of internet music sites , will this approach be enough to bring customers back into the store ?
salzmann thinks the service will appeal to the less technologically inclined and to those who appreciate the assistance offered at a traditional music store . " many do n't want to deal with the logistics of going online and burning their own cd , " says salzmann .
" what 's more , we offer a very professional looking product . " changing the way we buy music imhg 's technology is the latest innovation in an industry that is struggling to change the way we buy music .
" the rise of online file-sharing sites showed us that customers want to search for individual songs and put them in a particular order , " says greiner .
the music industry has since been scrambling to meet the demand , but recent ventures show there are profits for those who try . apple recently launched its own legal online music library by striking similar agreements with record labels , offering apple users -lrb- thus far only within the united states -rrb- the opportunity to download songs for 99 cents .
the venture exceeded all expectations , with more than 2 million songs purchased and downloaded within the first 16 days .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the road to portugal germany beats faroe islands by a hair reticent germans face possible curse of the faroes " mcberti " takes on his former team german players pessimistic ahead of italy clash culture & lifestyle -pipe- 12.06.2003 german soccer team avoids embarrassing draw großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's fredi bobic helps rescue germany from a humiliating draw in the last minutes .
the german soccer team was spared from what could have been an embarrassing draw with the mostly amateur faroe islanders .
but in the last minutes of the european championship qualifier germany pulled out a 2-0 victory . it came down to the final seconds .
would powerhouse germany be spared an embarrassing draw with the modest faroe islands team ?
the three-time world champions needed a win in wednesday night ’ s 2004 european championship qualifier match in the north atlantic to hold on to their top seat in group five .
but the goals remained elusive until the 89th minute when substitute striker miroslav klose pulled his team into the lead with one minute left on the clock .
then striker fredi bobic doubled the advantage two minutes into extended time , saving the german team from humiliation .
a close call on paper though , it should have been an easy win .
germany was given 8-1 and 10-2 odds against the faroe islands team , a group of amateur players which has yet to make it beyond qualifier matches .
but the faroese gave it their all , and with the home-team advantage and a jam-packed torshavn stadium , the germans struggled to overcome the islanders defense .
wednesday ’ s match was not the first time germany ’ s supposedly strong national team failed to dominate a supposedly lesser opponent . after the disappointing 1-1 draw with scotland last saturday , german team coach rudi völler was just relieved to come out a winner .
a sigh of relief " i am very happy .
the match was as problematic as i expected , " völler told reporters after the game .
" we could not score , but i knew it was just a question of time . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi völler völler added that he couldn ’ t reproach his players : " it ’ s hard to shine against opponents who concentrate on defending . "
the german coach praised the faroese goalie jakup mikkelsen for effectively thwarting the opponent ’ s goal attempts : " the way he played , he could play in the bundesliga or in any league in the world . "

a ruling by germany 's federal court of justice is forcing utility companies to buy renewable energy , even though it costs over ten times more than conventionally-produced power . germany 's federal court of justice in karlsruhe has ruled that the country 's renewable energies law eeg does not violate any constitutional rights .
the legislation guarantees wind turbine operators and solar energy producers much higher market prices for their ecological power .
the ruling came about after the regional electricity company schleswag in northern germany took its case to court .
it had refused to comply with the law , claiming that it violated its entrepreneurial freedom .
the company did not want to be forced to feed in power generated by several wind turbine operators in the region .
the minimum price requirements also posed an illegal subsidy , schleswag said .
the eeg stipulates that german utility companies pay a minimum of € 0.48 -lrb- $ 0.56 -rrb- per kilowatt hour to purchase energy generated by wind power , compared to € 0.03 to € 0.05 for conventionally produced electricity .
the judges in karlsruhe said in their ruling that despite the liberalization of the german energy market , utility companies still carried a particular responsibility to environmentally-friendly energy production .
the european court of justice in luxembourg already in 2001 ruled that the eeg did not represent indirect government subsidizing .
the world leader in wind energy federal environment minister jürgen trittin welcomed the court 's decision on wednesday .
he said he expected the major power providers to give up their resistance to renewable energies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin " renewable energies are a central element of the federal government 's environmental and energy policies , " trittin said in a statement .
" i assume that utility companies will get used to it . "
according to the environment ministry , the proportion of renewable energy in electric power consumption has jumped from 4.6 percent in 1998 to around 9 percent currently .
one-third of wind energy worldwide is produced in germany with its 14,000 wind turbines .
" the economy , the labor force and the environment can profit from a strong expansion in renewable energies , " trittin said .
berlin 's pet project according to a recent study by shell , renewable energies will contribute at least 50 percent of the worldwide energy use by 2050 .
germany - together with japan , denmark and the united states - belongs to the world leaders in expanding its renewable energies market .
this sector has been a pet project of trittin 's , who is a member of the environmentally-friendly greens party .
since the coalition government of social democrats and greens took power in 1998 , state-aided programs sparked a boom in wind and solar energy units .
wind turbines in particular began popping up everywhere .
many operators went public and collected hundreds of millions of euros for their expansion plans on the stock market .
but the gold rush seems to be coming to an end , as this sector is simply running out of space .
although there are new projects for wind turbine parks planned off the north sea coast , the financing is still not settled .
the solar boom is also waning .
last year , only about 65,000 new solar energy units were set up , half as many as in 2001 .
germany - with its over 16 million square feet of solar panels - is the number two in the photo-voltaic sector after japan .
but the proportion of solar energy in germany 's power production is still less than one percent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the wind of change blows through germany viable sources of renewable energy have long been the ' holy grail ' of environmentalists across the globe .

the german soccer team was spared from what could have been an embarrassing draw with the mostly amateur faroe islanders .
but in the last minutes of the european championship qualifier germany pulled out a 2-0 victory . it came down to the final seconds .
would powerhouse germany be spared an embarrassing draw with the modest faroe islands team ?
the three-time world champions needed a win in wednesday night ’ s 2004 european championship qualifier match in the north atlantic to hold on to their top seat in group five .
but the goals remained elusive until the 89th minute when substitute striker miroslav klose pulled his team into the lead with one minute left on the clock .
then striker fredi bobic doubled the advantage two minutes into extended time , saving the german team from humiliation .
a close call on paper though , it should have been an easy win .
germany was given 8-1 and 10-2 odds against the faroe islands team , a group of amateur players which has yet to make it beyond qualifier matches .
but the faroese gave it their all , and with the home-team advantage and a jam-packed torshavn stadium , the germans struggled to overcome the islanders defense .
wednesday ’ s match was not the first time germany ’ s supposedly strong national team failed to dominate a supposedly lesser opponent . after the disappointing 1-1 draw with scotland last saturday , german team coach rudi völler was just relieved to come out a winner .
a sigh of relief " i am very happy .
the match was as problematic as i expected , " völler told reporters after the game .
" we could not score , but i knew it was just a question of time . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi völler völler added that he couldn ’ t reproach his players : " it ’ s hard to shine against opponents who concentrate on defending . "
the german coach praised the faroese goalie jakup mikkelsen for effectively thwarting the opponent ’ s goal attempts : " the way he played , he could play in the bundesliga or in any league in the world . "
playing with heart " we played with our hearts and showed the world , that we can keep up with the best , " the faroe coach henrik larsen said .
" unfortunately we lost in the last minute .
but i am very pleased with my team . "
that ’ s something german fans can ’ t say for their team .
the near-draw with the soccer minnows coupled with the draw against scotland is almost too much for a nation expected to always be a soccer powerhouse .
the top-selling daily bild newspaper on thursday called the team ’ s performance " shameful " and referred to the 2-0 victory as germany ’ s " luckiest win ever . "
franz beckenbauer , former world cup winning coach and player , expressed his doubts about the team after watching them scrape by .
" we are back to where we were before the world cup , " he said reminding viewers of germany ’ s struggle to qualify for last year ’ s final .
völler , for his part , was cautiously optimistic .
" we are in a good position now but we haven ’ t won the qualification -lrb- group -rrb- yet .
if we are to win , we have to play better than we have so far , " he said looking ahead at the match against iceland . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reticent germans face possible curse of the faroes everyone expected the germans to beat scotland on saturday but the resulting draw in the european championship qualifiers adds an ominous feeling to their next match against the tiny faroe islands -lrb- june 11 , 2003 -rrb- .

the oil cartel decided on wednesday to retain current production levels .
but opec president and qatar oil minister abdullah bin hamad al-attiyah said they would meet again on 31 july to assess the impact of iraq 's return to the market .
" because of the uncertainty at the moment on the world market we want to meet as often as possible , " he said .
meanwhile the us energy information administration -lrb- eia -rrb- reported another decline in already low fuel stocks , prompting an immediate leap in crude oil prices .
iraq effect us light crude jumped 63 cents to $ 32.36 on the news , after hitting a peak of $ 32.50 - the highest level in 12 weeks and nearly 35 % higher than this time last year .

oil prices continued to hover above the $ 32 per barrel level on thursday morning but some dealers suggested opec 's decision indicated a softening of prices once iraqi oil returns to the market .
iraq , which stopped its oil exports in march , said earlier this week it hopes to produce 1.5 million barrels per day -lrb- bpd -rrb- by the end of month , of which one million would be exported .

barbara shook from the energy intelligence group said it was " probably the wisest decision in the short term " , but predicted there would be no cut if iraq 's oil sector is as badly damaged as has been reported .
looting and damage to equipment in key oil fields has prompted suggestions that iraqi exports will remain well below pre-war levels for some time .
" the situation appears to be very , very bad .
i would n't expect any further cut in july , " said ms shook .
but she added that regular opec meetings ensured prices did not go too far above the cartel 's goal of between $ 22 and $ 28 per barrel .

dr williams had retired from the welsh assembly only six weeks ago to return to his first career as a space scientist .
plaid leader ieuan wyn jones described him as a genius , and conservative assembly member alun cairns called him one of the kindest and most generous people he had known .
former plaid president dafydd wigley said : " this is very sad news .
" he had to correct so-called experts that came to the assembly " conservative alun cairns " it is a huge loss to wales and to the scientific world .
he was a man who still had a major contribution to make . "
police said they were investigating the death of a man in cathays , cardiff .

dr williams was an expert in both economics and astronomy dr williams had been plaid 's economic spokesman in the assembly for its first four-year term , from 1999 until he stepped down last month .
in a statement plaid said : " phil spent his life fighting for the people of wales and was a huge influence on plaid cymru .

he will be missed by all those within the party who have lost a friend and mentor . "
ieuan wyn jones , who will step down later this year as plaid leader , said : " i have known phil williams for over 30 years and always knew that i was in the presence of a genius . "
plaid mep eurig wyn , speaking from brussels , said : " his knowledge and capacity to understand and disseminate the details of european affairs was immense and will be sorely missed in plaid cymru by elected representatives so dependent on his expert advice .
he came to prominence at a 1968 by-election in caerphilly " i convey my condolences to all his family . "
dr williams , who had been am for south-east wales , was also physics professor at the university of wales , aberystwyth .

" i consider it a privilege to have known him and to have worked with him .
" his commitment to devolution was second to none .
he had one of the best brains i had ever come across and was prepared to work with any party to improve the quality of life .
phil wiilliams leaves a widow and two children " i can recall a number of occasions where he had to correct so-called experts that came to the assembly 's committee .
always polite and courteous and almost embarrassed by his intellect .
" he is an enormous loss to wales and was one of the world 's leading authority in his field .
few have achieved so much in their life as phil . "
plaid chairman john dixon said dr williams was a leading light in the party and had a distinguished history .

the troubled mutual insurer has written to 16,000 former policyholders asking them to sign a waiver clearing equitable of claims of mis-selling , negligence or fraud .
equitable is anxious to draw a line under the mis-selling scandal which brought it to the brink of financial collapse .
the company reached a compromise settlement last year with more than a million policyholders , who all signed a similar waiver .
rejection call but the 16,000 so-called " late-joiners " believe they have a stronger legal claim against the company .
this group joined equitable life after september 1998 , by which time the company 's board had received legal advice on the extent of its financial troubles .
the late-joiners ' action group is expected to tell its members to reject equitable 's compensation offer , which would see them receiving about 5 % of their investment .
this means some former policyholders stand to lose thousands of pounds , leaving them little alternative but to take equitable to court , the action group says .
legal action but a spokesman for equitable life said the late-joiners should consider the firm 's offer carefully .
" they have to consider whether they want a fair offer now - and draw a line under it .
" or whether they want to go to the huge expense - and the time it would take - to bring a case to court .
" there is no guarantee they would win - and we would fight it tooth and nail , " he told the bbc .
he said equitable 's offer was a fair one which had been drawn up with the full knowledge of the financial services authority .
he also claimed there were no legal grounds for a fraud action against the company .
unimpressed but paul weir , vice chairman of the equitable life late joiners action group , said he was not impressed with the insurer 's offer .
" i do n't think that getting back less than a fifth of what i have lost is a fair offer , " he told bbc radio 4 's today programme .
" i 'd like my capital back , let alone any loss of bonuses or interest . "
equitable has set aside £ 75m for the settlement , but mr weir said he thought the total liability would be nearer £ 400m .
" i 'm sure it would n't help -lrb- equitable 's financial position -rrb- at all , but the money 's been taken from us and it 's not our problem as to how they fund it , " he said .
ombudsman last month equitable lost five lead cases at the financial ombudsman relating to late-joiners .
the troubled mutual was found to have misrepresented to the consumers the possible impact of meeting all its liabilities to guaranteed annuity rate -lrb- gar -rrb- investors .
in one case a representative of the equitable , acting under advice from bosses , estimated the cost of meeting gar claims to be only £ 50m .
however , the equitable 's own lawyers had put the potential liability at closer to £ 1.5bn.
your comments : equitable has not been totally honest and should pay back the money taken from us with interest .
why is the goverment and the fsa not being more forceful in making them honour their obligations to policy holders ? ?
gordon cameron , scotland i am a late-joiner with a with-profits annuity .
i was deceived by equitable life .
i would prefer the company to go into liquidation .
i would then get the guaranteed minimum repayment from the abi or whatever the association of life assurance companies is called .
peter mcanena , uk the offer from equitable is totally unsatisfactory under the circumstances .
they have to come up with a fair and reasonable offer to the many victims of mis-selling walter gilmour , uk i 'm pleased to see that at last el is admitting liability .
clearly the 5 % offer is not enough , i ca n't see many people accepting anything less than the return of their original capital .
the longer that el spins it out the more people will get entrenched to go after the interest .
delaying does not fool anyone .
percy sledge , england their offer does not adequately compensate me for my loss of £ 287,243 .
this represents 33 % of my investment in an income drawdown policy on nov 28th , 1998 of £ £ 869,717 .
within 2 months of the plan start i received an official notification from equitable of their intention to take high court action .
this was the first time i heard of a gar situation !
john howard , uk as a wp late-joiner -lrb- mid ' 99 -rrb- who opted out of the , so far , successful litigation and signed the compromise , losing my right to sue , i have great sympathy with the ljag as i too was faced with losing 20 percent original capital on surrender .
i chose the " fingers crossed " route and current litigants must know that whatever increase in compensation they are awarded must come out of the pockets of all those of us left in equitable jail who accepted the compromise scheme - without whose action the good ship e. would definititely be sunk by now !
selfish , therefore .
the way forward should be to redress via the poi for regulatory authorities negligence .

it 's a surprising fact that more of us are addicted to drink than drugs , but that is the finding of the social care charity turning point .
breakfast heard the moving story of one young mother 's battle with alcohol .
we also talked to the head of turning point , victor adebowale .
turning point wants the health secretary alan milburn to put more money into treating alcoholics in britain .
the social care group says that alcohol plays a part in about 40,000 deaths per year , with current services patchy and fragmented .
according to a report published today , sufferers are denied the chance to overcome their addiction .
currently £ 95 million is allocated to treating alcohol related illness but £ 570 million is set aside for the treatment of drug addiction .
the charity argued that treatment for drink problems was " proven to be effective in turning lives around " but said some addicts had been forced to wait 18 months for the medical care they needed .
lord adebowale , chief executive of turning point , said the report , waiting for change , showed " a desperate need for the government to call time on alcohol dependency " .
he called on ministers to " systematically invest " in alcohol treatment services .
" with almost four million people in england and wales dependent on alcohol - over six times the number of people who are problem users of class a drugs - society can not afford to continue to neglect alcohol treatment .
" at present , the government does not even know how many people nationally are in alcohol treatment , " he said .
" there is an urgent need for the government to give as high a priority to tackling alcohol dependency as it does to addressing drug misuse .

they will be taking evidence from players , fans , and journalists .
with more and more clubs going into administration , the group will also be talking to the companies which take over the running of club finances when this happens .
