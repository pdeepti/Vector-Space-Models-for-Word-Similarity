crime-fighting duo return in virtual form a red ford gran torino with a white swoosh down either side .
tv culture has produced few more iconic cars , although there are a few contenders - kitt in knight rider , the general lee in the dukes of hazzard , del boy 's yellow reliant robin .
as soon as the starsky & hutch game begins , you get a rush of nostalgia when the cartoony version of the gran torino cruises by on-screen .
the original starsky & hutch tv series ran from 1975 to 1979 .
but , despite decades of repeats , it is not exactly fresh in the consciousness .
that is where the game comes in .
it both reinvigorates the characters and brand , and updates them into a contemporary form .
this form is , of course , a chasing and shooting-based video game .
hollywood treatment although starsky & hutch has passing similarities to driver , the getaway and grand theft auto , it is actually defined more by a light-hearted take on nostalgia about the tv series , its characters and its essence .
like so many tv series before it , starsky & hutch is getting the hollywood remake treatment discuss this story on bbci collective this means that , in the format of episodes , you get to chase bad guys round the streets of bay city with hutch leaning out of the car blasting away .
you can even perform stunts .
the more you achieve , the higher your viewer rating .
bore the audience with humdrum driving or let the baddies elude you and it drops to zero , in other words failure .
you can even combine controllers , steering wheels and light guns .
however , not only does the game give a dose of nostalgia that is both naff and hip , the revival of the brand is also timely in raising awareness for the new movie .
like so many tv series before it , starsky & hutch is getting the hollywood remake treatment .
cpt holdings inc , the owner of the brand has licensed it to empire interactive for the video game and presumably to warner bros for the new movie , starring ben stiller as starsky and owen wilson as hutch .

the bbc radio presenter has been honoured in a unique way - the street where he lives in mynyddygarreg has been named after him .
as soon as council workmen get around to putting the sign up , his official address will be ray gravell , heol ray gravell .
the idea was first mooted five years ago by his friend john jenkins who spotted a street in gwaun-cae-gurwen named after gareth edwards .
michael higgins , a town councillor in the neighbouring village of kidwelly , said there was overwhelming support from local people for the move . "
i 'm very , very proud " ray gravell " i think he adds a lot of colour and zip to the community , " he said .
" he is a great sportsman and a great ambassador for the area and is proud to be a mynyddygarreg person .
" i was joking with him the other day and told him at least he should not have any problem remembering where he lives . "
a petition was launched to change the name of the street - which was previously known as " off horeb road " .
former llanelli , wales and british lions rugby player ray said he was humbled by the move .
" i 'm very , very proud , " he said .
" there was a bank here that everyone called banc raymond after me , but this is official .
" it 's a beautiful area - an old quarry with lots of wildlife - so having my name on it is a real treat . "

the 2004 eisteddfod is being carefully prepared by a team of four who are co-ordinating nearly 1,000 volunteers to make the event run as smoothly as possible .
it is being held in the south of the country in wales ' newest city newport after an absence of 16 years , and is expected to bring in at least £ 6.5m to the local economy .
this year 's week-long event is being held in meifod , mid wales , starting on 2 august .
the approach of this year 's event has not prevented organisers of the newport eisteddfod continuing their work for next year .
one of the organisers , sioned davies , said she was expecting a very busy time as the fundraising begins in earnest and the competition classes are decided .
" the organising really began in january 2002 after a public meeting was held , " she said .
" we were n't really sure how the meeting was going to go because it seems there is less welsh spoken in this part of the country .
" but , we were overwhelmed by the support we had and we are really excited about it , " she said .
the event is to be held in the grounds of tredegar house starting on 31 july 2004 .
" the last time we came to newport it was absolutely brilliant and it is going to be a hard act to follow .
" but there is going to be something for everyone there and i hope that people come along .
" newport is only 10 minutes away from cardiff and we hope people will come from far and wide .
" it is not a bit like what it is on the television - it is n't just about competitive events .
" we are going to have about 350 trade stalls there , there is going to be a rock stand and there is definitely something for everyone - welsh speakers or non-welsh speakers , " she said .
ms davies said she is confident that the organising of next year 's event is going to plan but says that the hard work has yet to come .
" we have hundreds of people who are fundraising at the moment and we are trying to sort out the competitions . "
the team are expecting around 180,000 people to descend on the city during the eisteddfod week .
but the one big thing the organisers are hoping for is good weather after atrocious conditions in the 2002 festival held in pembrokeshire .
" we are all crossing our fingers and toes that the weather is good for the newport eisteddfod - i think we are due a few good weather years for the event , " said ms davies .

the newport eisteddfod will be held in the grounds of tredegar house one of the organisers , sioned davies , said she was expecting a very busy time as the fundraising begins in earnest and the competition classes are decided .
" the organising really began in january 2002 after a public meeting was held , " she said .
" we were n't really sure how the meeting was going to go because it seems there is less welsh spoken in this part of the country .
" but , we were overwhelmed by the support we had and we are really excited about it , " she said .
the event is to be held in the grounds of tredegar house starting on 31 july 2004 .
" the last time we came to newport it was absolutely brilliant and it is going to be a hard act to follow .
" but there is going to be something for everyone there and i hope that people come along .
" newport is only 10 minutes away from cardiff and we hope people will come from far and wide .
sioned davies is part of a team of four co-ordinating the planning " it is not a bit like what it is on the television - it is n't just about competitive events .
" we are going to have about 350 trade stalls there , there is going to be a rock stand and there is definitely something for everyone - welsh speakers or non-welsh speakers , " she said .
ms davies said she is confident that the organising of next year 's event is going to plan but says that the hard work has yet to come .
" we have hundreds of people who are fundraising at the moment and we are trying to sort out the competitions . "
the team are expecting around 180,000 people to descend on the city during the eisteddfod week .
but the one big thing the organisers are hoping for is good weather after atrocious conditions in the 2002 festival held in pembrokeshire .
" we are all crossing our fingers and toes that the weather is good for the newport eisteddfod - i think we are due a few good weather years for the event , " said ms davies .

the scottish centre of tourism -lrb- scot -rrb- said backpacking was a largely neglected area , but could help promote an upturn in visitor numbers .
a study by the centre , based at robert gordon university in aberdeen , found that 95 % of backpackers on holiday in scotland questioned said they would return .
but a number were put off by high travel costs .
positive impression dr maree thyne , from scot , claimed that the study , which gathered information from backpackers staying in scottish youth hostels , was prompted by the lack of research and official statistics on the subject in scotland .
the survey revealed that nearly 40 % of backpackers stayed less than a week .
it said that expectations were high of scotland 's natural beauty and cultural heritage .
however , only 14 % expected quality in food , service and shopping .
dr thyne said : " impressions on service and standard at bars and restaurants did not match the more positive impression associated with accommodation standard and quality of service . "
backpacker tourism , a largely neglected sector , could help promote an upturn in the industry .
dr maree thyne the survey found that 30 % of the total number of backpackers in scotland were british , 26 % were from mainland europe and 14 % were american and canadian .
the research also found that women constituted 54 % and more than 40 % were 20-29 years old , while more than half earned less than £ 20,000 per year .
dr thyne added : " an overwhelming 95 % indicated they would make a return visit to scotland as most felt their current visit did not allow them enough time to see other parts of the country .
" others emphasised that they were encouraged to come back after experiencing scotland 's natural beauty , cultural heritage and the friendliness of its people .
expensive destination " the research found that the main reason for not planning to return was the high cost of travelling in scotland due mostly to an unfavourable exchange rate .
" however respondents felt positively about overall value for money , indicating perhaps that other aspects of their visit had compensated for the fact that scotland was perceived as an expensive destination . "
dr tyne said : " while scotland 's tourism industry lags behind , and our national economy is in need of rejuvenation the research suggests that backpacker tourism , a largely neglected sector , could help promote an upturn in the industry .
" however visitors to scotland generally have a much shorter length of stay .
this may be partly due to the fact that scotland may only be a part of a wider trip across europe or the uk . "
