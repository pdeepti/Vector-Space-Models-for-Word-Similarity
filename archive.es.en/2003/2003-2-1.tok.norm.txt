hungary , poland and the czech republic support the u.s. position towards iraq out of gratitude for help in ending the cold war . commentators have been speculating that hungary , poland and the czech republic are part of a " new europe " since their heads of state signed a joint declaration with five other european leaders on jan .
30 pledging support for the u.s. stance towards iraq .
central europeans did n't intend to create a new bloc though , says czech journalist and political commentator jaroslav šlonka .

30 . not new but thankful the central european countries would reject a concept that dubs france and germany the " old europe , " as u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld recently maintained , with the eight signatories constituting a " new europe , " jaroslav šlonka told dw-world . the three former communist countries were showing their thanks to the u.s. for helping them shake off 40 years of communist dictatorship more than a decade ago , šlonka said . " the central european countries are paying back the americans . " simple logic šlonka explains that czech president havel , hungarian prime minister medgyessy and polish prime minister miller belong to the " old " generation of central europeans whose ideas were formed by the limited information from outside the eastern bloc they had access to before the 1989 revolutions in the region put an end to communist rule there . the ideas that were most accessible and influential to them were those of u.s. president ronald reagan and british prime minister margaret thatcher , according to šlonka .

they used the declaration to voice their standpoints on the iraq conflict even before the european union itself managed to determine a common position .

the move comes as the security council braces itself to receive evidence from the us that saddam hussein 's regime has been stockpiling weapons of mass destruction .
the geneva-based conference , which opened earlier this month , is responsible for consolidating the work of several arms-negotiating bodies .
its chairmanship is automatically rotated and , after iran stepped aside , iraq will head the meetings from mid-march .
by anyone 's standards , this is not great timing for the united nations as the us steps up pressure on baghdad to surrender any banned weapons or face military action .
embarrassingly , the conference on disarmament is the same international forum which negotiated the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and steered talks on the 1972 biological weapons convention .
the position of conference chair has no political significance as it rotates in alphabetical order , but this is the first time iraq has headed the pre-eminent meeting since it first joined , 16 years ago .
talks deadlocked in this session , the body is due to discuss bans on producing nuclear bomb-making material such as highly-enriched uranium .
it will also decide whether a new treaty is needed for covering weapons in space .
negotiations are already in deadlock .
in november 2001 , the us walked out of talks aimed at strengthening the biological weapons convention , claiming iraq was an untrustworthy partner .

during recent tests the largest number of invertebrates , which indicate high water quality , were scooped from the bed of a river in village of llangyndeyrn , carmarthenshire .
it 's not just the cleanliness of the river , the range of habitats available is also important graham rutt , environment agency scientist the river gwendraeth fach was found to be the healthiest in south west wales - and the second best in wales .
the result will now be used in a new official government index of river quality .
graham rutt , ecological appraisal scientist with the environment agency wales , said : " i was quite surprised by the kind of variety we collected .
" this is the highest-ever recorded by the agency in south west wales and is one of the highest reported anywhere in england and wales . "
he added : " such remarkable bio-diversity indicates a good standard of water quality and a variety of natural habitats within the river . "
experts will return to the river in two or three years to keep a check on the water quality .
otters are just one species making a return to rivers there are 290 sites monitored in the south west wales region and teams go out and collect samples for laboratory analysis from a third of them every year .
mr rutt said the return of otters to rivers - as well as dippers - can indicate good river quality .
but he added : " it 's not just the cleanliness of the river , the range of habitats available is also important .
" this site shows a good range of habitats , " said mr rutt whose team found freshwater shrimps , mayflies , stoneflies and caddis living amongst the gravel , stones and plants of the river gwendraeth fach .
he said welsh river quality has improved greatly in the last 20 years due to improved effluent treatment and the decline in heavy industry .

the pomp and circumstance of the house of lords might seem a world away from the gritty realities of politics in northern ireland , but the debate over reforming the lords could have implications for the balance of representation between nationalists and unionists at westminster .
the reason , of course , is that most nationalists are reluctant to accept a title as a british lord .
it smacks too much of patronage .
even thinking about taking an obe has proved a risky business in the past for sdlp councillors .
lord fitt : only nationalist peer from northern ireland when the party 's founding member gerry fitt accepted his peerage graffiti deriding him appeared on the walls of west belfast within 24 hours .
for that reason , lord fitt remains the nearest to a nationalist the house of lords has got - and that 's not very close given the rift between him and his former party .
the majority of the northern ireland peers are ulster unionists , with a smattering of independents , liberal democrats and labour .
the dup , much to their annoyance , do n't have any lords .
given the overwhelming government majority in the commons , the lords is sometimes referred to as the real opposition at westminster .
so , from time to time its deliberations are relevant to the peace process .
this week , for instance , the conservatives hailed an amendment introduced during the third reading of the police bill in the lords as an important government concession .
back burner moreover , the strong unionist and conservative sentiment in the lords has frightened ministers off introducing measures which they fear might be shot down .
the prime example is legislation regarding ' on the run paramilitaries ' .
the government conceded this in principle at weston park .
but it has put it on the back burner , in part because of the fervent opposition it would be likely to face in the house of lords .
baroness blood : favours an elected second chamber to bring the lords closer to the people some local peers - like the shankill community activist baroness blood - favour an elected second chamber in order to bring the lords closer to the people .
others - like the ulster unionist lord laird - argue that creating another elected chamber would cause friction with the commons and could dry up the pool of expertise now available in the lords .
both bemoan the fact that the much derided intake of ' people 's peers ' was n't used to recruit another northern ireland catholic to the upper house .
although tony blair has come down in favour of an appointed second chamber , some local mps believe the most likely option is a hybrid solution .
that would include a mixture of appointed and elected members .
whatever the outcome , remodelling the second chamber could provide a chance for the lack of representation of sections of northern ireland society to be addressed .
sinn fein may still choose to be abstentionist , as they do in the commons .
but if its members are called , say , senators , rather than lords , the whiff of patronage might be removed .
that should make it easier to persuade the broader nationalist community to get involved .

this happy couple found love through a dating agency as many chinese find love through dating agencies , they can find themselves coming into conflict with both communist and traditional values .
fifty years on from mao 's revolution , the role of chinese women has changed enormously and they enjoy levels of freedom undreamed of by their foot-bound ancestors .
but new freedoms and expectations have also led to increased pressures on marriages , and divorce rates are now soaring .
hu yangping : a match-making divorce lawyer hu yangping is a career woman who runs a dating agency , but is also trapped in an unhappy marriage .
her story illustrates the paradoxes and problems that face communist china as it attempts to embrace a changing world of greater individual liberty .
she is married to an officer in the people 's liberation army and , by law , can not divorce a soldier unless he consents .
social stigma yet she also works as a divorce lawyer .
at the china women 's league , hu yangping helps married women who have been the victims of domestic violence , and has handled more than 400 divorce cases .
actually , our clients are ashamed of using a dating agency .
hu yangping but after work she tries to match up more than 250 clients who are on the books of her dating agency , arranging 70 weddings in three and a half years .
none have ended in divorce .
but dating agencies have yet to be fully accepted in chinese society .
" actually , our clients are ashamed of using a dating agency .
they lie about us at their weddings , " said hu yangping .
" they even pretend they 're old sweethearts and we have to keep it secret ! "
second-class citizens many chinese are still wedded to the anachronistic view that women are second-class citizens , child bearers and domestic servants .
he said you 're not living in america , you 're not free , you 're my property mrs gung one of hu yangping 's clients at the women 's league , mrs gung , provides evidence that these attitudes still prevail .
" i ca n't stand it anymore .
i 'm a citizen of the people 's republic of china .
i have the right to leave him , " she said .
" he said you 're not living in america , you 're not free , you 're my property . "
hu yangping often gets angry listening to the way women are treated by their husbands , and can identify with many of their problems .
" being a divorce counsellor makes me reflect on my own marriage , " she said .
hu yangping can not easily divorce her husband " my marriage is n't a happy one .
my husband is hostile to me like i 'm his enemy .
" if i ask him about anything he says i 'm interrogating him but i 'm just showing interest and he tells me nothing .
" my clients regain their freedom i really envy them .
" when a divorce first starts my heart is sad and heavy .
when it 's over , though , i feel overjoyed .
" all their problems have vanished and a wonderful new life awaits them .
ideal marriage " sure they have fighting and tears .
divorce is painful but you eventually get a new life .
" my husband 's in the military so i ca n't divorce him unless he agrees . "
hu yangping eventually found a way to separate from her husband and she remains optimistic about the future .
" i do believe in love at first sight , although i have n't experienced it .
but i can imagine falling for someone who i 've only just met .
" i think in an ideal marriage you grow old together .
i love to imagine an old couple holding hands and walking into the sunset , " she said .

actually , our clients are ashamed of using a dating agency . "
hu yangping but after work she tries to match up more than 250 clients who are on the books of her dating agency , arranging 70 weddings in three and a half years .
none have ended in divorce .
but dating agencies have yet to be fully accepted in chinese society .
" actually , our clients are ashamed of using a dating agency .
they lie about us at their weddings , " said hu yangping .
" they even pretend they 're old sweethearts and we have to keep it secret ! "
second-class citizens many chinese are still wedded to the anachronistic view that women are second-class citizens , child bearers and domestic servants . "
he said you 're not living in america , you 're not free , you 're my property " mrs gung one of hu yangping 's clients at the women 's league , mrs gung , provides evidence that these attitudes still prevail .
" i ca n't stand it anymore .
i 'm a citizen of the people 's republic of china .
i have the right to leave him , " she said .
" he said you 're not living in america , you 're not free , you 're my property . "
hu yangping often gets angry listening to the way women are treated by their husbands , and can identify with many of their problems .
" being a divorce counsellor makes me reflect on my own marriage , " she said .
" my marriage is n't a happy one .
my husband is hostile to me like i 'm his enemy .
" if i ask him about anything he says i 'm interrogating him but i 'm just showing interest and he tells me nothing .
" my clients regain their freedom i really envy them .
" when a divorce first starts my heart is sad and heavy .
when it 's over , though , i feel overjoyed .
" all their problems have vanished and a wonderful new life awaits them .
ideal marriage " sure they have fighting and tears .
divorce is painful but you eventually get a new life .
" my husband 's in the military so i ca n't divorce him unless he agrees . "
hu yangping eventually found a way to separate from her husband and she remains optimistic about the future .
" i do believe in love at first sight , although i have n't experienced it .
but i can imagine falling for someone who i 've only just met .
" i think in an ideal marriage you grow old together .
i love to imagine an old couple holding hands and walking into the sunset , " she said .

a hundred yards further on a group of other boys , a little older , came up with a cheery " hello , how are you ? "
i suppose it was a symbol of what is happening here on a larger scale .
there 's all the official rhetoric about crushing any force that thinks it can invade iraq , about sending american and british troops back in body bags .
in some places , children are being given weapons training then there 's the iraq that insists on its reasonableness in the face of us and british pressure .
there 's one official here who sums up the whole issue of whether iraq does or does not have weapons of mass destruction this way : " you say i have £ 500 in my pocket .
i say i do n't .
you look in my pocket and see it 's empty and yet still you insist that i prove i do n't have the money ! "
the response in washington and london , i imagine , would be : " you 've put it in another pocket " - the claim that chemical and biological weapons have been concealed .
facade of normality as the argument goes round and round , the un inspectors carry on with their daily forays and ordinary iraqis carry on with their lives .
i 've been asked by officials : " does n't everything seem normal ? "
in baghdad 's markets , life seems to continue as normal they 're keen to play down the sense of crisis , feeling that only plays into the hands of the bush administration .
some things do seem decidedly normal .
twice at my hotel i have found myself in the middle of exuberant wedding celebrations .
some of the cars bringing the wedding parties may be pretty rickety , thanks to the impact of sanctions , but they could hardly have been made to look more festive .
but then you get the clues that there is something deceptive about all this , the apparent brushing off of the threat of war .
i went to saddam city on the outskirts of baghdad , home to at least a million people .
many of those who have migrated from rural areas over the years have settled there ; the poor hoping to cash in on baghdad 's boom times of the past .
it began life as a shanty district .
today it 's still common to see horse-drawn carts transporting all sorts of materials .
goats graze along the central reservations of the main roads .
and there are piles of uncleared rubbish outside the businesses , the roadside markets and the homes that seem to stretch away endlessly to the horizon .
preparing for war i called on hussein al-durraji , a retired man who brought his family to the area in the 1970s .
he was already armed , he said , and he had asked the authorities for more weapons for himself and his sons .
we are ready to sacrifice our lives hassan abdullah across the road , i met hassan abdullah and her teenage son in the yard of their breeze block home .
she dreamt of buying a plot so they could build a new and bigger home .
but on her husband 's meagre salary as a government worker , there was no chance of finding the £ 2000 or more it would cost .
she hoped her son would become a doctor or an engineer her daughter a teacher .
but there are more immediate preoccupations .
" we are ready to sacrifice our lives , " hassan said , " but every time we hear about the prospects of war on the news , we die . "
many people are stockpiling supplies ahead of a possible war president saddam hussein has talked this week of preparations for defending the country , of successive trenches to wear down any invading force , of teaching the americans that - in his words - " iraq is n't afghanistan . "
drive the country 's main highways and at the moment you do n't necessarily see much in the way of military movements .
on the road across the desert from jordan , it was a fleet of new dustcarts that caught my attention , not military vehicles .
' in god 's hands ' there were just a few on a journey north to mosul .
this is one of the most historic cities in the middle east , " the city of the prophets " , in an area inhabited as early as 6000 bc .
in recent times it has seen rapid modernisation .
iraq navigator : click here to explore saddam hussein 's iraq for yourself .
now it could find itself in the path of any military advance from turkey or from the kurdish region of northern iraq .
that is something its citizens are only too well aware of .
talking to people in the market , the most common response was that the future lay in god 's hands .
i found a jeweller who was surprisingly buoyant about business .
on yaqdan rafiq 's wall was a fading picture of new york , complete with the world trade center 's twin towers .
he said he kept it there for the memory .
as the americans attempt to make a convincing link between iraq and al-qaeda , i 'd bet that yaqdan 's photograph will get more than a passing glance in the coming weeks .

the bbc 's tom mckinley , in abidjan , says protesters were waving the orange , white and green of the ivorian flag and singing anti-french slogans .
we say no to rebels in our government .
for us it would be like handing over to bandits the keys to your house student leader charles ble goude one group of youths , their faces painted white , carried a coffin on their shoulders labelled with name of french president jacques chirac .
under the power-sharing deal , president gbagbo agreed to cede large powers to a government of national unity , including members of rebel groups .
the ivorian army has refused to accept the deal , saying it will not tolerate rebels in government - especially if those rebels are given key cabinet posts .
our correspondent says that , without the support of his army , it looking increasingly unlikely that the president will be able to implement the deal .
on friday , opponents of the agreement stormed the airport in abidjan to prevent the arrival in ivory coast of the newly-appointed prime minister , seydou diarra .
about 300 french citizens waiting to leave the country were trapped in the airport terminal by stone-throwing crowds and had to be protected by french troops .
mr diarra remained in the senegalese capital , dakar , where west african leaders have been discussing the deal .
they agreed to send mediators to ivory coast on saturday to persuade mr gbagbo to implement the accord .
tight security correspondents say that saturday 's rally , unlike other protests , has been peaceful .
security is tight in abidjan 's plateau district , where the presidency is located .
peace deal president gbagbo remains in power coalition interim government named non-partisan prime minister appointed government prepares fresh elections q & a : why the fighting in ivory coast ?
student leader charles ble goude told national television : " we say no to rebels in our government .
for us , it would be like handing over to bandits the keys to your house . "
a senior official from ghana , which has just taken over the rotating presidency of the 15-nation economic community of west african states -lrb- ecowas -rrb- told the afp news agency that six regional leaders were expected in abidjan by the afternoon .
he said the presidents of ghana , guinea-bissau , mali , niger , nigeria and togo would press mr gbagbo to implement the accord , signed in paris .
the united states has added its voice , with white house spokesman ari fleischer saying the accord " must be implemented without delay to bring an end to the violence " .
the peace deal , agreed in paris a week ago , was meant to end four months of violence by giving key government positions to rebels and mr gbagbo 's political opponents .
however , mr gbagbo 's supporters say the deal is humiliating and limits his powers .
france , the former colonial power in ivory coast , has advised all its non-essential nationals to leave .
it has troops in the country to safeguard about 16,000 french nationals and to police the faltering truce .
one french soldier was seriously hurt in friday 's disturbances .
the conflict has split ivory coast along ethnic and religious lines .

they are not talking about war in every corner of the world .
in sri lanka , they are celebrating peace .
fighting in the long civil war there stopped last february when the two sides signed a ceasefire deal .
now many of the thousands forced to flee their homes are returning to the battle-scarred ruins of jaffna in the north of the island - some intent on rebuilding their lives there .
jaffna 's streets are wide and tree-lined , and it is still possible to imagine what the city was like before the war .
others say they are seizing their chance to visit friends and relations just in case the ongoing peace talks break down and the area is once again sealed off from the outside world .
as we landed in the military airfield just outside jaffna , the excitement inside the plane grew to fever pitch .
in the seats in front of me were three generations of men .
there was an old grandfather clutching a stick between his knees .
beside him , his successful looking son , now a sydney businessman , who pulled out his mobile phone importantly as soon as the plane touched the runway .
and then an eight-year-old grandson , bored and restless until soldiers armed with big rifles came on board the plane to escort us through the military zoned strip to the waiting buses .
cut off for 20 years , during sri lanka 's civil war , jaffna has been virtually cut off from the rest of the world .
as we travelled the 10 kilometres into the once beautiful city , famous for its university and elegant villas , everyone 's faces were pressed against the window .
going past were bombed-out shells of houses , their remaining walls pock-marked with shrapnel ; the signs warning of landmines every few metres and the pathetic strips of paddy painstakingly being cultivated between the rubble .
rubbish heaps scatter the jaffna countryside suddenly the crowd of five daughters , all in their 50s accompanied by their elderly mother , erupted in the seats behind me and started gesticulating animatedly out of the window .
" look , it 's suresh 's school ! " they shouted .
i turned to look too , and saw a large yellow building , open to the sky and with only two walls still standing .
but the woman spoke as if this ghost of a place was still intact and full of children .
skinny goats and cows wander amongst the rubble of the city - in and out of destroyed buildings grazing on the grass growing up through vacant window frames , or foraging amongst the rubbish lying everywhere .
garrison town we saw beautiful villas lying waste , invaded by packs of dogs .
a few are beginning to be restored , with big piles of sand outside gaping doors .
jaffna 's streets are wide and tree-lined , and it is still possible to imagine what the city was like before the war .
but it still remains a garrison town , with armed soldiers walking everywhere , and on most street corners , bunkers made out of sandbags now grown over by grass and flowers .
we went past burning rubbish dumps swarming with big black crows .
the clear waters of the lagoon were spoiled by winding spirals of rusty barbed wire poking up out of the water these bunkers are still occupied , look closely and a pair of watchful eyes and the butt of a rifle stare back at you through a narrow slit in the bags .
the streets are full of bicycles and pedestrians , and only a few vans endemic to the rest of the country thunder past .
jaffna 's taxi rank of dusty old morris oxfords stands in the middle of the main boulevard outside the hospital - but no-one ever seems to hire them and they sit idle in the scorching sun .
we found these cars also do n't leave the city , and so to explore the rest of the peninsula we were forced to hire one of the few vans available .
dangerous transport as we bumped and wheezed out of jaffna , we discovered that we 'd managed to hire the most clapped-out of all jaffna 's clapped-out vans .
none of the benches of seats were secured to the floor , which meant everyone was suspended 20 centimetres above the floor as we flew over bumps .
women tamil tiger soldiers wear their hair in their own distinctive fashion i could n't work out why this van was so breezy for the first few minutes - unusually good ventilation perhaps - until i realised that the vehicle had no sliding side door , instead a gaping hole onto the dusty track running by .
all the children with us were immediately dispatched to the back seat and bags jammed up against the side to prevent any fatal exploration of the doorless van .
the road to the famous casurina beach - still listed on the maps as one of sri lanka 's most beautiful beaches - was a thin strip of sand leading across lakes and lagoons .
we went past burning rubbish dumps swarming with big black crows .
the clear waters of the lagoon were spoiled by winding spirals of rusty barbed wire poking up out of the water .
but where humans have suffered , bird life has profited .
the lagoon is stuffed with all kinds of wading birds - flocks of flamingos stand in the middle distance , cormorants perch on the barbed wire , black wings outstretched sunning themselves , a huge heron waited on a concrete slab next to the road watching our van go by .
everything is silent , hard to imagine the calm water boiling and crashing with shells and gunfire only a year ago .
delight at tourists we were stopped at five or six checkpoints on the way to the beach , guarded by bored sri lankan soldiers , mostly women , who leapt up in delight as we slowed down , enjoying the chance to while away a few minutes of the day pinching a baby 's squishy cheeks and surveying this new breed in jaffna - the european tourist .
2002 's ceasefire agreement ended 20 years of civil war when we arrived at the beach it was long and flat and covered with rubbish and barbed wire .
a restoration job is needed to reclaim its title as a famous beauty-spot .
it was a sunday , and so in common with beaches all over sri lanka , filled with young men drinking beer , having a barbecue and throwing each other exuberantly into the water .
a reassuringly familiar sight after so much destruction .
coming back into the city , the wind got up , and the obvious defects of the doorless van revealed themselves as sand and dust blew into our faces .
tamil tiger coiffure on the way , our driver pointed out two girls riding ahead of us on bicycles on the narrow causeway - both with two long plaits pinned and coiled around the sides of their heads .
they had thick black belts tightly cinched around their waists .
" tamil tiger soldiers , " the driver said .
" they all wear their hair like that as a sign " .
one was pedalling with a false leg , and as we overtook when the causeway widened , she turned to stare in at us defiantly , her prematurely-aged face lined and scarred .
later that afternoon , back in jaffna , i walked through the deserted streets to find the new library which has been rebuilt since the ceasefire .
on my way , on a patch of wasteland i saw the remains of what must have been an imposing large grey building .
in the middle an arch still stood intact , proclaiming itself as the regal cinema .
cows were grazing in what must have once been the auditorium .
its date of destruction was curiously preserved as faint letters underneath the arch still spelt out the legends of kirk douglas and anthony quinn - perhaps some hollywood extravaganza like spartacus was playing as the bombs fell .
i turned to see a jaffna returnee staring with me as well - immediately recognisable by his western shoes and clothes and his eagerness to talk to me .
he used to come to the regal every week , he said , listing some of the films he 'd watched there .
then he turned back , lost in his thoughts , surveying the ruins of his jaffna childhood .

jaffna 's streets are wide and tree-lined , and it is still possible to imagine what the city was like before the war . "
others say they are seizing their chance to visit friends and relations just in case the ongoing peace talks break down and the area is once again sealed off from the outside world .
as we landed in the military airfield just outside jaffna , the excitement inside the plane grew to fever pitch .
in the seats in front of me were three generations of men .
there was an old grandfather clutching a stick between his knees .
beside him , his successful looking son , now a sydney businessman , who pulled out his mobile phone importantly as soon as the plane touched the runway .
and then an eight-year-old grandson , bored and restless until soldiers armed with big rifles came on board the plane to escort us through the military zoned strip to the waiting buses .
cut off for 20 years , during sri lanka 's civil war , jaffna has been virtually cut off from the rest of the world .
as we travelled the 10 kilometres into the once beautiful city , famous for its university and elegant villas , everyone 's faces were pressed against the window .
going past were bombed-out shells of houses , their remaining walls pock-marked with shrapnel ; the signs warning of landmines every few metres and the pathetic strips of paddy painstakingly being cultivated between the rubble .
suddenly the crowd of five daughters , all in their 50s accompanied by their elderly mother , erupted in the seats behind me and started gesticulating animatedly out of the window .
" look , it 's suresh 's school ! " they shouted .
i turned to look too , and saw a large yellow building , open to the sky and with only two walls still standing .
but the woman spoke as if this ghost of a place was still intact and full of children .
skinny goats and cows wander amongst the rubble of the city - in and out of destroyed buildings grazing on the grass growing up through vacant window frames , or foraging amongst the rubbish lying everywhere .
garrison town we saw beautiful villas lying waste , invaded by packs of dogs .
a few are beginning to be restored , with big piles of sand outside gaping doors .
jaffna 's streets are wide and tree-lined , and it is still possible to imagine what the city was like before the war .
but it still remains a garrison town , with armed soldiers walking everywhere , and on most street corners , bunkers made out of sandbags now grown over by grass and flowers . "
we went past burning rubbish dumps swarming with big black crows .
the clear waters of the lagoon were spoiled by winding spirals of rusty barbed wire poking up out of the water " these bunkers are still occupied , look closely and a pair of watchful eyes and the butt of a rifle stare back at you through a narrow slit in the bags .
the streets are full of bicycles and pedestrians , and only a few vans endemic to the rest of the country thunder past .
jaffna 's taxi rank of dusty old morris oxfords stands in the middle of the main boulevard outside the hospital - but no-one ever seems to hire them and they sit idle in the scorching sun .
we found these cars also do n't leave the city , and so to explore the rest of the peninsula we were forced to hire one of the few vans available .
dangerous transport as we bumped and wheezed out of jaffna , we discovered that we 'd managed to hire the most clapped-out of all jaffna 's clapped-out vans .
none of the benches of seats were secured to the floor , which meant everyone was suspended 20 centimetres above the floor as we flew over bumps .
i could n't work out why this van was so breezy for the first few minutes - unusually good ventilation perhaps - until i realised that the vehicle had no sliding side door , instead a gaping hole onto the dusty track running by .
all the children with us were immediately dispatched to the back seat and bags jammed up against the side to prevent any fatal exploration of the doorless van .
the road to the famous casurina beach - still listed on the maps as one of sri lanka 's most beautiful beaches - was a thin strip of sand leading across lakes and lagoons .
we went past burning rubbish dumps swarming with big black crows .
the clear waters of the lagoon were spoiled by winding spirals of rusty barbed wire poking up out of the water .
but where humans have suffered , bird life has profited .
the lagoon is stuffed with all kinds of wading birds - flocks of flamingos stand in the middle distance , cormorants perch on the barbed wire , black wings outstretched sunning themselves , a huge heron waited on a concrete slab next to the road watching our van go by .
everything is silent , hard to imagine the calm water boiling and crashing with shells and gunfire only a year ago .
delight at tourists we were stopped at five or six checkpoints on the way to the beach , guarded by bored sri lankan soldiers , mostly women , who leapt up in delight as we slowed down , enjoying the chance to while away a few minutes of the day pinching a baby 's squishy cheeks and surveying this new breed in jaffna - the european tourist .
when we arrived at the beach it was long and flat and covered with rubbish and barbed wire .
a restoration job is needed to reclaim its title as a famous beauty-spot .
it was a sunday , and so in common with beaches all over sri lanka , filled with young men drinking beer , having a barbecue and throwing each other exuberantly into the water .
a reassuringly familiar sight after so much destruction .
coming back into the city , the wind got up , and the obvious defects of the doorless van revealed themselves as sand and dust blew into our faces .
tamil tiger coiffure on the way , our driver pointed out two girls riding ahead of us on bicycles on the narrow causeway - both with two long plaits pinned and coiled around the sides of their heads .
they had thick black belts tightly cinched around their waists .
" tamil tiger soldiers , " the driver said .
" they all wear their hair like that as a sign " .
one was pedalling with a false leg , and as we overtook when the causeway widened , she turned to stare in at us defiantly , her prematurely-aged face lined and scarred .
later that afternoon , back in jaffna , i walked through the deserted streets to find the new library which has been rebuilt since the ceasefire .
on my way , on a patch of wasteland i saw the remains of what must have been an imposing large grey building .
in the middle an arch still stood intact , proclaiming itself as the regal cinema .
cows were grazing in what must have once been the auditorium .
its date of destruction was curiously preserved as faint letters underneath the arch still spelt out the legends of kirk douglas and anthony quinn - perhaps some hollywood extravaganza like spartacus was playing as the bombs fell .
i turned to see a jaffna returnee staring with me as well - immediately recognisable by his western shoes and clothes and his eagerness to talk to me .
he used to come to the regal every week , he said , listing some of the films he 'd watched there .
then he turned back , lost in his thoughts , surveying the ruins of his jaffna childhood .

the image was taken when the baby was just nine weeks and six days and measured just 2.9 millimetres long .
his wife helen , 33 , is due to give birth in august .
mr thatcher from the thornhill area of the city said : " i think it is only fitting to a promotion winning side to name my soon to be born son after the entire current team . "
" i 've decided that the first name should be sam lennie after the owner sam hammam and the manager lennie lawrence .
" and if it turns out to be a girl we can call her samantha .
he will be a city fan there is no question about that steve thatcher , dad-to-be " then the middle names are neil , rhys , gary , scott , danny , william , andy , graham , jason , peter and robert .
" and the surname will be double barrelled , hammam-thatcher .
" of course he may drop them later on in his life but he will be a city fan there is no question about that .
" he is going to have to be a bluebird , " he said .
mr thatcher said his wife was happy with his choice of names but added that he would have to rethink them if the baby was a girl .
" i have taken my wife to many games and every game we have won , so she is quite happy about it , " he said .
but mrs thatcher said : " if our first born is a boy i think i 'll have to sit steve down and try and knock some sense into him .
" but secretly i 'm just praying we have a girl , " she added .

fans snapped up 40,000 tickets for the rapper 's glasgow gig in just 40 minutes when they went on sale at 0900 gmt on saturday .
promoters said it was a record for scottish ticket sales .
tickets for the only other uk venue in the hip hop star 's anger management tour , at milton keynes bowl on 21 june , sold out just as quickly .
eminem played in glasgow in 2001 now another date has been added to cope with demand .
the show at glasgow 's hampden park on 24 june is the only one in scotland .
eminem 's third album , the eminem show , has sold more than 13 million copies .
his movie debut in 8 mile has been highly acclaimed , but he has previously been a controversial figure .
during his last british shows in 2001 he was criticised for pretending to take pills on stage .
geoff ellis , the chief executive of promoters df concerts , said the rate at which tickets had sold was " phenomenal " .
he said : " with the success of 8 mile it has turned out to be a really perfect time to go on sale , and it 's a record for scotland as the fastest-selling show ever . "
internet rush mr ellis said he was not worried eminem would court controversy when he comes to scotland for the gig .
he said : " not at all .
the thing is he 's a rock and roll star and if people have n't got a bit of controversy they 're viewed as a bit boring .
" but i 'm not concerned about anything in that respect .
he is an utmost professional and he 's a great live artist and i ca n't wait to see him . "
tickets for the shows - presented by bbc radio 1 - went on sale over the counter at ticket agencies , record stores and on the web .
in total 65 % of the scottish tickets were sold over the internet and half of the tickets for the glasgow gig were snapped up within the first 15 minutes .
