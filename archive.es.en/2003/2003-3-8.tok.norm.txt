faithful friend : and a potential risk the pet travel scheme -lrb- pets -rrb- allows owners of companion animals to take them in and out of britain .
but animals coming from exotic disease areas abroad are now bringing new problems with them .
veterinary surgeons say more checks are needed to see what risk they represent .
they report their concerns in the veterinary record , the journal of the british veterinary association -lrb- bva -rrb- .
a team of uk and french vets analysed diagnostic data from imported animals which were found to be sick between april 2001 and july 2002 .
they also reviewed data from animals quarantined during that time -lrb- quarantine is obligatory for animals from countries not included in the pets scheme -rrb- .
the team tested samples from 67 dogs and three cats , most of which had entered the uk under pets : 14 of the dogs and one cat had been in quarantine .
high infection incidence blood samples were tested for three exotic diseases : babesiosis , leishmaniasis and ehrlichiosis .
the first dog with his own passport babesiosis is a severe tick-borne disease caused by various types of babesia , a microscopic parasite that infects red blood cells .
in humans it is rare , but potentially fatal .
babesiosis is a common infection in animals .
leishmaniasis is a potentially contagious disease in dogs and cats .
it is caused by a parasite transmitted by sandflies .
it can affect humans , but most people are unlikely to become ill .
ehrlichiosis , another tick-borne disease affecting dogs , can cause anaemia , decreased resistance to disease , infection and abnormal bleeding .
none of the cats showed signs of any of the diseases , but of the dogs 17 of the 53 that had entered under pets and seven of the 14 that entered the uk through quarantine had one or more of the three pathogens .
babesiosis was the most commonly diagnosed illness , and a total of ten dogs was confirmed with one of two strains of the disease .
several dogs showed evidence of more than one pathogen .
threat from elsewhere five had travelled from france under pets , two more under pets from thailand through germany and from japan , and three had been quarantined , two from hong kong and one from south africa .
the study found no infected cats five of the six dogs with ehrlichiosis had come from countries not included in the pets scheme .
of the dogs with leishmaniasis , four had travelled from spain : the vets say this probably underestimates the number of infected animals entering the uk under pets .
they say their findings " indicate the significance of these infections as a health and welfare issue for both the animals and their owners .
knowledge gap " should introduction of the appropriate vectors occur or alternative methods of transmission evolve , there is risk of extension of disease into dog , cat , human or wildlife populations which have not travelled .
" larger targeted surveillance schemes are required to further evaluate and monitor the risk involved . "
the pets scheme was introduced in february 2000 .
it allows animals from an approved list of countries to avoid undergoing six-month quarantine periods .
it applies at the moment to animals travelling from most of europe , from north america and from a number of long-haul rabies-free countries .

charges were dropped on thursday against a 31-year-old british skier who collided with another skier on a resort in denver colorado .
the authorities found the accident , which resulted in the death of the other skier , american robert henrichs , was not caused by any criminal act .
the slopes are becoming ever more crowded but the incident highlights how much skiing authorities are trying to ensure that people do not ski or snowboard out of control and possibly endanger others on the slopes .
the excellent snow conditions throughout the alps and the pyrenees this season have led to crowded slopes and a rise in collisions .
trial scheme in north america the resorts are much tougher on dangerous skiing with patrollers on the slopes and speed limits imposed in places .
even so 13 people have died as a result of collisions this season in colorado alone .
in europe , andorra , a principality between france and spain , is leading the way in safety on the pistes as all its resorts now have patrollers who look out for dangerous skiers .
in most cases they warn them to slow down and stay in control , but in extreme cases they can confiscate people 's lift passes and ban them from the slopes .
last year four people died , this season there has only been one death .
" our trial scheme is working very well " , marta rotes , director of ski andorra , told bbc news online .
" it has been accepted by skiers and boarders and so far it seems to have reduced injuries " .
this season in chamonix , france , an out of control skier went over the front of my skis and nearly knocked me over .
the next day someone skied into my six-year-old daughter and sent her tumbling .
he did not even stop to see if she was ok or to apologise .
' no firm rules ' most resorts now advise children to wear helmets for protection .
" the rules are very simple , " says vanessa fisher , from the ski club of great britain .
" skiers and boarders have to give way to people beneath them on a slope and ski with care and attention for other snow users . "
luggen : resorts must be aware of potential for accidents however , across the alps there are no firm rules for enforcement .
val d 'isere in france has some so-called " piste policemen " but they are few and far between .
the swiss resort of zermatt has given lift attendants and ski patrollers the authority to confiscate people 's passes if they ski out of control .
while cervinia in italy has a number of policemen on the slopes to stop skiers going too fast and will arrest them if they think they are endangering safety .
" we do not want to curtail people 's freedom on the mountains , " says daniel luggen , the marketing manager of zermatt in switzerland .
" at the moment we do not have a big problem with collisions on the slopes , but it is certainly something all ski resorts must watch carefully . "
whatever the measures put in place by the resorts , there is a growing body of opinion that believes more must now be done to prevent injuries , and even deaths , on the slopes as a small minority ski too fast and out of control .

fire extinguishers and solid oak floors were damaged in the raid at ceiriog memorial institute in glyn ceiriog near chirk .
trustees are trying to raise £ 300,000 to renovate the museum which was built in 1911 .
the majority of artefacts are in safekeeping at wrexham library .
treasurer frank jones said the money that would now have to be spent on repairs was earmarked for use elsewhere .
" we have n't got the money to spend on this sort of thing because we need every penny we 've got to refurbish the institute , " he said .
frank jones : the museum needs redeveloping " they broke in and they let off all the fire extinguishers - you can still see the white on the back of the stage .
" the oak floor , which is a lovely floor , was virtually stripped and we 're going to have to re-do it and polish it .
" they 've left fingerprints behind so the police are quite confident that they will get them . "
mr jones said the museum is well known throughout wales .
great poets " the institute 's been a very important part of welsh history over the years but now the national museum has superseded it , " he added .
" we 've got a bust here of one of the founders of orthopaedic surgery who lived in the valley .
" the college of surgeons in london has offered us no end of money for that , but we wo n't part with it .
" we do have things that are worth an awful lot of money .
repair work " we have got artefacts belonging to ceiriog hughes the poet here and many , many other things .
" the stained glass windows here commemorate the three great poets of the ceiriog valley and some of the books here are priceless , " he said .
the 90-year-old building is built from glyn ceiriog slate and mr jones said it is in desperate need of repair .
" the guttering needs doing , the walls are bowing out and need straightening and strengthening , the roof needs looking at too . "
the local community hope the new museum will open in 2005 .
