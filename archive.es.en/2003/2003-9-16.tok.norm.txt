a spokesman for the potsdam public prosecution , which announced that preliminary proceedings launched in april 2003 against a number of swiss and russian nationals on charges of receiving stolen goods , has revealed that the original painting is most likely in moscow .
russian authorities have been requested to confiscate the painting .

customers at a store in bremen were more than willing to do so , and hardly anyone questioned the company 's ethics , much to the dismay of the organizers . nestled inconspicuously between boutiques and snackbars in downtown bremen is a new store called " chromosoma . "
the shop with its ultra-cool interior opened just recently and promises to offer its customers something they wo n't get at a run-of-the-mill department store , namely , the possibility for a complete genetic make-over .
curious passers-by who venture inside the shop can explore a range of six products and services such as " book-a-baby , " which allows women to choose precisely when they wish to start a pregnancy , as well as selecting their baby 's genetic traits , and " re-set , " which offers customers the opportunity to store their genetic information with a view to human cloning .
the store also provides a service it calls " gen-ex , " which destroys human genetic footprints – the skin particles , hair and saliva that contain someone 's entire genetic code .
the product is designed to prevent involuntary assessment and storage of genetic material - information which could conceivably be misused by employers and insurance companies , for example .
sound a little dubious or ethically questionable to offer genetic designing to the paying public ?
well , that 's the point of the world 's first dna store .
simulating reality ?
chromosoma is in fact not a shop at all , but rather a " field-study " project organized by the bundeszentrale für politische bildung , or federal center for political education , in the run-up to its congress on genetic research from 15 – 17 september in bremen .
two years in the making , the 10-day long initiative was managed by leipzig-based artist alf thum , who posed as " chromosoma " ceo hans jürgen sternburg . his mission was to take genetic research out of the science laboratories and into the public eye , drawing people 's attention to the fact that the future is upon us – and gene technology and its applications are topics of immediate relevance to everyone .
by opening up the gene-shop and simulating reality , visitors to chromosoma were afforded a glimpse of a brave new world where gene technology is already so advanced that consumer genetics are simply part and parcel of everyday life .
so far the reality is a far cry from the type of products outlined in the chromosoma catalogue .
for now , many of the products displayed in the bremen store clash with current legislation , such as stringent embryo protection laws .
postive public resonance but florian feigl , who helped organize the venture , told dw-world that few of the weekend-shoppers who looked in on the opening-day asked probing questions .
staff at " chromosoma " discovered that their - hypothetical - products were surprisingly well-received by the unsuspecting public .
visitors took a keen interest in the services outlined and expressed immediate willingness to try out the " starter packs " handed out by friendly assistants along with complimentary glasses of sparkling wine .
florian feigl said the team observed that describing the products in aspirational , lifestyle terms meant that customers were quick to accept their often controversial premises .
implications of gene technology the situation , however , is much different when experts get involved .
and following on the footsteps of the dna shop , scientists , educators and politicians will descend on bremen for a three day conference entitled " good genes , bad genes – gene technology , gene research and consumer genetics . "

want to design a baby or take a peek into your genetic future ?
customers at a store in bremen were more than willing to do so , and hardly anyone questioned the company 's ethics , much to the dismay of the organizers . nestled inconspicuously between boutiques and snackbars in downtown bremen is a new store called " chromosoma . "
the shop with its ultra-cool interior opened just recently and promises to offer its customers something they wo n't get at a run-of-the-mill department store , namely , the possibility for a complete genetic make-over .
curious passers-by who venture inside the shop can explore a range of six products and services such as " book-a-baby , " which allows women to choose precisely when they wish to start a pregnancy , as well as selecting their baby 's genetic traits , and " re-set , " which offers customers the opportunity to store their genetic information with a view to human cloning .
the store also provides a service it calls " gen-ex , " which destroys human genetic footprints – the skin particles , hair and saliva that contain someone 's entire genetic code .
the product is designed to prevent involuntary assessment and storage of genetic material - information which could conceivably be misused by employers and insurance companies , for example .
sound a little dubious or ethically questionable to offer genetic designing to the paying public ?
well , that 's the point of the world 's first dna store .
simulating reality ?
chromosoma is in fact not a shop at all , but rather a " field-study " project organized by the bundeszentrale für politische bildung , or federal center for political education , in the run-up to its congress on genetic research from 15 – 17 september in bremen .
two years in the making , the 10-day long initiative was managed by leipzig-based artist alf thum , who posed as " chromosoma " ceo hans jürgen sternburg . his mission was to take genetic research out of the science laboratories and into the public eye , drawing people 's attention to the fact that the future is upon us – and gene technology and its applications are topics of immediate relevance to everyone .
by opening up the gene-shop and simulating reality , visitors to chromosoma were afforded a glimpse of a brave new world where gene technology is already so advanced that consumer genetics are simply part and parcel of everyday life .
so far the reality is a far cry from the type of products outlined in the chromosoma catalogue .
for now , many of the products displayed in the bremen store clash with current legislation , such as stringent embryo protection laws .
postive public resonance but florian feigl , who helped organize the venture , told dw-world that few of the weekend-shoppers who looked in on the opening-day asked probing questions .
staff at " chromosoma " discovered that their - hypothetical - products were surprisingly well-received by the unsuspecting public .
visitors took a keen interest in the services outlined and expressed immediate willingness to try out the " starter packs " handed out by friendly assistants along with complimentary glasses of sparkling wine .
florian feigl said the team observed that describing the products in aspirational , lifestyle terms meant that customers were quick to accept their often controversial premises .
implications of gene technology the situation , however , is much different when experts get involved .
and following on the footsteps of the dna shop , scientists , educators and politicians will descend on bremen for a three day conference entitled " good genes , bad genes – gene technology , gene research and consumer genetics . "
the chromosoma scenario will certainly figure highly in their discussions , especially as it sheds new light on the public 's acceptance of genetic designing and the need for broader awareness campaigns . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links chromosoma project description and mission of the field project by alf thum .

german mailorder giant quelle is now offering the car at discounted prices online , but the offer has run afoul of car dealers and even volkswagen itself . hoping the car 's reputation will be enough to prompt customers to risk ' sold-as-seen ' purchases , quelle began offering volkswagen ’ s new golf v model on its internet site on monday .
to spark interest , quelle is selling the car for around ten percent less than the average golf sticker price , a move which has incensed vw dealers across the country . volkwagen , too , is not amused and europe ’ s largest carmaker has said it will refuse to provide the mail-order outfit with any vehicles since it would violate agreements it has with dealers . “ we aren ’ t going to deliver any cars to quelle , ” vw spokesman dirk große-leege said , explaining vw dealers are not allowed to re-sell new cars to unauthorized dealers .
“ maybe if quelle is only acting as middleman for new car sales would it be legally acceptable . ” quelle says that is exactly what it is doing and that it will only facilitate the sale of a new golf between customer and an auto dealer with which it has an agreement .
the company has set up a partnership with bavarian firm carplus to act as intermediary with around a dozen authorized dealers . “ it ’ s correct that vw dealers are not allowed to sell vehicles directly to us , ” carplus manager heiko eich told the reuters news agency .
“ and they aren ’ t . ” dealers angry the volkswagen dealer ’ s association has slammed the quelle offer as “ not serious , ” and vw ’ s große-leege dismissed it as largely a pr event , aiming to piggyback on the expected success of the completely revamped golf .
the car , which will be available nationwide starting october 17 , has long been one of the best selling models in germany . quelle ’ s initiative has particularly scared dealers since they have only recently renegotiated contracts with vw that have already squeezed their profit margins .
carplus ’ eich admitted the bulk of the discount passed on to quelle ’ s customers , there would be little left over for the participating dealers , who then would hope to make up the losses with high volume sales . a quelle spokesman said the company wanted to sell between 3,000 and 4,000 cars a month within two years time .
with the popular golf making up a large chunk of total vw sales , other dealers fear seeing their overall sales dented . german car dealers , already angered by a european commission decision last year setting new rules making it easier to set up dealerships at unconventional places like supermarkets , also likely see quelle ’ s internet promotion as another attack on the traditional system of car dealerships . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de volkswagen pins revival hopes on new golf volkswagen unveiled the fifth-generation golf on monday in a dramatic display of lights , mist and optimistic sales forecasts .

interior minister schily hopes an appeals court will allow deportation if he obtains assurances from turkey that kaplan would receive a fair trial and torture would not be employed to extract confessions . last week he strongly criticized the düsseldorf court 's ruling that prohibited kaplan 's deportation , saying the decision was wrong because it was based on the assumption that turkey uses torture to obtain confessions .
schily referred to the fact that turkey has ratified the european human rights convention that prohibits torture . a cologne court rescinded kaplan 's status as a political asylum seeker in late august , but prohibited the german authorities from deporting the man . cologne caliphate kaplan was the leader of the islamic organization " caliphate state . "
schily banned the group , which had been suspected of spreading anti-semitic and anti-american propaganda within germany 's islamic community , in august 2002 . after another " caliph " established himself in berlin in 1996 , kaplan told his organization 's members the man 's " head should be cut off .

care to buy a brand new vw golf via the internet ?
german mailorder giant quelle is now offering the car at discounted prices online , but the offer has run afoul of car dealers and even volkswagen itself . hoping the car 's reputation will be enough to prompt customers to risk ' sold-as-seen ' purchases , quelle began offering volkswagen ’ s new golf v model on its internet site on monday .
to spark interest , quelle is selling the car for around ten percent less than the average golf sticker price , a move which has incensed vw dealers across the country . volkwagen , too , is not amused and europe ’ s largest carmaker has said it will refuse to provide the mail-order outfit with any vehicles since it would violate agreements it has with dealers . “ we aren ’ t going to deliver any cars to quelle , ” vw spokesman dirk große-leege said , explaining vw dealers are not allowed to re-sell new cars to unauthorized dealers .
“ maybe if quelle is only acting as middleman for new car sales would it be legally acceptable . ” quelle says that is exactly what it is doing and that it will only facilitate the sale of a new golf between customer and an auto dealer with which it has an agreement .
the company has set up a partnership with bavarian firm carplus to act as intermediary with around a dozen authorized dealers . “ it ’ s correct that vw dealers are not allowed to sell vehicles directly to us , ” carplus manager heiko eich told the reuters news agency .
“ and they aren ’ t . ” dealers angry the volkswagen dealer ’ s association has slammed the quelle offer as “ not serious , ” and vw ’ s große-leege dismissed it as largely a pr event , aiming to piggyback on the expected success of the completely revamped golf .
the car , which will be available nationwide starting october 17 , has long been one of the best selling models in germany . quelle ’ s initiative has particularly scared dealers since they have only recently renegotiated contracts with vw that have already squeezed their profit margins .
carplus ’ eich admitted the bulk of the discount passed on to quelle ’ s customers , there would be little left over for the participating dealers , who then would hope to make up the losses with high volume sales . a quelle spokesman said the company wanted to sell between 3,000 and 4,000 cars a month within two years time .
with the popular golf making up a large chunk of total vw sales , other dealers fear seeing their overall sales dented . german car dealers , already angered by a european commission decision last year setting new rules making it easier to set up dealerships at unconventional places like supermarkets , also likely see quelle ’ s internet promotion as another attack on the traditional system of car dealerships . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de volkswagen pins revival hopes on new golf volkswagen unveiled the fifth-generation golf on monday in a dramatic display of lights , mist and optimistic sales forecasts .

want to design a baby or take a peek into your genetic future ?
customers at a store in bremen were more than willing to do so , and hardly anyone questioned the company 's ethics , much to the dismay of the organizers . nestled inconspicuously between boutiques and snackbars in downtown bremen is a new store called " chromosoma . "
the shop with its ultra-cool interior opened just recently and promises to offer its customers something they wo n't get at a run-of-the-mill department store , namely , the possibility for a complete genetic make-over .
curious passers-by who venture inside the shop can explore a range of six products and services such as " book-a-baby , " which allows women to choose precisely when they wish to start a pregnancy , as well as selecting their baby 's genetic traits , and " re-set , " which offers customers the opportunity to store their genetic information with a view to human cloning .
the store also provides a service it calls " gen-ex , " which destroys human genetic footprints – the skin particles , hair and saliva that contain someone 's entire genetic code .
the product is designed to prevent involuntary assessment and storage of genetic material - information which could conceivably be misused by employers and insurance companies , for example .
sound a little dubious or ethically questionable to offer genetic designing to the paying public ?
well , that 's the point of the world 's first dna store .

chromosoma is in fact not a shop at all , but rather a " field-study " project organized by the bundeszentrale für politische bildung , or federal center for political education , in the run-up to its congress on genetic research from 15 – 17 september in bremen .
two years in the making , the 10-day long initiative was managed by leipzig-based artist alf thum , who posed as " chromosoma " ceo hans jürgen sternburg . his mission was to take genetic research out of the science laboratories and into the public eye , drawing people 's attention to the fact that the future is upon us – and gene technology and its applications are topics of immediate relevance to everyone .
by opening up the gene-shop and simulating reality , visitors to chromosoma were afforded a glimpse of a brave new world where gene technology is already so advanced that consumer genetics are simply part and parcel of everyday life .
so far the reality is a far cry from the type of products outlined in the chromosoma catalogue .
for now , many of the products displayed in the bremen store clash with current legislation , such as stringent embryo protection laws .
postive public resonance but florian feigl , who helped organize the venture , told dw-world that few of the weekend-shoppers who looked in on the opening-day asked probing questions .
staff at " chromosoma " discovered that their - hypothetical - products were surprisingly well-received by the unsuspecting public .
visitors took a keen interest in the services outlined and expressed immediate willingness to try out the " starter packs " handed out by friendly assistants along with complimentary glasses of sparkling wine .
florian feigl said the team observed that describing the products in aspirational , lifestyle terms meant that customers were quick to accept their often controversial premises .
implications of gene technology the situation , however , is much different when experts get involved .
and following on the footsteps of the dna shop , scientists , educators and politicians will descend on bremen for a three day conference entitled " good genes , bad genes – gene technology , gene research and consumer genetics . "

by opening up the gene-shop and simulating reality , visitors to chromosoma were afforded a glimpse of a brave new world where gene technology is already so advanced that consumer genetics are simply part and parcel of everyday life .
so far the reality is a far cry from the type of products outlined in the chromosoma catalogue .
for now , many of the products displayed in the bremen store clash with current legislation , such as stringent embryo protection laws .
postive public resonance but florian feigl , who helped organize the venture , told dw-world that few of the weekend-shoppers who looked in on the opening-day asked probing questions .
staff at " chromosoma " discovered that their - hypothetical - products were surprisingly well-received by the unsuspecting public .
visitors took a keen interest in the services outlined and expressed immediate willingness to try out the " starter packs " handed out by friendly assistants along with complimentary glasses of sparkling wine .
florian feigl said the team observed that describing the products in aspirational , lifestyle terms meant that customers were quick to accept their often controversial premises .
implications of gene technology the situation , however , is much different when experts get involved .
and following on the footsteps of the dna shop , scientists , educators and politicians will descend on bremen for a three day conference entitled " good genes , bad genes – gene technology , gene research and consumer genetics . "
the chromosoma scenario will certainly figure highly in their discussions , especially as it sheds new light on the public 's acceptance of genetic designing and the need for broader awareness campaigns . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links chromosoma project description and mission of the field project by alf thum .

german mailorder giant quelle is now offering the car at discounted prices online , but the offer has run afoul of car dealers and even volkswagen itself . hoping the car 's reputation will be enough to prompt customers to risk ' sold-as-seen ' purchases , quelle began offering volkswagen ’ s new golf v model on its internet site on monday .
to spark interest , quelle is selling the car for around ten percent less than the average golf sticker price , a move which has incensed vw dealers across the country . volkwagen , too , is not amused and europe ’ s largest carmaker has said it will refuse to provide the mail-order outfit with any vehicles since it would violate agreements it has with dealers . “ we aren ’ t going to deliver any cars to quelle , ” vw spokesman dirk große-leege said , explaining vw dealers are not allowed to re-sell new cars to unauthorized dealers .

want to design a baby or take a peek into your genetic future ?
customers at a store in bremen were more than willing to do so , and hardly anyone questioned the company 's ethics , much to the dismay of the organizers . nestled inconspicuously between boutiques and snackbars in downtown bremen is a new store called " chromosoma . "
the shop with its ultra-cool interior opened just recently and promises to offer its customers something they wo n't get at a run-of-the-mill department store , namely , the possibility for a complete genetic make-over .
curious passers-by who venture inside the shop can explore a range of six products and services such as " book-a-baby , " which allows women to choose precisely when they wish to start a pregnancy , as well as selecting their baby 's genetic traits , and " re-set , " which offers customers the opportunity to store their genetic information with a view to human cloning .
the store also provides a service it calls " gen-ex , " which destroys human genetic footprints – the skin particles , hair and saliva that contain someone 's entire genetic code .
the product is designed to prevent involuntary assessment and storage of genetic material - information which could conceivably be misused by employers and insurance companies , for example .
sound a little dubious or ethically questionable to offer genetic designing to the paying public ?
well , that 's the point of the world 's first dna store .
simulating reality ?
chromosoma is in fact not a shop at all , but rather a " field-study " project organized by the bundeszentrale für politische bildung , or federal center for political education , in the run-up to its congress on genetic research from 15 – 17 september in bremen .
two years in the making , the 10-day long initiative was managed by leipzig-based artist alf thum , who posed as " chromosoma " ceo hans jürgen sternburg . his mission was to take genetic research out of the science laboratories and into the public eye , drawing people 's attention to the fact that the future is upon us – and gene technology and its applications are topics of immediate relevance to everyone .
by opening up the gene-shop and simulating reality , visitors to chromosoma were afforded a glimpse of a brave new world where gene technology is already so advanced that consumer genetics are simply part and parcel of everyday life .
so far the reality is a far cry from the type of products outlined in the chromosoma catalogue .
for now , many of the products displayed in the bremen store clash with current legislation , such as stringent embryo protection laws .
postive public resonance but florian feigl , who helped organize the venture , told dw-world that few of the weekend-shoppers who looked in on the opening-day asked probing questions .
staff at " chromosoma " discovered that their - hypothetical - products were surprisingly well-received by the unsuspecting public .
visitors took a keen interest in the services outlined and expressed immediate willingness to try out the " starter packs " handed out by friendly assistants along with complimentary glasses of sparkling wine .
florian feigl said the team observed that describing the products in aspirational , lifestyle terms meant that customers were quick to accept their often controversial premises .
implications of gene technology the situation , however , is much different when experts get involved .
and following on the footsteps of the dna shop , scientists , educators and politicians will descend on bremen for a three day conference entitled " good genes , bad genes – gene technology , gene research and consumer genetics . "

want to design a baby or take a peek into your genetic future ?
customers at a store in bremen were more than willing to do so , and hardly anyone questioned the company 's ethics , much to the dismay of the organizers . nestled inconspicuously between boutiques and snackbars in downtown bremen is a new store called " chromosoma . "
the shop with its ultra-cool interior opened just recently and promises to offer its customers something they wo n't get at a run-of-the-mill department store , namely , the possibility for a complete genetic make-over .
curious passers-by who venture inside the shop can explore a range of six products and services such as " book-a-baby , " which allows women to choose precisely when they wish to start a pregnancy , as well as selecting their baby 's genetic traits , and " re-set , " which offers customers the opportunity to store their genetic information with a view to human cloning .
the store also provides a service it calls " gen-ex , " which destroys human genetic footprints – the skin particles , hair and saliva that contain someone 's entire genetic code .
the product is designed to prevent involuntary assessment and storage of genetic material - information which could conceivably be misused by employers and insurance companies , for example .
sound a little dubious or ethically questionable to offer genetic designing to the paying public ?
well , that 's the point of the world 's first dna store .
simulating reality ?
chromosoma is in fact not a shop at all , but rather a " field-study " project organized by the bundeszentrale für politische bildung , or federal center for political education , in the run-up to its congress on genetic research from 15 – 17 september in bremen .
two years in the making , the 10-day long initiative was managed by leipzig-based artist alf thum , who posed as " chromosoma " ceo hans jürgen sternburg . his mission was to take genetic research out of the science laboratories and into the public eye , drawing people 's attention to the fact that the future is upon us – and gene technology and its applications are topics of immediate relevance to everyone .
by opening up the gene-shop and simulating reality , visitors to chromosoma were afforded a glimpse of a brave new world where gene technology is already so advanced that consumer genetics are simply part and parcel of everyday life .
so far the reality is a far cry from the type of products outlined in the chromosoma catalogue .
for now , many of the products displayed in the bremen store clash with current legislation , such as stringent embryo protection laws .
postive public resonance but florian feigl , who helped organize the venture , told dw-world that few of the weekend-shoppers who looked in on the opening-day asked probing questions .
staff at " chromosoma " discovered that their - hypothetical - products were surprisingly well-received by the unsuspecting public .
visitors took a keen interest in the services outlined and expressed immediate willingness to try out the " starter packs " handed out by friendly assistants along with complimentary glasses of sparkling wine .
florian feigl said the team observed that describing the products in aspirational , lifestyle terms meant that customers were quick to accept their often controversial premises .
implications of gene technology the situation , however , is much different when experts get involved .
and following on the footsteps of the dna shop , scientists , educators and politicians will descend on bremen for a three day conference entitled " good genes , bad genes – gene technology , gene research and consumer genetics . "

care to buy a brand new vw golf via the internet ?
german mailorder giant quelle is now offering the car at discounted prices online , but the offer has run afoul of car dealers and even volkswagen itself . hoping the car 's reputation will be enough to prompt customers to risk ' sold-as-seen ' purchases , quelle began offering volkswagen ’ s new golf v model on its internet site on monday .
to spark interest , quelle is selling the car for around ten percent less than the average golf sticker price , a move which has incensed vw dealers across the country . volkwagen , too , is not amused and europe ’ s largest carmaker has said it will refuse to provide the mail-order outfit with any vehicles since it would violate agreements it has with dealers . “ we aren ’ t going to deliver any cars to quelle , ” vw spokesman dirk große-leege said , explaining vw dealers are not allowed to re-sell new cars to unauthorized dealers .
“ maybe if quelle is only acting as middleman for new car sales would it be legally acceptable . ” quelle says that is exactly what it is doing and that it will only facilitate the sale of a new golf between customer and an auto dealer with which it has an agreement .
the company has set up a partnership with bavarian firm carplus to act as intermediary with around a dozen authorized dealers . “ it ’ s correct that vw dealers are not allowed to sell vehicles directly to us , ” carplus manager heiko eich told the reuters news agency .
“ and they aren ’ t . ” dealers angry the volkswagen dealer ’ s association has slammed the quelle offer as “ not serious , ” and vw ’ s große-leege dismissed it as largely a pr event , aiming to piggyback on the expected success of the completely revamped golf .
the car , which will be available nationwide starting october 17 , has long been one of the best selling models in germany . quelle ’ s initiative has particularly scared dealers since they have only recently renegotiated contracts with vw that have already squeezed their profit margins .
carplus ’ eich admitted the bulk of the discount passed on to quelle ’ s customers , there would be little left over for the participating dealers , who then would hope to make up the losses with high volume sales . a quelle spokesman said the company wanted to sell between 3,000 and 4,000 cars a month within two years time .
with the popular golf making up a large chunk of total vw sales , other dealers fear seeing their overall sales dented . german car dealers , already angered by a european commission decision last year setting new rules making it easier to set up dealerships at unconventional places like supermarkets , also likely see quelle ’ s internet promotion as another attack on the traditional system of car dealerships . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de volkswagen pins revival hopes on new golf volkswagen unveiled the fifth-generation golf on monday in a dramatic display of lights , mist and optimistic sales forecasts .
however , once the smoke has cleared , heavy expectation will remain .

want to design a baby or take a peek into your genetic future ?
customers at a store in bremen were more than willing to do so , and hardly anyone questioned the company 's ethics , much to the dismay of the organizers . nestled inconspicuously between boutiques and snackbars in downtown bremen is a new store called " chromosoma . "
the shop with its ultra-cool interior opened just recently and promises to offer its customers something they wo n't get at a run-of-the-mill department store , namely , the possibility for a complete genetic make-over .
curious passers-by who venture inside the shop can explore a range of six products and services such as " book-a-baby , " which allows women to choose precisely when they wish to start a pregnancy , as well as selecting their baby 's genetic traits , and " re-set , " which offers customers the opportunity to store their genetic information with a view to human cloning .
the store also provides a service it calls " gen-ex , " which destroys human genetic footprints – the skin particles , hair and saliva that contain someone 's entire genetic code .
the product is designed to prevent involuntary assessment and storage of genetic material - information which could conceivably be misused by employers and insurance companies , for example .
sound a little dubious or ethically questionable to offer genetic designing to the paying public ?
well , that 's the point of the world 's first dna store .
simulating reality ?
chromosoma is in fact not a shop at all , but rather a " field-study " project organized by the bundeszentrale für politische bildung , or federal center for political education , in the run-up to its congress on genetic research from 15 – 17 september in bremen .
two years in the making , the 10-day long initiative was managed by leipzig-based artist alf thum , who posed as " chromosoma " ceo hans jürgen sternburg . his mission was to take genetic research out of the science laboratories and into the public eye , drawing people 's attention to the fact that the future is upon us – and gene technology and its applications are topics of immediate relevance to everyone .
by opening up the gene-shop and simulating reality , visitors to chromosoma were afforded a glimpse of a brave new world where gene technology is already so advanced that consumer genetics are simply part and parcel of everyday life .
so far the reality is a far cry from the type of products outlined in the chromosoma catalogue .
for now , many of the products displayed in the bremen store clash with current legislation , such as stringent embryo protection laws .
postive public resonance but florian feigl , who helped organize the venture , told dw-world that few of the weekend-shoppers who looked in on the opening-day asked probing questions .
staff at " chromosoma " discovered that their - hypothetical - products were surprisingly well-received by the unsuspecting public .
visitors took a keen interest in the services outlined and expressed immediate willingness to try out the " starter packs " handed out by friendly assistants along with complimentary glasses of sparkling wine .
florian feigl said the team observed that describing the products in aspirational , lifestyle terms meant that customers were quick to accept their often controversial premises .
implications of gene technology the situation , however , is much different when experts get involved .
and following on the footsteps of the dna shop , scientists , educators and politicians will descend on bremen for a three day conference entitled " good genes , bad genes – gene technology , gene research and consumer genetics . "
the chromosoma scenario will certainly figure highly in their discussions , especially as it sheds new light on the public 's acceptance of genetic designing and the need for broader awareness campaigns . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links chromosoma project description and mission of the field project by alf thum .

customers at a store in bremen were more than willing to do so , and hardly anyone questioned the company 's ethics , much to the dismay of the organizers . nestled inconspicuously between boutiques and snackbars in downtown bremen is a new store called " chromosoma . "
the shop with its ultra-cool interior opened just recently and promises to offer its customers something they wo n't get at a run-of-the-mill department store , namely , the possibility for a complete genetic make-over .
curious passers-by who venture inside the shop can explore a range of six products and services such as " book-a-baby , " which allows women to choose precisely when they wish to start a pregnancy , as well as selecting their baby 's genetic traits , and " re-set , " which offers customers the opportunity to store their genetic information with a view to human cloning .
the store also provides a service it calls " gen-ex , " which destroys human genetic footprints – the skin particles , hair and saliva that contain someone 's entire genetic code .
the product is designed to prevent involuntary assessment and storage of genetic material - information which could conceivably be misused by employers and insurance companies , for example .

chromosoma is in fact not a shop at all , but rather a " field-study " project organized by the bundeszentrale für politische bildung , or federal center for political education , in the run-up to its congress on genetic research from 15 – 17 september in bremen .
two years in the making , the 10-day long initiative was managed by leipzig-based artist alf thum , who posed as " chromosoma " ceo hans jürgen sternburg . his mission was to take genetic research out of the science laboratories and into the public eye , drawing people 's attention to the fact that the future is upon us – and gene technology and its applications are topics of immediate relevance to everyone .
by opening up the gene-shop and simulating reality , visitors to chromosoma were afforded a glimpse of a brave new world where gene technology is already so advanced that consumer genetics are simply part and parcel of everyday life .
so far the reality is a far cry from the type of products outlined in the chromosoma catalogue .
for now , many of the products displayed in the bremen store clash with current legislation , such as stringent embryo protection laws .
postive public resonance but florian feigl , who helped organize the venture , told dw-world that few of the weekend-shoppers who looked in on the opening-day asked probing questions .
staff at " chromosoma " discovered that their - hypothetical - products were surprisingly well-received by the unsuspecting public .
visitors took a keen interest in the services outlined and expressed immediate willingness to try out the " starter packs " handed out by friendly assistants along with complimentary glasses of sparkling wine .
florian feigl said the team observed that describing the products in aspirational , lifestyle terms meant that customers were quick to accept their often controversial premises .
implications of gene technology the situation , however , is much different when experts get involved .
and following on the footsteps of the dna shop , scientists , educators and politicians will descend on bremen for a three day conference entitled " good genes , bad genes – gene technology , gene research and consumer genetics . "

interior minister schily is in ankara to discuss deporting a turkish , islamic fundamentalist .
a german court stopped a deportation order against the " caliph of cologne , " saying turkey might not observe his human rights . german interior minister otto schily meets with his turkish counterpart abdulkadir aksu in ankara on tuesday to get assurances from the turkish government that " no statements obtained through torture would be used against -lsb- islamic fundamentalist metin -rsb- kaplan " in a turkish trial .
a düsseldorf court had prevented the deportation of the self-proclaimed " caliph of cologne " because it said there was no guarantee that turkey would give him a fair trial and abstain from torture . the case could become " a symbol for the weakness of our state " if it proves impossible to deport kaplan , schily said in an interview with the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" if we do n't succeed in getting this person out of the country , the well-fortified democracy has not gotten very far .
what else are we going to put up with ? " wanted in turkey the turkish national served four years in a german prison for inciting the murder of a rival who was killed by unknown assailants in 1999 .

interior minister schily hopes an appeals court will allow deportation if he obtains assurances from turkey that kaplan would receive a fair trial and torture would not be employed to extract confessions . last week he strongly criticized the düsseldorf court 's ruling that prohibited kaplan 's deportation , saying the decision was wrong because it was based on the assumption that turkey uses torture to obtain confessions .
schily referred to the fact that turkey has ratified the european human rights convention that prohibits torture . a cologne court rescinded kaplan 's status as a political asylum seeker in late august , but prohibited the german authorities from deporting the man . cologne caliphate kaplan was the leader of the islamic organization " caliphate state . "
schily banned the group , which had been suspected of spreading anti-semitic and anti-american propaganda within germany 's islamic community , in august 2002 . after another " caliph " established himself in berlin in 1996 , kaplan told his organization 's members the man 's " head should be cut off .

want to design a baby or take a peek into your genetic future ?
customers at a store in bremen were more than willing to do so , and hardly anyone questioned the company 's ethics , much to the dismay of the organizers . nestled inconspicuously between boutiques and snackbars in downtown bremen is a new store called " chromosoma . "
the shop with its ultra-cool interior opened just recently and promises to offer its customers something they wo n't get at a run-of-the-mill department store , namely , the possibility for a complete genetic make-over .
curious passers-by who venture inside the shop can explore a range of six products and services such as " book-a-baby , " which allows women to choose precisely when they wish to start a pregnancy , as well as selecting their baby 's genetic traits , and " re-set , " which offers customers the opportunity to store their genetic information with a view to human cloning .
the store also provides a service it calls " gen-ex , " which destroys human genetic footprints – the skin particles , hair and saliva that contain someone 's entire genetic code .
the product is designed to prevent involuntary assessment and storage of genetic material - information which could conceivably be misused by employers and insurance companies , for example .
sound a little dubious or ethically questionable to offer genetic designing to the paying public ?
well , that 's the point of the world 's first dna store .
simulating reality ?
chromosoma is in fact not a shop at all , but rather a " field-study " project organized by the bundeszentrale für politische bildung , or federal center for political education , in the run-up to its congress on genetic research from 15 – 17 september in bremen .
two years in the making , the 10-day long initiative was managed by leipzig-based artist alf thum , who posed as " chromosoma " ceo hans jürgen sternburg . his mission was to take genetic research out of the science laboratories and into the public eye , drawing people 's attention to the fact that the future is upon us – and gene technology and its applications are topics of immediate relevance to everyone .
by opening up the gene-shop and simulating reality , visitors to chromosoma were afforded a glimpse of a brave new world where gene technology is already so advanced that consumer genetics are simply part and parcel of everyday life .
so far the reality is a far cry from the type of products outlined in the chromosoma catalogue .
for now , many of the products displayed in the bremen store clash with current legislation , such as stringent embryo protection laws .
postive public resonance but florian feigl , who helped organize the venture , told dw-world that few of the weekend-shoppers who looked in on the opening-day asked probing questions .
staff at " chromosoma " discovered that their - hypothetical - products were surprisingly well-received by the unsuspecting public .
visitors took a keen interest in the services outlined and expressed immediate willingness to try out the " starter packs " handed out by friendly assistants along with complimentary glasses of sparkling wine .
florian feigl said the team observed that describing the products in aspirational , lifestyle terms meant that customers were quick to accept their often controversial premises .
implications of gene technology the situation , however , is much different when experts get involved .
and following on the footsteps of the dna shop , scientists , educators and politicians will descend on bremen for a three day conference entitled " good genes , bad genes – gene technology , gene research and consumer genetics . "
the chromosoma scenario will certainly figure highly in their discussions , especially as it sheds new light on the public 's acceptance of genetic designing and the need for broader awareness campaigns . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links chromosoma project description and mission of the field project by alf thum .

german mailorder giant quelle is now offering the car at discounted prices online , but the offer has run afoul of car dealers and even volkswagen itself . hoping the car 's reputation will be enough to prompt customers to risk ' sold-as-seen ' purchases , quelle began offering volkswagen ’ s new golf v model on its internet site on monday .
to spark interest , quelle is selling the car for around ten percent less than the average golf sticker price , a move which has incensed vw dealers across the country . volkwagen , too , is not amused and europe ’ s largest carmaker has said it will refuse to provide the mail-order outfit with any vehicles since it would violate agreements it has with dealers . “ we aren ’ t going to deliver any cars to quelle , ” vw spokesman dirk große-leege said , explaining vw dealers are not allowed to re-sell new cars to unauthorized dealers .
“ maybe if quelle is only acting as middleman for new car sales would it be legally acceptable . ” quelle says that is exactly what it is doing and that it will only facilitate the sale of a new golf between customer and an auto dealer with which it has an agreement .
the company has set up a partnership with bavarian firm carplus to act as intermediary with around a dozen authorized dealers . “ it ’ s correct that vw dealers are not allowed to sell vehicles directly to us , ” carplus manager heiko eich told the reuters news agency .
“ and they aren ’ t . ” dealers angry the volkswagen dealer ’ s association has slammed the quelle offer as “ not serious , ” and vw ’ s große-leege dismissed it as largely a pr event , aiming to piggyback on the expected success of the completely revamped golf .
the car , which will be available nationwide starting october 17 , has long been one of the best selling models in germany . quelle ’ s initiative has particularly scared dealers since they have only recently renegotiated contracts with vw that have already squeezed their profit margins .
carplus ’ eich admitted the bulk of the discount passed on to quelle ’ s customers , there would be little left over for the participating dealers , who then would hope to make up the losses with high volume sales . a quelle spokesman said the company wanted to sell between 3,000 and 4,000 cars a month within two years time .
with the popular golf making up a large chunk of total vw sales , other dealers fear seeing their overall sales dented . german car dealers , already angered by a european commission decision last year setting new rules making it easier to set up dealerships at unconventional places like supermarkets , also likely see quelle ’ s internet promotion as another attack on the traditional system of car dealerships . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de volkswagen pins revival hopes on new golf volkswagen unveiled the fifth-generation golf on monday in a dramatic display of lights , mist and optimistic sales forecasts .

interior minister schily hopes an appeals court will allow deportation if he obtains assurances from turkey that kaplan would receive a fair trial and torture would not be employed to extract confessions . last week he strongly criticized the düsseldorf court 's ruling that prohibited kaplan 's deportation , saying the decision was wrong because it was based on the assumption that turkey uses torture to obtain confessions .
schily referred to the fact that turkey has ratified the european human rights convention that prohibits torture . a cologne court rescinded kaplan 's status as a political asylum seeker in late august , but prohibited the german authorities from deporting the man . cologne caliphate kaplan was the leader of the islamic organization " caliphate state . "
schily banned the group , which had been suspected of spreading anti-semitic and anti-american propaganda within germany 's islamic community , in august 2002 . after another " caliph " established himself in berlin in 1996 , kaplan told his organization 's members the man 's " head should be cut off .

german mailorder giant quelle is now offering the car at discounted prices online , but the offer has run afoul of car dealers and even volkswagen itself . hoping the car 's reputation will be enough to prompt customers to risk ' sold-as-seen ' purchases , quelle began offering volkswagen ’ s new golf v model on its internet site on monday .
to spark interest , quelle is selling the car for around ten percent less than the average golf sticker price , a move which has incensed vw dealers across the country . volkwagen , too , is not amused and europe ’ s largest carmaker has said it will refuse to provide the mail-order outfit with any vehicles since it would violate agreements it has with dealers . “ we aren ’ t going to deliver any cars to quelle , ” vw spokesman dirk große-leege said , explaining vw dealers are not allowed to re-sell new cars to unauthorized dealers .
“ maybe if quelle is only acting as middleman for new car sales would it be legally acceptable . ” quelle says that is exactly what it is doing and that it will only facilitate the sale of a new golf between customer and an auto dealer with which it has an agreement .
the company has set up a partnership with bavarian firm carplus to act as intermediary with around a dozen authorized dealers . “ it ’ s correct that vw dealers are not allowed to sell vehicles directly to us , ” carplus manager heiko eich told the reuters news agency .
“ and they aren ’ t . ” dealers angry the volkswagen dealer ’ s association has slammed the quelle offer as “ not serious , ” and vw ’ s große-leege dismissed it as largely a pr event , aiming to piggyback on the expected success of the completely revamped golf .
the car , which will be available nationwide starting october 17 , has long been one of the best selling models in germany . quelle ’ s initiative has particularly scared dealers since they have only recently renegotiated contracts with vw that have already squeezed their profit margins .
carplus ’ eich admitted the bulk of the discount passed on to quelle ’ s customers , there would be little left over for the participating dealers , who then would hope to make up the losses with high volume sales . a quelle spokesman said the company wanted to sell between 3,000 and 4,000 cars a month within two years time .
with the popular golf making up a large chunk of total vw sales , other dealers fear seeing their overall sales dented . german car dealers , already angered by a european commission decision last year setting new rules making it easier to set up dealerships at unconventional places like supermarkets , also likely see quelle ’ s internet promotion as another attack on the traditional system of car dealerships . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de volkswagen pins revival hopes on new golf volkswagen unveiled the fifth-generation golf on monday in a dramatic display of lights , mist and optimistic sales forecasts .

want to design a baby or take a peek into your genetic future ?
customers at a store in bremen were more than willing to do so , and hardly anyone questioned the company 's ethics , much to the dismay of the organizers . nestled inconspicuously between boutiques and snackbars in downtown bremen is a new store called " chromosoma . "
the shop with its ultra-cool interior opened just recently and promises to offer its customers something they wo n't get at a run-of-the-mill department store , namely , the possibility for a complete genetic make-over .
curious passers-by who venture inside the shop can explore a range of six products and services such as " book-a-baby , " which allows women to choose precisely when they wish to start a pregnancy , as well as selecting their baby 's genetic traits , and " re-set , " which offers customers the opportunity to store their genetic information with a view to human cloning .
the store also provides a service it calls " gen-ex , " which destroys human genetic footprints – the skin particles , hair and saliva that contain someone 's entire genetic code .
the product is designed to prevent involuntary assessment and storage of genetic material - information which could conceivably be misused by employers and insurance companies , for example .

chromosoma is in fact not a shop at all , but rather a " field-study " project organized by the bundeszentrale für politische bildung , or federal center for political education , in the run-up to its congress on genetic research from 15 – 17 september in bremen .
two years in the making , the 10-day long initiative was managed by leipzig-based artist alf thum , who posed as " chromosoma " ceo hans jürgen sternburg . his mission was to take genetic research out of the science laboratories and into the public eye , drawing people 's attention to the fact that the future is upon us – and gene technology and its applications are topics of immediate relevance to everyone .
by opening up the gene-shop and simulating reality , visitors to chromosoma were afforded a glimpse of a brave new world where gene technology is already so advanced that consumer genetics are simply part and parcel of everyday life .
so far the reality is a far cry from the type of products outlined in the chromosoma catalogue .
for now , many of the products displayed in the bremen store clash with current legislation , such as stringent embryo protection laws .
postive public resonance but florian feigl , who helped organize the venture , told dw-world that few of the weekend-shoppers who looked in on the opening-day asked probing questions .

visitors took a keen interest in the services outlined and expressed immediate willingness to try out the " starter packs " handed out by friendly assistants along with complimentary glasses of sparkling wine .

customers at a store in bremen were more than willing to do so , and hardly anyone questioned the company 's ethics , much to the dismay of the organizers . nestled inconspicuously between boutiques and snackbars in downtown bremen is a new store called " chromosoma . "
the shop with its ultra-cool interior opened just recently and promises to offer its customers something they wo n't get at a run-of-the-mill department store , namely , the possibility for a complete genetic make-over .
curious passers-by who venture inside the shop can explore a range of six products and services such as " book-a-baby , " which allows women to choose precisely when they wish to start a pregnancy , as well as selecting their baby 's genetic traits , and " re-set , " which offers customers the opportunity to store their genetic information with a view to human cloning .
the store also provides a service it calls " gen-ex , " which destroys human genetic footprints – the skin particles , hair and saliva that contain someone 's entire genetic code .
the product is designed to prevent involuntary assessment and storage of genetic material - information which could conceivably be misused by employers and insurance companies , for example .

chromosoma is in fact not a shop at all , but rather a " field-study " project organized by the bundeszentrale für politische bildung , or federal center for political education , in the run-up to its congress on genetic research from 15 – 17 september in bremen .
two years in the making , the 10-day long initiative was managed by leipzig-based artist alf thum , who posed as " chromosoma " ceo hans jürgen sternburg . his mission was to take genetic research out of the science laboratories and into the public eye , drawing people 's attention to the fact that the future is upon us – and gene technology and its applications are topics of immediate relevance to everyone .

german mailorder giant quelle is now offering the car at discounted prices online , but the offer has run afoul of car dealers and even volkswagen itself . hoping the car 's reputation will be enough to prompt customers to risk ' sold-as-seen ' purchases , quelle began offering volkswagen ’ s new golf v model on its internet site on monday .
to spark interest , quelle is selling the car for around ten percent less than the average golf sticker price , a move which has incensed vw dealers across the country . volkwagen , too , is not amused and europe ’ s largest carmaker has said it will refuse to provide the mail-order outfit with any vehicles since it would violate agreements it has with dealers . “ we aren ’ t going to deliver any cars to quelle , ” vw spokesman dirk große-leege said , explaining vw dealers are not allowed to re-sell new cars to unauthorized dealers .

care to buy a brand new vw golf via the internet ?
german mailorder giant quelle is now offering the car at discounted prices online , but the offer has run afoul of car dealers and even volkswagen itself . hoping the car 's reputation will be enough to prompt customers to risk ' sold-as-seen ' purchases , quelle began offering volkswagen ’ s new golf v model on its internet site on monday .
to spark interest , quelle is selling the car for around ten percent less than the average golf sticker price , a move which has incensed vw dealers across the country . volkwagen , too , is not amused and europe ’ s largest carmaker has said it will refuse to provide the mail-order outfit with any vehicles since it would violate agreements it has with dealers . “ we aren ’ t going to deliver any cars to quelle , ” vw spokesman dirk große-leege said , explaining vw dealers are not allowed to re-sell new cars to unauthorized dealers .
“ maybe if quelle is only acting as middleman for new car sales would it be legally acceptable . ” quelle says that is exactly what it is doing and that it will only facilitate the sale of a new golf between customer and an auto dealer with which it has an agreement .
the company has set up a partnership with bavarian firm carplus to act as intermediary with around a dozen authorized dealers . “ it ’ s correct that vw dealers are not allowed to sell vehicles directly to us , ” carplus manager heiko eich told the reuters news agency .
“ and they aren ’ t . ” dealers angry the volkswagen dealer ’ s association has slammed the quelle offer as “ not serious , ” and vw ’ s große-leege dismissed it as largely a pr event , aiming to piggyback on the expected success of the completely revamped golf .
the car , which will be available nationwide starting october 17 , has long been one of the best selling models in germany . quelle ’ s initiative has particularly scared dealers since they have only recently renegotiated contracts with vw that have already squeezed their profit margins .
carplus ’ eich admitted the bulk of the discount passed on to quelle ’ s customers , there would be little left over for the participating dealers , who then would hope to make up the losses with high volume sales . a quelle spokesman said the company wanted to sell between 3,000 and 4,000 cars a month within two years time .
with the popular golf making up a large chunk of total vw sales , other dealers fear seeing their overall sales dented . german car dealers , already angered by a european commission decision last year setting new rules making it easier to set up dealerships at unconventional places like supermarkets , also likely see quelle ’ s internet promotion as another attack on the traditional system of car dealerships . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de volkswagen pins revival hopes on new golf volkswagen unveiled the fifth-generation golf on monday in a dramatic display of lights , mist and optimistic sales forecasts .
however , once the smoke has cleared , heavy expectation will remain .

the 10bn shekel -lrb- $ 2.2bn ; £ 1.4bn -rrb- cutback takes the government 's 2004 budget to 257bn shekels .
the move , agreed on tuesday morning after a marathon 18-hour meeting , follows a similar belt-tightening exercise for the current financial year .
but the cuts have triggered deep divisions within the cabinet , as a phalanx of powerful ministers - backed by prime minister ariel sharon - forced finance minister benjamin netanyahu to scale back much of his plans to slash the defence budget .
the burden is to fall instead on welfare and education .
and the new spending plan still has to pass three votes in the knesset , or parliament - a process that held up last year 's budget for weeks .
in the meantime , israel 's economy remains in a parlous state , gripped by a three year recession which has coincided with ballooning security spending in the face of bloody conflict with the palestinians .
the effect has been to squeeze tax revenues and inflate the budget deficit to as much as 6 % this year .
for 2004 , the government is basing its projections on 2.5 % growth and a 4 % deficit - described by credit agencies as a tough target .
jockeying for position originally , mr netanyahu had planned to cut defence by as much as 3bn shekels .
defence spending is seen by sharon as sacrosanct but but defence minister shaul mofaz made sure that the prime minister - a former general - was onside to prevent that , and mr netanyahu transferred much of the burden to an across-the-board 5 % fall in national insurance payouts instead .
mr mofaz still voted against the budget 's lower defence spending cutback , along with eight others in the 23-member cabinet .
among them were the five ministers from the secular shinui party , demonstrating the split in israel 's polity caused by the government 's need for minority party support .
without the votes of the ultra-orthodox jewish parties , the likud party government of mr sharon can not hold a majority .
the shinui ministers are angry that mr netanyahu refused to cut back on subsidies to religious councils and the services they deliver , although they have stepped back from threats to collapse the coalition over the issue .
vice premier and industry , trade and labour minister ehud olmert also voted against the budget , having told mr netanyahu over the weekend that the plan failed to do anything to encourage growth and employment , both stagnant at best .
and education minister limor livnat was another rebel .
" i could not vote in parliament for this budget , which in effect means the collapse of our education system , " she told israeli radio .

christopher henderson from pateley bridge , north yorkshire said the entire family was " shocked " when they discovered that mark , 31 , a tv producer who was born lincoln but now lives in london , was among a group of eight tourists held captive .
he and matthew scott , 19 , who was born in london , are believed to have been captured by the rebel revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- .
local reports said a massive manhunt was on for the kidnappers and their victims with up to 1,500 police and soldiers as well as nine black hawk helicopters joining the search .
mr henderson , 59 , said of mark : " he 's pretty tough and i 'm confident that he will be able to cope .
' he had saved for long time to make this trip , and had travelled throughout central america for the past 4 months using public transport and trekking to some of the more remote areas . "
" he was in good spirits when i spoke to him 10 days ago . "
mr henderson was kidnapped along with seven other tourists mark and mr scott were snatched alongside a german , a spaniard and four israelis on a trek to the ciudad perdida -lrb- the lost city -rrb- ancient ruins in mountainous jungle in the northern region of colombia .
discovered in the 1970s , the lost city is made up of a web of roads , terraces and small stone plazas thought to date from 500 bc .
it is only accessible by a five-day trek or hired helicopter .
the attack took place in the sierra nevada , inland from the caribbean resort of santa marta .
the eight abducted people were part of a larger group of 15 tourists that had earlier split in two .
the seven others were all safe .
they told journalists in santa marta that they were probably allowed to go because they were physically unfit or did not have sturdy walking shoes .
the area is not one of those that the foreign office strongly advises against all travel to , but british tourists are told that overland travel in any part of colombia is unwise .
sierra nevada is a disputed territory , fought over by marxist guerrillas , right-wing paramilitaries and drugs traffickers , none of whom welcome foreign visitors .
most of colombia 's 3,000-odd kidnappings every year - that is one every four hours - are carried out by farc , who use the ransom to fund their 39-year war on the state .
travel in the area is judged " unwise " by the foreign office tom hart dyke , 27 , a botanist from eynsford , kent , was kidnapped in march 2000 after he travelled to the colombia-panama border to hunt for rare orchids .
he was held for nine months .
he and a fellow british traveller , former city merchant banker paul winder , from chelmsford , were kidnapped in the village of payita in an area neighbouring the region where the two britons have gone missing .
mr hart dyke said the captives would now be feeling terrified .
he said : " you just have to take it day by day .
they told us every day how they would execute us , with guns or chainsaws .
" they describe it to your face .
they said , 'you are going to die in these woods ' . "
after failing to get the ransom , mr hart dyke believes , the rebels simply got tired of having to move with the captives and decided to release them .

sierra nevada is a disputed territory , fought over by marxist guerrillas , right-wing paramilitaries and drugs traffickers , none of whom welcome foreign visitors .
most of colombia 's 3,000-odd kidnappings every year - that is one every four hours - are carried out by farc , who use the ransom to fund their 39-year war on the state .
travel in the area is judged " unwise " by the foreign office tom hart dyke , 27 , a botanist from eynsford , kent , was kidnapped in march 2000 after he travelled to the colombia-panama border to hunt for rare orchids .
he was held for nine months .
he and a fellow british traveller , former city merchant banker paul winder , from chelmsford , were kidnapped in the village of payita in an area neighbouring the region where the two britons have gone missing .
mr hart dyke said the captives would now be feeling terrified .
he said : " you just have to take it day by day .
they told us every day how they would execute us , with guns or chainsaws .
" they describe it to your face .
they said , 'you are going to die in these woods ' . "
after failing to get the ransom , mr hart dyke believes , the rebels simply got tired of having to move with the captives and decided to release them .

christopher henderson from pateley bridge , north yorkshire said the entire family was " shocked " when they discovered that mark , 31 , a tv producer who was born lincoln but now lives in london , was among a group of eight tourists held captive .
he and matthew scott , 19 , who was born in london , are believed to have been captured by the rebel revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- .
local reports said a massive manhunt was on for the kidnappers and their victims with up to 1,500 police and soldiers as well as nine black hawk helicopters joining the search .
mr henderson , 59 , said of mark : " he 's pretty tough and i 'm confident that he will be able to cope .
' he had saved for long time to make this trip , and had travelled throughout central america for the past 4 months using public transport and trekking to some of the more remote areas . "
" he was in good spirits when i spoke to him 10 days ago . "
mr henderson was kidnapped along with seven other tourists mark and mr scott were snatched alongside a german , a spaniard and four israelis on a trek to the ciudad perdida -lrb- the lost city -rrb- ancient ruins in mountainous jungle in the northern region of colombia .
discovered in the 1970s , the lost city is made up of a web of roads , terraces and small stone plazas thought to date from 500 bc .
it is only accessible by a five-day trek or hired helicopter .

ellis was hanged in 1955 after being convicted of shooting dead her lover - racing driver david blakely - outside the magdala pub in hampstead , north-west london .
forty-seven years later , the court of appeal in london is being urged by ellis 's sister and others to reduce the conviction to manslaughter on the grounds of provocation .
the case has been referred by the criminal cases review commission , which investigates possible miscarriages of justice .
ellis 's sister , muriel jakubait , 82 , from woking in surrey , is expected to attend the hearing .
she believes she is fulfilling her sister 's dying wish by pursuing the appeal .
miscarriage " i 've stood by that - what she said - the truth would come out .
" but what she did n't think about was who would do it and i 've been the one to strive for her , " she told bbc news .
the judges will hear that ellis had a miscarriage after being punched by mr blakely just 10 days before she killed him .
lawyers will also point to the role played by another of ellis 's boyfriends , who was said to have given her the gun and taught her to use it before driving her to the murder scene .
who does know what happened ?
tish campbell , pub landlady on this day : 13 july , 1955 ellis 's grandchildren are expected to be in court for the appeal hearing , but her son and daughter are no longer alive .
ellis , who was born in rhyl , north wales , was 28 when she was hanged at holloway prison in 1955 .
the death penalty in the uk was suspended in 1965 and permanently removed in 1970 .
at ellis 's trial , the judge ruled out a defence of provocation by her violent lover .
the trial was held two months after the shooting and lasted just over a day , with the jury taking less than half an hour to reach its verdict .
the magdala 's current landlady tish campbell says some of her customers still remember the incident and that the pub attracts visitors because of the murder .
" not many of my regulars exactly know what happened .
it was obviously a crime of passion , " she said .
" who does know what happened ? "
the appeal hearing is expected to last two days , with judgement to be delivered in writing at a later date .
the appeal judges are lord justice kay , mr justice silber and mr justice leveson .

justin maynard was shot in the neck in tugford close at about 1845 bst on 26 august .
patrols have been stepped up and stop-and-search tactics reintroduced since the shooting .
but greater manchester police -lrb- gmp -rrb- said their best lead was a woman who contacted them with " vital information " shortly after mr maynard 's death and have appealed for her to get back in touch .
his mother , miranda , said : " i lost everything on the night justin was killed , he meant the world to me and i ca n't imagine my life without him .
' life turned upside down ' " our family will never be the same without him and we all miss him terribly .
" if anyone knows anything about his death i would ask them to please , please come forward and tell the police what they know .
" i lost my whole world the night that he was killed and it 's not fair that his killers should live a normal life when mine and the rest of my family 's have been turned upside down . "
she added that her son had " wanted to make something of himself " and was due to start a college course later this month .
leaflets written in a variety of languages and posters of mr maynard have been distributed around moss side in the hope they will jog peoples ' memories of the incident .
detective superintendent vincent petrykowski , of gmp , also appealed for the woman who contacted them at about 1300 bst on 28 august to speak to detectives again .
he said : " this woman has not been in touch with us since and we are very eager to speak to her again .
" i would ask her to please call the incident room as soon as possible . "

but for some folks such high speeds are simply too slow .
some science experiments can generate so much data that it still takes hours to send the information across the net so it can start to be analysed .
technologies like the grid look set to help get the data to where it needs to be and fast net providers are looking at better ways to get data moving .
terabyte troubles one of the recent developments in radio astronomy involves linking up a distributed network of telescopes to form a giant , virtual instrument as big as a continent .
the good thing about this technique , which goes by the formidable name of very long baseline interferometry -lrb- vlbi -rrb- , is that it produces very high quality radio images of astronomical phenomena such as exploding supernovae , pulsars and black holes .
the downside is the vast amounts of data that it generates .
the european vlbi project links 16 telescopes that each generate one gigabit of data per second over the 25 days of an observation session .
the end result is a pile of data tens of terabytes deep recorded on to huge numbers of magnetic tapes .
dai davies , director of dante , which provides high-speed networks to europe 's research institutes , said that before now the highest data transfer speed was achieved by putting the tapes in a van and driving them to where they need to be analysed .
delivery vans can carry lots of tapes at the same time which means that europe 's roads have a relatively high bandwidth .
sea floor sensors are helping understanding of the planet " you can send a few hundred megabytes per second through dhl , " he said .
the problem with delivering data by road is the time it takes for the tapes to travel from where they are collected to where they are analysed .
sometimes it arrives weeks after an observation session has finished .
dr davies said the basic protocols of the internet got in the way when huge amounts of data had to be sent .
at very high speeds the net 's transmission control protocol -lrb- tcp -rrb- , that helps ensure data reaches its intended destination , slows things down because it checks to see if packets have arrived .
" tcp was designed along with similar protocols in the 1970s when they were coping with line speeds in the kilobits , " he said .
net loss dr davies said dante was looking at changing the basic protocol it used to transport data and at alternative ways of organising its network to provide capacity on demand .
by moving away from pure net protocols and hardware it should become possible to give research institutions bandwidth as it is needed .
mike garrett , director of the europe 's joint institute for vlbi , said it was working with dante on ways to get data from its 16 telescopes to its supercomputer for analysis in real-time .
he also said it was carrying out a pilot grid project to see if it was possible to spread the analysis load by sending out the data to a cluster of computers .
and it is not just astronomers who have much data to deal with seabed sensors cardiff university is currently installing a gigabit network as part of the welsh e-science centre being created at the institution .
tom wiersma , manager of the network at cardiff university , said the fast network will help some of its scientists do more with the huge amount of data they gather .
as an example , cardiff researcher adam schultz is using huge numbers of seabed sensors to monitor geological activity and refine theories about the workings of the earth 's interior .
mr wiersma said that the high-speed network would make it much easier for scientists like dr schultz to move information around and added that broader work on packaging data for analysis would be useful too .
" scientists need to be able to connect to the grid , take their data and find the computing resource they need to crunch it without having to worry about preparing the data , splitting it up and so on , " he said .

but for some folks such high speeds are simply too slow .
some science experiments can generate so much data that it still takes hours to send the information across the net so it can start to be analysed .
technologies like the grid look set to help get the data to where it needs to be and fast net providers are looking at better ways to get data moving .
terabyte troubles one of the recent developments in radio astronomy involves linking up a distributed network of telescopes to form a giant , virtual instrument as big as a continent .
the good thing about this technique , which goes by the formidable name of very long baseline interferometry -lrb- vlbi -rrb- , is that it produces very high quality radio images of astronomical phenomena such as exploding supernovae , pulsars and black holes .
the downside is the vast amounts of data that it generates .
the european vlbi project links 16 telescopes that each generate one gigabit of data per second over the 25 days of an observation session .
the end result is a pile of data tens of terabytes deep recorded on to huge numbers of magnetic tapes .
dai davies , director of dante , which provides high-speed networks to europe 's research institutes , said that before now the highest data transfer speed was achieved by putting the tapes in a van and driving them to where they need to be analysed .
delivery vans can carry lots of tapes at the same time which means that europe 's roads have a relatively high bandwidth .
sea floor sensors are helping understanding of the planet " you can send a few hundred megabytes per second through dhl , " he said .
the problem with delivering data by road is the time it takes for the tapes to travel from where they are collected to where they are analysed .
sometimes it arrives weeks after an observation session has finished .
dr davies said the basic protocols of the internet got in the way when huge amounts of data had to be sent .
at very high speeds the net 's transmission control protocol -lrb- tcp -rrb- , that helps ensure data reaches its intended destination , slows things down because it checks to see if packets have arrived .
" tcp was designed along with similar protocols in the 1970s when they were coping with line speeds in the kilobits , " he said .
net loss dr davies said dante was looking at changing the basic protocol it used to transport data and at alternative ways of organising its network to provide capacity on demand .
by moving away from pure net protocols and hardware it should become possible to give research institutions bandwidth as it is needed .
mike garrett , director of the europe 's joint institute for vlbi , said it was working with dante on ways to get data from its 16 telescopes to its supercomputer for analysis in real-time .
he also said it was carrying out a pilot grid project to see if it was possible to spread the analysis load by sending out the data to a cluster of computers .
and it is not just astronomers who have much data to deal with seabed sensors cardiff university is currently installing a gigabit network as part of the welsh e-science centre being created at the institution .
tom wiersma , manager of the network at cardiff university , said the fast network will help some of its scientists do more with the huge amount of data they gather .
as an example , cardiff researcher adam schultz is using huge numbers of seabed sensors to monitor geological activity and refine theories about the workings of the earth 's interior .
mr wiersma said that the high-speed network would make it much easier for scientists like dr schultz to move information around and added that broader work on packaging data for analysis would be useful too .

as an example , cardiff researcher adam schultz is using huge numbers of seabed sensors to monitor geological activity and refine theories about the workings of the earth 's interior .
mr wiersma said that the high-speed network would make it much easier for scientists like dr schultz to move information around and added that broader work on packaging data for analysis would be useful too .
" scientists need to be able to connect to the grid , take their data and find the computing resource they need to crunch it without having to worry about preparing the data , splitting it up and so on , " he said .

but for some folks such high speeds are simply too slow .
some science experiments can generate so much data that it still takes hours to send the information across the net so it can start to be analysed .
technologies like the grid look set to help get the data to where it needs to be and fast net providers are looking at better ways to get data moving .
terabyte troubles one of the recent developments in radio astronomy involves linking up a distributed network of telescopes to form a giant , virtual instrument as big as a continent .
the good thing about this technique , which goes by the formidable name of very long baseline interferometry -lrb- vlbi -rrb- , is that it produces very high quality radio images of astronomical phenomena such as exploding supernovae , pulsars and black holes .
the downside is the vast amounts of data that it generates .
the european vlbi project links 16 telescopes that each generate one gigabit of data per second over the 25 days of an observation session .
the end result is a pile of data tens of terabytes deep recorded on to huge numbers of magnetic tapes .
dai davies , director of dante , which provides high-speed networks to europe 's research institutes , said that before now the highest data transfer speed was achieved by putting the tapes in a van and driving them to where they need to be analysed .
delivery vans can carry lots of tapes at the same time which means that europe 's roads have a relatively high bandwidth .
sea floor sensors are helping understanding of the planet " you can send a few hundred megabytes per second through dhl , " he said .
the problem with delivering data by road is the time it takes for the tapes to travel from where they are collected to where they are analysed .
sometimes it arrives weeks after an observation session has finished .
dr davies said the basic protocols of the internet got in the way when huge amounts of data had to be sent .
at very high speeds the net 's transmission control protocol -lrb- tcp -rrb- , that helps ensure data reaches its intended destination , slows things down because it checks to see if packets have arrived .
" tcp was designed along with similar protocols in the 1970s when they were coping with line speeds in the kilobits , " he said .
net loss dr davies said dante was looking at changing the basic protocol it used to transport data and at alternative ways of organising its network to provide capacity on demand .
by moving away from pure net protocols and hardware it should become possible to give research institutions bandwidth as it is needed .
mike garrett , director of the europe 's joint institute for vlbi , said it was working with dante on ways to get data from its 16 telescopes to its supercomputer for analysis in real-time .
he also said it was carrying out a pilot grid project to see if it was possible to spread the analysis load by sending out the data to a cluster of computers .

tanzanian president benjamin mkapa said he had failed to get the government and rebels to agree to share power , after nearly 12 hours of talks .
an estimated 300,000 people have been killed in burundi during a decade of civil war .
mr mkapa insisted that the differences were not impossible to resolve .
row but bbc reporter prime ndikumagenge in tanzania says the rebels were demanding a number of posts in the burundian government , including those of the vice president and the speaker of parliament .
burundi war some 300,000 killed since 1993 tutsi minority dominated since independence hutu rebels demand army reform nelson mandela power-sharing plan failed to stop fighting burundi 's elusive peace the government says that this would break the regional and ethnic balances that have been defined by the arusha peace accord which has governed political life in burundi since 2001 .
the secretary general of the main rebel group , the fdd , hussein radjabu told afp news agency : " the government still does not want to give way . "
a government spokesman told the bbc the fdd rebels walked out of the talks because they wanted to have greater representation in the new army .
the burundian transitional government delegation was led by president domitien ndayizeye with the main rebel fdd group represented by its leader pierre nkurunziza .
they had also failed to reach agreement at face-to-face talks in uganda last week .

tanzanian president benjamin mkapa said he had failed to get the government and rebels to agree to share power , after nearly 12 hours of talks .

mr mkapa insisted that the differences were not impossible to resolve .

the secretary general of the main rebel group , the fdd , hussein radjabu told afp news agency : " the government still does not want to give way . "
a government spokesman told the bbc the fdd rebels walked out of the talks because they wanted to have greater representation in the new army .
the burundian transitional government delegation was led by president domitien ndayizeye with the main rebel fdd group represented by its leader pierre nkurunziza .
they had also failed to reach agreement at face-to-face talks in uganda last week .

to others , it is simply the most efficient way of doing business .
the latest trials of controversial electronic radio tags that allow store bosses to keep track of individual goods are currently taking place .
tesco chiefs are piloting the chips , which contain a code similar to a product 's barcode but unique to that actual item , at branches in sandhurst , berkshire , and leicester .
there was controversy earlier in 2003 when the tracking system was used in the packaging of gillette mach3 razor blades to stop shoplifting at one of the store chain 's cambridge branches .
i 'm not talking about an orwellian nightmare that may or may not occur .
this is on its way campaigner chris mcdermott human rights campaigners criticised the radio frequency identification -lrb- rfid -rrb- scheme , saying that anyone with the right kind of scanning device could find out exactly what items shoppers have bought and could ultimately identify a person simply by the goods they are carrying or wearing .
its designers - based at the auto-id centre , set up by the massachusetts institute of technology - say their goal is to produce an internet database of every product in the world .
the chips are now being attached to the packaging of almost every dvd disc in the sandhurst and leicester stores .
but bosses are adamant that they are being used only to tell staff which titles are in stock , how many there are of them and where they can be found .
security uses they have vowed that the two latest trials , which will last until the end of 2003 , are not being held to improve security at the stores nor to build up profiles of their customers ' shopping habits .
tesco spokesman greg sage told bbc news online : " there has been some talk in america about privacy but we would never compromise the privacy of our customers .
" we are very responsible about these things .
" we would never introduce anything without clear benefits to the customer .
" there are potential security benefits with rfid but it 's not something we are looking at sandhurst or leicester . "
universal database but mr sage confirmed that the tags would not be switched off at the point of sale but would remain with shoppers until they disposed of the product 's packaging .
campaigner chris mcdermott , of recently-formed pressure group , notags.co.uk , says he would be happier if the chips were not there in the first place .
he is campaigning against the introduction of rfid , saying that if the goal of a universal database is achieved it could signal the end of our privacy .
mr mcdermott said : " if you pay with a credit or debit card , or use a loyalty card , you are intrinsically linked to that product .

the latest trials of controversial electronic radio tags that allow store bosses to keep track of individual goods are currently taking place .
tesco chiefs are piloting the chips , which contain a code similar to a product 's barcode but unique to that actual item , at branches in sandhurst , berkshire , and leicester .

campaigner chris mcdermott , of recently-formed pressure group , notags.co.uk , says he would be happier if the chips were not there in the first place .

tribal leaders from australia have called on the royal albert memorial museum in exeter to let them take the remains of their ancestors back home when they visit the city next month .
the skulls were presented to the museum and have been in its collection for 125 years .
exeter city council is expected to approve the repatriation of the skulls at a meeting on tuesday evening .
the foundation for aboriginal and islander research action -lrb- faira -rrb- wants the skulls laid to rest as part of a worldwide campaign to return bones taken from graves by european collectors in the late 19th and early 20th centuries .
native ground aborigines believe the spirits of their ancestors can not rest in peace until their bones are buried in their native ground .
the skulls are not currently on display in exeter , and museum curator len pole is recommending they are returned to australia .
" i do n't think human remains can be owned by an institution such as a museum , but can be valued and looked after by the dependants of the populations and communities from which they originally came .
" clearly there is likely to be much greater interest in these items in australia than in exeter . "
if the council decides to return the skulls , a ceremony is likely to be held at the museum to mark the handover .
manchester museum acceded to a similar request from faira two months ago .
