27 , marks international holocaust day .
dw 's cornelia rabitz says that it 's time for europe to find a common discourse on remembering the darkest part of the continent 's past to ensure a bright future . about 1 million people from around the world visit the auschwitz memorial each year to commemorate the victims of the holocaust .
it 's a significant number of people , who still come to the museum to get an idea of living and dying in this former antechamber of hell - and to learn from history . memorial officials recently rang sounded an alarm , saying that the buildings are in danger of collapsing and that a lot of money is needed for their restoration .
germany reacted quickly and said that it would help out financially .
and rightly so .
more than six decades after the end of the war , it remains a duty for state and society to accept historic responsibility and keep the memory alive - even if this becomes more and more difficult as the distance of time keeps growing and eyewitnesses die . history books , museums , tv documentaries and movie films have to replace personal conversations .
the ability to relate to the topic - both in terms of time and emotions - continues to wane . to learn from history also means to look at today and arm ourselves against discrimination , racism , xenophobia and - needless to say - anti-semitism .
it 's depressing to see that the conflict between israelis and palestinians has led to falling inhibition thresholds and that jewish people are becoming the targets of hate mail - especially in germany . it 's alarming that anti-semitic stereotypes persist , as polls show again and again .
it 's alarming that neo-nazis drum people together for noisy demonstrations , that propaganda and historical misrepresentation find receptive audiences in our society . still : there will be a large number of events , lectures and concerts to commemorate tuesday 's holocaust day .
they will offer a chance to deal with the issue .
keeping the memory alive could become a european task .
a unifying europe should agree on a common discourse of memory .
dealing with the dark sides of one 's past still can not be taken for granted everywhere . germany , with its long and hard path towards coming to terms with its national socialist crimes and guilt , could certainly serve as an example . cornelia rabitz covers culture for dw-radio -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the country 's jewish leaders chose to skip the main government ceremony on tuesday in protest for what they say is lack of respect . germany 's leading jewish organization , the central council of jews in germany , said it was boycotting the memorial event in the german parliament because surviving victims had not been personally acknowledged in the past .
" i would understand it if we were talking about representatives of the second or third generations , " council general secretary stephan j. kramer told ap news agency .
" but it can not be that actual survivors are treated like mere onlookers . "
german president horst koehler addressed the bundestag in a speech marking the 64th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz concentration camp .
january 27th has been the official day for holocaust remembrance in germany since 1996 .
some of those who took part in the ceremony were critical of the council 's decision .
" in recent years , we 've always had very dignified hours of remembrance with a variety of participants , " social democratic cultural spokeswoman monika griefahn said in an interview with a berlin radio station .
but the boycott comes at a time in which many jewish leaders in germany are questioning whether the country is doing enough to combat anti-semitism .
gaza fallout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president koehler , middle , and other german leaders observed the occasion kramer said the most recent hostilities between israel and palestinians had led to an upsurge in anti-jewish sentiment in germany .
" we have been forced to register that during the war in gaza the number of hate mails sent to the council has increased by around 40 percent to 200-300 per week , " kramer told ap .
he added that some of those mails contained explicit death threats toward council members .
in his speech before the reichstag , president koehler called for greater solidarity with german jews .
" let us stand beside our fellow jewish citizens , " koehler said .
" whoever attacks them attacks all of us as well . "
but jewish leaders are also disappointed at germany 's reaction to pope benedict xvi 's decision to repeal the excommunication of a priest for holocaust denial .
in an interview with a german tv station , council president charlotte knobloch said she was outraged by the decision taken by the german pontiff .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz was liberated 64 years ago the rancor might cause some to question whether holocaust memorial day serves any other purpose than to pay ritualistic lip-service to a historical tragedy and injustice .
but yehuda bauer , the director of the yad vashem holocaust memorial in israel , says that ceremonies like the one in the bundestag can serve a valuable purpose .
" the ritual can gain in content and can be presented so that true thoughts and feelings are behind it , " bauer said in an interview with a german radio station .
the israeli historian said the occasion was also useful in lending historical perspective to recent events .
" genocide is the attempt to partially or completely exterminate a national , ethnic , religious or racial group , " bauer said .
" what happened in gaza is a conflict , a bloody conflict between two nationalities like in sri lanka , kashmir and other places .
they are not genocides . "
" what is happening in darfur and what happened in rwanda are genocides , " bauer added .
" you have to distinguish . "
during world war ii , the nazi regime organized the systematic killings of some six million jews , most of them in eastern europe .
the nazis also targeted sinti and roma and homosexuals for wholesale extermination . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 27.01.2009 proposed nabucco gas pipeline gets european bank backing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech prime minister topolanek and hungary 's gyurcsany were confident of success the heads of the eu 's european investment bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development -lrb- ebrd -rrb- said tuesday , jan .
27 , that they are prepared to provide financial backing for the nabucco gas pipeline . spurred on by europe 's worst-ever gas crisis earlier this month , which left millions of homes across the continent without heat in the depths of winter , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany invited top-ranking officials from both the eu and the countries involved in nabucco to inject fresh momentum into the slow-moving project .
nabucco , an ambitious but still-unbuilt gas pipeline aimed at reducing europe 's energy reliance on russia , is a 3,300-kilometer -lrb- 2,050-mile -rrb- pipeline between turkey and austria .
costing an estimated 7.9 billion euros , the aim is to transport up to 31 billion cubic meters of gas each year from the caspian sea to western europe , bypassing russia and ukraine .
nabucco currently has six shareholders - omv of austria , mol of hungary , transgaz of romania , bulgargaz of bulgaria , botas of turkey and rwe of germany .
but for the pipeline to get moving , nabucco would need an initial cash injection of an estimated 300 million euros .
both the eib and ebrd said they were willing to invest in the early stages of the project through a series of loans , providing certain conditions are met .
" the eib is ready to finance projects that further eu objectives of increased sustainability and energy security , " said philippe maystadt , president of the european investment bank , during the opening addresses by participants at the " nabucco summit " in hungary .
the eib is prepared to finance " up to 25 percent of project cost , " provided a secure intergovernmental agreement on the nabucco pipeline is reached , he said .
maystadt noted that of 48 billion euros of financing it provided last year , a quarter was for energy projects .
ebrd president thomas mirow also offered financial backing to the nabucco pipeline , on the condition that it " meets the requirements of solid project financing . "
the bank would need to see concrete plans and completion guarantees , besides a stable political agreement , said mirow .
eu wary of future gas crises czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu , spoke about the recent gas crisis caused by a pricing dispute between russia and ukraine that affected supplies to europe .
" a new crisis could emerge at any time , and next time it could be even worse , " topolanek said .
he added that reaching an agreement on nabucco is a " test of european solidarity . "
the latest gas row between russia and ukraine has highlighted europe 's need to diversify its energy sources and thrown the spotlight on nabucco .
but critics insist that the vast project will remain nothing but a pipe dream because its backers can not guarantee that they will ever have sufficient gas supplies to make it profitable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political will could see the eu with an alternative gas source eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs urged political leaders to commit firmly to nabucco by the end of march , or risk jeopardizing the project .
in his opening address as host , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany called on the eu to provide 200 to 300 million euros within the next few weeks to get the construction of the pipeline off the ground .
gyurcsany stressed that he was not hoping for a loan , but rather for starting capital from the eu .
us deputy assistant secretary of state matthew bryza noted that the tuesday summit had made it clear that gyurcsany , who dismissed nabucco as " a dream " in 2007 , was now fully committed to the energy supply diversification project .
on the supply side , turkmenistan and azerbaijan both indicated they would be willing to supply some of the gas .
" azerbaijan , which is according to current plans is a transit country , could eventually serve as a supplier as well , " azerbaijani president ilham aliyev said .
azerbaijan 's gas reserves of some two or three trillion cubic meters would be sufficient to last " several decades , " he said .
austrian economy minister reinhold mitterlehner suggested that egypt and iran could also be brought in as suppliers in the long term .
but a deal currently seems unlikely with iran given the long-running international standoff over its disputed nuclear program .
russia , ukraine still wrangling meanwhile , russia and ukraine were still wrangling over the details of the deal which ended their gas quarrel earlier this month .
ukrainian president viktor yushchenko said on tuesday he would stand by the terms of the agreement with russia , even though not all the details are to his liking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrangling between russia and ukraine continues but russian officials questioned his reliability , saying that the political rivalry between yushchenko and prime minister yulia timoshenko could still lead kiev to cancel the contract .
" the agreements signed are not easy ones , but ukraine fully takes up the performance -lrb- of its commitments -rrb- and guarantees full-fledged transit to european consumers , " yushchenko told journalists in brussels after a meeting with the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso .
the assurance that yushchenko would abide by the terms of the agreement finalized by timoshenko was " an important step forward in allowing us to focus on our broader relationship , " barroso said .
but the spokesman for russian prime minister vladimir putin said that moscow still feared that the growing rivalry between yushchenko and timoshenko , who are set to face off in next year 's presidential election , could torpedo the deal .
eu in talks to upgrade ukraine 's transit system yushchenko 's working breakfast with barroso was dominated by the energy question , with both men highlighting the need to upgrade ukraine 's gas-transit system and build more links between ukrainian and european energy markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could help ukraine update its transit network the commission is set to host an international conference aimed at gathering donations to upgrade ukraine 's gas-transit system on march 23 in brussels .
the eu and ukraine have agreed to form a joint expert group to plan the meeting , the leaders said tuesday .
during the conflict , barroso had warned that both russia and ukraine were damaging their credibility as reliable partners .
but on monday he said that " in bilateral relations , we are not taking any negative consequences from -lrb- the gas row -rrb- because we believe ukraine wants to deepen the relationship with the eu , and we also want to deepen the relationship with ukraine . "
he also said that " we have to state very clearly that we were disappointed by the problems between ukraine and russia , " and called for political stability and reform in ukraine .
his diplomatic balancing act is likely to have a frosty reception in moscow , where peskov said that russia " would prefer to hear from the european states a very serious and severe evaluation of who is guilty for interrupting the transit .

" in recent years , we 've always had very dignified hours of remembrance with a variety of participants , " social democratic cultural spokeswoman monika griefahn said in an interview with a berlin radio station .
but the boycott comes at a time in which many jewish leaders in germany are questioning whether the country is doing enough to combat anti-semitism .
gaza fallout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president koehler , middle , and other german leaders observed the occasion kramer said the most recent hostilities between israel and palestinians had led to an upsurge in anti-jewish sentiment in germany .
" we have been forced to register that during the war in gaza the number of hate mails sent to the council has increased by around 40 percent to 200-300 per week , " kramer told ap .
he added that some of those mails contained explicit death threats toward council members .
in his speech before the reichstag , president koehler called for greater solidarity with german jews .
" let us stand beside our fellow jewish citizens , " koehler said .
" whoever attacks them attacks all of us as well . "
but jewish leaders are also disappointed at germany 's reaction to pope benedict xvi 's decision to repeal the excommunication of a priest for holocaust denial .
in an interview with a german tv station , council president charlotte knobloch said she was outraged by the decision taken by the german pontiff .

but the country 's jewish leaders chose to skip the main government ceremony on tuesday in protest for what they say is lack of respect . germany 's leading jewish organization , the central council of jews in germany , said it was boycotting the memorial event in the german parliament because surviving victims had not been personally acknowledged in the past .

obama 's internationalist style is drawing positive reviews , but disagreements still loom . one week into his presidency , barack obama seems to be making good on his campaign pledge to adopt a more multilateral approach to global problems than his predecessor .
on monday , jan .
26 , obama gave his first formal television interview to the arab-language channel al-arabiya , in which he sought to reassure muslims in the middle east that " americans are not your enemy . "
he also put in telephone calls to french president nicolas sarkozy , german chancellor angela merkel and russia president dmitry medvedev .
obama and sarkozy conversed for 30 minutes .
afterwards , in a statement , the french president said they have agreed to work together in " resolute fashion " on the reconstruction of afghanistan , the global economic crisis and obama 's plan to shut down the controversial army detention center in guantanamo bay , cuba .
obama 's talks with merkel and medvedev reportedly focused on many of the same issues .
relations between the united states and france , germany and russia cooled under obama 's predecessor george w. bush - in part because those three countries refused to support the us-led war on iraq .
in the realm of foreign policy , obama concentrated much of his first week in office on the middle east .
but monday 's calls suggest that he wants to increase cooperation between the us and europe as well .
media hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama supports states ' effort to reduce co2 emissions the decisions taken by obama during his first seven days are going down well with european newspapers , most of which took a dim view of bush and what were perceived as his short-sighted , unilateral policies .
" the diversity of the decisions and directives in the past seven days gives us an idea not only of obama 's political caliber … but also of his modus operandi : his ability to decide cleverly and maneuver between hostile ideological fronts , " wrote the italian newspaper la repubblica .
european opinion-makers have welcomed the appointment of former senator george mitchell , the architect of peace in northern ireland , as us special envoy to the middle east .
" our hopes are with him and the new american government , " wrote the french paper paris-normandie .
" so that words and reason can finally silence weapons . "
europeans are also encouraged by obama 's environmental policies , which place greater emphasis on clean energy sources .
" it is truly a major event that the president of the world 's most powerful nation and one of its biggest polluters definitively acknowledges the need for new and more responsible policies , " wrote the french paper la presse de la manche .
guantanamo and other dilemmas bildunterschrift : how long will the smiles between obama and europe last ? but while the honeymoon continues for now , there are issues on which the obama administration and europe do not see eye to eye .
russia , for instance , has said it will cooperate with washington on fighting terrorism , especially in afghanistan , but has also stressed that it wants more understanding from the us in return .
and merkel 's conservative-led government in germany has been noticeably less enthusiastic than france about the idea that eu countries could take in some of the prisoners released from guantanamo .
some european newspapers are echoing the resistance to that idea .
" without any logic at all , the us is insisting that -lsb- detainees -rsb- be dispersed to countries that have more-or-less actively participated in the war on terror , " wrote the conservative-leaning danish paper jyllands-posten .
" it would be more obvious to send them back to their home countries . "
moreover , some left-wing commentators are disappointed in the sort of change obama has brought to us policies - and in particular his stated aim to step up america 's military efforts in afghanistan .
" the first democratic president in the modern era to be elected on an anti-war ticket is also , to the relief of neocons and the liberal belligerati , a hawk , " wrote richard seymour in britain 's guardian newspaper .
if obama follows through with his plan to seek a military solution in afghanistan , he will likely call on america 's european allies to do more - something that may not sit very well with eu leaders , who have been historically skittish about sending troops abroad . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

obama 's internationalist style is drawing positive reviews , but disagreements still loom . one week into his presidency , barack obama seems to be making good on his campaign pledge to adopt a more multilateral approach to global problems than his predecessor .
on monday , jan .
26 , obama gave his first formal television interview to the arab-language channel al-arabiya , in which he sought to reassure muslims in the middle east that " americans are not your enemy . "
he also put in telephone calls to french president nicolas sarkozy , german chancellor angela merkel and russia president dmitry medvedev .
obama and sarkozy conversed for 30 minutes .
afterwards , in a statement , the french president said they have agreed to work together in " resolute fashion " on the reconstruction of afghanistan , the global economic crisis and obama 's plan to shut down the controversial army detention center in guantanamo bay , cuba .
obama 's talks with merkel and medvedev reportedly focused on many of the same issues .
relations between the united states and france , germany and russia cooled under obama 's predecessor george w. bush - in part because those three countries refused to support the us-led war on iraq .
in the realm of foreign policy , obama concentrated much of his first week in office on the middle east .
but monday 's calls suggest that he wants to increase cooperation between the us and europe as well .
media hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama supports states ' effort to reduce co2 emissions the decisions taken by obama during his first seven days are going down well with european newspapers , most of which took a dim view of bush and what were perceived as his short-sighted , unilateral policies .
" the diversity of the decisions and directives in the past seven days gives us an idea not only of obama 's political caliber … but also of his modus operandi : his ability to decide cleverly and maneuver between hostile ideological fronts , " wrote the italian newspaper la repubblica .
european opinion-makers have welcomed the appointment of former senator george mitchell , the architect of peace in northern ireland , as us special envoy to the middle east .
" our hopes are with him and the new american government , " wrote the french paper paris-normandie .
" so that words and reason can finally silence weapons . "
europeans are also encouraged by obama 's environmental policies , which place greater emphasis on clean energy sources .
" it is truly a major event that the president of the world 's most powerful nation and one of its biggest polluters definitively acknowledges the need for new and more responsible policies , " wrote the french paper la presse de la manche .
guantanamo and other dilemmas bildunterschrift : how long will the smiles between obama and europe last ? but while the honeymoon continues for now , there are issues on which the obama administration and europe do not see eye to eye .
russia , for instance , has said it will cooperate with washington on fighting terrorism , especially in afghanistan , but has also stressed that it wants more understanding from the us in return .
and merkel 's conservative-led government in germany has been noticeably less enthusiastic than france about the idea that eu countries could take in some of the prisoners released from guantanamo .
some european newspapers are echoing the resistance to that idea .
" without any logic at all , the us is insisting that -lsb- detainees -rsb- be dispersed to countries that have more-or-less actively participated in the war on terror , " wrote the conservative-leaning danish paper jyllands-posten .
" it would be more obvious to send them back to their home countries . "
moreover , some left-wing commentators are disappointed in the sort of change obama has brought to us policies - and in particular his stated aim to step up america 's military efforts in afghanistan .
" the first democratic president in the modern era to be elected on an anti-war ticket is also , to the relief of neocons and the liberal belligerati , a hawk , " wrote richard seymour in britain 's guardian newspaper .
if obama follows through with his plan to seek a military solution in afghanistan , he will likely call on america 's european allies to do more - something that may not sit very well with eu leaders , who have been historically skittish about sending troops abroad . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , marks international holocaust day .
dw 's cornelia rabitz says that it 's time for europe to find a common discourse on remembering the darkest part of the continent 's past to ensure a bright future . about 1 million people from around the world visit the auschwitz memorial each year to commemorate the victims of the holocaust .
it 's a significant number of people , who still come to the museum to get an idea of living and dying in this former antechamber of hell - and to learn from history . memorial officials recently rang sounded an alarm , saying that the buildings are in danger of collapsing and that a lot of money is needed for their restoration .
germany reacted quickly and said that it would help out financially .
and rightly so .
more than six decades after the end of the war , it remains a duty for state and society to accept historic responsibility and keep the memory alive - even if this becomes more and more difficult as the distance of time keeps growing and eyewitnesses die . history books , museums , tv documentaries and movie films have to replace personal conversations .
the ability to relate to the topic - both in terms of time and emotions - continues to wane . to learn from history also means to look at today and arm ourselves against discrimination , racism , xenophobia and - needless to say - anti-semitism .
it 's depressing to see that the conflict between israelis and palestinians has led to falling inhibition thresholds and that jewish people are becoming the targets of hate mail - especially in germany . it 's alarming that anti-semitic stereotypes persist , as polls show again and again .
it 's alarming that neo-nazis drum people together for noisy demonstrations , that propaganda and historical misrepresentation find receptive audiences in our society . still : there will be a large number of events , lectures and concerts to commemorate tuesday 's holocaust day .
they will offer a chance to deal with the issue .
keeping the memory alive could become a european task .
a unifying europe should agree on a common discourse of memory .
dealing with the dark sides of one 's past still can not be taken for granted everywhere . germany , with its long and hard path towards coming to terms with its national socialist crimes and guilt , could certainly serve as an example . cornelia rabitz covers culture for dw-radio -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 27.01.2009 proposed nabucco gas pipeline gets european bank backing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech prime minister topolanek and hungary 's gyurcsany were confident of success the heads of the eu 's european investment bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development -lrb- ebrd -rrb- said tuesday , jan .
27 , that they are prepared to provide financial backing for the nabucco gas pipeline . spurred on by europe 's worst-ever gas crisis earlier this month , which left millions of homes across the continent without heat in the depths of winter , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany invited top-ranking officials from both the eu and the countries involved in nabucco to inject fresh momentum into the slow-moving project .
nabucco , an ambitious but still-unbuilt gas pipeline aimed at reducing europe 's energy reliance on russia , is a 3,300-kilometer -lrb- 2,050-mile -rrb- pipeline between turkey and austria .
costing an estimated 7.9 billion euros , the aim is to transport up to 31 billion cubic meters of gas each year from the caspian sea to western europe , bypassing russia and ukraine .
nabucco currently has six shareholders - omv of austria , mol of hungary , transgaz of romania , bulgargaz of bulgaria , botas of turkey and rwe of germany .
but for the pipeline to get moving , nabucco would need an initial cash injection of an estimated 300 million euros .
both the eib and ebrd said they were willing to invest in the early stages of the project through a series of loans , providing certain conditions are met .
" the eib is ready to finance projects that further eu objectives of increased sustainability and energy security , " said philippe maystadt , president of the european investment bank , during the opening addresses by participants at the " nabucco summit " in hungary .
the eib is prepared to finance " up to 25 percent of project cost , " provided a secure intergovernmental agreement on the nabucco pipeline is reached , he said .
maystadt noted that of 48 billion euros of financing it provided last year , a quarter was for energy projects .
ebrd president thomas mirow also offered financial backing to the nabucco pipeline , on the condition that it " meets the requirements of solid project financing . "
the bank would need to see concrete plans and completion guarantees , besides a stable political agreement , said mirow .
eu wary of future gas crises czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu , spoke about the recent gas crisis caused by a pricing dispute between russia and ukraine that affected supplies to europe .
" a new crisis could emerge at any time , and next time it could be even worse , " topolanek said .
he added that reaching an agreement on nabucco is a " test of european solidarity . "
the latest gas row between russia and ukraine has highlighted europe 's need to diversify its energy sources and thrown the spotlight on nabucco .
but critics insist that the vast project will remain nothing but a pipe dream because its backers can not guarantee that they will ever have sufficient gas supplies to make it profitable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political will could see the eu with an alternative gas source eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs urged political leaders to commit firmly to nabucco by the end of march , or risk jeopardizing the project .
in his opening address as host , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany called on the eu to provide 200 to 300 million euros within the next few weeks to get the construction of the pipeline off the ground .
gyurcsany stressed that he was not hoping for a loan , but rather for starting capital from the eu .
us deputy assistant secretary of state matthew bryza noted that the tuesday summit had made it clear that gyurcsany , who dismissed nabucco as " a dream " in 2007 , was now fully committed to the energy supply diversification project .
on the supply side , turkmenistan and azerbaijan both indicated they would be willing to supply some of the gas .
" azerbaijan , which is according to current plans is a transit country , could eventually serve as a supplier as well , " azerbaijani president ilham aliyev said .
azerbaijan 's gas reserves of some two or three trillion cubic meters would be sufficient to last " several decades , " he said .
austrian economy minister reinhold mitterlehner suggested that egypt and iran could also be brought in as suppliers in the long term .
but a deal currently seems unlikely with iran given the long-running international standoff over its disputed nuclear program .
russia , ukraine still wrangling meanwhile , russia and ukraine were still wrangling over the details of the deal which ended their gas quarrel earlier this month .
ukrainian president viktor yushchenko said on tuesday he would stand by the terms of the agreement with russia , even though not all the details are to his liking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrangling between russia and ukraine continues but russian officials questioned his reliability , saying that the political rivalry between yushchenko and prime minister yulia timoshenko could still lead kiev to cancel the contract .
" the agreements signed are not easy ones , but ukraine fully takes up the performance -lrb- of its commitments -rrb- and guarantees full-fledged transit to european consumers , " yushchenko told journalists in brussels after a meeting with the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso .
the assurance that yushchenko would abide by the terms of the agreement finalized by timoshenko was " an important step forward in allowing us to focus on our broader relationship , " barroso said .
but the spokesman for russian prime minister vladimir putin said that moscow still feared that the growing rivalry between yushchenko and timoshenko , who are set to face off in next year 's presidential election , could torpedo the deal .
eu in talks to upgrade ukraine 's transit system yushchenko 's working breakfast with barroso was dominated by the energy question , with both men highlighting the need to upgrade ukraine 's gas-transit system and build more links between ukrainian and european energy markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could help ukraine update its transit network the commission is set to host an international conference aimed at gathering donations to upgrade ukraine 's gas-transit system on march 23 in brussels .
the eu and ukraine have agreed to form a joint expert group to plan the meeting , the leaders said tuesday .
during the conflict , barroso had warned that both russia and ukraine were damaging their credibility as reliable partners .
but on monday he said that " in bilateral relations , we are not taking any negative consequences from -lrb- the gas row -rrb- because we believe ukraine wants to deepen the relationship with the eu , and we also want to deepen the relationship with ukraine . "
he also said that " we have to state very clearly that we were disappointed by the problems between ukraine and russia , " and called for political stability and reform in ukraine .
his diplomatic balancing act is likely to have a frosty reception in moscow , where peskov said that russia " would prefer to hear from the european states a very serious and severe evaluation of who is guilty for interrupting the transit .

" due to the legal situation in different -lrb- eu -rrb- countries , we ca n't give a quick answer ...
it is not a question which can be solved in weeks or months , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the bloc 's rotating presidency . while the new administration of us president barack obama has not yet officially asked european governments to host any of the 60 guantanamo inmates eligible for release , a list of possible candidates has already begun circulating in european capitals . but the lack of a quick response from the eu is likely to be ill-received in washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans want to get off on a good foot with obama analysts had warned ahead of monday 's talks that the eu 's reaction on guantanamo represented the first real test of europe 's will to start relations with the obama administration on a positive note . as finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said , " we need to shake hands with the us : it 's a new , fresh start . " legal complications but ministers later insisted that legal complications made it impossible for them to commit themselves quickly . " we found during our discussions that the legal situations are different in different -lrb- eu -rrb- states , " schwarzenberg said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama signs an executive order closing the prison at guantanamo bay he said foreign ministers would first ask for a reasoned opinion from their justice and interior ministers .
" then we will probably have another meeting , " he said . so far , portugal is the only eu member state to have clearly stated its intention of taking in former detainees who would face persecution and abuse if sent to their countries of origin in the middle east . the foreign ministers of germany and france both said in brussels that they would consider hosting the men in orange jumpsuits only on a " case-by-case " basis , with france 's bernard kouchner insisting that he would not accept any " impositions " from washington . and britain , which has already taken in 12 former detainees , has said it will not take in more . britain " feels it has already made a significant contribution but that we are keen to offer our experience on the repatriation of these people to other european countries who are ready to play their part , " british foreign secretary david miliband said ahead of the talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guantanamo prison outraged many europeans the eu has long called for the closure of the guantanamo detention center and welcomed the decision by obama to prepare the jail 's closure soon after assuming office . but securing a common european position on what to do next would likely take a long period of complex legal discussions , judging from the outcome of monday 's talks . opposition group there was further controversy when ministers removed the people 's mujahedin of iran -lrb- pmoi -rrb- from their list of terrorist organizations on monday , despite the opposition of france and public protests in tehran . the widely expected move followed a ruling by the european court in luxembourg , which in december said the eu was wrong to keep the pmoi 's assets frozen after it was taken off a british list of terrorist organizations . " what we are doing today is abiding by the resolution of the european court .
there 's nothing we can do about that resolution , " eu foreign-policy chief javier solana said . however , in light of objections from france , czech officials said the eu might reconsider its decision " if new evidence " against the pmoi were to emerge . founded in 1965 , the pmoi operated a military wing in its early years , but says it renounced violence in june 2001 and now advocates the political overthrow of iran 's current government . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , that they are prepared to provide financial backing for the nabucco gas pipeline . spurred on by europe 's worst-ever gas crisis earlier this month , which left millions of homes across the continent without heat in the depths of winter , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany invited top-ranking officials from both the eu and the countries involved in nabucco to inject fresh momentum into the slow-moving project .
nabucco , an ambitious but still-unbuilt gas pipeline aimed at reducing europe 's energy reliance on russia , is a 3,300-kilometer -lrb- 2,050-mile -rrb- pipeline between turkey and austria .
costing an estimated 7.9 billion euros , the aim is to transport up to 31 billion cubic meters of gas each year from the caspian sea to western europe , bypassing russia and ukraine .
nabucco currently has six shareholders - omv of austria , mol of hungary , transgaz of romania , bulgargaz of bulgaria , botas of turkey and rwe of germany .
but for the pipeline to get moving , nabucco would need an initial cash injection of an estimated 300 million euros .
both the eib and ebrd said they were willing to invest in the early stages of the project through a series of loans , providing certain conditions are met .
" the eib is ready to finance projects that further eu objectives of increased sustainability and energy security , " said philippe maystadt , president of the european investment bank , during the opening addresses by participants at the " nabucco summit " in hungary .
the eib is prepared to finance " up to 25 percent of project cost , " provided a secure intergovernmental agreement on the nabucco pipeline is reached , he said .
maystadt noted that of 48 billion euros of financing it provided last year , a quarter was for energy projects .
ebrd president thomas mirow also offered financial backing to the nabucco pipeline , on the condition that it " meets the requirements of solid project financing . "
the bank would need to see concrete plans and completion guarantees , besides a stable political agreement , said mirow .
eu wary of future gas crises czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu , spoke about the recent gas crisis caused by a pricing dispute between russia and ukraine that affected supplies to europe .
" a new crisis could emerge at any time , and next time it could be even worse , " topolanek said .
he added that reaching an agreement on nabucco is a " test of european solidarity . "
the latest gas row between russia and ukraine has highlighted europe 's need to diversify its energy sources and thrown the spotlight on nabucco .
but critics insist that the vast project will remain nothing but a pipe dream because its backers can not guarantee that they will ever have sufficient gas supplies to make it profitable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political will could see the eu with an alternative gas source eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs urged political leaders to commit firmly to nabucco by the end of march , or risk jeopardizing the project .
in his opening address as host , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany called on the eu to provide 200 to 300 million euros within the next few weeks to get the construction of the pipeline off the ground .
gyurcsany stressed that he was not hoping for a loan , but rather for starting capital from the eu .
us deputy assistant secretary of state matthew bryza noted that the tuesday summit had made it clear that gyurcsany , who dismissed nabucco as " a dream " in 2007 , was now fully committed to the energy supply diversification project .
on the supply side , turkmenistan and azerbaijan both indicated they would be willing to supply some of the gas .
" azerbaijan , which is according to current plans is a transit country , could eventually serve as a supplier as well , " azerbaijani president ilham aliyev said .
azerbaijan 's gas reserves of some two or three trillion cubic meters would be sufficient to last " several decades , " he said .
austrian economy minister reinhold mitterlehner suggested that egypt and iran could also be brought in as suppliers in the long term .
but a deal currently seems unlikely with iran given the long-running international standoff over its disputed nuclear program .
russia , ukraine still wrangling meanwhile , russia and ukraine were still wrangling over the details of the deal which ended their gas quarrel earlier this month .
ukrainian president viktor yushchenko said on tuesday he would stand by the terms of the agreement with russia , even though not all the details are to his liking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrangling between russia and ukraine continues but russian officials questioned his reliability , saying that the political rivalry between yushchenko and prime minister yulia timoshenko could still lead kiev to cancel the contract .
" the agreements signed are not easy ones , but ukraine fully takes up the performance -lrb- of its commitments -rrb- and guarantees full-fledged transit to european consumers , " yushchenko told journalists in brussels after a meeting with the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso .
the assurance that yushchenko would abide by the terms of the agreement finalized by timoshenko was " an important step forward in allowing us to focus on our broader relationship , " barroso said .
but the spokesman for russian prime minister vladimir putin said that moscow still feared that the growing rivalry between yushchenko and timoshenko , who are set to face off in next year 's presidential election , could torpedo the deal .
eu in talks to upgrade ukraine 's transit system yushchenko 's working breakfast with barroso was dominated by the energy question , with both men highlighting the need to upgrade ukraine 's gas-transit system and build more links between ukrainian and european energy markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could help ukraine update its transit network the commission is set to host an international conference aimed at gathering donations to upgrade ukraine 's gas-transit system on march 23 in brussels .
the eu and ukraine have agreed to form a joint expert group to plan the meeting , the leaders said tuesday .
during the conflict , barroso had warned that both russia and ukraine were damaging their credibility as reliable partners .
but on monday he said that " in bilateral relations , we are not taking any negative consequences from -lrb- the gas row -rrb- because we believe ukraine wants to deepen the relationship with the eu , and we also want to deepen the relationship with ukraine . "
he also said that " we have to state very clearly that we were disappointed by the problems between ukraine and russia , " and called for political stability and reform in ukraine .
his diplomatic balancing act is likely to have a frosty reception in moscow , where peskov said that russia " would prefer to hear from the european states a very serious and severe evaluation of who is guilty for interrupting the transit .

germany has about 3,500 soldiers stationed the country , where attacks remain a common occurance . seven years after the end of the taliban regime , afghanistan continues to be wracked by violence .
maurus wrixel , a first lieutenant in the german military , recently shared his experience at the front lines of the effort to rebuild afghanistan and restore order in the war-torn country .
wrixel is part of the german military 's " provincial reconstruction team " in feyzabad .
although the taliban never had control over this northern part of the country , german soldiers have become primary targets for islamist extremists in the region .
in november 2008 , four bundeswehr soldiers were injured near feyzabad when their patrol was attacked .
wrixel , a 27-year-old first lieutenant , said he did n't shirk away from deployment in afghanistan .
he knew of the dangers when he signed up to serve in the german military .
" it was clear to me that i was going to do it because i 'm a soldier and foreign assignments are part of that , " said the blond young man from a small town near the western german city of neuss .
facing daily danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops do n't have much contact with afghans despite months of preparation , wrixel 's deployment to afghanistan in june of 2008 made him feel queasy .
" on one hand , you 're excited because you can finally use what you 've learned for so long .
on the other hand , you wonder about all the things that could happen .
that is the double-edged part , " wrixel said .
more than 30 of his fellow soldiers have already lost their lives in afghanistan .
it 's not always easy to keep going out and doing the job , especially the day after an attack , he said .
" sometimes you hear that something has happened in the evening in kunduz and then the next day you have to go outside again , " he said .
" or you 're standing in the dark at a road crossing and people come up to you who you ca n't recognize despite night-vision devices and you just have to just hope that nothing happens . "
getting into the routine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 30 german soldiers have died in afghanistan the badakhshan province has terrain that is often compared with a lunar landscape .
there are brown , low mountain ranges with steep cliffs and the air seems to always be filled with dust .
despite its rich mineral resources , the region is the poorest in afghanistan .
the average life expectancy is 43 years and 90 percent of the population is illiterate .
it 's an area which , compared to europe , seems stuck in the middle ages .
the low level of development means there is plenty of work for german reconstruction team members , and they work hard .
it helps make the time pass more quickly .
during their free time , soldiers have few entertainment options , as security concerns make it nearly impossible for them to leave the camp .
there 's a small " fitness tent " where they can work out .
wrixel also spends afternoons playing foosball or darts or drinking coffee .
in the evening , they are allowed to drink a beer , but are limited by the so-called " two can rule " as they need to be ready to deploy at any time .
despite all the risks and annoyances , maurus wrixel is positive , calling his time in afghanistan a " super experience . "
the teamwork alone makes it worth it , he said .
" i 'd go again , if i got another offer , " he says .
but it 's unlikely that he will get another chance .
in a few months , his seven years of bundeswehr service will come to an end .
germany could become more involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks remain a near-daily occurance in afghanistan it 's possible that more soldiers like wrixel will be heading to afghanistan in the future .
germany is among those european nations bracing for demands from the new us administration that they do more in afghanistan .
but germany is reluctant to send more troops .
chancellor merkel has said that she would not accede to any request from president barack obama to send troops to southern afghanistan , the scene of much of the heavy fighting against taliban insurgents .
" wherever germany commits itself , a wholeness of military and civilian assistance should be visible , " she said .

it 's not always easy to keep going out and doing the job , especially the day after an attack , he said .
" sometimes you hear that something has happened in the evening in kunduz and then the next day you have to go outside again , " he said .
" or you 're standing in the dark at a road crossing and people come up to you who you ca n't recognize despite night-vision devices and you just have to just hope that nothing happens . "
getting into the routine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 30 german soldiers have died in afghanistan the badakhshan province has terrain that is often compared with a lunar landscape .
there are brown , low mountain ranges with steep cliffs and the air seems to always be filled with dust .
despite its rich mineral resources , the region is the poorest in afghanistan .
the average life expectancy is 43 years and 90 percent of the population is illiterate .
it 's an area which , compared to europe , seems stuck in the middle ages .
the low level of development means there is plenty of work for german reconstruction team members , and they work hard .
it helps make the time pass more quickly .
during their free time , soldiers have few entertainment options , as security concerns make it nearly impossible for them to leave the camp .
there 's a small " fitness tent " where they can work out .
wrixel also spends afternoons playing foosball or darts or drinking coffee .
in the evening , they are allowed to drink a beer , but are limited by the so-called " two can rule " as they need to be ready to deploy at any time .
despite all the risks and annoyances , maurus wrixel is positive , calling his time in afghanistan a " super experience . "
the teamwork alone makes it worth it , he said .
" i 'd go again , if i got another offer , " he says .
but it 's unlikely that he will get another chance .
in a few months , his seven years of bundeswehr service will come to an end .
germany could become more involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks remain a near-daily occurance in afghanistan it 's possible that more soldiers like wrixel will be heading to afghanistan in the future .
germany is among those european nations bracing for demands from the new us administration that they do more in afghanistan .
but germany is reluctant to send more troops .

27 , that they are prepared to provide financial backing for the nabucco gas pipeline . spurred on by europe 's worst-ever gas crisis earlier this month , which left millions of homes across the continent without heat in the depths of winter , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany invited top-ranking officials from both the eu and the countries involved in nabucco to inject fresh momentum into the slow-moving project .
nabucco , an ambitious but still-unbuilt gas pipeline aimed at reducing europe 's energy reliance on russia , is a 3,300-kilometer -lrb- 2,050-mile -rrb- pipeline between turkey and austria .
costing an estimated 7.9 billion euros , the aim is to transport up to 31 billion cubic meters of gas each year from the caspian sea to western europe , bypassing russia and ukraine .
nabucco currently has six shareholders - omv of austria , mol of hungary , transgaz of romania , bulgargaz of bulgaria , botas of turkey and rwe of germany .
but for the pipeline to get moving , nabucco would need an initial cash injection of an estimated 300 million euros .
both the eib and ebrd said they were willing to invest in the early stages of the project through a series of loans , providing certain conditions are met .
" the eib is ready to finance projects that further eu objectives of increased sustainability and energy security , " said philippe maystadt , president of the european investment bank , during the opening addresses by participants at the " nabucco summit " in hungary .
the eib is prepared to finance " up to 25 percent of project cost , " provided a secure intergovernmental agreement on the nabucco pipeline is reached , he said .
maystadt noted that of 48 billion euros of financing it provided last year , a quarter was for energy projects .
ebrd president thomas mirow also offered financial backing to the nabucco pipeline , on the condition that it " meets the requirements of solid project financing . "
the bank would need to see concrete plans and completion guarantees , besides a stable political agreement , said mirow .
eu wary of future gas crises czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu , spoke about the recent gas crisis caused by a pricing dispute between russia and ukraine that affected supplies to europe .
" a new crisis could emerge at any time , and next time it could be even worse , " topolanek said .
he added that reaching an agreement on nabucco is a " test of european solidarity . "
the latest gas row between russia and ukraine has highlighted europe 's need to diversify its energy sources and thrown the spotlight on nabucco .
but critics insist that the vast project will remain nothing but a pipe dream because its backers can not guarantee that they will ever have sufficient gas supplies to make it profitable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political will could see the eu with an alternative gas source eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs urged political leaders to commit firmly to nabucco by the end of march , or risk jeopardizing the project .
in his opening address as host , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany called on the eu to provide 200 to 300 million euros within the next few weeks to get the construction of the pipeline off the ground .
gyurcsany stressed that he was not hoping for a loan , but rather for starting capital from the eu .
us deputy assistant secretary of state matthew bryza noted that the tuesday summit had made it clear that gyurcsany , who dismissed nabucco as " a dream " in 2007 , was now fully committed to the energy supply diversification project .
on the supply side , turkmenistan and azerbaijan both indicated they would be willing to supply some of the gas .
" azerbaijan , which is according to current plans is a transit country , could eventually serve as a supplier as well , " azerbaijani president ilham aliyev said .
azerbaijan 's gas reserves of some two or three trillion cubic meters would be sufficient to last " several decades , " he said .
austrian economy minister reinhold mitterlehner suggested that egypt and iran could also be brought in as suppliers in the long term .
but a deal currently seems unlikely with iran given the long-running international standoff over its disputed nuclear program .
russia , ukraine still wrangling meanwhile , russia and ukraine were still wrangling over the details of the deal which ended their gas quarrel earlier this month .
ukrainian president viktor yushchenko said on tuesday he would stand by the terms of the agreement with russia , even though not all the details are to his liking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrangling between russia and ukraine continues but russian officials questioned his reliability , saying that the political rivalry between yushchenko and prime minister yulia timoshenko could still lead kiev to cancel the contract .
" the agreements signed are not easy ones , but ukraine fully takes up the performance -lrb- of its commitments -rrb- and guarantees full-fledged transit to european consumers , " yushchenko told journalists in brussels after a meeting with the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso .
the assurance that yushchenko would abide by the terms of the agreement finalized by timoshenko was " an important step forward in allowing us to focus on our broader relationship , " barroso said .
but the spokesman for russian prime minister vladimir putin said that moscow still feared that the growing rivalry between yushchenko and timoshenko , who are set to face off in next year 's presidential election , could torpedo the deal .
eu in talks to upgrade ukraine 's transit system yushchenko 's working breakfast with barroso was dominated by the energy question , with both men highlighting the need to upgrade ukraine 's gas-transit system and build more links between ukrainian and european energy markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could help ukraine update its transit network the commission is set to host an international conference aimed at gathering donations to upgrade ukraine 's gas-transit system on march 23 in brussels .
the eu and ukraine have agreed to form a joint expert group to plan the meeting , the leaders said tuesday .
during the conflict , barroso had warned that both russia and ukraine were damaging their credibility as reliable partners .
but on monday he said that " in bilateral relations , we are not taking any negative consequences from -lrb- the gas row -rrb- because we believe ukraine wants to deepen the relationship with the eu , and we also want to deepen the relationship with ukraine . "
he also said that " we have to state very clearly that we were disappointed by the problems between ukraine and russia , " and called for political stability and reform in ukraine .
his diplomatic balancing act is likely to have a frosty reception in moscow , where peskov said that russia " would prefer to hear from the european states a very serious and severe evaluation of who is guilty for interrupting the transit .

27 , marks international holocaust day .
dw 's cornelia rabitz says that it 's time for europe to find a common discourse on remembering the darkest part of the continent 's past to ensure a bright future . about 1 million people from around the world visit the auschwitz memorial each year to commemorate the victims of the holocaust .
it 's a significant number of people , who still come to the museum to get an idea of living and dying in this former antechamber of hell - and to learn from history . memorial officials recently rang sounded an alarm , saying that the buildings are in danger of collapsing and that a lot of money is needed for their restoration .
germany reacted quickly and said that it would help out financially .
and rightly so .
more than six decades after the end of the war , it remains a duty for state and society to accept historic responsibility and keep the memory alive - even if this becomes more and more difficult as the distance of time keeps growing and eyewitnesses die . history books , museums , tv documentaries and movie films have to replace personal conversations .
the ability to relate to the topic - both in terms of time and emotions - continues to wane . to learn from history also means to look at today and arm ourselves against discrimination , racism , xenophobia and - needless to say - anti-semitism .
it 's depressing to see that the conflict between israelis and palestinians has led to falling inhibition thresholds and that jewish people are becoming the targets of hate mail - especially in germany . it 's alarming that anti-semitic stereotypes persist , as polls show again and again .
it 's alarming that neo-nazis drum people together for noisy demonstrations , that propaganda and historical misrepresentation find receptive audiences in our society . still : there will be a large number of events , lectures and concerts to commemorate tuesday 's holocaust day .
they will offer a chance to deal with the issue .
keeping the memory alive could become a european task .
a unifying europe should agree on a common discourse of memory .
dealing with the dark sides of one 's past still can not be taken for granted everywhere . germany , with its long and hard path towards coming to terms with its national socialist crimes and guilt , could certainly serve as an example . cornelia rabitz covers culture for dw-radio -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 27.01.2009 jewish leaders boycott german holocaust memorial ceremony großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while some jewish leaders attended the ceremony , council representatives were absent germany has remembered the victims of national socialism with a variety of events .
but the country 's jewish leaders chose to skip the main government ceremony on tuesday in protest for what they say is lack of respect . germany 's leading jewish organization , the central council of jews in germany , said it was boycotting the memorial event in the german parliament because surviving victims had not been personally acknowledged in the past .
" i would understand it if we were talking about representatives of the second or third generations , " council general secretary stephan j. kramer told ap news agency .
" but it can not be that actual survivors are treated like mere onlookers . "
german president horst koehler addressed the bundestag in a speech marking the 64th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz concentration camp .
january 27th has been the official day for holocaust remembrance in germany since 1996 .
some of those who took part in the ceremony were critical of the council 's decision .
" in recent years , we 've always had very dignified hours of remembrance with a variety of participants , " social democratic cultural spokeswoman monika griefahn said in an interview with a berlin radio station .
but the boycott comes at a time in which many jewish leaders in germany are questioning whether the country is doing enough to combat anti-semitism .
gaza fallout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president koehler , middle , and other german leaders observed the occasion kramer said the most recent hostilities between israel and palestinians had led to an upsurge in anti-jewish sentiment in germany .
" we have been forced to register that during the war in gaza the number of hate mails sent to the council has increased by around 40 percent to 200-300 per week , " kramer told ap .
he added that some of those mails contained explicit death threats toward council members .
in his speech before the reichstag , president koehler called for greater solidarity with german jews .
" let us stand beside our fellow jewish citizens , " koehler said .
" whoever attacks them attacks all of us as well . "
but jewish leaders are also disappointed at germany 's reaction to pope benedict xvi 's decision to repeal the excommunication of a priest for holocaust denial .
in an interview with a german tv station , council president charlotte knobloch said she was outraged by the decision taken by the german pontiff .
more than just words ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz was liberated 64 years ago the rancor might cause some to question whether holocaust memorial day serves any other purpose than to pay ritualistic lip-service to a historical tragedy and injustice .
but yehuda bauer , the director of the yad vashem holocaust memorial in israel , says that ceremonies like the one in the bundestag can serve a valuable purpose .
" the ritual can gain in content and can be presented so that true thoughts and feelings are behind it , " bauer said in an interview with a german radio station .
the israeli historian said the occasion was also useful in lending historical perspective to recent events .
" genocide is the attempt to partially or completely exterminate a national , ethnic , religious or racial group , " bauer said .
" what happened in gaza is a conflict , a bloody conflict between two nationalities like in sri lanka , kashmir and other places .
they are not genocides . "
" what is happening in darfur and what happened in rwanda are genocides , " bauer added .
" you have to distinguish . "
during world war ii , the nazi regime organized the systematic killings of some six million jews , most of them in eastern europe .
the nazis also targeted sinti and roma and homosexuals for wholesale extermination . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany has about 3,500 soldiers stationed the country , where attacks remain a common occurance . seven years after the end of the taliban regime , afghanistan continues to be wracked by violence .
maurus wrixel , a first lieutenant in the german military , recently shared his experience at the front lines of the effort to rebuild afghanistan and restore order in the war-torn country .
wrixel is part of the german military 's " provincial reconstruction team " in feyzabad .
although the taliban never had control over this northern part of the country , german soldiers have become primary targets for islamist extremists in the region .
in november 2008 , four bundeswehr soldiers were injured near feyzabad when their patrol was attacked .
wrixel , a 27-year-old first lieutenant , said he did n't shirk away from deployment in afghanistan .
he knew of the dangers when he signed up to serve in the german military .
" it was clear to me that i was going to do it because i 'm a soldier and foreign assignments are part of that , " said the blond young man from a small town near the western german city of neuss .
facing daily danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops do n't have much contact with afghans despite months of preparation , wrixel 's deployment to afghanistan in june of 2008 made him feel queasy .
" on one hand , you 're excited because you can finally use what you 've learned for so long .
on the other hand , you wonder about all the things that could happen .
that is the double-edged part , " wrixel said .
more than 30 of his fellow soldiers have already lost their lives in afghanistan .
it 's not always easy to keep going out and doing the job , especially the day after an attack , he said .
" sometimes you hear that something has happened in the evening in kunduz and then the next day you have to go outside again , " he said .
" or you 're standing in the dark at a road crossing and people come up to you who you ca n't recognize despite night-vision devices and you just have to just hope that nothing happens . "
getting into the routine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 30 german soldiers have died in afghanistan the badakhshan province has terrain that is often compared with a lunar landscape .
there are brown , low mountain ranges with steep cliffs and the air seems to always be filled with dust .
despite its rich mineral resources , the region is the poorest in afghanistan .
the average life expectancy is 43 years and 90 percent of the population is illiterate .
it 's an area which , compared to europe , seems stuck in the middle ages .
the low level of development means there is plenty of work for german reconstruction team members , and they work hard .
it helps make the time pass more quickly .
during their free time , soldiers have few entertainment options , as security concerns make it nearly impossible for them to leave the camp .
there 's a small " fitness tent " where they can work out .
wrixel also spends afternoons playing foosball or darts or drinking coffee .
in the evening , they are allowed to drink a beer , but are limited by the so-called " two can rule " as they need to be ready to deploy at any time .
despite all the risks and annoyances , maurus wrixel is positive , calling his time in afghanistan a " super experience . "
the teamwork alone makes it worth it , he said .
" i 'd go again , if i got another offer , " he says .
but it 's unlikely that he will get another chance .
in a few months , his seven years of bundeswehr service will come to an end .
germany could become more involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks remain a near-daily occurance in afghanistan it 's possible that more soldiers like wrixel will be heading to afghanistan in the future .
germany is among those european nations bracing for demands from the new us administration that they do more in afghanistan .
but germany is reluctant to send more troops .
chancellor merkel has said that she would not accede to any request from president barack obama to send troops to southern afghanistan , the scene of much of the heavy fighting against taliban insurgents .
" wherever germany commits itself , a wholeness of military and civilian assistance should be visible , " she said .

germany has about 3,500 soldiers stationed the country , where attacks remain a common occurance . seven years after the end of the taliban regime , afghanistan continues to be wracked by violence .
maurus wrixel , a first lieutenant in the german military , recently shared his experience at the front lines of the effort to rebuild afghanistan and restore order in the war-torn country .
wrixel is part of the german military 's " provincial reconstruction team " in feyzabad .
although the taliban never had control over this northern part of the country , german soldiers have become primary targets for islamist extremists in the region .
in november 2008 , four bundeswehr soldiers were injured near feyzabad when their patrol was attacked .
wrixel , a 27-year-old first lieutenant , said he did n't shirk away from deployment in afghanistan .
he knew of the dangers when he signed up to serve in the german military .
" it was clear to me that i was going to do it because i 'm a soldier and foreign assignments are part of that , " said the blond young man from a small town near the western german city of neuss .
facing daily danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops do n't have much contact with afghans despite months of preparation , wrixel 's deployment to afghanistan in june of 2008 made him feel queasy .
" on one hand , you 're excited because you can finally use what you 've learned for so long .
on the other hand , you wonder about all the things that could happen .
that is the double-edged part , " wrixel said .
more than 30 of his fellow soldiers have already lost their lives in afghanistan .
it 's not always easy to keep going out and doing the job , especially the day after an attack , he said .
" sometimes you hear that something has happened in the evening in kunduz and then the next day you have to go outside again , " he said .
" or you 're standing in the dark at a road crossing and people come up to you who you ca n't recognize despite night-vision devices and you just have to just hope that nothing happens . "

there are brown , low mountain ranges with steep cliffs and the air seems to always be filled with dust .
despite its rich mineral resources , the region is the poorest in afghanistan .
the average life expectancy is 43 years and 90 percent of the population is illiterate .
it 's an area which , compared to europe , seems stuck in the middle ages .
the low level of development means there is plenty of work for german reconstruction team members , and they work hard .
it helps make the time pass more quickly .
during their free time , soldiers have few entertainment options , as security concerns make it nearly impossible for them to leave the camp .
there 's a small " fitness tent " where they can work out .
wrixel also spends afternoons playing foosball or darts or drinking coffee .
in the evening , they are allowed to drink a beer , but are limited by the so-called " two can rule " as they need to be ready to deploy at any time .
despite all the risks and annoyances , maurus wrixel is positive , calling his time in afghanistan a " super experience . "
the teamwork alone makes it worth it , he said .
" i 'd go again , if i got another offer , " he says .
but it 's unlikely that he will get another chance .
in a few months , his seven years of bundeswehr service will come to an end .

germany is among those european nations bracing for demands from the new us administration that they do more in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 27.01.2009 jewish leaders boycott german holocaust memorial ceremony großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while some jewish leaders attended the ceremony , council representatives were absent germany has remembered the victims of national socialism with a variety of events .
but the country 's jewish leaders chose to skip the main government ceremony on tuesday in protest for what they say is lack of respect . germany 's leading jewish organization , the central council of jews in germany , said it was boycotting the memorial event in the german parliament because surviving victims had not been personally acknowledged in the past .
" i would understand it if we were talking about representatives of the second or third generations , " council general secretary stephan j. kramer told ap news agency .
" but it can not be that actual survivors are treated like mere onlookers . "
german president horst koehler addressed the bundestag in a speech marking the 64th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz concentration camp .
january 27th has been the official day for holocaust remembrance in germany since 1996 .
some of those who took part in the ceremony were critical of the council 's decision .
" in recent years , we 've always had very dignified hours of remembrance with a variety of participants , " social democratic cultural spokeswoman monika griefahn said in an interview with a berlin radio station .
but the boycott comes at a time in which many jewish leaders in germany are questioning whether the country is doing enough to combat anti-semitism .
gaza fallout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president koehler , middle , and other german leaders observed the occasion kramer said the most recent hostilities between israel and palestinians had led to an upsurge in anti-jewish sentiment in germany .
" we have been forced to register that during the war in gaza the number of hate mails sent to the council has increased by around 40 percent to 200-300 per week , " kramer told ap .
he added that some of those mails contained explicit death threats toward council members .
in his speech before the reichstag , president koehler called for greater solidarity with german jews .
" let us stand beside our fellow jewish citizens , " koehler said .
" whoever attacks them attacks all of us as well . "
but jewish leaders are also disappointed at germany 's reaction to pope benedict xvi 's decision to repeal the excommunication of a priest for holocaust denial .
in an interview with a german tv station , council president charlotte knobloch said she was outraged by the decision taken by the german pontiff .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz was liberated 64 years ago the rancor might cause some to question whether holocaust memorial day serves any other purpose than to pay ritualistic lip-service to a historical tragedy and injustice .
but yehuda bauer , the director of the yad vashem holocaust memorial in israel , says that ceremonies like the one in the bundestag can serve a valuable purpose .
" the ritual can gain in content and can be presented so that true thoughts and feelings are behind it , " bauer said in an interview with a german radio station .
the israeli historian said the occasion was also useful in lending historical perspective to recent events .
" genocide is the attempt to partially or completely exterminate a national , ethnic , religious or racial group , " bauer said .
" what happened in gaza is a conflict , a bloody conflict between two nationalities like in sri lanka , kashmir and other places .
they are not genocides . "
" what is happening in darfur and what happened in rwanda are genocides , " bauer added .
" you have to distinguish . "
during world war ii , the nazi regime organized the systematic killings of some six million jews , most of them in eastern europe .
the nazis also targeted sinti and roma and homosexuals for wholesale extermination . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , that they are prepared to provide financial backing for the nabucco gas pipeline . spurred on by europe 's worst-ever gas crisis earlier this month , which left millions of homes across the continent without heat in the depths of winter , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany invited top-ranking officials from both the eu and the countries involved in nabucco to inject fresh momentum into the slow-moving project .
nabucco , an ambitious but still-unbuilt gas pipeline aimed at reducing europe 's energy reliance on russia , is a 3,300-kilometer -lrb- 2,050-mile -rrb- pipeline between turkey and austria .
costing an estimated 7.9 billion euros , the aim is to transport up to 31 billion cubic meters of gas each year from the caspian sea to western europe , bypassing russia and ukraine .
nabucco currently has six shareholders - omv of austria , mol of hungary , transgaz of romania , bulgargaz of bulgaria , botas of turkey and rwe of germany .
but for the pipeline to get moving , nabucco would need an initial cash injection of an estimated 300 million euros .
both the eib and ebrd said they were willing to invest in the early stages of the project through a series of loans , providing certain conditions are met .
" the eib is ready to finance projects that further eu objectives of increased sustainability and energy security , " said philippe maystadt , president of the european investment bank , during the opening addresses by participants at the " nabucco summit " in hungary .
the eib is prepared to finance " up to 25 percent of project cost , " provided a secure intergovernmental agreement on the nabucco pipeline is reached , he said .
maystadt noted that of 48 billion euros of financing it provided last year , a quarter was for energy projects .
ebrd president thomas mirow also offered financial backing to the nabucco pipeline , on the condition that it " meets the requirements of solid project financing . "
the bank would need to see concrete plans and completion guarantees , besides a stable political agreement , said mirow .
eu wary of future gas crises czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu , spoke about the recent gas crisis caused by a pricing dispute between russia and ukraine that affected supplies to europe .
" a new crisis could emerge at any time , and next time it could be even worse , " topolanek said .
he added that reaching an agreement on nabucco is a " test of european solidarity . "
the latest gas row between russia and ukraine has highlighted europe 's need to diversify its energy sources and thrown the spotlight on nabucco .
but critics insist that the vast project will remain nothing but a pipe dream because its backers can not guarantee that they will ever have sufficient gas supplies to make it profitable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political will could see the eu with an alternative gas source eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs urged political leaders to commit firmly to nabucco by the end of march , or risk jeopardizing the project .
in his opening address as host , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany called on the eu to provide 200 to 300 million euros within the next few weeks to get the construction of the pipeline off the ground .
gyurcsany stressed that he was not hoping for a loan , but rather for starting capital from the eu .
us deputy assistant secretary of state matthew bryza noted that the tuesday summit had made it clear that gyurcsany , who dismissed nabucco as " a dream " in 2007 , was now fully committed to the energy supply diversification project .
on the supply side , turkmenistan and azerbaijan both indicated they would be willing to supply some of the gas .
" azerbaijan , which is according to current plans is a transit country , could eventually serve as a supplier as well , " azerbaijani president ilham aliyev said .
azerbaijan 's gas reserves of some two or three trillion cubic meters would be sufficient to last " several decades , " he said .
austrian economy minister reinhold mitterlehner suggested that egypt and iran could also be brought in as suppliers in the long term .
but a deal currently seems unlikely with iran given the long-running international standoff over its disputed nuclear program .
russia , ukraine still wrangling meanwhile , russia and ukraine were still wrangling over the details of the deal which ended their gas quarrel earlier this month .
ukrainian president viktor yushchenko said on tuesday he would stand by the terms of the agreement with russia , even though not all the details are to his liking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrangling between russia and ukraine continues but russian officials questioned his reliability , saying that the political rivalry between yushchenko and prime minister yulia timoshenko could still lead kiev to cancel the contract .
" the agreements signed are not easy ones , but ukraine fully takes up the performance -lrb- of its commitments -rrb- and guarantees full-fledged transit to european consumers , " yushchenko told journalists in brussels after a meeting with the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso .
the assurance that yushchenko would abide by the terms of the agreement finalized by timoshenko was " an important step forward in allowing us to focus on our broader relationship , " barroso said .
but the spokesman for russian prime minister vladimir putin said that moscow still feared that the growing rivalry between yushchenko and timoshenko , who are set to face off in next year 's presidential election , could torpedo the deal .
eu in talks to upgrade ukraine 's transit system yushchenko 's working breakfast with barroso was dominated by the energy question , with both men highlighting the need to upgrade ukraine 's gas-transit system and build more links between ukrainian and european energy markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could help ukraine update its transit network the commission is set to host an international conference aimed at gathering donations to upgrade ukraine 's gas-transit system on march 23 in brussels .
the eu and ukraine have agreed to form a joint expert group to plan the meeting , the leaders said tuesday .
during the conflict , barroso had warned that both russia and ukraine were damaging their credibility as reliable partners .
but on monday he said that " in bilateral relations , we are not taking any negative consequences from -lrb- the gas row -rrb- because we believe ukraine wants to deepen the relationship with the eu , and we also want to deepen the relationship with ukraine . "
he also said that " we have to state very clearly that we were disappointed by the problems between ukraine and russia , " and called for political stability and reform in ukraine .
his diplomatic balancing act is likely to have a frosty reception in moscow , where peskov said that russia " would prefer to hear from the european states a very serious and severe evaluation of who is guilty for interrupting the transit .

27 , that they are prepared to provide financial backing for the nabucco gas pipeline . spurred on by europe 's worst-ever gas crisis earlier this month , which left millions of homes across the continent without heat in the depths of winter , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany invited top-ranking officials from both the eu and the countries involved in nabucco to inject fresh momentum into the slow-moving project .
nabucco , an ambitious but still-unbuilt gas pipeline aimed at reducing europe 's energy reliance on russia , is a 3,300-kilometer -lrb- 2,050-mile -rrb- pipeline between turkey and austria .
costing an estimated 7.9 billion euros , the aim is to transport up to 31 billion cubic meters of gas each year from the caspian sea to western europe , bypassing russia and ukraine .
nabucco currently has six shareholders - omv of austria , mol of hungary , transgaz of romania , bulgargaz of bulgaria , botas of turkey and rwe of germany .
but for the pipeline to get moving , nabucco would need an initial cash injection of an estimated 300 million euros .
both the eib and ebrd said they were willing to invest in the early stages of the project through a series of loans , providing certain conditions are met .
" the eib is ready to finance projects that further eu objectives of increased sustainability and energy security , " said philippe maystadt , president of the european investment bank , during the opening addresses by participants at the " nabucco summit " in hungary .
the eib is prepared to finance " up to 25 percent of project cost , " provided a secure intergovernmental agreement on the nabucco pipeline is reached , he said .
maystadt noted that of 48 billion euros of financing it provided last year , a quarter was for energy projects .
ebrd president thomas mirow also offered financial backing to the nabucco pipeline , on the condition that it " meets the requirements of solid project financing . "
the bank would need to see concrete plans and completion guarantees , besides a stable political agreement , said mirow .
eu wary of future gas crises czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu , spoke about the recent gas crisis caused by a pricing dispute between russia and ukraine that affected supplies to europe .
" a new crisis could emerge at any time , and next time it could be even worse , " topolanek said .
he added that reaching an agreement on nabucco is a " test of european solidarity . "
the latest gas row between russia and ukraine has highlighted europe 's need to diversify its energy sources and thrown the spotlight on nabucco .
but critics insist that the vast project will remain nothing but a pipe dream because its backers can not guarantee that they will ever have sufficient gas supplies to make it profitable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political will could see the eu with an alternative gas source eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs urged political leaders to commit firmly to nabucco by the end of march , or risk jeopardizing the project .
in his opening address as host , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany called on the eu to provide 200 to 300 million euros within the next few weeks to get the construction of the pipeline off the ground .
gyurcsany stressed that he was not hoping for a loan , but rather for starting capital from the eu .
us deputy assistant secretary of state matthew bryza noted that the tuesday summit had made it clear that gyurcsany , who dismissed nabucco as " a dream " in 2007 , was now fully committed to the energy supply diversification project .
on the supply side , turkmenistan and azerbaijan both indicated they would be willing to supply some of the gas .
" azerbaijan , which is according to current plans is a transit country , could eventually serve as a supplier as well , " azerbaijani president ilham aliyev said .
azerbaijan 's gas reserves of some two or three trillion cubic meters would be sufficient to last " several decades , " he said .
austrian economy minister reinhold mitterlehner suggested that egypt and iran could also be brought in as suppliers in the long term .
but a deal currently seems unlikely with iran given the long-running international standoff over its disputed nuclear program .
russia , ukraine still wrangling meanwhile , russia and ukraine were still wrangling over the details of the deal which ended their gas quarrel earlier this month .
ukrainian president viktor yushchenko said on tuesday he would stand by the terms of the agreement with russia , even though not all the details are to his liking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrangling between russia and ukraine continues but russian officials questioned his reliability , saying that the political rivalry between yushchenko and prime minister yulia timoshenko could still lead kiev to cancel the contract .
" the agreements signed are not easy ones , but ukraine fully takes up the performance -lrb- of its commitments -rrb- and guarantees full-fledged transit to european consumers , " yushchenko told journalists in brussels after a meeting with the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso .
the assurance that yushchenko would abide by the terms of the agreement finalized by timoshenko was " an important step forward in allowing us to focus on our broader relationship , " barroso said .
but the spokesman for russian prime minister vladimir putin said that moscow still feared that the growing rivalry between yushchenko and timoshenko , who are set to face off in next year 's presidential election , could torpedo the deal .
eu in talks to upgrade ukraine 's transit system yushchenko 's working breakfast with barroso was dominated by the energy question , with both men highlighting the need to upgrade ukraine 's gas-transit system and build more links between ukrainian and european energy markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could help ukraine update its transit network the commission is set to host an international conference aimed at gathering donations to upgrade ukraine 's gas-transit system on march 23 in brussels .
the eu and ukraine have agreed to form a joint expert group to plan the meeting , the leaders said tuesday .
during the conflict , barroso had warned that both russia and ukraine were damaging their credibility as reliable partners .
but on monday he said that " in bilateral relations , we are not taking any negative consequences from -lrb- the gas row -rrb- because we believe ukraine wants to deepen the relationship with the eu , and we also want to deepen the relationship with ukraine . "

27 , marks international holocaust day .
dw 's cornelia rabitz says that it 's time for europe to find a common discourse on remembering the darkest part of the continent 's past to ensure a bright future . about 1 million people from around the world visit the auschwitz memorial each year to commemorate the victims of the holocaust .
it 's a significant number of people , who still come to the museum to get an idea of living and dying in this former antechamber of hell - and to learn from history . memorial officials recently rang sounded an alarm , saying that the buildings are in danger of collapsing and that a lot of money is needed for their restoration .
germany reacted quickly and said that it would help out financially .
and rightly so .
more than six decades after the end of the war , it remains a duty for state and society to accept historic responsibility and keep the memory alive - even if this becomes more and more difficult as the distance of time keeps growing and eyewitnesses die . history books , museums , tv documentaries and movie films have to replace personal conversations .
the ability to relate to the topic - both in terms of time and emotions - continues to wane . to learn from history also means to look at today and arm ourselves against discrimination , racism , xenophobia and - needless to say - anti-semitism .
it 's depressing to see that the conflict between israelis and palestinians has led to falling inhibition thresholds and that jewish people are becoming the targets of hate mail - especially in germany . it 's alarming that anti-semitic stereotypes persist , as polls show again and again .
it 's alarming that neo-nazis drum people together for noisy demonstrations , that propaganda and historical misrepresentation find receptive audiences in our society . still : there will be a large number of events , lectures and concerts to commemorate tuesday 's holocaust day .
they will offer a chance to deal with the issue .
keeping the memory alive could become a european task .
a unifying europe should agree on a common discourse of memory .
dealing with the dark sides of one 's past still can not be taken for granted everywhere . germany , with its long and hard path towards coming to terms with its national socialist crimes and guilt , could certainly serve as an example . cornelia rabitz covers culture for dw-radio -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 27.01.2009 obama calls europe , gets largely cooperative response großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo is one of the most tricky issues right now for obama the new us president capped off his first week in office by phoning the leaders of france , germany and russia .
obama 's internationalist style is drawing positive reviews , but disagreements still loom . one week into his presidency , barack obama seems to be making good on his campaign pledge to adopt a more multilateral approach to global problems than his predecessor .
on monday , jan .
26 , obama gave his first formal television interview to the arab-language channel al-arabiya , in which he sought to reassure muslims in the middle east that " americans are not your enemy . "
he also put in telephone calls to french president nicolas sarkozy , german chancellor angela merkel and russia president dmitry medvedev .
obama and sarkozy conversed for 30 minutes .
afterwards , in a statement , the french president said they have agreed to work together in " resolute fashion " on the reconstruction of afghanistan , the global economic crisis and obama 's plan to shut down the controversial army detention center in guantanamo bay , cuba .
obama 's talks with merkel and medvedev reportedly focused on many of the same issues .
relations between the united states and france , germany and russia cooled under obama 's predecessor george w. bush - in part because those three countries refused to support the us-led war on iraq .
in the realm of foreign policy , obama concentrated much of his first week in office on the middle east .
but monday 's calls suggest that he wants to increase cooperation between the us and europe as well .
media hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama supports states ' effort to reduce co2 emissions the decisions taken by obama during his first seven days are going down well with european newspapers , most of which took a dim view of bush and what were perceived as his short-sighted , unilateral policies .
" the diversity of the decisions and directives in the past seven days gives us an idea not only of obama 's political caliber … but also of his modus operandi : his ability to decide cleverly and maneuver between hostile ideological fronts , " wrote the italian newspaper la repubblica .
european opinion-makers have welcomed the appointment of former senator george mitchell , the architect of peace in northern ireland , as us special envoy to the middle east .
" our hopes are with him and the new american government , " wrote the french paper paris-normandie .
" so that words and reason can finally silence weapons . "
europeans are also encouraged by obama 's environmental policies , which place greater emphasis on clean energy sources .
" it is truly a major event that the president of the world 's most powerful nation and one of its biggest polluters definitively acknowledges the need for new and more responsible policies , " wrote the french paper la presse de la manche .
guantanamo and other dilemmas bildunterschrift : how long will the smiles between obama and europe last ? but while the honeymoon continues for now , there are issues on which the obama administration and europe do not see eye to eye .
russia , for instance , has said it will cooperate with washington on fighting terrorism , especially in afghanistan , but has also stressed that it wants more understanding from the us in return .
and merkel 's conservative-led government in germany has been noticeably less enthusiastic than france about the idea that eu countries could take in some of the prisoners released from guantanamo .
some european newspapers are echoing the resistance to that idea .
" without any logic at all , the us is insisting that -lsb- detainees -rsb- be dispersed to countries that have more-or-less actively participated in the war on terror , " wrote the conservative-leaning danish paper jyllands-posten .
" it would be more obvious to send them back to their home countries . "
moreover , some left-wing commentators are disappointed in the sort of change obama has brought to us policies - and in particular his stated aim to step up america 's military efforts in afghanistan .
" the first democratic president in the modern era to be elected on an anti-war ticket is also , to the relief of neocons and the liberal belligerati , a hawk , " wrote richard seymour in britain 's guardian newspaper .
if obama follows through with his plan to seek a military solution in afghanistan , he will likely call on america 's european allies to do more - something that may not sit very well with eu leaders , who have been historically skittish about sending troops abroad . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

obama 's internationalist style is drawing positive reviews , but disagreements still loom . one week into his presidency , barack obama seems to be making good on his campaign pledge to adopt a more multilateral approach to global problems than his predecessor .
on monday , jan .
26 , obama gave his first formal television interview to the arab-language channel al-arabiya , in which he sought to reassure muslims in the middle east that " americans are not your enemy . "
he also put in telephone calls to french president nicolas sarkozy , german chancellor angela merkel and russia president dmitry medvedev .
obama and sarkozy conversed for 30 minutes .
afterwards , in a statement , the french president said they have agreed to work together in " resolute fashion " on the reconstruction of afghanistan , the global economic crisis and obama 's plan to shut down the controversial army detention center in guantanamo bay , cuba .
obama 's talks with merkel and medvedev reportedly focused on many of the same issues .
relations between the united states and france , germany and russia cooled under obama 's predecessor george w. bush - in part because those three countries refused to support the us-led war on iraq .
in the realm of foreign policy , obama concentrated much of his first week in office on the middle east .
but monday 's calls suggest that he wants to increase cooperation between the us and europe as well .
media hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama supports states ' effort to reduce co2 emissions the decisions taken by obama during his first seven days are going down well with european newspapers , most of which took a dim view of bush and what were perceived as his short-sighted , unilateral policies .
" the diversity of the decisions and directives in the past seven days gives us an idea not only of obama 's political caliber … but also of his modus operandi : his ability to decide cleverly and maneuver between hostile ideological fronts , " wrote the italian newspaper la repubblica .
european opinion-makers have welcomed the appointment of former senator george mitchell , the architect of peace in northern ireland , as us special envoy to the middle east .
" our hopes are with him and the new american government , " wrote the french paper paris-normandie .
" so that words and reason can finally silence weapons . "
europeans are also encouraged by obama 's environmental policies , which place greater emphasis on clean energy sources .
" it is truly a major event that the president of the world 's most powerful nation and one of its biggest polluters definitively acknowledges the need for new and more responsible policies , " wrote the french paper la presse de la manche .
guantanamo and other dilemmas bildunterschrift : how long will the smiles between obama and europe last ? but while the honeymoon continues for now , there are issues on which the obama administration and europe do not see eye to eye .
russia , for instance , has said it will cooperate with washington on fighting terrorism , especially in afghanistan , but has also stressed that it wants more understanding from the us in return .
and merkel 's conservative-led government in germany has been noticeably less enthusiastic than france about the idea that eu countries could take in some of the prisoners released from guantanamo .
some european newspapers are echoing the resistance to that idea .
" without any logic at all , the us is insisting that -lsb- detainees -rsb- be dispersed to countries that have more-or-less actively participated in the war on terror , " wrote the conservative-leaning danish paper jyllands-posten .
" it would be more obvious to send them back to their home countries . "
moreover , some left-wing commentators are disappointed in the sort of change obama has brought to us policies - and in particular his stated aim to step up america 's military efforts in afghanistan .
" the first democratic president in the modern era to be elected on an anti-war ticket is also , to the relief of neocons and the liberal belligerati , a hawk , " wrote richard seymour in britain 's guardian newspaper .
if obama follows through with his plan to seek a military solution in afghanistan , he will likely call on america 's european allies to do more - something that may not sit very well with eu leaders , who have been historically skittish about sending troops abroad . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 27.01.2009 obama calls europe , gets largely cooperative response großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo is one of the most tricky issues right now for obama the new us president capped off his first week in office by phoning the leaders of france , germany and russia .
obama 's internationalist style is drawing positive reviews , but disagreements still loom . one week into his presidency , barack obama seems to be making good on his campaign pledge to adopt a more multilateral approach to global problems than his predecessor .
on monday , jan .
26 , obama gave his first formal television interview to the arab-language channel al-arabiya , in which he sought to reassure muslims in the middle east that " americans are not your enemy . "
he also put in telephone calls to french president nicolas sarkozy , german chancellor angela merkel and russia president dmitry medvedev .
obama and sarkozy conversed for 30 minutes .
afterwards , in a statement , the french president said they have agreed to work together in " resolute fashion " on the reconstruction of afghanistan , the global economic crisis and obama 's plan to shut down the controversial army detention center in guantanamo bay , cuba .
obama 's talks with merkel and medvedev reportedly focused on many of the same issues .
relations between the united states and france , germany and russia cooled under obama 's predecessor george w. bush - in part because those three countries refused to support the us-led war on iraq .
in the realm of foreign policy , obama concentrated much of his first week in office on the middle east .
but monday 's calls suggest that he wants to increase cooperation between the us and europe as well .
media hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama supports states ' effort to reduce co2 emissions the decisions taken by obama during his first seven days are going down well with european newspapers , most of which took a dim view of bush and what were perceived as his short-sighted , unilateral policies .
" the diversity of the decisions and directives in the past seven days gives us an idea not only of obama 's political caliber … but also of his modus operandi : his ability to decide cleverly and maneuver between hostile ideological fronts , " wrote the italian newspaper la repubblica .
european opinion-makers have welcomed the appointment of former senator george mitchell , the architect of peace in northern ireland , as us special envoy to the middle east .
" our hopes are with him and the new american government , " wrote the french paper paris-normandie .
" so that words and reason can finally silence weapons . "
europeans are also encouraged by obama 's environmental policies , which place greater emphasis on clean energy sources .
" it is truly a major event that the president of the world 's most powerful nation and one of its biggest polluters definitively acknowledges the need for new and more responsible policies , " wrote the french paper la presse de la manche .
guantanamo and other dilemmas bildunterschrift : how long will the smiles between obama and europe last ? but while the honeymoon continues for now , there are issues on which the obama administration and europe do not see eye to eye .
russia , for instance , has said it will cooperate with washington on fighting terrorism , especially in afghanistan , but has also stressed that it wants more understanding from the us in return .
and merkel 's conservative-led government in germany has been noticeably less enthusiastic than france about the idea that eu countries could take in some of the prisoners released from guantanamo .
some european newspapers are echoing the resistance to that idea .
" without any logic at all , the us is insisting that -lsb- detainees -rsb- be dispersed to countries that have more-or-less actively participated in the war on terror , " wrote the conservative-leaning danish paper jyllands-posten .
" it would be more obvious to send them back to their home countries . "
moreover , some left-wing commentators are disappointed in the sort of change obama has brought to us policies - and in particular his stated aim to step up america 's military efforts in afghanistan .
" the first democratic president in the modern era to be elected on an anti-war ticket is also , to the relief of neocons and the liberal belligerati , a hawk , " wrote richard seymour in britain 's guardian newspaper .
if obama follows through with his plan to seek a military solution in afghanistan , he will likely call on america 's european allies to do more - something that may not sit very well with eu leaders , who have been historically skittish about sending troops abroad . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now it has another problem arising from the hardware . " for sale : six security scanners in original packing , never used .
perfect for airport checks and entrances at highly sensitive locations .
sold separately or as one job lot .
open to offers of around 120,000 euros -lrb- $ 158,000 -rrb- each . "
at first glance , this -lrb- fabricated -rrb- advert may suggest that the european union is feeling the pinch in the current financial climate and is looking to put some much needed extra revenue back into its coffers .
but on closer inspection , the ad reveals not that the eu is hard-up for cash and has to sell off its equipment but that it is ready to offload some controversial hardware due to its embarrassing nature .
taking a closer look at the small print , one can see why : " caution – these scanners can provide unwanted and intrusive naked images . "
the scanners in question , currently being stored in the basements of the european parliament buildings in brussels and strasbourg , have been at the center of a heated debate since october when eu nations began arguing over plans to introduce the body scanners at airports around the continent .
those in favor stressed the need for such equipment in the fight against terrorism while others opposed the scanners over concerns about voyeurism .
a question of dignity and security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scanner shows up guns and bombs - and everything else wolfgang schaeuble , the german interior minister , was one of the opponents to the plan .
schaeuble spoke of the threat to passengers ' " dignity " as they appeared naked on screens while the scanner seeks out arms , explosives , drugs and other illicit items .
" i do n't want the police to run the risk of being accused of voyeurism , " schaeuble told a press conference at the time .
" if we manage to invent scanners that do n't produce images then we could use them , " he added .
schaeuble 's french counterpart michele alliot-marie was in favor of the scanners , for security not voyeuristic reasons .
alliot-marie recognized the need " to respect everyone 's rights " but added " we must use , with great determination , all advanced technology to fight the terrorists and major criminals , because they know perfectly well how to use it and are often a jump ahead of us , " she stressed .
germany researching alternatives as eu shelves plan schaeuble 's comments eventually led to the start of laboratory tests in germany in which scientists began working on potential upgrades to the full-body airport screening devices in the hope they would find a way to produce images that do not show passengers naked .
the eu shelved its plans to introduce the scanners around the bloc in november after several were tested in airports around europe as part of a trial .

but the country 's jewish leaders chose to skip the main government ceremony on tuesday in protest for what they say is lack of respect . germany 's leading jewish organization , the central council of jews in germany , said it was boycotting the memorial event in the german parliament because surviving victims had not been personally acknowledged in the past .
" i would understand it if we were talking about representatives of the second or third generations , " council general secretary stephan j. kramer told ap news agency .
" but it can not be that actual survivors are treated like mere onlookers . "
german president horst koehler addressed the bundestag in a speech marking the 64th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz concentration camp .
january 27th has been the official day for holocaust remembrance in germany since 1996 .
some of those who took part in the ceremony were critical of the council 's decision .
" in recent years , we 've always had very dignified hours of remembrance with a variety of participants , " social democratic cultural spokeswoman monika griefahn said in an interview with a berlin radio station .

he added that some of those mails contained explicit death threats toward council members .
in his speech before the reichstag , president koehler called for greater solidarity with german jews .
" let us stand beside our fellow jewish citizens , " koehler said .
" whoever attacks them attacks all of us as well . "
but jewish leaders are also disappointed at germany 's reaction to pope benedict xvi 's decision to repeal the excommunication of a priest for holocaust denial .

but the country 's jewish leaders chose to skip the main government ceremony on tuesday in protest for what they say is lack of respect . germany 's leading jewish organization , the central council of jews in germany , said it was boycotting the memorial event in the german parliament because surviving victims had not been personally acknowledged in the past .
" i would understand it if we were talking about representatives of the second or third generations , " council general secretary stephan j. kramer told ap news agency .
" but it can not be that actual survivors are treated like mere onlookers . "
german president horst koehler addressed the bundestag in a speech marking the 64th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz concentration camp .
january 27th has been the official day for holocaust remembrance in germany since 1996 .
some of those who took part in the ceremony were critical of the council 's decision .
" in recent years , we 've always had very dignified hours of remembrance with a variety of participants , " social democratic cultural spokeswoman monika griefahn said in an interview with a berlin radio station .
but the boycott comes at a time in which many jewish leaders in germany are questioning whether the country is doing enough to combat anti-semitism .
gaza fallout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president koehler , middle , and other german leaders observed the occasion kramer said the most recent hostilities between israel and palestinians had led to an upsurge in anti-jewish sentiment in germany .
" we have been forced to register that during the war in gaza the number of hate mails sent to the council has increased by around 40 percent to 200-300 per week , " kramer told ap .
he added that some of those mails contained explicit death threats toward council members .
in his speech before the reichstag , president koehler called for greater solidarity with german jews .
" let us stand beside our fellow jewish citizens , " koehler said .
" whoever attacks them attacks all of us as well . "
but jewish leaders are also disappointed at germany 's reaction to pope benedict xvi 's decision to repeal the excommunication of a priest for holocaust denial .
in an interview with a german tv station , council president charlotte knobloch said she was outraged by the decision taken by the german pontiff .
more than just words ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz was liberated 64 years ago the rancor might cause some to question whether holocaust memorial day serves any other purpose than to pay ritualistic lip-service to a historical tragedy and injustice .
but yehuda bauer , the director of the yad vashem holocaust memorial in israel , says that ceremonies like the one in the bundestag can serve a valuable purpose .
" the ritual can gain in content and can be presented so that true thoughts and feelings are behind it , " bauer said in an interview with a german radio station .
the israeli historian said the occasion was also useful in lending historical perspective to recent events .
" genocide is the attempt to partially or completely exterminate a national , ethnic , religious or racial group , " bauer said .
" what happened in gaza is a conflict , a bloody conflict between two nationalities like in sri lanka , kashmir and other places .
they are not genocides . "
" what is happening in darfur and what happened in rwanda are genocides , " bauer added .
" you have to distinguish . "
during world war ii , the nazi regime organized the systematic killings of some six million jews , most of them in eastern europe .
the nazis also targeted sinti and roma and homosexuals for wholesale extermination . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , marks international holocaust day .
dw 's cornelia rabitz says that it 's time for europe to find a common discourse on remembering the darkest part of the continent 's past to ensure a bright future . about 1 million people from around the world visit the auschwitz memorial each year to commemorate the victims of the holocaust .
it 's a significant number of people , who still come to the museum to get an idea of living and dying in this former antechamber of hell - and to learn from history . memorial officials recently rang sounded an alarm , saying that the buildings are in danger of collapsing and that a lot of money is needed for their restoration .
germany reacted quickly and said that it would help out financially .
and rightly so .
more than six decades after the end of the war , it remains a duty for state and society to accept historic responsibility and keep the memory alive - even if this becomes more and more difficult as the distance of time keeps growing and eyewitnesses die . history books , museums , tv documentaries and movie films have to replace personal conversations .
the ability to relate to the topic - both in terms of time and emotions - continues to wane . to learn from history also means to look at today and arm ourselves against discrimination , racism , xenophobia and - needless to say - anti-semitism .
it 's depressing to see that the conflict between israelis and palestinians has led to falling inhibition thresholds and that jewish people are becoming the targets of hate mail - especially in germany . it 's alarming that anti-semitic stereotypes persist , as polls show again and again .
it 's alarming that neo-nazis drum people together for noisy demonstrations , that propaganda and historical misrepresentation find receptive audiences in our society . still : there will be a large number of events , lectures and concerts to commemorate tuesday 's holocaust day .
they will offer a chance to deal with the issue .
keeping the memory alive could become a european task .
a unifying europe should agree on a common discourse of memory .
dealing with the dark sides of one 's past still can not be taken for granted everywhere . germany , with its long and hard path towards coming to terms with its national socialist crimes and guilt , could certainly serve as an example . cornelia rabitz covers culture for dw-radio -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , marks international holocaust day .
dw 's cornelia rabitz says that it 's time for europe to find a common discourse on remembering the darkest part of the continent 's past to ensure a bright future . about 1 million people from around the world visit the auschwitz memorial each year to commemorate the victims of the holocaust .
it 's a significant number of people , who still come to the museum to get an idea of living and dying in this former antechamber of hell - and to learn from history . memorial officials recently rang sounded an alarm , saying that the buildings are in danger of collapsing and that a lot of money is needed for their restoration .
germany reacted quickly and said that it would help out financially .
and rightly so .
more than six decades after the end of the war , it remains a duty for state and society to accept historic responsibility and keep the memory alive - even if this becomes more and more difficult as the distance of time keeps growing and eyewitnesses die . history books , museums , tv documentaries and movie films have to replace personal conversations .
the ability to relate to the topic - both in terms of time and emotions - continues to wane . to learn from history also means to look at today and arm ourselves against discrimination , racism , xenophobia and - needless to say - anti-semitism .
it 's depressing to see that the conflict between israelis and palestinians has led to falling inhibition thresholds and that jewish people are becoming the targets of hate mail - especially in germany . it 's alarming that anti-semitic stereotypes persist , as polls show again and again .
it 's alarming that neo-nazis drum people together for noisy demonstrations , that propaganda and historical misrepresentation find receptive audiences in our society . still : there will be a large number of events , lectures and concerts to commemorate tuesday 's holocaust day .
they will offer a chance to deal with the issue .
keeping the memory alive could become a european task .
a unifying europe should agree on a common discourse of memory .
dealing with the dark sides of one 's past still can not be taken for granted everywhere . germany , with its long and hard path towards coming to terms with its national socialist crimes and guilt , could certainly serve as an example . cornelia rabitz covers culture for dw-radio -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 27.01.2009 proposed nabucco gas pipeline gets european bank backing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech prime minister topolanek and hungary 's gyurcsany were confident of success the heads of the eu 's european investment bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development -lrb- ebrd -rrb- said tuesday , jan .
27 , that they are prepared to provide financial backing for the nabucco gas pipeline . spurred on by europe 's worst-ever gas crisis earlier this month , which left millions of homes across the continent without heat in the depths of winter , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany invited top-ranking officials from both the eu and the countries involved in nabucco to inject fresh momentum into the slow-moving project .
nabucco , an ambitious but still-unbuilt gas pipeline aimed at reducing europe 's energy reliance on russia , is a 3,300-kilometer -lrb- 2,050-mile -rrb- pipeline between turkey and austria .
costing an estimated 7.9 billion euros , the aim is to transport up to 31 billion cubic meters of gas each year from the caspian sea to western europe , bypassing russia and ukraine .
nabucco currently has six shareholders - omv of austria , mol of hungary , transgaz of romania , bulgargaz of bulgaria , botas of turkey and rwe of germany .
but for the pipeline to get moving , nabucco would need an initial cash injection of an estimated 300 million euros .
both the eib and ebrd said they were willing to invest in the early stages of the project through a series of loans , providing certain conditions are met .
" the eib is ready to finance projects that further eu objectives of increased sustainability and energy security , " said philippe maystadt , president of the european investment bank , during the opening addresses by participants at the " nabucco summit " in hungary .
the eib is prepared to finance " up to 25 percent of project cost , " provided a secure intergovernmental agreement on the nabucco pipeline is reached , he said .
maystadt noted that of 48 billion euros of financing it provided last year , a quarter was for energy projects .
ebrd president thomas mirow also offered financial backing to the nabucco pipeline , on the condition that it " meets the requirements of solid project financing . "
the bank would need to see concrete plans and completion guarantees , besides a stable political agreement , said mirow .
eu wary of future gas crises czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu , spoke about the recent gas crisis caused by a pricing dispute between russia and ukraine that affected supplies to europe .
" a new crisis could emerge at any time , and next time it could be even worse , " topolanek said .
he added that reaching an agreement on nabucco is a " test of european solidarity . "
the latest gas row between russia and ukraine has highlighted europe 's need to diversify its energy sources and thrown the spotlight on nabucco .
but critics insist that the vast project will remain nothing but a pipe dream because its backers can not guarantee that they will ever have sufficient gas supplies to make it profitable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political will could see the eu with an alternative gas source eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs urged political leaders to commit firmly to nabucco by the end of march , or risk jeopardizing the project .
in his opening address as host , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany called on the eu to provide 200 to 300 million euros within the next few weeks to get the construction of the pipeline off the ground .
gyurcsany stressed that he was not hoping for a loan , but rather for starting capital from the eu .
us deputy assistant secretary of state matthew bryza noted that the tuesday summit had made it clear that gyurcsany , who dismissed nabucco as " a dream " in 2007 , was now fully committed to the energy supply diversification project .
on the supply side , turkmenistan and azerbaijan both indicated they would be willing to supply some of the gas .
" azerbaijan , which is according to current plans is a transit country , could eventually serve as a supplier as well , " azerbaijani president ilham aliyev said .
azerbaijan 's gas reserves of some two or three trillion cubic meters would be sufficient to last " several decades , " he said .
austrian economy minister reinhold mitterlehner suggested that egypt and iran could also be brought in as suppliers in the long term .
but a deal currently seems unlikely with iran given the long-running international standoff over its disputed nuclear program .
russia , ukraine still wrangling meanwhile , russia and ukraine were still wrangling over the details of the deal which ended their gas quarrel earlier this month .
ukrainian president viktor yushchenko said on tuesday he would stand by the terms of the agreement with russia , even though not all the details are to his liking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrangling between russia and ukraine continues but russian officials questioned his reliability , saying that the political rivalry between yushchenko and prime minister yulia timoshenko could still lead kiev to cancel the contract .
" the agreements signed are not easy ones , but ukraine fully takes up the performance -lrb- of its commitments -rrb- and guarantees full-fledged transit to european consumers , " yushchenko told journalists in brussels after a meeting with the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso .
the assurance that yushchenko would abide by the terms of the agreement finalized by timoshenko was " an important step forward in allowing us to focus on our broader relationship , " barroso said .
but the spokesman for russian prime minister vladimir putin said that moscow still feared that the growing rivalry between yushchenko and timoshenko , who are set to face off in next year 's presidential election , could torpedo the deal .
eu in talks to upgrade ukraine 's transit system yushchenko 's working breakfast with barroso was dominated by the energy question , with both men highlighting the need to upgrade ukraine 's gas-transit system and build more links between ukrainian and european energy markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could help ukraine update its transit network the commission is set to host an international conference aimed at gathering donations to upgrade ukraine 's gas-transit system on march 23 in brussels .
the eu and ukraine have agreed to form a joint expert group to plan the meeting , the leaders said tuesday .
during the conflict , barroso had warned that both russia and ukraine were damaging their credibility as reliable partners .
but on monday he said that " in bilateral relations , we are not taking any negative consequences from -lrb- the gas row -rrb- because we believe ukraine wants to deepen the relationship with the eu , and we also want to deepen the relationship with ukraine . "
he also said that " we have to state very clearly that we were disappointed by the problems between ukraine and russia , " and called for political stability and reform in ukraine .
his diplomatic balancing act is likely to have a frosty reception in moscow , where peskov said that russia " would prefer to hear from the european states a very serious and severe evaluation of who is guilty for interrupting the transit .

nabucco currently has six shareholders - omv of austria , mol of hungary , transgaz of romania , bulgargaz of bulgaria , botas of turkey and rwe of germany .
but for the pipeline to get moving , nabucco would need an initial cash injection of an estimated 300 million euros .
both the eib and ebrd said they were willing to invest in the early stages of the project through a series of loans , providing certain conditions are met .
" the eib is ready to finance projects that further eu objectives of increased sustainability and energy security , " said philippe maystadt , president of the european investment bank , during the opening addresses by participants at the " nabucco summit " in hungary .
the eib is prepared to finance " up to 25 percent of project cost , " provided a secure intergovernmental agreement on the nabucco pipeline is reached , he said .
maystadt noted that of 48 billion euros of financing it provided last year , a quarter was for energy projects .
ebrd president thomas mirow also offered financial backing to the nabucco pipeline , on the condition that it " meets the requirements of solid project financing . "
the bank would need to see concrete plans and completion guarantees , besides a stable political agreement , said mirow .
eu wary of future gas crises czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu , spoke about the recent gas crisis caused by a pricing dispute between russia and ukraine that affected supplies to europe .
" a new crisis could emerge at any time , and next time it could be even worse , " topolanek said .
he added that reaching an agreement on nabucco is a " test of european solidarity . "
the latest gas row between russia and ukraine has highlighted europe 's need to diversify its energy sources and thrown the spotlight on nabucco .
but critics insist that the vast project will remain nothing but a pipe dream because its backers can not guarantee that they will ever have sufficient gas supplies to make it profitable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political will could see the eu with an alternative gas source eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs urged political leaders to commit firmly to nabucco by the end of march , or risk jeopardizing the project .
in his opening address as host , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany called on the eu to provide 200 to 300 million euros within the next few weeks to get the construction of the pipeline off the ground .
gyurcsany stressed that he was not hoping for a loan , but rather for starting capital from the eu .
us deputy assistant secretary of state matthew bryza noted that the tuesday summit had made it clear that gyurcsany , who dismissed nabucco as " a dream " in 2007 , was now fully committed to the energy supply diversification project .
on the supply side , turkmenistan and azerbaijan both indicated they would be willing to supply some of the gas .
" azerbaijan , which is according to current plans is a transit country , could eventually serve as a supplier as well , " azerbaijani president ilham aliyev said .
azerbaijan 's gas reserves of some two or three trillion cubic meters would be sufficient to last " several decades , " he said .
austrian economy minister reinhold mitterlehner suggested that egypt and iran could also be brought in as suppliers in the long term .
but a deal currently seems unlikely with iran given the long-running international standoff over its disputed nuclear program .
russia , ukraine still wrangling meanwhile , russia and ukraine were still wrangling over the details of the deal which ended their gas quarrel earlier this month .
ukrainian president viktor yushchenko said on tuesday he would stand by the terms of the agreement with russia , even though not all the details are to his liking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrangling between russia and ukraine continues but russian officials questioned his reliability , saying that the political rivalry between yushchenko and prime minister yulia timoshenko could still lead kiev to cancel the contract .
" the agreements signed are not easy ones , but ukraine fully takes up the performance -lrb- of its commitments -rrb- and guarantees full-fledged transit to european consumers , " yushchenko told journalists in brussels after a meeting with the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso .
the assurance that yushchenko would abide by the terms of the agreement finalized by timoshenko was " an important step forward in allowing us to focus on our broader relationship , " barroso said .
but the spokesman for russian prime minister vladimir putin said that moscow still feared that the growing rivalry between yushchenko and timoshenko , who are set to face off in next year 's presidential election , could torpedo the deal .
eu in talks to upgrade ukraine 's transit system yushchenko 's working breakfast with barroso was dominated by the energy question , with both men highlighting the need to upgrade ukraine 's gas-transit system and build more links between ukrainian and european energy markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could help ukraine update its transit network the commission is set to host an international conference aimed at gathering donations to upgrade ukraine 's gas-transit system on march 23 in brussels .
the eu and ukraine have agreed to form a joint expert group to plan the meeting , the leaders said tuesday .
during the conflict , barroso had warned that both russia and ukraine were damaging their credibility as reliable partners .
but on monday he said that " in bilateral relations , we are not taking any negative consequences from -lrb- the gas row -rrb- because we believe ukraine wants to deepen the relationship with the eu , and we also want to deepen the relationship with ukraine . "
he also said that " we have to state very clearly that we were disappointed by the problems between ukraine and russia , " and called for political stability and reform in ukraine .
his diplomatic balancing act is likely to have a frosty reception in moscow , where peskov said that russia " would prefer to hear from the european states a very serious and severe evaluation of who is guilty for interrupting the transit .

he also put in telephone calls to french president nicolas sarkozy , german chancellor angela merkel and russia president dmitry medvedev .
obama and sarkozy conversed for 30 minutes .
afterwards , in a statement , the french president said they have agreed to work together in " resolute fashion " on the reconstruction of afghanistan , the global economic crisis and obama 's plan to shut down the controversial army detention center in guantanamo bay , cuba .
obama 's talks with merkel and medvedev reportedly focused on many of the same issues .
relations between the united states and france , germany and russia cooled under obama 's predecessor george w. bush - in part because those three countries refused to support the us-led war on iraq .

obama 's talks with merkel and medvedev reportedly focused on many of the same issues .
relations between the united states and france , germany and russia cooled under obama 's predecessor george w. bush - in part because those three countries refused to support the us-led war on iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 27.01.2009 proposed nabucco gas pipeline gets european bank backing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech prime minister topolanek and hungary 's gyurcsany were confident of success the heads of the eu 's european investment bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development -lrb- ebrd -rrb- said tuesday , jan .
27 , that they are prepared to provide financial backing for the nabucco gas pipeline . spurred on by europe 's worst-ever gas crisis earlier this month , which left millions of homes across the continent without heat in the depths of winter , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany invited top-ranking officials from both the eu and the countries involved in nabucco to inject fresh momentum into the slow-moving project .
nabucco , an ambitious but still-unbuilt gas pipeline aimed at reducing europe 's energy reliance on russia , is a 3,300-kilometer -lrb- 2,050-mile -rrb- pipeline between turkey and austria .
costing an estimated 7.9 billion euros , the aim is to transport up to 31 billion cubic meters of gas each year from the caspian sea to western europe , bypassing russia and ukraine .
nabucco currently has six shareholders - omv of austria , mol of hungary , transgaz of romania , bulgargaz of bulgaria , botas of turkey and rwe of germany .
but for the pipeline to get moving , nabucco would need an initial cash injection of an estimated 300 million euros .
both the eib and ebrd said they were willing to invest in the early stages of the project through a series of loans , providing certain conditions are met .
" the eib is ready to finance projects that further eu objectives of increased sustainability and energy security , " said philippe maystadt , president of the european investment bank , during the opening addresses by participants at the " nabucco summit " in hungary .
the eib is prepared to finance " up to 25 percent of project cost , " provided a secure intergovernmental agreement on the nabucco pipeline is reached , he said .
maystadt noted that of 48 billion euros of financing it provided last year , a quarter was for energy projects .
ebrd president thomas mirow also offered financial backing to the nabucco pipeline , on the condition that it " meets the requirements of solid project financing . "
the bank would need to see concrete plans and completion guarantees , besides a stable political agreement , said mirow .
eu wary of future gas crises czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu , spoke about the recent gas crisis caused by a pricing dispute between russia and ukraine that affected supplies to europe .
" a new crisis could emerge at any time , and next time it could be even worse , " topolanek said .
he added that reaching an agreement on nabucco is a " test of european solidarity . "
the latest gas row between russia and ukraine has highlighted europe 's need to diversify its energy sources and thrown the spotlight on nabucco .
but critics insist that the vast project will remain nothing but a pipe dream because its backers can not guarantee that they will ever have sufficient gas supplies to make it profitable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political will could see the eu with an alternative gas source eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs urged political leaders to commit firmly to nabucco by the end of march , or risk jeopardizing the project .
in his opening address as host , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany called on the eu to provide 200 to 300 million euros within the next few weeks to get the construction of the pipeline off the ground .
gyurcsany stressed that he was not hoping for a loan , but rather for starting capital from the eu .
us deputy assistant secretary of state matthew bryza noted that the tuesday summit had made it clear that gyurcsany , who dismissed nabucco as " a dream " in 2007 , was now fully committed to the energy supply diversification project .
on the supply side , turkmenistan and azerbaijan both indicated they would be willing to supply some of the gas .
" azerbaijan , which is according to current plans is a transit country , could eventually serve as a supplier as well , " azerbaijani president ilham aliyev said .
azerbaijan 's gas reserves of some two or three trillion cubic meters would be sufficient to last " several decades , " he said .
austrian economy minister reinhold mitterlehner suggested that egypt and iran could also be brought in as suppliers in the long term .
but a deal currently seems unlikely with iran given the long-running international standoff over its disputed nuclear program .
russia , ukraine still wrangling meanwhile , russia and ukraine were still wrangling over the details of the deal which ended their gas quarrel earlier this month .
ukrainian president viktor yushchenko said on tuesday he would stand by the terms of the agreement with russia , even though not all the details are to his liking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrangling between russia and ukraine continues but russian officials questioned his reliability , saying that the political rivalry between yushchenko and prime minister yulia timoshenko could still lead kiev to cancel the contract .
" the agreements signed are not easy ones , but ukraine fully takes up the performance -lrb- of its commitments -rrb- and guarantees full-fledged transit to european consumers , " yushchenko told journalists in brussels after a meeting with the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso .
the assurance that yushchenko would abide by the terms of the agreement finalized by timoshenko was " an important step forward in allowing us to focus on our broader relationship , " barroso said .
but the spokesman for russian prime minister vladimir putin said that moscow still feared that the growing rivalry between yushchenko and timoshenko , who are set to face off in next year 's presidential election , could torpedo the deal .
eu in talks to upgrade ukraine 's transit system yushchenko 's working breakfast with barroso was dominated by the energy question , with both men highlighting the need to upgrade ukraine 's gas-transit system and build more links between ukrainian and european energy markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could help ukraine update its transit network the commission is set to host an international conference aimed at gathering donations to upgrade ukraine 's gas-transit system on march 23 in brussels .
the eu and ukraine have agreed to form a joint expert group to plan the meeting , the leaders said tuesday .
during the conflict , barroso had warned that both russia and ukraine were damaging their credibility as reliable partners .
but on monday he said that " in bilateral relations , we are not taking any negative consequences from -lrb- the gas row -rrb- because we believe ukraine wants to deepen the relationship with the eu , and we also want to deepen the relationship with ukraine . "
he also said that " we have to state very clearly that we were disappointed by the problems between ukraine and russia , " and called for political stability and reform in ukraine .
his diplomatic balancing act is likely to have a frosty reception in moscow , where peskov said that russia " would prefer to hear from the european states a very serious and severe evaluation of who is guilty for interrupting the transit .

27 , marks international holocaust day .
dw 's cornelia rabitz says that it 's time for europe to find a common discourse on remembering the darkest part of the continent 's past to ensure a bright future . about 1 million people from around the world visit the auschwitz memorial each year to commemorate the victims of the holocaust .
it 's a significant number of people , who still come to the museum to get an idea of living and dying in this former antechamber of hell - and to learn from history . memorial officials recently rang sounded an alarm , saying that the buildings are in danger of collapsing and that a lot of money is needed for their restoration .
germany reacted quickly and said that it would help out financially .
and rightly so .
more than six decades after the end of the war , it remains a duty for state and society to accept historic responsibility and keep the memory alive - even if this becomes more and more difficult as the distance of time keeps growing and eyewitnesses die . history books , museums , tv documentaries and movie films have to replace personal conversations .
the ability to relate to the topic - both in terms of time and emotions - continues to wane . to learn from history also means to look at today and arm ourselves against discrimination , racism , xenophobia and - needless to say - anti-semitism .
it 's depressing to see that the conflict between israelis and palestinians has led to falling inhibition thresholds and that jewish people are becoming the targets of hate mail - especially in germany . it 's alarming that anti-semitic stereotypes persist , as polls show again and again .
it 's alarming that neo-nazis drum people together for noisy demonstrations , that propaganda and historical misrepresentation find receptive audiences in our society . still : there will be a large number of events , lectures and concerts to commemorate tuesday 's holocaust day .
they will offer a chance to deal with the issue .
keeping the memory alive could become a european task .
a unifying europe should agree on a common discourse of memory .
dealing with the dark sides of one 's past still can not be taken for granted everywhere . germany , with its long and hard path towards coming to terms with its national socialist crimes and guilt , could certainly serve as an example . cornelia rabitz covers culture for dw-radio -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the country 's jewish leaders chose to skip the main government ceremony on tuesday in protest for what they say is lack of respect . germany 's leading jewish organization , the central council of jews in germany , said it was boycotting the memorial event in the german parliament because surviving victims had not been personally acknowledged in the past .
" i would understand it if we were talking about representatives of the second or third generations , " council general secretary stephan j. kramer told ap news agency .
" but it can not be that actual survivors are treated like mere onlookers . "
german president horst koehler addressed the bundestag in a speech marking the 64th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz concentration camp .
january 27th has been the official day for holocaust remembrance in germany since 1996 .
some of those who took part in the ceremony were critical of the council 's decision .
" in recent years , we 've always had very dignified hours of remembrance with a variety of participants , " social democratic cultural spokeswoman monika griefahn said in an interview with a berlin radio station .
but the boycott comes at a time in which many jewish leaders in germany are questioning whether the country is doing enough to combat anti-semitism .
gaza fallout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president koehler , middle , and other german leaders observed the occasion kramer said the most recent hostilities between israel and palestinians had led to an upsurge in anti-jewish sentiment in germany .
" we have been forced to register that during the war in gaza the number of hate mails sent to the council has increased by around 40 percent to 200-300 per week , " kramer told ap .
he added that some of those mails contained explicit death threats toward council members .
in his speech before the reichstag , president koehler called for greater solidarity with german jews .
" let us stand beside our fellow jewish citizens , " koehler said .
" whoever attacks them attacks all of us as well . "
but jewish leaders are also disappointed at germany 's reaction to pope benedict xvi 's decision to repeal the excommunication of a priest for holocaust denial .
in an interview with a german tv station , council president charlotte knobloch said she was outraged by the decision taken by the german pontiff .

" the ritual can gain in content and can be presented so that true thoughts and feelings are behind it , " bauer said in an interview with a german radio station .
the israeli historian said the occasion was also useful in lending historical perspective to recent events .
" genocide is the attempt to partially or completely exterminate a national , ethnic , religious or racial group , " bauer said .

but the country 's jewish leaders chose to skip the main government ceremony on tuesday in protest for what they say is lack of respect . germany 's leading jewish organization , the central council of jews in germany , said it was boycotting the memorial event in the german parliament because surviving victims had not been personally acknowledged in the past .
" i would understand it if we were talking about representatives of the second or third generations , " council general secretary stephan j. kramer told ap news agency .
" but it can not be that actual survivors are treated like mere onlookers . "
german president horst koehler addressed the bundestag in a speech marking the 64th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz concentration camp .
january 27th has been the official day for holocaust remembrance in germany since 1996 .
some of those who took part in the ceremony were critical of the council 's decision .
" in recent years , we 've always had very dignified hours of remembrance with a variety of participants , " social democratic cultural spokeswoman monika griefahn said in an interview with a berlin radio station .

he added that some of those mails contained explicit death threats toward council members .
in his speech before the reichstag , president koehler called for greater solidarity with german jews .
" let us stand beside our fellow jewish citizens , " koehler said .
" whoever attacks them attacks all of us as well . "
but jewish leaders are also disappointed at germany 's reaction to pope benedict xvi 's decision to repeal the excommunication of a priest for holocaust denial .

dw 's cornelia rabitz says that it 's time for europe to find a common discourse on remembering the darkest part of the continent 's past to ensure a bright future . about 1 million people from around the world visit the auschwitz memorial each year to commemorate the victims of the holocaust .
it 's a significant number of people , who still come to the museum to get an idea of living and dying in this former antechamber of hell - and to learn from history . memorial officials recently rang sounded an alarm , saying that the buildings are in danger of collapsing and that a lot of money is needed for their restoration .
germany reacted quickly and said that it would help out financially .
and rightly so .
more than six decades after the end of the war , it remains a duty for state and society to accept historic responsibility and keep the memory alive - even if this becomes more and more difficult as the distance of time keeps growing and eyewitnesses die . history books , museums , tv documentaries and movie films have to replace personal conversations .
the ability to relate to the topic - both in terms of time and emotions - continues to wane . to learn from history also means to look at today and arm ourselves against discrimination , racism , xenophobia and - needless to say - anti-semitism .
it 's depressing to see that the conflict between israelis and palestinians has led to falling inhibition thresholds and that jewish people are becoming the targets of hate mail - especially in germany . it 's alarming that anti-semitic stereotypes persist , as polls show again and again .
it 's alarming that neo-nazis drum people together for noisy demonstrations , that propaganda and historical misrepresentation find receptive audiences in our society . still : there will be a large number of events , lectures and concerts to commemorate tuesday 's holocaust day .
they will offer a chance to deal with the issue .
keeping the memory alive could become a european task .
a unifying europe should agree on a common discourse of memory .
dealing with the dark sides of one 's past still can not be taken for granted everywhere . germany , with its long and hard path towards coming to terms with its national socialist crimes and guilt , could certainly serve as an example . cornelia rabitz covers culture for dw-radio -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" due to the legal situation in different -lrb- eu -rrb- countries , we ca n't give a quick answer ...

27 , marks international holocaust day .
dw 's cornelia rabitz says that it 's time for europe to find a common discourse on remembering the darkest part of the continent 's past to ensure a bright future . about 1 million people from around the world visit the auschwitz memorial each year to commemorate the victims of the holocaust .
it 's a significant number of people , who still come to the museum to get an idea of living and dying in this former antechamber of hell - and to learn from history . memorial officials recently rang sounded an alarm , saying that the buildings are in danger of collapsing and that a lot of money is needed for their restoration .
germany reacted quickly and said that it would help out financially .
and rightly so .
more than six decades after the end of the war , it remains a duty for state and society to accept historic responsibility and keep the memory alive - even if this becomes more and more difficult as the distance of time keeps growing and eyewitnesses die . history books , museums , tv documentaries and movie films have to replace personal conversations .
the ability to relate to the topic - both in terms of time and emotions - continues to wane . to learn from history also means to look at today and arm ourselves against discrimination , racism , xenophobia and - needless to say - anti-semitism .
it 's depressing to see that the conflict between israelis and palestinians has led to falling inhibition thresholds and that jewish people are becoming the targets of hate mail - especially in germany . it 's alarming that anti-semitic stereotypes persist , as polls show again and again .
it 's alarming that neo-nazis drum people together for noisy demonstrations , that propaganda and historical misrepresentation find receptive audiences in our society . still : there will be a large number of events , lectures and concerts to commemorate tuesday 's holocaust day .
they will offer a chance to deal with the issue .
keeping the memory alive could become a european task .
a unifying europe should agree on a common discourse of memory .
dealing with the dark sides of one 's past still can not be taken for granted everywhere . germany , with its long and hard path towards coming to terms with its national socialist crimes and guilt , could certainly serve as an example . cornelia rabitz covers culture for dw-radio -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analysts had predicted that it would fall to 81.5 points . based on a survey of 7,000 german executives and drawn up by the munich-based ifo economic research institute , the index plummeted in december to 82.7 points , which was its lowest point since the 1980s oil crisis .
since the publication of the december survey , a slew of bleak indicators and data have continued to roll in .
economy may pick up soon the indicator 's component gauging expectations six months down the track is predicted to rise on hopes of an economic pickup later in the year .
predictions of an increase in the expectations gauge come amid signs that the severe downturn that has hit germany and the world economy in recent months could be reaching its low point .

" due to the legal situation in different -lrb- eu -rrb- countries , we ca n't give a quick answer ...
it is not a question which can be solved in weeks or months , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the bloc 's rotating presidency . while the new administration of us president barack obama has not yet officially asked european governments to host any of the 60 guantanamo inmates eligible for release , a list of possible candidates has already begun circulating in european capitals . but the lack of a quick response from the eu is likely to be ill-received in washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans want to get off on a good foot with obama analysts had warned ahead of monday 's talks that the eu 's reaction on guantanamo represented the first real test of europe 's will to start relations with the obama administration on a positive note . as finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said , " we need to shake hands with the us : it 's a new , fresh start . " legal complications but ministers later insisted that legal complications made it impossible for them to commit themselves quickly . " we found during our discussions that the legal situations are different in different -lrb- eu -rrb- states , " schwarzenberg said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama signs an executive order closing the prison at guantanamo bay he said foreign ministers would first ask for a reasoned opinion from their justice and interior ministers .
" then we will probably have another meeting , " he said . so far , portugal is the only eu member state to have clearly stated its intention of taking in former detainees who would face persecution and abuse if sent to their countries of origin in the middle east . the foreign ministers of germany and france both said in brussels that they would consider hosting the men in orange jumpsuits only on a " case-by-case " basis , with france 's bernard kouchner insisting that he would not accept any " impositions " from washington . and britain , which has already taken in 12 former detainees , has said it will not take in more . britain " feels it has already made a significant contribution but that we are keen to offer our experience on the repatriation of these people to other european countries who are ready to play their part , " british foreign secretary david miliband said ahead of the talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guantanamo prison outraged many europeans the eu has long called for the closure of the guantanamo detention center and welcomed the decision by obama to prepare the jail 's closure soon after assuming office . but securing a common european position on what to do next would likely take a long period of complex legal discussions , judging from the outcome of monday 's talks . opposition group there was further controversy when ministers removed the people 's mujahedin of iran -lrb- pmoi -rrb- from their list of terrorist organizations on monday , despite the opposition of france and public protests in tehran . the widely expected move followed a ruling by the european court in luxembourg , which in december said the eu was wrong to keep the pmoi 's assets frozen after it was taken off a british list of terrorist organizations . " what we are doing today is abiding by the resolution of the european court .
there 's nothing we can do about that resolution , " eu foreign-policy chief javier solana said . however , in light of objections from france , czech officials said the eu might reconsider its decision " if new evidence " against the pmoi were to emerge . founded in 1965 , the pmoi operated a military wing in its early years , but says it renounced violence in june 2001 and now advocates the political overthrow of iran 's current government . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nabucco , an ambitious but still-unbuilt gas pipeline aimed at reducing europe 's energy reliance on russia , is a 3,300-kilometer -lrb- 2,050-mile -rrb- pipeline between turkey and austria .
costing an estimated 7.9 billion euros , the aim is to transport up to 31 billion cubic meters of gas each year from the caspian sea to western europe , bypassing russia and ukraine .
nabucco currently has six shareholders - omv of austria , mol of hungary , transgaz of romania , bulgargaz of bulgaria , botas of turkey and rwe of germany .
but for the pipeline to get moving , nabucco would need an initial cash injection of an estimated 300 million euros .
both the eib and ebrd said they were willing to invest in the early stages of the project through a series of loans , providing certain conditions are met .
" the eib is ready to finance projects that further eu objectives of increased sustainability and energy security , " said philippe maystadt , president of the european investment bank , during the opening addresses by participants at the " nabucco summit " in hungary .
the eib is prepared to finance " up to 25 percent of project cost , " provided a secure intergovernmental agreement on the nabucco pipeline is reached , he said .
maystadt noted that of 48 billion euros of financing it provided last year , a quarter was for energy projects .
ebrd president thomas mirow also offered financial backing to the nabucco pipeline , on the condition that it " meets the requirements of solid project financing . "
the bank would need to see concrete plans and completion guarantees , besides a stable political agreement , said mirow .
eu wary of future gas crises czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu , spoke about the recent gas crisis caused by a pricing dispute between russia and ukraine that affected supplies to europe .
" a new crisis could emerge at any time , and next time it could be even worse , " topolanek said .
he added that reaching an agreement on nabucco is a " test of european solidarity . "
the latest gas row between russia and ukraine has highlighted europe 's need to diversify its energy sources and thrown the spotlight on nabucco .
but critics insist that the vast project will remain nothing but a pipe dream because its backers can not guarantee that they will ever have sufficient gas supplies to make it profitable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political will could see the eu with an alternative gas source eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs urged political leaders to commit firmly to nabucco by the end of march , or risk jeopardizing the project .
in his opening address as host , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany called on the eu to provide 200 to 300 million euros within the next few weeks to get the construction of the pipeline off the ground .
gyurcsany stressed that he was not hoping for a loan , but rather for starting capital from the eu .
us deputy assistant secretary of state matthew bryza noted that the tuesday summit had made it clear that gyurcsany , who dismissed nabucco as " a dream " in 2007 , was now fully committed to the energy supply diversification project .
on the supply side , turkmenistan and azerbaijan both indicated they would be willing to supply some of the gas .
" azerbaijan , which is according to current plans is a transit country , could eventually serve as a supplier as well , " azerbaijani president ilham aliyev said .
azerbaijan 's gas reserves of some two or three trillion cubic meters would be sufficient to last " several decades , " he said .
austrian economy minister reinhold mitterlehner suggested that egypt and iran could also be brought in as suppliers in the long term .
but a deal currently seems unlikely with iran given the long-running international standoff over its disputed nuclear program .
russia , ukraine still wrangling meanwhile , russia and ukraine were still wrangling over the details of the deal which ended their gas quarrel earlier this month .
ukrainian president viktor yushchenko said on tuesday he would stand by the terms of the agreement with russia , even though not all the details are to his liking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrangling between russia and ukraine continues but russian officials questioned his reliability , saying that the political rivalry between yushchenko and prime minister yulia timoshenko could still lead kiev to cancel the contract .
" the agreements signed are not easy ones , but ukraine fully takes up the performance -lrb- of its commitments -rrb- and guarantees full-fledged transit to european consumers , " yushchenko told journalists in brussels after a meeting with the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso .
the assurance that yushchenko would abide by the terms of the agreement finalized by timoshenko was " an important step forward in allowing us to focus on our broader relationship , " barroso said .
but the spokesman for russian prime minister vladimir putin said that moscow still feared that the growing rivalry between yushchenko and timoshenko , who are set to face off in next year 's presidential election , could torpedo the deal .
eu in talks to upgrade ukraine 's transit system yushchenko 's working breakfast with barroso was dominated by the energy question , with both men highlighting the need to upgrade ukraine 's gas-transit system and build more links between ukrainian and european energy markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could help ukraine update its transit network the commission is set to host an international conference aimed at gathering donations to upgrade ukraine 's gas-transit system on march 23 in brussels .
the eu and ukraine have agreed to form a joint expert group to plan the meeting , the leaders said tuesday .
during the conflict , barroso had warned that both russia and ukraine were damaging their credibility as reliable partners .
but on monday he said that " in bilateral relations , we are not taking any negative consequences from -lrb- the gas row -rrb- because we believe ukraine wants to deepen the relationship with the eu , and we also want to deepen the relationship with ukraine . "
he also said that " we have to state very clearly that we were disappointed by the problems between ukraine and russia , " and called for political stability and reform in ukraine .
his diplomatic balancing act is likely to have a frosty reception in moscow , where peskov said that russia " would prefer to hear from the european states a very serious and severe evaluation of who is guilty for interrupting the transit .

germany has about 3,500 soldiers stationed the country , where attacks remain a common occurance . seven years after the end of the taliban regime , afghanistan continues to be wracked by violence .
maurus wrixel , a first lieutenant in the german military , recently shared his experience at the front lines of the effort to rebuild afghanistan and restore order in the war-torn country .
wrixel is part of the german military 's " provincial reconstruction team " in feyzabad .
although the taliban never had control over this northern part of the country , german soldiers have become primary targets for islamist extremists in the region .
in november 2008 , four bundeswehr soldiers were injured near feyzabad when their patrol was attacked .
wrixel , a 27-year-old first lieutenant , said he did n't shirk away from deployment in afghanistan .
he knew of the dangers when he signed up to serve in the german military .
" it was clear to me that i was going to do it because i 'm a soldier and foreign assignments are part of that , " said the blond young man from a small town near the western german city of neuss .
facing daily danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops do n't have much contact with afghans despite months of preparation , wrixel 's deployment to afghanistan in june of 2008 made him feel queasy .
" on one hand , you 're excited because you can finally use what you 've learned for so long .
on the other hand , you wonder about all the things that could happen .
that is the double-edged part , " wrixel said .
more than 30 of his fellow soldiers have already lost their lives in afghanistan .
it 's not always easy to keep going out and doing the job , especially the day after an attack , he said .
" sometimes you hear that something has happened in the evening in kunduz and then the next day you have to go outside again , " he said .
" or you 're standing in the dark at a road crossing and people come up to you who you ca n't recognize despite night-vision devices and you just have to just hope that nothing happens . "
getting into the routine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 30 german soldiers have died in afghanistan the badakhshan province has terrain that is often compared with a lunar landscape .
there are brown , low mountain ranges with steep cliffs and the air seems to always be filled with dust .
despite its rich mineral resources , the region is the poorest in afghanistan .
the average life expectancy is 43 years and 90 percent of the population is illiterate .
it 's an area which , compared to europe , seems stuck in the middle ages .
the low level of development means there is plenty of work for german reconstruction team members , and they work hard .
it helps make the time pass more quickly .
during their free time , soldiers have few entertainment options , as security concerns make it nearly impossible for them to leave the camp .
there 's a small " fitness tent " where they can work out .
wrixel also spends afternoons playing foosball or darts or drinking coffee .

27 , that they are prepared to provide financial backing for the nabucco gas pipeline . spurred on by europe 's worst-ever gas crisis earlier this month , which left millions of homes across the continent without heat in the depths of winter , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany invited top-ranking officials from both the eu and the countries involved in nabucco to inject fresh momentum into the slow-moving project .
nabucco , an ambitious but still-unbuilt gas pipeline aimed at reducing europe 's energy reliance on russia , is a 3,300-kilometer -lrb- 2,050-mile -rrb- pipeline between turkey and austria .
costing an estimated 7.9 billion euros , the aim is to transport up to 31 billion cubic meters of gas each year from the caspian sea to western europe , bypassing russia and ukraine .
nabucco currently has six shareholders - omv of austria , mol of hungary , transgaz of romania , bulgargaz of bulgaria , botas of turkey and rwe of germany .
but for the pipeline to get moving , nabucco would need an initial cash injection of an estimated 300 million euros .
both the eib and ebrd said they were willing to invest in the early stages of the project through a series of loans , providing certain conditions are met .
" the eib is ready to finance projects that further eu objectives of increased sustainability and energy security , " said philippe maystadt , president of the european investment bank , during the opening addresses by participants at the " nabucco summit " in hungary .
the eib is prepared to finance " up to 25 percent of project cost , " provided a secure intergovernmental agreement on the nabucco pipeline is reached , he said .
maystadt noted that of 48 billion euros of financing it provided last year , a quarter was for energy projects .
ebrd president thomas mirow also offered financial backing to the nabucco pipeline , on the condition that it " meets the requirements of solid project financing . "
the bank would need to see concrete plans and completion guarantees , besides a stable political agreement , said mirow .
eu wary of future gas crises czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu , spoke about the recent gas crisis caused by a pricing dispute between russia and ukraine that affected supplies to europe .
" a new crisis could emerge at any time , and next time it could be even worse , " topolanek said .
he added that reaching an agreement on nabucco is a " test of european solidarity . "
the latest gas row between russia and ukraine has highlighted europe 's need to diversify its energy sources and thrown the spotlight on nabucco .
but critics insist that the vast project will remain nothing but a pipe dream because its backers can not guarantee that they will ever have sufficient gas supplies to make it profitable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political will could see the eu with an alternative gas source eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs urged political leaders to commit firmly to nabucco by the end of march , or risk jeopardizing the project .
in his opening address as host , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany called on the eu to provide 200 to 300 million euros within the next few weeks to get the construction of the pipeline off the ground .
gyurcsany stressed that he was not hoping for a loan , but rather for starting capital from the eu .
us deputy assistant secretary of state matthew bryza noted that the tuesday summit had made it clear that gyurcsany , who dismissed nabucco as " a dream " in 2007 , was now fully committed to the energy supply diversification project .
on the supply side , turkmenistan and azerbaijan both indicated they would be willing to supply some of the gas .
" azerbaijan , which is according to current plans is a transit country , could eventually serve as a supplier as well , " azerbaijani president ilham aliyev said .
azerbaijan 's gas reserves of some two or three trillion cubic meters would be sufficient to last " several decades , " he said .
austrian economy minister reinhold mitterlehner suggested that egypt and iran could also be brought in as suppliers in the long term .
but a deal currently seems unlikely with iran given the long-running international standoff over its disputed nuclear program .
russia , ukraine still wrangling meanwhile , russia and ukraine were still wrangling over the details of the deal which ended their gas quarrel earlier this month .
ukrainian president viktor yushchenko said on tuesday he would stand by the terms of the agreement with russia , even though not all the details are to his liking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrangling between russia and ukraine continues but russian officials questioned his reliability , saying that the political rivalry between yushchenko and prime minister yulia timoshenko could still lead kiev to cancel the contract .
" the agreements signed are not easy ones , but ukraine fully takes up the performance -lrb- of its commitments -rrb- and guarantees full-fledged transit to european consumers , " yushchenko told journalists in brussels after a meeting with the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso .
the assurance that yushchenko would abide by the terms of the agreement finalized by timoshenko was " an important step forward in allowing us to focus on our broader relationship , " barroso said .
but the spokesman for russian prime minister vladimir putin said that moscow still feared that the growing rivalry between yushchenko and timoshenko , who are set to face off in next year 's presidential election , could torpedo the deal .
eu in talks to upgrade ukraine 's transit system yushchenko 's working breakfast with barroso was dominated by the energy question , with both men highlighting the need to upgrade ukraine 's gas-transit system and build more links between ukrainian and european energy markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could help ukraine update its transit network the commission is set to host an international conference aimed at gathering donations to upgrade ukraine 's gas-transit system on march 23 in brussels .
the eu and ukraine have agreed to form a joint expert group to plan the meeting , the leaders said tuesday .
during the conflict , barroso had warned that both russia and ukraine were damaging their credibility as reliable partners .
but on monday he said that " in bilateral relations , we are not taking any negative consequences from -lrb- the gas row -rrb- because we believe ukraine wants to deepen the relationship with the eu , and we also want to deepen the relationship with ukraine . "
he also said that " we have to state very clearly that we were disappointed by the problems between ukraine and russia , " and called for political stability and reform in ukraine .
his diplomatic balancing act is likely to have a frosty reception in moscow , where peskov said that russia " would prefer to hear from the european states a very serious and severe evaluation of who is guilty for interrupting the transit .

gaza fallout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president koehler , middle , and other german leaders observed the occasion kramer said the most recent hostilities between israel and palestinians had led to an upsurge in anti-jewish sentiment in germany .
" we have been forced to register that during the war in gaza the number of hate mails sent to the council has increased by around 40 percent to 200-300 per week , " kramer told ap .
he added that some of those mails contained explicit death threats toward council members .
in his speech before the reichstag , president koehler called for greater solidarity with german jews .
" let us stand beside our fellow jewish citizens , " koehler said .
" whoever attacks them attacks all of us as well . "
but jewish leaders are also disappointed at germany 's reaction to pope benedict xvi 's decision to repeal the excommunication of a priest for holocaust denial .
in an interview with a german tv station , council president charlotte knobloch said she was outraged by the decision taken by the german pontiff .
more than just words ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz was liberated 64 years ago the rancor might cause some to question whether holocaust memorial day serves any other purpose than to pay ritualistic lip-service to a historical tragedy and injustice .
but yehuda bauer , the director of the yad vashem holocaust memorial in israel , says that ceremonies like the one in the bundestag can serve a valuable purpose .
" the ritual can gain in content and can be presented so that true thoughts and feelings are behind it , " bauer said in an interview with a german radio station .
the israeli historian said the occasion was also useful in lending historical perspective to recent events .
" genocide is the attempt to partially or completely exterminate a national , ethnic , religious or racial group , " bauer said .
" what happened in gaza is a conflict , a bloody conflict between two nationalities like in sri lanka , kashmir and other places .
they are not genocides . "
" what is happening in darfur and what happened in rwanda are genocides , " bauer added .
" you have to distinguish . "
during world war ii , the nazi regime organized the systematic killings of some six million jews , most of them in eastern europe .
the nazis also targeted sinti and roma and homosexuals for wholesale extermination . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany has about 3,500 soldiers stationed the country , where attacks remain a common occurance . seven years after the end of the taliban regime , afghanistan continues to be wracked by violence .
maurus wrixel , a first lieutenant in the german military , recently shared his experience at the front lines of the effort to rebuild afghanistan and restore order in the war-torn country .
wrixel is part of the german military 's " provincial reconstruction team " in feyzabad .
although the taliban never had control over this northern part of the country , german soldiers have become primary targets for islamist extremists in the region .
in november 2008 , four bundeswehr soldiers were injured near feyzabad when their patrol was attacked .
wrixel , a 27-year-old first lieutenant , said he did n't shirk away from deployment in afghanistan .
he knew of the dangers when he signed up to serve in the german military .
" it was clear to me that i was going to do it because i 'm a soldier and foreign assignments are part of that , " said the blond young man from a small town near the western german city of neuss .
facing daily danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops do n't have much contact with afghans despite months of preparation , wrixel 's deployment to afghanistan in june of 2008 made him feel queasy .
" on one hand , you 're excited because you can finally use what you 've learned for so long .
on the other hand , you wonder about all the things that could happen .
that is the double-edged part , " wrixel said .
more than 30 of his fellow soldiers have already lost their lives in afghanistan .
it 's not always easy to keep going out and doing the job , especially the day after an attack , he said .
" sometimes you hear that something has happened in the evening in kunduz and then the next day you have to go outside again , " he said .
" or you 're standing in the dark at a road crossing and people come up to you who you ca n't recognize despite night-vision devices and you just have to just hope that nothing happens . "

there are brown , low mountain ranges with steep cliffs and the air seems to always be filled with dust .
despite its rich mineral resources , the region is the poorest in afghanistan .
the average life expectancy is 43 years and 90 percent of the population is illiterate .
it 's an area which , compared to europe , seems stuck in the middle ages .
the low level of development means there is plenty of work for german reconstruction team members , and they work hard .
it helps make the time pass more quickly .
during their free time , soldiers have few entertainment options , as security concerns make it nearly impossible for them to leave the camp .
there 's a small " fitness tent " where they can work out .
wrixel also spends afternoons playing foosball or darts or drinking coffee .
in the evening , they are allowed to drink a beer , but are limited by the so-called " two can rule " as they need to be ready to deploy at any time .
despite all the risks and annoyances , maurus wrixel is positive , calling his time in afghanistan a " super experience . "
the teamwork alone makes it worth it , he said .
" i 'd go again , if i got another offer , " he says .

germany has about 3,500 soldiers stationed the country , where attacks remain a common occurance . seven years after the end of the taliban regime , afghanistan continues to be wracked by violence .
maurus wrixel , a first lieutenant in the german military , recently shared his experience at the front lines of the effort to rebuild afghanistan and restore order in the war-torn country .
wrixel is part of the german military 's " provincial reconstruction team " in feyzabad .
although the taliban never had control over this northern part of the country , german soldiers have become primary targets for islamist extremists in the region .
in november 2008 , four bundeswehr soldiers were injured near feyzabad when their patrol was attacked .
wrixel , a 27-year-old first lieutenant , said he did n't shirk away from deployment in afghanistan .
he knew of the dangers when he signed up to serve in the german military .
" it was clear to me that i was going to do it because i 'm a soldier and foreign assignments are part of that , " said the blond young man from a small town near the western german city of neuss .

" on one hand , you 're excited because you can finally use what you 've learned for so long .
on the other hand , you wonder about all the things that could happen .
that is the double-edged part , " wrixel said .
more than 30 of his fellow soldiers have already lost their lives in afghanistan .
it 's not always easy to keep going out and doing the job , especially the day after an attack , he said .
" sometimes you hear that something has happened in the evening in kunduz and then the next day you have to go outside again , " he said .
" or you 're standing in the dark at a road crossing and people come up to you who you ca n't recognize despite night-vision devices and you just have to just hope that nothing happens . "

in the evening , they are allowed to drink a beer , but are limited by the so-called " two can rule " as they need to be ready to deploy at any time .
despite all the risks and annoyances , maurus wrixel is positive , calling his time in afghanistan a " super experience . "
the teamwork alone makes it worth it , he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 27.01.2009 eu seeks buyers for unwanted security " nude scanners " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu argued about the scanners on the issues of privacy and decency a proposed plan to introduce full-body security scanners at airports around europe plunged the eu into a debate about privacy and decency .
now it has another problem arising from the hardware . " for sale : six security scanners in original packing , never used .
perfect for airport checks and entrances at highly sensitive locations .
sold separately or as one job lot .
open to offers of around 120,000 euros -lrb- $ 158,000 -rrb- each . "
at first glance , this -lrb- fabricated -rrb- advert may suggest that the european union is feeling the pinch in the current financial climate and is looking to put some much needed extra revenue back into its coffers .
but on closer inspection , the ad reveals not that the eu is hard-up for cash and has to sell off its equipment but that it is ready to offload some controversial hardware due to its embarrassing nature .
taking a closer look at the small print , one can see why : " caution – these scanners can provide unwanted and intrusive naked images . "
the scanners in question , currently being stored in the basements of the european parliament buildings in brussels and strasbourg , have been at the center of a heated debate since october when eu nations began arguing over plans to introduce the body scanners at airports around the continent .
those in favor stressed the need for such equipment in the fight against terrorism while others opposed the scanners over concerns about voyeurism .
a question of dignity and security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scanner shows up guns and bombs - and everything else wolfgang schaeuble , the german interior minister , was one of the opponents to the plan .
schaeuble spoke of the threat to passengers ' " dignity " as they appeared naked on screens while the scanner seeks out arms , explosives , drugs and other illicit items .
" i do n't want the police to run the risk of being accused of voyeurism , " schaeuble told a press conference at the time .
" if we manage to invent scanners that do n't produce images then we could use them , " he added .
schaeuble 's french counterpart michele alliot-marie was in favor of the scanners , for security not voyeuristic reasons .
alliot-marie recognized the need " to respect everyone 's rights " but added " we must use , with great determination , all advanced technology to fight the terrorists and major criminals , because they know perfectly well how to use it and are often a jump ahead of us , " she stressed .
germany researching alternatives as eu shelves plan schaeuble 's comments eventually led to the start of laboratory tests in germany in which scientists began working on potential upgrades to the full-body airport screening devices in the hope they would find a way to produce images that do not show passengers naked .
the eu shelved its plans to introduce the scanners around the bloc in november after several were tested in airports around europe as part of a trial .
eu parliamentarians will now discuss how the scanners in their possession will be sold - and to whom . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

obama 's internationalist style is drawing positive reviews , but disagreements still loom . one week into his presidency , barack obama seems to be making good on his campaign pledge to adopt a more multilateral approach to global problems than his predecessor .
on monday , jan .
26 , obama gave his first formal television interview to the arab-language channel al-arabiya , in which he sought to reassure muslims in the middle east that " americans are not your enemy . "
he also put in telephone calls to french president nicolas sarkozy , german chancellor angela merkel and russia president dmitry medvedev .
obama and sarkozy conversed for 30 minutes .
afterwards , in a statement , the french president said they have agreed to work together in " resolute fashion " on the reconstruction of afghanistan , the global economic crisis and obama 's plan to shut down the controversial army detention center in guantanamo bay , cuba .
obama 's talks with merkel and medvedev reportedly focused on many of the same issues .
relations between the united states and france , germany and russia cooled under obama 's predecessor george w. bush - in part because those three countries refused to support the us-led war on iraq .
in the realm of foreign policy , obama concentrated much of his first week in office on the middle east .
but monday 's calls suggest that he wants to increase cooperation between the us and europe as well .
media hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama supports states ' effort to reduce co2 emissions the decisions taken by obama during his first seven days are going down well with european newspapers , most of which took a dim view of bush and what were perceived as his short-sighted , unilateral policies .
" the diversity of the decisions and directives in the past seven days gives us an idea not only of obama 's political caliber … but also of his modus operandi : his ability to decide cleverly and maneuver between hostile ideological fronts , " wrote the italian newspaper la repubblica .
european opinion-makers have welcomed the appointment of former senator george mitchell , the architect of peace in northern ireland , as us special envoy to the middle east .
" our hopes are with him and the new american government , " wrote the french paper paris-normandie .
" so that words and reason can finally silence weapons . "
europeans are also encouraged by obama 's environmental policies , which place greater emphasis on clean energy sources .
" it is truly a major event that the president of the world 's most powerful nation and one of its biggest polluters definitively acknowledges the need for new and more responsible policies , " wrote the french paper la presse de la manche .
guantanamo and other dilemmas bildunterschrift : how long will the smiles between obama and europe last ? but while the honeymoon continues for now , there are issues on which the obama administration and europe do not see eye to eye .
russia , for instance , has said it will cooperate with washington on fighting terrorism , especially in afghanistan , but has also stressed that it wants more understanding from the us in return .
and merkel 's conservative-led government in germany has been noticeably less enthusiastic than france about the idea that eu countries could take in some of the prisoners released from guantanamo .
some european newspapers are echoing the resistance to that idea .
" without any logic at all , the us is insisting that -lsb- detainees -rsb- be dispersed to countries that have more-or-less actively participated in the war on terror , " wrote the conservative-leaning danish paper jyllands-posten .
" it would be more obvious to send them back to their home countries . "
moreover , some left-wing commentators are disappointed in the sort of change obama has brought to us policies - and in particular his stated aim to step up america 's military efforts in afghanistan .
" the first democratic president in the modern era to be elected on an anti-war ticket is also , to the relief of neocons and the liberal belligerati , a hawk , " wrote richard seymour in britain 's guardian newspaper .
if obama follows through with his plan to seek a military solution in afghanistan , he will likely call on america 's european allies to do more - something that may not sit very well with eu leaders , who have been historically skittish about sending troops abroad . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the realm of foreign policy , obama concentrated much of his first week in office on the middle east .
but monday 's calls suggest that he wants to increase cooperation between the us and europe as well .

" the diversity of the decisions and directives in the past seven days gives us an idea not only of obama 's political caliber … but also of his modus operandi : his ability to decide cleverly and maneuver between hostile ideological fronts , " wrote the italian newspaper la repubblica .
european opinion-makers have welcomed the appointment of former senator george mitchell , the architect of peace in northern ireland , as us special envoy to the middle east .
" our hopes are with him and the new american government , " wrote the french paper paris-normandie .
" so that words and reason can finally silence weapons . "

russia , for instance , has said it will cooperate with washington on fighting terrorism , especially in afghanistan , but has also stressed that it wants more understanding from the us in return .
and merkel 's conservative-led government in germany has been noticeably less enthusiastic than france about the idea that eu countries could take in some of the prisoners released from guantanamo .
some european newspapers are echoing the resistance to that idea .

" the first democratic president in the modern era to be elected on an anti-war ticket is also , to the relief of neocons and the liberal belligerati , a hawk , " wrote richard seymour in britain 's guardian newspaper .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 27.01.2009 obama calls europe , gets largely cooperative response großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo is one of the most tricky issues right now for obama the new us president capped off his first week in office by phoning the leaders of france , germany and russia .
obama 's internationalist style is drawing positive reviews , but disagreements still loom . one week into his presidency , barack obama seems to be making good on his campaign pledge to adopt a more multilateral approach to global problems than his predecessor .
on monday , jan .
26 , obama gave his first formal television interview to the arab-language channel al-arabiya , in which he sought to reassure muslims in the middle east that " americans are not your enemy . "
he also put in telephone calls to french president nicolas sarkozy , german chancellor angela merkel and russia president dmitry medvedev .
obama and sarkozy conversed for 30 minutes .
afterwards , in a statement , the french president said they have agreed to work together in " resolute fashion " on the reconstruction of afghanistan , the global economic crisis and obama 's plan to shut down the controversial army detention center in guantanamo bay , cuba .
obama 's talks with merkel and medvedev reportedly focused on many of the same issues .
relations between the united states and france , germany and russia cooled under obama 's predecessor george w. bush - in part because those three countries refused to support the us-led war on iraq .
in the realm of foreign policy , obama concentrated much of his first week in office on the middle east .
but monday 's calls suggest that he wants to increase cooperation between the us and europe as well .
media hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama supports states ' effort to reduce co2 emissions the decisions taken by obama during his first seven days are going down well with european newspapers , most of which took a dim view of bush and what were perceived as his short-sighted , unilateral policies .
" the diversity of the decisions and directives in the past seven days gives us an idea not only of obama 's political caliber … but also of his modus operandi : his ability to decide cleverly and maneuver between hostile ideological fronts , " wrote the italian newspaper la repubblica .
european opinion-makers have welcomed the appointment of former senator george mitchell , the architect of peace in northern ireland , as us special envoy to the middle east .
" our hopes are with him and the new american government , " wrote the french paper paris-normandie .
" so that words and reason can finally silence weapons . "
europeans are also encouraged by obama 's environmental policies , which place greater emphasis on clean energy sources .
" it is truly a major event that the president of the world 's most powerful nation and one of its biggest polluters definitively acknowledges the need for new and more responsible policies , " wrote the french paper la presse de la manche .
guantanamo and other dilemmas bildunterschrift : how long will the smiles between obama and europe last ? but while the honeymoon continues for now , there are issues on which the obama administration and europe do not see eye to eye .
russia , for instance , has said it will cooperate with washington on fighting terrorism , especially in afghanistan , but has also stressed that it wants more understanding from the us in return .
and merkel 's conservative-led government in germany has been noticeably less enthusiastic than france about the idea that eu countries could take in some of the prisoners released from guantanamo .
some european newspapers are echoing the resistance to that idea .
" without any logic at all , the us is insisting that -lsb- detainees -rsb- be dispersed to countries that have more-or-less actively participated in the war on terror , " wrote the conservative-leaning danish paper jyllands-posten .
" it would be more obvious to send them back to their home countries . "
moreover , some left-wing commentators are disappointed in the sort of change obama has brought to us policies - and in particular his stated aim to step up america 's military efforts in afghanistan .
" the first democratic president in the modern era to be elected on an anti-war ticket is also , to the relief of neocons and the liberal belligerati , a hawk , " wrote richard seymour in britain 's guardian newspaper .
if obama follows through with his plan to seek a military solution in afghanistan , he will likely call on america 's european allies to do more - something that may not sit very well with eu leaders , who have been historically skittish about sending troops abroad . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

obama 's internationalist style is drawing positive reviews , but disagreements still loom . one week into his presidency , barack obama seems to be making good on his campaign pledge to adopt a more multilateral approach to global problems than his predecessor .
on monday , jan .
26 , obama gave his first formal television interview to the arab-language channel al-arabiya , in which he sought to reassure muslims in the middle east that " americans are not your enemy . "
he also put in telephone calls to french president nicolas sarkozy , german chancellor angela merkel and russia president dmitry medvedev .
obama and sarkozy conversed for 30 minutes .
afterwards , in a statement , the french president said they have agreed to work together in " resolute fashion " on the reconstruction of afghanistan , the global economic crisis and obama 's plan to shut down the controversial army detention center in guantanamo bay , cuba .
obama 's talks with merkel and medvedev reportedly focused on many of the same issues .
relations between the united states and france , germany and russia cooled under obama 's predecessor george w. bush - in part because those three countries refused to support the us-led war on iraq .
in the realm of foreign policy , obama concentrated much of his first week in office on the middle east .
but monday 's calls suggest that he wants to increase cooperation between the us and europe as well .
media hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama supports states ' effort to reduce co2 emissions the decisions taken by obama during his first seven days are going down well with european newspapers , most of which took a dim view of bush and what were perceived as his short-sighted , unilateral policies .
" the diversity of the decisions and directives in the past seven days gives us an idea not only of obama 's political caliber … but also of his modus operandi : his ability to decide cleverly and maneuver between hostile ideological fronts , " wrote the italian newspaper la repubblica .
european opinion-makers have welcomed the appointment of former senator george mitchell , the architect of peace in northern ireland , as us special envoy to the middle east .
" our hopes are with him and the new american government , " wrote the french paper paris-normandie .
" so that words and reason can finally silence weapons . "
europeans are also encouraged by obama 's environmental policies , which place greater emphasis on clean energy sources .
" it is truly a major event that the president of the world 's most powerful nation and one of its biggest polluters definitively acknowledges the need for new and more responsible policies , " wrote the french paper la presse de la manche .
guantanamo and other dilemmas bildunterschrift : how long will the smiles between obama and europe last ? but while the honeymoon continues for now , there are issues on which the obama administration and europe do not see eye to eye .
russia , for instance , has said it will cooperate with washington on fighting terrorism , especially in afghanistan , but has also stressed that it wants more understanding from the us in return .
and merkel 's conservative-led government in germany has been noticeably less enthusiastic than france about the idea that eu countries could take in some of the prisoners released from guantanamo .
some european newspapers are echoing the resistance to that idea .
" without any logic at all , the us is insisting that -lsb- detainees -rsb- be dispersed to countries that have more-or-less actively participated in the war on terror , " wrote the conservative-leaning danish paper jyllands-posten .
" it would be more obvious to send them back to their home countries . "
moreover , some left-wing commentators are disappointed in the sort of change obama has brought to us policies - and in particular his stated aim to step up america 's military efforts in afghanistan .
" the first democratic president in the modern era to be elected on an anti-war ticket is also , to the relief of neocons and the liberal belligerati , a hawk , " wrote richard seymour in britain 's guardian newspaper .
if obama follows through with his plan to seek a military solution in afghanistan , he will likely call on america 's european allies to do more - something that may not sit very well with eu leaders , who have been historically skittish about sending troops abroad . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's cornelia rabitz says that it 's time for europe to find a common discourse on remembering the darkest part of the continent 's past to ensure a bright future . about 1 million people from around the world visit the auschwitz memorial each year to commemorate the victims of the holocaust .
it 's a significant number of people , who still come to the museum to get an idea of living and dying in this former antechamber of hell - and to learn from history . memorial officials recently rang sounded an alarm , saying that the buildings are in danger of collapsing and that a lot of money is needed for their restoration .
germany reacted quickly and said that it would help out financially .
and rightly so .
more than six decades after the end of the war , it remains a duty for state and society to accept historic responsibility and keep the memory alive - even if this becomes more and more difficult as the distance of time keeps growing and eyewitnesses die . history books , museums , tv documentaries and movie films have to replace personal conversations .
the ability to relate to the topic - both in terms of time and emotions - continues to wane . to learn from history also means to look at today and arm ourselves against discrimination , racism , xenophobia and - needless to say - anti-semitism .
it 's depressing to see that the conflict between israelis and palestinians has led to falling inhibition thresholds and that jewish people are becoming the targets of hate mail - especially in germany . it 's alarming that anti-semitic stereotypes persist , as polls show again and again .
it 's alarming that neo-nazis drum people together for noisy demonstrations , that propaganda and historical misrepresentation find receptive audiences in our society . still : there will be a large number of events , lectures and concerts to commemorate tuesday 's holocaust day .

january 27th has been the official day for holocaust remembrance in germany since 1996 .
some of those who took part in the ceremony were critical of the council 's decision .
" in recent years , we 've always had very dignified hours of remembrance with a variety of participants , " social democratic cultural spokeswoman monika griefahn said in an interview with a berlin radio station .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 27.01.2009 eu seeks buyers for unwanted security " nude scanners " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu argued about the scanners on the issues of privacy and decency a proposed plan to introduce full-body security scanners at airports around europe plunged the eu into a debate about privacy and decency .
now it has another problem arising from the hardware . " for sale : six security scanners in original packing , never used .
perfect for airport checks and entrances at highly sensitive locations .
sold separately or as one job lot .
open to offers of around 120,000 euros -lrb- $ 158,000 -rrb- each . "
at first glance , this -lrb- fabricated -rrb- advert may suggest that the european union is feeling the pinch in the current financial climate and is looking to put some much needed extra revenue back into its coffers .
but on closer inspection , the ad reveals not that the eu is hard-up for cash and has to sell off its equipment but that it is ready to offload some controversial hardware due to its embarrassing nature .
taking a closer look at the small print , one can see why : " caution – these scanners can provide unwanted and intrusive naked images . "
the scanners in question , currently being stored in the basements of the european parliament buildings in brussels and strasbourg , have been at the center of a heated debate since october when eu nations began arguing over plans to introduce the body scanners at airports around the continent .
those in favor stressed the need for such equipment in the fight against terrorism while others opposed the scanners over concerns about voyeurism .
a question of dignity and security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scanner shows up guns and bombs - and everything else wolfgang schaeuble , the german interior minister , was one of the opponents to the plan .
schaeuble spoke of the threat to passengers ' " dignity " as they appeared naked on screens while the scanner seeks out arms , explosives , drugs and other illicit items .
" i do n't want the police to run the risk of being accused of voyeurism , " schaeuble told a press conference at the time .
" if we manage to invent scanners that do n't produce images then we could use them , " he added .
schaeuble 's french counterpart michele alliot-marie was in favor of the scanners , for security not voyeuristic reasons .
alliot-marie recognized the need " to respect everyone 's rights " but added " we must use , with great determination , all advanced technology to fight the terrorists and major criminals , because they know perfectly well how to use it and are often a jump ahead of us , " she stressed .
germany researching alternatives as eu shelves plan schaeuble 's comments eventually led to the start of laboratory tests in germany in which scientists began working on potential upgrades to the full-body airport screening devices in the hope they would find a way to produce images that do not show passengers naked .
the eu shelved its plans to introduce the scanners around the bloc in november after several were tested in airports around europe as part of a trial .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 27.01.2009 eu seeks buyers for unwanted security " nude scanners " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu argued about the scanners on the issues of privacy and decency a proposed plan to introduce full-body security scanners at airports around europe plunged the eu into a debate about privacy and decency .
now it has another problem arising from the hardware . " for sale : six security scanners in original packing , never used .
perfect for airport checks and entrances at highly sensitive locations .
sold separately or as one job lot .
open to offers of around 120,000 euros -lrb- $ 158,000 -rrb- each . "
at first glance , this -lrb- fabricated -rrb- advert may suggest that the european union is feeling the pinch in the current financial climate and is looking to put some much needed extra revenue back into its coffers .
but on closer inspection , the ad reveals not that the eu is hard-up for cash and has to sell off its equipment but that it is ready to offload some controversial hardware due to its embarrassing nature .
taking a closer look at the small print , one can see why : " caution – these scanners can provide unwanted and intrusive naked images . "
the scanners in question , currently being stored in the basements of the european parliament buildings in brussels and strasbourg , have been at the center of a heated debate since october when eu nations began arguing over plans to introduce the body scanners at airports around the continent .
those in favor stressed the need for such equipment in the fight against terrorism while others opposed the scanners over concerns about voyeurism .
a question of dignity and security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scanner shows up guns and bombs - and everything else wolfgang schaeuble , the german interior minister , was one of the opponents to the plan .
schaeuble spoke of the threat to passengers ' " dignity " as they appeared naked on screens while the scanner seeks out arms , explosives , drugs and other illicit items .
" i do n't want the police to run the risk of being accused of voyeurism , " schaeuble told a press conference at the time .
" if we manage to invent scanners that do n't produce images then we could use them , " he added .
schaeuble 's french counterpart michele alliot-marie was in favor of the scanners , for security not voyeuristic reasons .
alliot-marie recognized the need " to respect everyone 's rights " but added " we must use , with great determination , all advanced technology to fight the terrorists and major criminals , because they know perfectly well how to use it and are often a jump ahead of us , " she stressed .
germany researching alternatives as eu shelves plan schaeuble 's comments eventually led to the start of laboratory tests in germany in which scientists began working on potential upgrades to the full-body airport screening devices in the hope they would find a way to produce images that do not show passengers naked .
the eu shelved its plans to introduce the scanners around the bloc in november after several were tested in airports around europe as part of a trial .
eu parliamentarians will now discuss how the scanners in their possession will be sold - and to whom . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analysts had predicted that it would fall to 81.5 points . based on a survey of 7,000 german executives and drawn up by the munich-based ifo economic research institute , the index plummeted in december to 82.7 points , which was its lowest point since the 1980s oil crisis .
since the publication of the december survey , a slew of bleak indicators and data have continued to roll in .
economy may pick up soon the indicator 's component gauging expectations six months down the track is predicted to rise on hopes of an economic pickup later in the year .
predictions of an increase in the expectations gauge come amid signs that the severe downturn that has hit germany and the world economy in recent months could be reaching its low point .
indeed , hopes have been rising that the round of hefty global interest rate cuts , falling oil prices and government stimulus packages would help to form the basis of an economic pickup later in the year . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany has about 3,500 soldiers stationed the country , where attacks remain a common occurance . seven years after the end of the taliban regime , afghanistan continues to be wracked by violence .
maurus wrixel , a first lieutenant in the german military , recently shared his experience at the front lines of the effort to rebuild afghanistan and restore order in the war-torn country .
wrixel is part of the german military 's " provincial reconstruction team " in feyzabad .
although the taliban never had control over this northern part of the country , german soldiers have become primary targets for islamist extremists in the region .
in november 2008 , four bundeswehr soldiers were injured near feyzabad when their patrol was attacked .
wrixel , a 27-year-old first lieutenant , said he did n't shirk away from deployment in afghanistan .

" due to the legal situation in different -lrb- eu -rrb- countries , we ca n't give a quick answer ...
it is not a question which can be solved in weeks or months , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the bloc 's rotating presidency . while the new administration of us president barack obama has not yet officially asked european governments to host any of the 60 guantanamo inmates eligible for release , a list of possible candidates has already begun circulating in european capitals . but the lack of a quick response from the eu is likely to be ill-received in washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans want to get off on a good foot with obama analysts had warned ahead of monday 's talks that the eu 's reaction on guantanamo represented the first real test of europe 's will to start relations with the obama administration on a positive note . as finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said , " we need to shake hands with the us : it 's a new , fresh start . " legal complications but ministers later insisted that legal complications made it impossible for them to commit themselves quickly . " we found during our discussions that the legal situations are different in different -lrb- eu -rrb- states , " schwarzenberg said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama signs an executive order closing the prison at guantanamo bay he said foreign ministers would first ask for a reasoned opinion from their justice and interior ministers .
" then we will probably have another meeting , " he said . so far , portugal is the only eu member state to have clearly stated its intention of taking in former detainees who would face persecution and abuse if sent to their countries of origin in the middle east . the foreign ministers of germany and france both said in brussels that they would consider hosting the men in orange jumpsuits only on a " case-by-case " basis , with france 's bernard kouchner insisting that he would not accept any " impositions " from washington . and britain , which has already taken in 12 former detainees , has said it will not take in more . britain " feels it has already made a significant contribution but that we are keen to offer our experience on the repatriation of these people to other european countries who are ready to play their part , " british foreign secretary david miliband said ahead of the talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guantanamo prison outraged many europeans the eu has long called for the closure of the guantanamo detention center and welcomed the decision by obama to prepare the jail 's closure soon after assuming office . but securing a common european position on what to do next would likely take a long period of complex legal discussions , judging from the outcome of monday 's talks . opposition group there was further controversy when ministers removed the people 's mujahedin of iran -lrb- pmoi -rrb- from their list of terrorist organizations on monday , despite the opposition of france and public protests in tehran . the widely expected move followed a ruling by the european court in luxembourg , which in december said the eu was wrong to keep the pmoi 's assets frozen after it was taken off a british list of terrorist organizations . " what we are doing today is abiding by the resolution of the european court .
there 's nothing we can do about that resolution , " eu foreign-policy chief javier solana said . however , in light of objections from france , czech officials said the eu might reconsider its decision " if new evidence " against the pmoi were to emerge . founded in 1965 , the pmoi operated a military wing in its early years , but says it renounced violence in june 2001 and now advocates the political overthrow of iran 's current government . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's cornelia rabitz says that it 's time for europe to find a common discourse on remembering the darkest part of the continent 's past to ensure a bright future . about 1 million people from around the world visit the auschwitz memorial each year to commemorate the victims of the holocaust .
it 's a significant number of people , who still come to the museum to get an idea of living and dying in this former antechamber of hell - and to learn from history . memorial officials recently rang sounded an alarm , saying that the buildings are in danger of collapsing and that a lot of money is needed for their restoration .
germany reacted quickly and said that it would help out financially .
and rightly so .
more than six decades after the end of the war , it remains a duty for state and society to accept historic responsibility and keep the memory alive - even if this becomes more and more difficult as the distance of time keeps growing and eyewitnesses die . history books , museums , tv documentaries and movie films have to replace personal conversations .
the ability to relate to the topic - both in terms of time and emotions - continues to wane . to learn from history also means to look at today and arm ourselves against discrimination , racism , xenophobia and - needless to say - anti-semitism .
it 's depressing to see that the conflict between israelis and palestinians has led to falling inhibition thresholds and that jewish people are becoming the targets of hate mail - especially in germany . it 's alarming that anti-semitic stereotypes persist , as polls show again and again .
it 's alarming that neo-nazis drum people together for noisy demonstrations , that propaganda and historical misrepresentation find receptive audiences in our society . still : there will be a large number of events , lectures and concerts to commemorate tuesday 's holocaust day .
they will offer a chance to deal with the issue .
keeping the memory alive could become a european task .
a unifying europe should agree on a common discourse of memory .

dw 's cornelia rabitz says that it 's time for europe to find a common discourse on remembering the darkest part of the continent 's past to ensure a bright future . about 1 million people from around the world visit the auschwitz memorial each year to commemorate the victims of the holocaust .
it 's a significant number of people , who still come to the museum to get an idea of living and dying in this former antechamber of hell - and to learn from history . memorial officials recently rang sounded an alarm , saying that the buildings are in danger of collapsing and that a lot of money is needed for their restoration .
germany reacted quickly and said that it would help out financially .
and rightly so .
more than six decades after the end of the war , it remains a duty for state and society to accept historic responsibility and keep the memory alive - even if this becomes more and more difficult as the distance of time keeps growing and eyewitnesses die . history books , museums , tv documentaries and movie films have to replace personal conversations .
the ability to relate to the topic - both in terms of time and emotions - continues to wane . to learn from history also means to look at today and arm ourselves against discrimination , racism , xenophobia and - needless to say - anti-semitism .
it 's depressing to see that the conflict between israelis and palestinians has led to falling inhibition thresholds and that jewish people are becoming the targets of hate mail - especially in germany . it 's alarming that anti-semitic stereotypes persist , as polls show again and again .
it 's alarming that neo-nazis drum people together for noisy demonstrations , that propaganda and historical misrepresentation find receptive audiences in our society . still : there will be a large number of events , lectures and concerts to commemorate tuesday 's holocaust day .

obama 's internationalist style is drawing positive reviews , but disagreements still loom . one week into his presidency , barack obama seems to be making good on his campaign pledge to adopt a more multilateral approach to global problems than his predecessor .
on monday , jan .
26 , obama gave his first formal television interview to the arab-language channel al-arabiya , in which he sought to reassure muslims in the middle east that " americans are not your enemy . "
he also put in telephone calls to french president nicolas sarkozy , german chancellor angela merkel and russia president dmitry medvedev .
obama and sarkozy conversed for 30 minutes .
afterwards , in a statement , the french president said they have agreed to work together in " resolute fashion " on the reconstruction of afghanistan , the global economic crisis and obama 's plan to shut down the controversial army detention center in guantanamo bay , cuba .
obama 's talks with merkel and medvedev reportedly focused on many of the same issues .
relations between the united states and france , germany and russia cooled under obama 's predecessor george w. bush - in part because those three countries refused to support the us-led war on iraq .
in the realm of foreign policy , obama concentrated much of his first week in office on the middle east .
but monday 's calls suggest that he wants to increase cooperation between the us and europe as well .
media hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama supports states ' effort to reduce co2 emissions the decisions taken by obama during his first seven days are going down well with european newspapers , most of which took a dim view of bush and what were perceived as his short-sighted , unilateral policies .
" the diversity of the decisions and directives in the past seven days gives us an idea not only of obama 's political caliber … but also of his modus operandi : his ability to decide cleverly and maneuver between hostile ideological fronts , " wrote the italian newspaper la repubblica .
european opinion-makers have welcomed the appointment of former senator george mitchell , the architect of peace in northern ireland , as us special envoy to the middle east .
" our hopes are with him and the new american government , " wrote the french paper paris-normandie .
" so that words and reason can finally silence weapons . "
europeans are also encouraged by obama 's environmental policies , which place greater emphasis on clean energy sources .
" it is truly a major event that the president of the world 's most powerful nation and one of its biggest polluters definitively acknowledges the need for new and more responsible policies , " wrote the french paper la presse de la manche .
guantanamo and other dilemmas bildunterschrift : how long will the smiles between obama and europe last ? but while the honeymoon continues for now , there are issues on which the obama administration and europe do not see eye to eye .
russia , for instance , has said it will cooperate with washington on fighting terrorism , especially in afghanistan , but has also stressed that it wants more understanding from the us in return .
and merkel 's conservative-led government in germany has been noticeably less enthusiastic than france about the idea that eu countries could take in some of the prisoners released from guantanamo .
some european newspapers are echoing the resistance to that idea .
" without any logic at all , the us is insisting that -lsb- detainees -rsb- be dispersed to countries that have more-or-less actively participated in the war on terror , " wrote the conservative-leaning danish paper jyllands-posten .
" it would be more obvious to send them back to their home countries . "
moreover , some left-wing commentators are disappointed in the sort of change obama has brought to us policies - and in particular his stated aim to step up america 's military efforts in afghanistan .
" the first democratic president in the modern era to be elected on an anti-war ticket is also , to the relief of neocons and the liberal belligerati , a hawk , " wrote richard seymour in britain 's guardian newspaper .
if obama follows through with his plan to seek a military solution in afghanistan , he will likely call on america 's european allies to do more - something that may not sit very well with eu leaders , who have been historically skittish about sending troops abroad . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

obama 's internationalist style is drawing positive reviews , but disagreements still loom . one week into his presidency , barack obama seems to be making good on his campaign pledge to adopt a more multilateral approach to global problems than his predecessor .
on monday , jan .
26 , obama gave his first formal television interview to the arab-language channel al-arabiya , in which he sought to reassure muslims in the middle east that " americans are not your enemy . "
he also put in telephone calls to french president nicolas sarkozy , german chancellor angela merkel and russia president dmitry medvedev .
obama and sarkozy conversed for 30 minutes .
afterwards , in a statement , the french president said they have agreed to work together in " resolute fashion " on the reconstruction of afghanistan , the global economic crisis and obama 's plan to shut down the controversial army detention center in guantanamo bay , cuba .
obama 's talks with merkel and medvedev reportedly focused on many of the same issues .
relations between the united states and france , germany and russia cooled under obama 's predecessor george w. bush - in part because those three countries refused to support the us-led war on iraq .
in the realm of foreign policy , obama concentrated much of his first week in office on the middle east .
but monday 's calls suggest that he wants to increase cooperation between the us and europe as well .

european opinion-makers have welcomed the appointment of former senator george mitchell , the architect of peace in northern ireland , as us special envoy to the middle east .

obama 's internationalist style is drawing positive reviews , but disagreements still loom . one week into his presidency , barack obama seems to be making good on his campaign pledge to adopt a more multilateral approach to global problems than his predecessor .
on monday , jan .
26 , obama gave his first formal television interview to the arab-language channel al-arabiya , in which he sought to reassure muslims in the middle east that " americans are not your enemy . "
he also put in telephone calls to french president nicolas sarkozy , german chancellor angela merkel and russia president dmitry medvedev .
obama and sarkozy conversed for 30 minutes .
afterwards , in a statement , the french president said they have agreed to work together in " resolute fashion " on the reconstruction of afghanistan , the global economic crisis and obama 's plan to shut down the controversial army detention center in guantanamo bay , cuba .
obama 's talks with merkel and medvedev reportedly focused on many of the same issues .
relations between the united states and france , germany and russia cooled under obama 's predecessor george w. bush - in part because those three countries refused to support the us-led war on iraq .
in the realm of foreign policy , obama concentrated much of his first week in office on the middle east .
but monday 's calls suggest that he wants to increase cooperation between the us and europe as well .
media hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama supports states ' effort to reduce co2 emissions the decisions taken by obama during his first seven days are going down well with european newspapers , most of which took a dim view of bush and what were perceived as his short-sighted , unilateral policies .
" the diversity of the decisions and directives in the past seven days gives us an idea not only of obama 's political caliber … but also of his modus operandi : his ability to decide cleverly and maneuver between hostile ideological fronts , " wrote the italian newspaper la repubblica .
european opinion-makers have welcomed the appointment of former senator george mitchell , the architect of peace in northern ireland , as us special envoy to the middle east .
" our hopes are with him and the new american government , " wrote the french paper paris-normandie .
" so that words and reason can finally silence weapons . "
europeans are also encouraged by obama 's environmental policies , which place greater emphasis on clean energy sources .
" it is truly a major event that the president of the world 's most powerful nation and one of its biggest polluters definitively acknowledges the need for new and more responsible policies , " wrote the french paper la presse de la manche .
guantanamo and other dilemmas bildunterschrift : how long will the smiles between obama and europe last ? but while the honeymoon continues for now , there are issues on which the obama administration and europe do not see eye to eye .
russia , for instance , has said it will cooperate with washington on fighting terrorism , especially in afghanistan , but has also stressed that it wants more understanding from the us in return .
and merkel 's conservative-led government in germany has been noticeably less enthusiastic than france about the idea that eu countries could take in some of the prisoners released from guantanamo .
some european newspapers are echoing the resistance to that idea .
" without any logic at all , the us is insisting that -lsb- detainees -rsb- be dispersed to countries that have more-or-less actively participated in the war on terror , " wrote the conservative-leaning danish paper jyllands-posten .
" it would be more obvious to send them back to their home countries . "
moreover , some left-wing commentators are disappointed in the sort of change obama has brought to us policies - and in particular his stated aim to step up america 's military efforts in afghanistan .
" the first democratic president in the modern era to be elected on an anti-war ticket is also , to the relief of neocons and the liberal belligerati , a hawk , " wrote richard seymour in britain 's guardian newspaper .
if obama follows through with his plan to seek a military solution in afghanistan , he will likely call on america 's european allies to do more - something that may not sit very well with eu leaders , who have been historically skittish about sending troops abroad . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany has about 3,500 soldiers stationed the country , where attacks remain a common occurance . seven years after the end of the taliban regime , afghanistan continues to be wracked by violence .
maurus wrixel , a first lieutenant in the german military , recently shared his experience at the front lines of the effort to rebuild afghanistan and restore order in the war-torn country .
wrixel is part of the german military 's " provincial reconstruction team " in feyzabad .
although the taliban never had control over this northern part of the country , german soldiers have become primary targets for islamist extremists in the region .
in november 2008 , four bundeswehr soldiers were injured near feyzabad when their patrol was attacked .
wrixel , a 27-year-old first lieutenant , said he did n't shirk away from deployment in afghanistan .
he knew of the dangers when he signed up to serve in the german military .
" it was clear to me that i was going to do it because i 'm a soldier and foreign assignments are part of that , " said the blond young man from a small town near the western german city of neuss .
facing daily danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops do n't have much contact with afghans despite months of preparation , wrixel 's deployment to afghanistan in june of 2008 made him feel queasy .
" on one hand , you 're excited because you can finally use what you 've learned for so long .
on the other hand , you wonder about all the things that could happen .
that is the double-edged part , " wrixel said .
more than 30 of his fellow soldiers have already lost their lives in afghanistan .
it 's not always easy to keep going out and doing the job , especially the day after an attack , he said .
" sometimes you hear that something has happened in the evening in kunduz and then the next day you have to go outside again , " he said .
" or you 're standing in the dark at a road crossing and people come up to you who you ca n't recognize despite night-vision devices and you just have to just hope that nothing happens . "

there are brown , low mountain ranges with steep cliffs and the air seems to always be filled with dust .
despite its rich mineral resources , the region is the poorest in afghanistan .
the average life expectancy is 43 years and 90 percent of the population is illiterate .
it 's an area which , compared to europe , seems stuck in the middle ages .
the low level of development means there is plenty of work for german reconstruction team members , and they work hard .
it helps make the time pass more quickly .
during their free time , soldiers have few entertainment options , as security concerns make it nearly impossible for them to leave the camp .
there 's a small " fitness tent " where they can work out .
wrixel also spends afternoons playing foosball or darts or drinking coffee .
in the evening , they are allowed to drink a beer , but are limited by the so-called " two can rule " as they need to be ready to deploy at any time .
despite all the risks and annoyances , maurus wrixel is positive , calling his time in afghanistan a " super experience . "
the teamwork alone makes it worth it , he said .
" i 'd go again , if i got another offer , " he says .
but it 's unlikely that he will get another chance .
in a few months , his seven years of bundeswehr service will come to an end .
germany could become more involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks remain a near-daily occurance in afghanistan it 's possible that more soldiers like wrixel will be heading to afghanistan in the future .
germany is among those european nations bracing for demands from the new us administration that they do more in afghanistan .
but germany is reluctant to send more troops .
chancellor merkel has said that she would not accede to any request from president barack obama to send troops to southern afghanistan , the scene of much of the heavy fighting against taliban insurgents .

germany has about 3,500 soldiers stationed the country , where attacks remain a common occurance . seven years after the end of the taliban regime , afghanistan continues to be wracked by violence .
maurus wrixel , a first lieutenant in the german military , recently shared his experience at the front lines of the effort to rebuild afghanistan and restore order in the war-torn country .
wrixel is part of the german military 's " provincial reconstruction team " in feyzabad .
although the taliban never had control over this northern part of the country , german soldiers have become primary targets for islamist extremists in the region .
in november 2008 , four bundeswehr soldiers were injured near feyzabad when their patrol was attacked .
wrixel , a 27-year-old first lieutenant , said he did n't shirk away from deployment in afghanistan .
he knew of the dangers when he signed up to serve in the german military .
" it was clear to me that i was going to do it because i 'm a soldier and foreign assignments are part of that , " said the blond young man from a small town near the western german city of neuss .
facing daily danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops do n't have much contact with afghans despite months of preparation , wrixel 's deployment to afghanistan in june of 2008 made him feel queasy .
" on one hand , you 're excited because you can finally use what you 've learned for so long .
on the other hand , you wonder about all the things that could happen .
that is the double-edged part , " wrixel said .
more than 30 of his fellow soldiers have already lost their lives in afghanistan .
it 's not always easy to keep going out and doing the job , especially the day after an attack , he said .
" sometimes you hear that something has happened in the evening in kunduz and then the next day you have to go outside again , " he said .
" or you 're standing in the dark at a road crossing and people come up to you who you ca n't recognize despite night-vision devices and you just have to just hope that nothing happens . "

there are brown , low mountain ranges with steep cliffs and the air seems to always be filled with dust .
despite its rich mineral resources , the region is the poorest in afghanistan .
the average life expectancy is 43 years and 90 percent of the population is illiterate .
it 's an area which , compared to europe , seems stuck in the middle ages .
the low level of development means there is plenty of work for german reconstruction team members , and they work hard .
it helps make the time pass more quickly .
during their free time , soldiers have few entertainment options , as security concerns make it nearly impossible for them to leave the camp .
there 's a small " fitness tent " where they can work out .
wrixel also spends afternoons playing foosball or darts or drinking coffee .
in the evening , they are allowed to drink a beer , but are limited by the so-called " two can rule " as they need to be ready to deploy at any time .
despite all the risks and annoyances , maurus wrixel is positive , calling his time in afghanistan a " super experience . "
the teamwork alone makes it worth it , he said .
" i 'd go again , if i got another offer , " he says .
but it 's unlikely that he will get another chance .
in a few months , his seven years of bundeswehr service will come to an end .

at first glance , this -lrb- fabricated -rrb- advert may suggest that the european union is feeling the pinch in the current financial climate and is looking to put some much needed extra revenue back into its coffers .
but on closer inspection , the ad reveals not that the eu is hard-up for cash and has to sell off its equipment but that it is ready to offload some controversial hardware due to its embarrassing nature .
taking a closer look at the small print , one can see why : " caution – these scanners can provide unwanted and intrusive naked images . "
the scanners in question , currently being stored in the basements of the european parliament buildings in brussels and strasbourg , have been at the center of a heated debate since october when eu nations began arguing over plans to introduce the body scanners at airports around the continent .

a question of dignity and security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scanner shows up guns and bombs - and everything else wolfgang schaeuble , the german interior minister , was one of the opponents to the plan .

" i do n't want the police to run the risk of being accused of voyeurism , " schaeuble told a press conference at the time .
" if we manage to invent scanners that do n't produce images then we could use them , " he added .
schaeuble 's french counterpart michele alliot-marie was in favor of the scanners , for security not voyeuristic reasons .
alliot-marie recognized the need " to respect everyone 's rights " but added " we must use , with great determination , all advanced technology to fight the terrorists and major criminals , because they know perfectly well how to use it and are often a jump ahead of us , " she stressed .
germany researching alternatives as eu shelves plan schaeuble 's comments eventually led to the start of laboratory tests in germany in which scientists began working on potential upgrades to the full-body airport screening devices in the hope they would find a way to produce images that do not show passengers naked .
the eu shelved its plans to introduce the scanners around the bloc in november after several were tested in airports around europe as part of a trial .

but the country 's jewish leaders chose to skip the main government ceremony on tuesday in protest for what they say is lack of respect . germany 's leading jewish organization , the central council of jews in germany , said it was boycotting the memorial event in the german parliament because surviving victims had not been personally acknowledged in the past .
" i would understand it if we were talking about representatives of the second or third generations , " council general secretary stephan j. kramer told ap news agency .
" but it can not be that actual survivors are treated like mere onlookers . "
german president horst koehler addressed the bundestag in a speech marking the 64th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz concentration camp .
january 27th has been the official day for holocaust remembrance in germany since 1996 .
some of those who took part in the ceremony were critical of the council 's decision .
" in recent years , we 've always had very dignified hours of remembrance with a variety of participants , " social democratic cultural spokeswoman monika griefahn said in an interview with a berlin radio station .

he added that some of those mails contained explicit death threats toward council members .
in his speech before the reichstag , president koehler called for greater solidarity with german jews .
" let us stand beside our fellow jewish citizens , " koehler said .
" whoever attacks them attacks all of us as well . "
but jewish leaders are also disappointed at germany 's reaction to pope benedict xvi 's decision to repeal the excommunication of a priest for holocaust denial .

but the country 's jewish leaders chose to skip the main government ceremony on tuesday in protest for what they say is lack of respect . germany 's leading jewish organization , the central council of jews in germany , said it was boycotting the memorial event in the german parliament because surviving victims had not been personally acknowledged in the past .
" i would understand it if we were talking about representatives of the second or third generations , " council general secretary stephan j. kramer told ap news agency .
" but it can not be that actual survivors are treated like mere onlookers . "
german president horst koehler addressed the bundestag in a speech marking the 64th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz concentration camp .
january 27th has been the official day for holocaust remembrance in germany since 1996 .
some of those who took part in the ceremony were critical of the council 's decision .
" in recent years , we 've always had very dignified hours of remembrance with a variety of participants , " social democratic cultural spokeswoman monika griefahn said in an interview with a berlin radio station .
but the boycott comes at a time in which many jewish leaders in germany are questioning whether the country is doing enough to combat anti-semitism .
gaza fallout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president koehler , middle , and other german leaders observed the occasion kramer said the most recent hostilities between israel and palestinians had led to an upsurge in anti-jewish sentiment in germany .
" we have been forced to register that during the war in gaza the number of hate mails sent to the council has increased by around 40 percent to 200-300 per week , " kramer told ap .
he added that some of those mails contained explicit death threats toward council members .
in his speech before the reichstag , president koehler called for greater solidarity with german jews .
" let us stand beside our fellow jewish citizens , " koehler said .
" whoever attacks them attacks all of us as well . "
but jewish leaders are also disappointed at germany 's reaction to pope benedict xvi 's decision to repeal the excommunication of a priest for holocaust denial .
in an interview with a german tv station , council president charlotte knobloch said she was outraged by the decision taken by the german pontiff .

but the country 's jewish leaders chose to skip the main government ceremony on tuesday in protest for what they say is lack of respect . germany 's leading jewish organization , the central council of jews in germany , said it was boycotting the memorial event in the german parliament because surviving victims had not been personally acknowledged in the past .
" i would understand it if we were talking about representatives of the second or third generations , " council general secretary stephan j. kramer told ap news agency .
" but it can not be that actual survivors are treated like mere onlookers . "
german president horst koehler addressed the bundestag in a speech marking the 64th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz concentration camp .
january 27th has been the official day for holocaust remembrance in germany since 1996 .
some of those who took part in the ceremony were critical of the council 's decision .
" in recent years , we 've always had very dignified hours of remembrance with a variety of participants , " social democratic cultural spokeswoman monika griefahn said in an interview with a berlin radio station .
but the boycott comes at a time in which many jewish leaders in germany are questioning whether the country is doing enough to combat anti-semitism .
gaza fallout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president koehler , middle , and other german leaders observed the occasion kramer said the most recent hostilities between israel and palestinians had led to an upsurge in anti-jewish sentiment in germany .
" we have been forced to register that during the war in gaza the number of hate mails sent to the council has increased by around 40 percent to 200-300 per week , " kramer told ap .
he added that some of those mails contained explicit death threats toward council members .
in his speech before the reichstag , president koehler called for greater solidarity with german jews .
" let us stand beside our fellow jewish citizens , " koehler said .
" whoever attacks them attacks all of us as well . "
but jewish leaders are also disappointed at germany 's reaction to pope benedict xvi 's decision to repeal the excommunication of a priest for holocaust denial .
in an interview with a german tv station , council president charlotte knobloch said she was outraged by the decision taken by the german pontiff .
more than just words ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz was liberated 64 years ago the rancor might cause some to question whether holocaust memorial day serves any other purpose than to pay ritualistic lip-service to a historical tragedy and injustice .
but yehuda bauer , the director of the yad vashem holocaust memorial in israel , says that ceremonies like the one in the bundestag can serve a valuable purpose .
" the ritual can gain in content and can be presented so that true thoughts and feelings are behind it , " bauer said in an interview with a german radio station .
the israeli historian said the occasion was also useful in lending historical perspective to recent events .
" genocide is the attempt to partially or completely exterminate a national , ethnic , religious or racial group , " bauer said .
" what happened in gaza is a conflict , a bloody conflict between two nationalities like in sri lanka , kashmir and other places .
they are not genocides . "
" what is happening in darfur and what happened in rwanda are genocides , " bauer added .
" you have to distinguish . "
during world war ii , the nazi regime organized the systematic killings of some six million jews , most of them in eastern europe .
the nazis also targeted sinti and roma and homosexuals for wholesale extermination . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 27.01.2009 proposed nabucco gas pipeline gets european bank backing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech prime minister topolanek and hungary 's gyurcsany were confident of success the heads of the eu 's european investment bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development -lrb- ebrd -rrb- said tuesday , jan .
27 , that they are prepared to provide financial backing for the nabucco gas pipeline . spurred on by europe 's worst-ever gas crisis earlier this month , which left millions of homes across the continent without heat in the depths of winter , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany invited top-ranking officials from both the eu and the countries involved in nabucco to inject fresh momentum into the slow-moving project .
nabucco , an ambitious but still-unbuilt gas pipeline aimed at reducing europe 's energy reliance on russia , is a 3,300-kilometer -lrb- 2,050-mile -rrb- pipeline between turkey and austria .
costing an estimated 7.9 billion euros , the aim is to transport up to 31 billion cubic meters of gas each year from the caspian sea to western europe , bypassing russia and ukraine .
nabucco currently has six shareholders - omv of austria , mol of hungary , transgaz of romania , bulgargaz of bulgaria , botas of turkey and rwe of germany .
but for the pipeline to get moving , nabucco would need an initial cash injection of an estimated 300 million euros .
both the eib and ebrd said they were willing to invest in the early stages of the project through a series of loans , providing certain conditions are met .
" the eib is ready to finance projects that further eu objectives of increased sustainability and energy security , " said philippe maystadt , president of the european investment bank , during the opening addresses by participants at the " nabucco summit " in hungary .
the eib is prepared to finance " up to 25 percent of project cost , " provided a secure intergovernmental agreement on the nabucco pipeline is reached , he said .
maystadt noted that of 48 billion euros of financing it provided last year , a quarter was for energy projects .
ebrd president thomas mirow also offered financial backing to the nabucco pipeline , on the condition that it " meets the requirements of solid project financing . "
the bank would need to see concrete plans and completion guarantees , besides a stable political agreement , said mirow .
eu wary of future gas crises czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu , spoke about the recent gas crisis caused by a pricing dispute between russia and ukraine that affected supplies to europe .
" a new crisis could emerge at any time , and next time it could be even worse , " topolanek said .
he added that reaching an agreement on nabucco is a " test of european solidarity . "
the latest gas row between russia and ukraine has highlighted europe 's need to diversify its energy sources and thrown the spotlight on nabucco .
but critics insist that the vast project will remain nothing but a pipe dream because its backers can not guarantee that they will ever have sufficient gas supplies to make it profitable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political will could see the eu with an alternative gas source eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs urged political leaders to commit firmly to nabucco by the end of march , or risk jeopardizing the project .
in his opening address as host , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany called on the eu to provide 200 to 300 million euros within the next few weeks to get the construction of the pipeline off the ground .
gyurcsany stressed that he was not hoping for a loan , but rather for starting capital from the eu .
us deputy assistant secretary of state matthew bryza noted that the tuesday summit had made it clear that gyurcsany , who dismissed nabucco as " a dream " in 2007 , was now fully committed to the energy supply diversification project .
on the supply side , turkmenistan and azerbaijan both indicated they would be willing to supply some of the gas .
" azerbaijan , which is according to current plans is a transit country , could eventually serve as a supplier as well , " azerbaijani president ilham aliyev said .
azerbaijan 's gas reserves of some two or three trillion cubic meters would be sufficient to last " several decades , " he said .
austrian economy minister reinhold mitterlehner suggested that egypt and iran could also be brought in as suppliers in the long term .
but a deal currently seems unlikely with iran given the long-running international standoff over its disputed nuclear program .
russia , ukraine still wrangling meanwhile , russia and ukraine were still wrangling over the details of the deal which ended their gas quarrel earlier this month .
ukrainian president viktor yushchenko said on tuesday he would stand by the terms of the agreement with russia , even though not all the details are to his liking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrangling between russia and ukraine continues but russian officials questioned his reliability , saying that the political rivalry between yushchenko and prime minister yulia timoshenko could still lead kiev to cancel the contract .
" the agreements signed are not easy ones , but ukraine fully takes up the performance -lrb- of its commitments -rrb- and guarantees full-fledged transit to european consumers , " yushchenko told journalists in brussels after a meeting with the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso .
the assurance that yushchenko would abide by the terms of the agreement finalized by timoshenko was " an important step forward in allowing us to focus on our broader relationship , " barroso said .
but the spokesman for russian prime minister vladimir putin said that moscow still feared that the growing rivalry between yushchenko and timoshenko , who are set to face off in next year 's presidential election , could torpedo the deal .
eu in talks to upgrade ukraine 's transit system yushchenko 's working breakfast with barroso was dominated by the energy question , with both men highlighting the need to upgrade ukraine 's gas-transit system and build more links between ukrainian and european energy markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could help ukraine update its transit network the commission is set to host an international conference aimed at gathering donations to upgrade ukraine 's gas-transit system on march 23 in brussels .
the eu and ukraine have agreed to form a joint expert group to plan the meeting , the leaders said tuesday .
during the conflict , barroso had warned that both russia and ukraine were damaging their credibility as reliable partners .

27 , that they are prepared to provide financial backing for the nabucco gas pipeline . spurred on by europe 's worst-ever gas crisis earlier this month , which left millions of homes across the continent without heat in the depths of winter , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany invited top-ranking officials from both the eu and the countries involved in nabucco to inject fresh momentum into the slow-moving project .
nabucco , an ambitious but still-unbuilt gas pipeline aimed at reducing europe 's energy reliance on russia , is a 3,300-kilometer -lrb- 2,050-mile -rrb- pipeline between turkey and austria .
costing an estimated 7.9 billion euros , the aim is to transport up to 31 billion cubic meters of gas each year from the caspian sea to western europe , bypassing russia and ukraine .
nabucco currently has six shareholders - omv of austria , mol of hungary , transgaz of romania , bulgargaz of bulgaria , botas of turkey and rwe of germany .
but for the pipeline to get moving , nabucco would need an initial cash injection of an estimated 300 million euros .
both the eib and ebrd said they were willing to invest in the early stages of the project through a series of loans , providing certain conditions are met .
" the eib is ready to finance projects that further eu objectives of increased sustainability and energy security , " said philippe maystadt , president of the european investment bank , during the opening addresses by participants at the " nabucco summit " in hungary .
the eib is prepared to finance " up to 25 percent of project cost , " provided a secure intergovernmental agreement on the nabucco pipeline is reached , he said .
maystadt noted that of 48 billion euros of financing it provided last year , a quarter was for energy projects .
ebrd president thomas mirow also offered financial backing to the nabucco pipeline , on the condition that it " meets the requirements of solid project financing . "
the bank would need to see concrete plans and completion guarantees , besides a stable political agreement , said mirow .
eu wary of future gas crises czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu , spoke about the recent gas crisis caused by a pricing dispute between russia and ukraine that affected supplies to europe .
" a new crisis could emerge at any time , and next time it could be even worse , " topolanek said .
he added that reaching an agreement on nabucco is a " test of european solidarity . "
the latest gas row between russia and ukraine has highlighted europe 's need to diversify its energy sources and thrown the spotlight on nabucco .
but critics insist that the vast project will remain nothing but a pipe dream because its backers can not guarantee that they will ever have sufficient gas supplies to make it profitable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political will could see the eu with an alternative gas source eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs urged political leaders to commit firmly to nabucco by the end of march , or risk jeopardizing the project .
in his opening address as host , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany called on the eu to provide 200 to 300 million euros within the next few weeks to get the construction of the pipeline off the ground .
gyurcsany stressed that he was not hoping for a loan , but rather for starting capital from the eu .
us deputy assistant secretary of state matthew bryza noted that the tuesday summit had made it clear that gyurcsany , who dismissed nabucco as " a dream " in 2007 , was now fully committed to the energy supply diversification project .
on the supply side , turkmenistan and azerbaijan both indicated they would be willing to supply some of the gas .
" azerbaijan , which is according to current plans is a transit country , could eventually serve as a supplier as well , " azerbaijani president ilham aliyev said .
azerbaijan 's gas reserves of some two or three trillion cubic meters would be sufficient to last " several decades , " he said .
austrian economy minister reinhold mitterlehner suggested that egypt and iran could also be brought in as suppliers in the long term .
but a deal currently seems unlikely with iran given the long-running international standoff over its disputed nuclear program .
russia , ukraine still wrangling meanwhile , russia and ukraine were still wrangling over the details of the deal which ended their gas quarrel earlier this month .
ukrainian president viktor yushchenko said on tuesday he would stand by the terms of the agreement with russia , even though not all the details are to his liking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrangling between russia and ukraine continues but russian officials questioned his reliability , saying that the political rivalry between yushchenko and prime minister yulia timoshenko could still lead kiev to cancel the contract .
" the agreements signed are not easy ones , but ukraine fully takes up the performance -lrb- of its commitments -rrb- and guarantees full-fledged transit to european consumers , " yushchenko told journalists in brussels after a meeting with the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso .
the assurance that yushchenko would abide by the terms of the agreement finalized by timoshenko was " an important step forward in allowing us to focus on our broader relationship , " barroso said .
but the spokesman for russian prime minister vladimir putin said that moscow still feared that the growing rivalry between yushchenko and timoshenko , who are set to face off in next year 's presidential election , could torpedo the deal .
eu in talks to upgrade ukraine 's transit system yushchenko 's working breakfast with barroso was dominated by the energy question , with both men highlighting the need to upgrade ukraine 's gas-transit system and build more links between ukrainian and european energy markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could help ukraine update its transit network the commission is set to host an international conference aimed at gathering donations to upgrade ukraine 's gas-transit system on march 23 in brussels .
the eu and ukraine have agreed to form a joint expert group to plan the meeting , the leaders said tuesday .
during the conflict , barroso had warned that both russia and ukraine were damaging their credibility as reliable partners .
but on monday he said that " in bilateral relations , we are not taking any negative consequences from -lrb- the gas row -rrb- because we believe ukraine wants to deepen the relationship with the eu , and we also want to deepen the relationship with ukraine . "

27 , that they are prepared to provide financial backing for the nabucco gas pipeline . spurred on by europe 's worst-ever gas crisis earlier this month , which left millions of homes across the continent without heat in the depths of winter , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany invited top-ranking officials from both the eu and the countries involved in nabucco to inject fresh momentum into the slow-moving project .
nabucco , an ambitious but still-unbuilt gas pipeline aimed at reducing europe 's energy reliance on russia , is a 3,300-kilometer -lrb- 2,050-mile -rrb- pipeline between turkey and austria .
costing an estimated 7.9 billion euros , the aim is to transport up to 31 billion cubic meters of gas each year from the caspian sea to western europe , bypassing russia and ukraine .
nabucco currently has six shareholders - omv of austria , mol of hungary , transgaz of romania , bulgargaz of bulgaria , botas of turkey and rwe of germany .
but for the pipeline to get moving , nabucco would need an initial cash injection of an estimated 300 million euros .
both the eib and ebrd said they were willing to invest in the early stages of the project through a series of loans , providing certain conditions are met .
" the eib is ready to finance projects that further eu objectives of increased sustainability and energy security , " said philippe maystadt , president of the european investment bank , during the opening addresses by participants at the " nabucco summit " in hungary .
the eib is prepared to finance " up to 25 percent of project cost , " provided a secure intergovernmental agreement on the nabucco pipeline is reached , he said .
maystadt noted that of 48 billion euros of financing it provided last year , a quarter was for energy projects .
ebrd president thomas mirow also offered financial backing to the nabucco pipeline , on the condition that it " meets the requirements of solid project financing . "
the bank would need to see concrete plans and completion guarantees , besides a stable political agreement , said mirow .
eu wary of future gas crises czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu , spoke about the recent gas crisis caused by a pricing dispute between russia and ukraine that affected supplies to europe .
" a new crisis could emerge at any time , and next time it could be even worse , " topolanek said .
he added that reaching an agreement on nabucco is a " test of european solidarity . "
the latest gas row between russia and ukraine has highlighted europe 's need to diversify its energy sources and thrown the spotlight on nabucco .
but critics insist that the vast project will remain nothing but a pipe dream because its backers can not guarantee that they will ever have sufficient gas supplies to make it profitable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political will could see the eu with an alternative gas source eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs urged political leaders to commit firmly to nabucco by the end of march , or risk jeopardizing the project .
in his opening address as host , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany called on the eu to provide 200 to 300 million euros within the next few weeks to get the construction of the pipeline off the ground .
gyurcsany stressed that he was not hoping for a loan , but rather for starting capital from the eu .
us deputy assistant secretary of state matthew bryza noted that the tuesday summit had made it clear that gyurcsany , who dismissed nabucco as " a dream " in 2007 , was now fully committed to the energy supply diversification project .
on the supply side , turkmenistan and azerbaijan both indicated they would be willing to supply some of the gas .
" azerbaijan , which is according to current plans is a transit country , could eventually serve as a supplier as well , " azerbaijani president ilham aliyev said .
azerbaijan 's gas reserves of some two or three trillion cubic meters would be sufficient to last " several decades , " he said .
austrian economy minister reinhold mitterlehner suggested that egypt and iran could also be brought in as suppliers in the long term .
but a deal currently seems unlikely with iran given the long-running international standoff over its disputed nuclear program .
russia , ukraine still wrangling meanwhile , russia and ukraine were still wrangling over the details of the deal which ended their gas quarrel earlier this month .
ukrainian president viktor yushchenko said on tuesday he would stand by the terms of the agreement with russia , even though not all the details are to his liking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrangling between russia and ukraine continues but russian officials questioned his reliability , saying that the political rivalry between yushchenko and prime minister yulia timoshenko could still lead kiev to cancel the contract .
" the agreements signed are not easy ones , but ukraine fully takes up the performance -lrb- of its commitments -rrb- and guarantees full-fledged transit to european consumers , " yushchenko told journalists in brussels after a meeting with the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso .
the assurance that yushchenko would abide by the terms of the agreement finalized by timoshenko was " an important step forward in allowing us to focus on our broader relationship , " barroso said .
but the spokesman for russian prime minister vladimir putin said that moscow still feared that the growing rivalry between yushchenko and timoshenko , who are set to face off in next year 's presidential election , could torpedo the deal .
eu in talks to upgrade ukraine 's transit system yushchenko 's working breakfast with barroso was dominated by the energy question , with both men highlighting the need to upgrade ukraine 's gas-transit system and build more links between ukrainian and european energy markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could help ukraine update its transit network the commission is set to host an international conference aimed at gathering donations to upgrade ukraine 's gas-transit system on march 23 in brussels .
the eu and ukraine have agreed to form a joint expert group to plan the meeting , the leaders said tuesday .
during the conflict , barroso had warned that both russia and ukraine were damaging their credibility as reliable partners .
but on monday he said that " in bilateral relations , we are not taking any negative consequences from -lrb- the gas row -rrb- because we believe ukraine wants to deepen the relationship with the eu , and we also want to deepen the relationship with ukraine . "
he also said that " we have to state very clearly that we were disappointed by the problems between ukraine and russia , " and called for political stability and reform in ukraine .
his diplomatic balancing act is likely to have a frosty reception in moscow , where peskov said that russia " would prefer to hear from the european states a very serious and severe evaluation of who is guilty for interrupting the transit .

nabucco currently has six shareholders - omv of austria , mol of hungary , transgaz of romania , bulgargaz of bulgaria , botas of turkey and rwe of germany .
but for the pipeline to get moving , nabucco would need an initial cash injection of an estimated 300 million euros .
both the eib and ebrd said they were willing to invest in the early stages of the project through a series of loans , providing certain conditions are met .
" the eib is ready to finance projects that further eu objectives of increased sustainability and energy security , " said philippe maystadt , president of the european investment bank , during the opening addresses by participants at the " nabucco summit " in hungary .
the eib is prepared to finance " up to 25 percent of project cost , " provided a secure intergovernmental agreement on the nabucco pipeline is reached , he said .
maystadt noted that of 48 billion euros of financing it provided last year , a quarter was for energy projects .
ebrd president thomas mirow also offered financial backing to the nabucco pipeline , on the condition that it " meets the requirements of solid project financing . "
the bank would need to see concrete plans and completion guarantees , besides a stable political agreement , said mirow .
eu wary of future gas crises czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu , spoke about the recent gas crisis caused by a pricing dispute between russia and ukraine that affected supplies to europe .
" a new crisis could emerge at any time , and next time it could be even worse , " topolanek said .
he added that reaching an agreement on nabucco is a " test of european solidarity . "
the latest gas row between russia and ukraine has highlighted europe 's need to diversify its energy sources and thrown the spotlight on nabucco .
but critics insist that the vast project will remain nothing but a pipe dream because its backers can not guarantee that they will ever have sufficient gas supplies to make it profitable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political will could see the eu with an alternative gas source eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs urged political leaders to commit firmly to nabucco by the end of march , or risk jeopardizing the project .
in his opening address as host , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany called on the eu to provide 200 to 300 million euros within the next few weeks to get the construction of the pipeline off the ground .
gyurcsany stressed that he was not hoping for a loan , but rather for starting capital from the eu .
us deputy assistant secretary of state matthew bryza noted that the tuesday summit had made it clear that gyurcsany , who dismissed nabucco as " a dream " in 2007 , was now fully committed to the energy supply diversification project .
on the supply side , turkmenistan and azerbaijan both indicated they would be willing to supply some of the gas .
" azerbaijan , which is according to current plans is a transit country , could eventually serve as a supplier as well , " azerbaijani president ilham aliyev said .
azerbaijan 's gas reserves of some two or three trillion cubic meters would be sufficient to last " several decades , " he said .
austrian economy minister reinhold mitterlehner suggested that egypt and iran could also be brought in as suppliers in the long term .
but a deal currently seems unlikely with iran given the long-running international standoff over its disputed nuclear program .
russia , ukraine still wrangling meanwhile , russia and ukraine were still wrangling over the details of the deal which ended their gas quarrel earlier this month .
ukrainian president viktor yushchenko said on tuesday he would stand by the terms of the agreement with russia , even though not all the details are to his liking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrangling between russia and ukraine continues but russian officials questioned his reliability , saying that the political rivalry between yushchenko and prime minister yulia timoshenko could still lead kiev to cancel the contract .
" the agreements signed are not easy ones , but ukraine fully takes up the performance -lrb- of its commitments -rrb- and guarantees full-fledged transit to european consumers , " yushchenko told journalists in brussels after a meeting with the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso .
the assurance that yushchenko would abide by the terms of the agreement finalized by timoshenko was " an important step forward in allowing us to focus on our broader relationship , " barroso said .
but the spokesman for russian prime minister vladimir putin said that moscow still feared that the growing rivalry between yushchenko and timoshenko , who are set to face off in next year 's presidential election , could torpedo the deal .
eu in talks to upgrade ukraine 's transit system yushchenko 's working breakfast with barroso was dominated by the energy question , with both men highlighting the need to upgrade ukraine 's gas-transit system and build more links between ukrainian and european energy markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could help ukraine update its transit network the commission is set to host an international conference aimed at gathering donations to upgrade ukraine 's gas-transit system on march 23 in brussels .
the eu and ukraine have agreed to form a joint expert group to plan the meeting , the leaders said tuesday .
during the conflict , barroso had warned that both russia and ukraine were damaging their credibility as reliable partners .
but on monday he said that " in bilateral relations , we are not taking any negative consequences from -lrb- the gas row -rrb- because we believe ukraine wants to deepen the relationship with the eu , and we also want to deepen the relationship with ukraine . "
he also said that " we have to state very clearly that we were disappointed by the problems between ukraine and russia , " and called for political stability and reform in ukraine .
his diplomatic balancing act is likely to have a frosty reception in moscow , where peskov said that russia " would prefer to hear from the european states a very serious and severe evaluation of who is guilty for interrupting the transit .

but the country 's jewish leaders chose to skip the main government ceremony on tuesday in protest for what they say is lack of respect . germany 's leading jewish organization , the central council of jews in germany , said it was boycotting the memorial event in the german parliament because surviving victims had not been personally acknowledged in the past .
" i would understand it if we were talking about representatives of the second or third generations , " council general secretary stephan j. kramer told ap news agency .
" but it can not be that actual survivors are treated like mere onlookers . "
german president horst koehler addressed the bundestag in a speech marking the 64th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz concentration camp .
january 27th has been the official day for holocaust remembrance in germany since 1996 .
some of those who took part in the ceremony were critical of the council 's decision .
" in recent years , we 've always had very dignified hours of remembrance with a variety of participants , " social democratic cultural spokeswoman monika griefahn said in an interview with a berlin radio station .

he added that some of those mails contained explicit death threats toward council members .
in his speech before the reichstag , president koehler called for greater solidarity with german jews .
" let us stand beside our fellow jewish citizens , " koehler said .
" whoever attacks them attacks all of us as well . "
but jewish leaders are also disappointed at germany 's reaction to pope benedict xvi 's decision to repeal the excommunication of a priest for holocaust denial .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 27.01.2009 eu seeks buyers for unwanted security " nude scanners " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu argued about the scanners on the issues of privacy and decency a proposed plan to introduce full-body security scanners at airports around europe plunged the eu into a debate about privacy and decency .
now it has another problem arising from the hardware . " for sale : six security scanners in original packing , never used .
perfect for airport checks and entrances at highly sensitive locations .
sold separately or as one job lot .
open to offers of around 120,000 euros -lrb- $ 158,000 -rrb- each . "
at first glance , this -lrb- fabricated -rrb- advert may suggest that the european union is feeling the pinch in the current financial climate and is looking to put some much needed extra revenue back into its coffers .
but on closer inspection , the ad reveals not that the eu is hard-up for cash and has to sell off its equipment but that it is ready to offload some controversial hardware due to its embarrassing nature .
taking a closer look at the small print , one can see why : " caution – these scanners can provide unwanted and intrusive naked images . "
the scanners in question , currently being stored in the basements of the european parliament buildings in brussels and strasbourg , have been at the center of a heated debate since october when eu nations began arguing over plans to introduce the body scanners at airports around the continent .
those in favor stressed the need for such equipment in the fight against terrorism while others opposed the scanners over concerns about voyeurism .
a question of dignity and security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scanner shows up guns and bombs - and everything else wolfgang schaeuble , the german interior minister , was one of the opponents to the plan .
schaeuble spoke of the threat to passengers ' " dignity " as they appeared naked on screens while the scanner seeks out arms , explosives , drugs and other illicit items .
" i do n't want the police to run the risk of being accused of voyeurism , " schaeuble told a press conference at the time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 27.01.2009 eu seeks buyers for unwanted security " nude scanners " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu argued about the scanners on the issues of privacy and decency a proposed plan to introduce full-body security scanners at airports around europe plunged the eu into a debate about privacy and decency .
now it has another problem arising from the hardware . " for sale : six security scanners in original packing , never used .
perfect for airport checks and entrances at highly sensitive locations .
sold separately or as one job lot .
open to offers of around 120,000 euros -lrb- $ 158,000 -rrb- each . "
at first glance , this -lrb- fabricated -rrb- advert may suggest that the european union is feeling the pinch in the current financial climate and is looking to put some much needed extra revenue back into its coffers .
but on closer inspection , the ad reveals not that the eu is hard-up for cash and has to sell off its equipment but that it is ready to offload some controversial hardware due to its embarrassing nature .
taking a closer look at the small print , one can see why : " caution – these scanners can provide unwanted and intrusive naked images . "
the scanners in question , currently being stored in the basements of the european parliament buildings in brussels and strasbourg , have been at the center of a heated debate since october when eu nations began arguing over plans to introduce the body scanners at airports around the continent .
those in favor stressed the need for such equipment in the fight against terrorism while others opposed the scanners over concerns about voyeurism .
a question of dignity and security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scanner shows up guns and bombs - and everything else wolfgang schaeuble , the german interior minister , was one of the opponents to the plan .
schaeuble spoke of the threat to passengers ' " dignity " as they appeared naked on screens while the scanner seeks out arms , explosives , drugs and other illicit items .
" i do n't want the police to run the risk of being accused of voyeurism , " schaeuble told a press conference at the time .
" if we manage to invent scanners that do n't produce images then we could use them , " he added .
schaeuble 's french counterpart michele alliot-marie was in favor of the scanners , for security not voyeuristic reasons .
alliot-marie recognized the need " to respect everyone 's rights " but added " we must use , with great determination , all advanced technology to fight the terrorists and major criminals , because they know perfectly well how to use it and are often a jump ahead of us , " she stressed .
germany researching alternatives as eu shelves plan schaeuble 's comments eventually led to the start of laboratory tests in germany in which scientists began working on potential upgrades to the full-body airport screening devices in the hope they would find a way to produce images that do not show passengers naked .
the eu shelved its plans to introduce the scanners around the bloc in november after several were tested in airports around europe as part of a trial .
eu parliamentarians will now discuss how the scanners in their possession will be sold - and to whom . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" what we are doing today is abiding by the resolution of the european court .
there 's nothing we can do about that resolution , " eu foreign-policy chief javier solana said . however , in light of objections from france , czech officials said the eu might reconsider its decision " if new evidence " against the pmoi were to emerge . founded in 1965 , the pmoi operated a military wing in its early years , but says it renounced violence in june 2001 and now advocates the political overthrow of iran 's current government . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" legal complications but ministers later insisted that legal complications made it impossible for them to commit themselves quickly . " we found during our discussions that the legal situations are different in different -lrb- eu -rrb- states , " schwarzenberg said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama signs an executive order closing the prison at guantanamo bay he said foreign ministers would first ask for a reasoned opinion from their justice and interior ministers .
" then we will probably have another meeting , " he said . so far , portugal is the only eu member state to have clearly stated its intention of taking in former detainees who would face persecution and abuse if sent to their countries of origin in the middle east . the foreign ministers of germany and france both said in brussels that they would consider hosting the men in orange jumpsuits only on a " case-by-case " basis , with france 's bernard kouchner insisting that he would not accept any " impositions " from washington . and britain , which has already taken in 12 former detainees , has said it will not take in more . britain " feels it has already made a significant contribution but that we are keen to offer our experience on the repatriation of these people to other european countries who are ready to play their part , " british foreign secretary david miliband said ahead of the talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guantanamo prison outraged many europeans the eu has long called for the closure of the guantanamo detention center and welcomed the decision by obama to prepare the jail 's closure soon after assuming office . but securing a common european position on what to do next would likely take a long period of complex legal discussions , judging from the outcome of monday 's talks . opposition group there was further controversy when ministers removed the people 's mujahedin of iran -lrb- pmoi -rrb- from their list of terrorist organizations on monday , despite the opposition of france and public protests in tehran . the widely expected move followed a ruling by the european court in luxembourg , which in december said the eu was wrong to keep the pmoi 's assets frozen after it was taken off a british list of terrorist organizations . " what we are doing today is abiding by the resolution of the european court .
there 's nothing we can do about that resolution , " eu foreign-policy chief javier solana said . however , in light of objections from france , czech officials said the eu might reconsider its decision " if new evidence " against the pmoi were to emerge . founded in 1965 , the pmoi operated a military wing in its early years , but says it renounced violence in june 2001 and now advocates the political overthrow of iran 's current government . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analysts had predicted that it would fall to 81.5 points . based on a survey of 7,000 german executives and drawn up by the munich-based ifo economic research institute , the index plummeted in december to 82.7 points , which was its lowest point since the 1980s oil crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 27.01.2009 proposed nabucco gas pipeline gets european bank backing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech prime minister topolanek and hungary 's gyurcsany were confident of success the heads of the eu 's european investment bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development -lrb- ebrd -rrb- said tuesday , jan .
27 , that they are prepared to provide financial backing for the nabucco gas pipeline . spurred on by europe 's worst-ever gas crisis earlier this month , which left millions of homes across the continent without heat in the depths of winter , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany invited top-ranking officials from both the eu and the countries involved in nabucco to inject fresh momentum into the slow-moving project .
nabucco , an ambitious but still-unbuilt gas pipeline aimed at reducing europe 's energy reliance on russia , is a 3,300-kilometer -lrb- 2,050-mile -rrb- pipeline between turkey and austria .
costing an estimated 7.9 billion euros , the aim is to transport up to 31 billion cubic meters of gas each year from the caspian sea to western europe , bypassing russia and ukraine .
nabucco currently has six shareholders - omv of austria , mol of hungary , transgaz of romania , bulgargaz of bulgaria , botas of turkey and rwe of germany .
but for the pipeline to get moving , nabucco would need an initial cash injection of an estimated 300 million euros .
both the eib and ebrd said they were willing to invest in the early stages of the project through a series of loans , providing certain conditions are met .
" the eib is ready to finance projects that further eu objectives of increased sustainability and energy security , " said philippe maystadt , president of the european investment bank , during the opening addresses by participants at the " nabucco summit " in hungary .
the eib is prepared to finance " up to 25 percent of project cost , " provided a secure intergovernmental agreement on the nabucco pipeline is reached , he said .
maystadt noted that of 48 billion euros of financing it provided last year , a quarter was for energy projects .
ebrd president thomas mirow also offered financial backing to the nabucco pipeline , on the condition that it " meets the requirements of solid project financing . "
the bank would need to see concrete plans and completion guarantees , besides a stable political agreement , said mirow .
eu wary of future gas crises czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu , spoke about the recent gas crisis caused by a pricing dispute between russia and ukraine that affected supplies to europe .
" a new crisis could emerge at any time , and next time it could be even worse , " topolanek said .
he added that reaching an agreement on nabucco is a " test of european solidarity . "
the latest gas row between russia and ukraine has highlighted europe 's need to diversify its energy sources and thrown the spotlight on nabucco .
but critics insist that the vast project will remain nothing but a pipe dream because its backers can not guarantee that they will ever have sufficient gas supplies to make it profitable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political will could see the eu with an alternative gas source eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs urged political leaders to commit firmly to nabucco by the end of march , or risk jeopardizing the project .
in his opening address as host , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany called on the eu to provide 200 to 300 million euros within the next few weeks to get the construction of the pipeline off the ground .
gyurcsany stressed that he was not hoping for a loan , but rather for starting capital from the eu .
us deputy assistant secretary of state matthew bryza noted that the tuesday summit had made it clear that gyurcsany , who dismissed nabucco as " a dream " in 2007 , was now fully committed to the energy supply diversification project .
on the supply side , turkmenistan and azerbaijan both indicated they would be willing to supply some of the gas .
" azerbaijan , which is according to current plans is a transit country , could eventually serve as a supplier as well , " azerbaijani president ilham aliyev said .
azerbaijan 's gas reserves of some two or three trillion cubic meters would be sufficient to last " several decades , " he said .
austrian economy minister reinhold mitterlehner suggested that egypt and iran could also be brought in as suppliers in the long term .
but a deal currently seems unlikely with iran given the long-running international standoff over its disputed nuclear program .
russia , ukraine still wrangling meanwhile , russia and ukraine were still wrangling over the details of the deal which ended their gas quarrel earlier this month .
ukrainian president viktor yushchenko said on tuesday he would stand by the terms of the agreement with russia , even though not all the details are to his liking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrangling between russia and ukraine continues but russian officials questioned his reliability , saying that the political rivalry between yushchenko and prime minister yulia timoshenko could still lead kiev to cancel the contract .
" the agreements signed are not easy ones , but ukraine fully takes up the performance -lrb- of its commitments -rrb- and guarantees full-fledged transit to european consumers , " yushchenko told journalists in brussels after a meeting with the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso .
the assurance that yushchenko would abide by the terms of the agreement finalized by timoshenko was " an important step forward in allowing us to focus on our broader relationship , " barroso said .
but the spokesman for russian prime minister vladimir putin said that moscow still feared that the growing rivalry between yushchenko and timoshenko , who are set to face off in next year 's presidential election , could torpedo the deal .
eu in talks to upgrade ukraine 's transit system yushchenko 's working breakfast with barroso was dominated by the energy question , with both men highlighting the need to upgrade ukraine 's gas-transit system and build more links between ukrainian and european energy markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could help ukraine update its transit network the commission is set to host an international conference aimed at gathering donations to upgrade ukraine 's gas-transit system on march 23 in brussels .
the eu and ukraine have agreed to form a joint expert group to plan the meeting , the leaders said tuesday .
during the conflict , barroso had warned that both russia and ukraine were damaging their credibility as reliable partners .
but on monday he said that " in bilateral relations , we are not taking any negative consequences from -lrb- the gas row -rrb- because we believe ukraine wants to deepen the relationship with the eu , and we also want to deepen the relationship with ukraine . "
he also said that " we have to state very clearly that we were disappointed by the problems between ukraine and russia , " and called for political stability and reform in ukraine .
his diplomatic balancing act is likely to have a frosty reception in moscow , where peskov said that russia " would prefer to hear from the european states a very serious and severe evaluation of who is guilty for interrupting the transit .

germany has about 3,500 soldiers stationed the country , where attacks remain a common occurance . seven years after the end of the taliban regime , afghanistan continues to be wracked by violence .
maurus wrixel , a first lieutenant in the german military , recently shared his experience at the front lines of the effort to rebuild afghanistan and restore order in the war-torn country .
wrixel is part of the german military 's " provincial reconstruction team " in feyzabad .
although the taliban never had control over this northern part of the country , german soldiers have become primary targets for islamist extremists in the region .
in november 2008 , four bundeswehr soldiers were injured near feyzabad when their patrol was attacked .
wrixel , a 27-year-old first lieutenant , said he did n't shirk away from deployment in afghanistan .
he knew of the dangers when he signed up to serve in the german military .
" it was clear to me that i was going to do it because i 'm a soldier and foreign assignments are part of that , " said the blond young man from a small town near the western german city of neuss .
facing daily danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops do n't have much contact with afghans despite months of preparation , wrixel 's deployment to afghanistan in june of 2008 made him feel queasy .
" on one hand , you 're excited because you can finally use what you 've learned for so long .
on the other hand , you wonder about all the things that could happen .
that is the double-edged part , " wrixel said .
more than 30 of his fellow soldiers have already lost their lives in afghanistan .
it 's not always easy to keep going out and doing the job , especially the day after an attack , he said .
" sometimes you hear that something has happened in the evening in kunduz and then the next day you have to go outside again , " he said .
" or you 're standing in the dark at a road crossing and people come up to you who you ca n't recognize despite night-vision devices and you just have to just hope that nothing happens . "
getting into the routine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 30 german soldiers have died in afghanistan the badakhshan province has terrain that is often compared with a lunar landscape .
there are brown , low mountain ranges with steep cliffs and the air seems to always be filled with dust .
despite its rich mineral resources , the region is the poorest in afghanistan .
the average life expectancy is 43 years and 90 percent of the population is illiterate .
it 's an area which , compared to europe , seems stuck in the middle ages .
the low level of development means there is plenty of work for german reconstruction team members , and they work hard .
it helps make the time pass more quickly .
during their free time , soldiers have few entertainment options , as security concerns make it nearly impossible for them to leave the camp .
there 's a small " fitness tent " where they can work out .
wrixel also spends afternoons playing foosball or darts or drinking coffee .
in the evening , they are allowed to drink a beer , but are limited by the so-called " two can rule " as they need to be ready to deploy at any time .
despite all the risks and annoyances , maurus wrixel is positive , calling his time in afghanistan a " super experience . "
the teamwork alone makes it worth it , he said .
" i 'd go again , if i got another offer , " he says .
but it 's unlikely that he will get another chance .
in a few months , his seven years of bundeswehr service will come to an end .
germany could become more involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks remain a near-daily occurance in afghanistan it 's possible that more soldiers like wrixel will be heading to afghanistan in the future .
germany is among those european nations bracing for demands from the new us administration that they do more in afghanistan .
but germany is reluctant to send more troops .
chancellor merkel has said that she would not accede to any request from president barack obama to send troops to southern afghanistan , the scene of much of the heavy fighting against taliban insurgents .
" wherever germany commits itself , a wholeness of military and civilian assistance should be visible , " she said .
german forces , the third-biggest component in the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , are based in safer northern afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 27.01.2009 obama calls europe , gets largely cooperative response großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo is one of the most tricky issues right now for obama the new us president capped off his first week in office by phoning the leaders of france , germany and russia .
obama 's internationalist style is drawing positive reviews , but disagreements still loom . one week into his presidency , barack obama seems to be making good on his campaign pledge to adopt a more multilateral approach to global problems than his predecessor .
on monday , jan .
26 , obama gave his first formal television interview to the arab-language channel al-arabiya , in which he sought to reassure muslims in the middle east that " americans are not your enemy . "
he also put in telephone calls to french president nicolas sarkozy , german chancellor angela merkel and russia president dmitry medvedev .
obama and sarkozy conversed for 30 minutes .
afterwards , in a statement , the french president said they have agreed to work together in " resolute fashion " on the reconstruction of afghanistan , the global economic crisis and obama 's plan to shut down the controversial army detention center in guantanamo bay , cuba .
obama 's talks with merkel and medvedev reportedly focused on many of the same issues .
relations between the united states and france , germany and russia cooled under obama 's predecessor george w. bush - in part because those three countries refused to support the us-led war on iraq .
in the realm of foreign policy , obama concentrated much of his first week in office on the middle east .
but monday 's calls suggest that he wants to increase cooperation between the us and europe as well .
media hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama supports states ' effort to reduce co2 emissions the decisions taken by obama during his first seven days are going down well with european newspapers , most of which took a dim view of bush and what were perceived as his short-sighted , unilateral policies .
" the diversity of the decisions and directives in the past seven days gives us an idea not only of obama 's political caliber … but also of his modus operandi : his ability to decide cleverly and maneuver between hostile ideological fronts , " wrote the italian newspaper la repubblica .
european opinion-makers have welcomed the appointment of former senator george mitchell , the architect of peace in northern ireland , as us special envoy to the middle east .
" our hopes are with him and the new american government , " wrote the french paper paris-normandie .
" so that words and reason can finally silence weapons . "
europeans are also encouraged by obama 's environmental policies , which place greater emphasis on clean energy sources .
" it is truly a major event that the president of the world 's most powerful nation and one of its biggest polluters definitively acknowledges the need for new and more responsible policies , " wrote the french paper la presse de la manche .
guantanamo and other dilemmas bildunterschrift : how long will the smiles between obama and europe last ? but while the honeymoon continues for now , there are issues on which the obama administration and europe do not see eye to eye .
russia , for instance , has said it will cooperate with washington on fighting terrorism , especially in afghanistan , but has also stressed that it wants more understanding from the us in return .
and merkel 's conservative-led government in germany has been noticeably less enthusiastic than france about the idea that eu countries could take in some of the prisoners released from guantanamo .
some european newspapers are echoing the resistance to that idea .
" without any logic at all , the us is insisting that -lsb- detainees -rsb- be dispersed to countries that have more-or-less actively participated in the war on terror , " wrote the conservative-leaning danish paper jyllands-posten .
" it would be more obvious to send them back to their home countries . "
moreover , some left-wing commentators are disappointed in the sort of change obama has brought to us policies - and in particular his stated aim to step up america 's military efforts in afghanistan .
" the first democratic president in the modern era to be elected on an anti-war ticket is also , to the relief of neocons and the liberal belligerati , a hawk , " wrote richard seymour in britain 's guardian newspaper .
if obama follows through with his plan to seek a military solution in afghanistan , he will likely call on america 's european allies to do more - something that may not sit very well with eu leaders , who have been historically skittish about sending troops abroad . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , marks international holocaust day .
dw 's cornelia rabitz says that it 's time for europe to find a common discourse on remembering the darkest part of the continent 's past to ensure a bright future . about 1 million people from around the world visit the auschwitz memorial each year to commemorate the victims of the holocaust .
it 's a significant number of people , who still come to the museum to get an idea of living and dying in this former antechamber of hell - and to learn from history . memorial officials recently rang sounded an alarm , saying that the buildings are in danger of collapsing and that a lot of money is needed for their restoration .
germany reacted quickly and said that it would help out financially .
and rightly so .
more than six decades after the end of the war , it remains a duty for state and society to accept historic responsibility and keep the memory alive - even if this becomes more and more difficult as the distance of time keeps growing and eyewitnesses die . history books , museums , tv documentaries and movie films have to replace personal conversations .
the ability to relate to the topic - both in terms of time and emotions - continues to wane . to learn from history also means to look at today and arm ourselves against discrimination , racism , xenophobia and - needless to say - anti-semitism .
it 's depressing to see that the conflict between israelis and palestinians has led to falling inhibition thresholds and that jewish people are becoming the targets of hate mail - especially in germany . it 's alarming that anti-semitic stereotypes persist , as polls show again and again .
it 's alarming that neo-nazis drum people together for noisy demonstrations , that propaganda and historical misrepresentation find receptive audiences in our society . still : there will be a large number of events , lectures and concerts to commemorate tuesday 's holocaust day .
they will offer a chance to deal with the issue .
keeping the memory alive could become a european task .
a unifying europe should agree on a common discourse of memory .
dealing with the dark sides of one 's past still can not be taken for granted everywhere . germany , with its long and hard path towards coming to terms with its national socialist crimes and guilt , could certainly serve as an example . cornelia rabitz covers culture for dw-radio -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

obama 's internationalist style is drawing positive reviews , but disagreements still loom . one week into his presidency , barack obama seems to be making good on his campaign pledge to adopt a more multilateral approach to global problems than his predecessor .
on monday , jan .
26 , obama gave his first formal television interview to the arab-language channel al-arabiya , in which he sought to reassure muslims in the middle east that " americans are not your enemy . "
he also put in telephone calls to french president nicolas sarkozy , german chancellor angela merkel and russia president dmitry medvedev .
obama and sarkozy conversed for 30 minutes .
afterwards , in a statement , the french president said they have agreed to work together in " resolute fashion " on the reconstruction of afghanistan , the global economic crisis and obama 's plan to shut down the controversial army detention center in guantanamo bay , cuba .
obama 's talks with merkel and medvedev reportedly focused on many of the same issues .
relations between the united states and france , germany and russia cooled under obama 's predecessor george w. bush - in part because those three countries refused to support the us-led war on iraq .
in the realm of foreign policy , obama concentrated much of his first week in office on the middle east .
but monday 's calls suggest that he wants to increase cooperation between the us and europe as well .
media hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama supports states ' effort to reduce co2 emissions the decisions taken by obama during his first seven days are going down well with european newspapers , most of which took a dim view of bush and what were perceived as his short-sighted , unilateral policies .
" the diversity of the decisions and directives in the past seven days gives us an idea not only of obama 's political caliber … but also of his modus operandi : his ability to decide cleverly and maneuver between hostile ideological fronts , " wrote the italian newspaper la repubblica .
european opinion-makers have welcomed the appointment of former senator george mitchell , the architect of peace in northern ireland , as us special envoy to the middle east .
" our hopes are with him and the new american government , " wrote the french paper paris-normandie .
" so that words and reason can finally silence weapons . "
europeans are also encouraged by obama 's environmental policies , which place greater emphasis on clean energy sources .
" it is truly a major event that the president of the world 's most powerful nation and one of its biggest polluters definitively acknowledges the need for new and more responsible policies , " wrote the french paper la presse de la manche .
guantanamo and other dilemmas bildunterschrift : how long will the smiles between obama and europe last ? but while the honeymoon continues for now , there are issues on which the obama administration and europe do not see eye to eye .
russia , for instance , has said it will cooperate with washington on fighting terrorism , especially in afghanistan , but has also stressed that it wants more understanding from the us in return .
and merkel 's conservative-led government in germany has been noticeably less enthusiastic than france about the idea that eu countries could take in some of the prisoners released from guantanamo .
some european newspapers are echoing the resistance to that idea .
" without any logic at all , the us is insisting that -lsb- detainees -rsb- be dispersed to countries that have more-or-less actively participated in the war on terror , " wrote the conservative-leaning danish paper jyllands-posten .
" it would be more obvious to send them back to their home countries . "
moreover , some left-wing commentators are disappointed in the sort of change obama has brought to us policies - and in particular his stated aim to step up america 's military efforts in afghanistan .
" the first democratic president in the modern era to be elected on an anti-war ticket is also , to the relief of neocons and the liberal belligerati , a hawk , " wrote richard seymour in britain 's guardian newspaper .
if obama follows through with his plan to seek a military solution in afghanistan , he will likely call on america 's european allies to do more - something that may not sit very well with eu leaders , who have been historically skittish about sending troops abroad . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analysts had predicted that it would fall to 81.5 points . based on a survey of 7,000 german executives and drawn up by the munich-based ifo economic research institute , the index plummeted in december to 82.7 points , which was its lowest point since the 1980s oil crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 27.01.2009 proposed nabucco gas pipeline gets european bank backing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech prime minister topolanek and hungary 's gyurcsany were confident of success the heads of the eu 's european investment bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development -lrb- ebrd -rrb- said tuesday , jan .
27 , that they are prepared to provide financial backing for the nabucco gas pipeline . spurred on by europe 's worst-ever gas crisis earlier this month , which left millions of homes across the continent without heat in the depths of winter , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany invited top-ranking officials from both the eu and the countries involved in nabucco to inject fresh momentum into the slow-moving project .
nabucco , an ambitious but still-unbuilt gas pipeline aimed at reducing europe 's energy reliance on russia , is a 3,300-kilometer -lrb- 2,050-mile -rrb- pipeline between turkey and austria .
costing an estimated 7.9 billion euros , the aim is to transport up to 31 billion cubic meters of gas each year from the caspian sea to western europe , bypassing russia and ukraine .
nabucco currently has six shareholders - omv of austria , mol of hungary , transgaz of romania , bulgargaz of bulgaria , botas of turkey and rwe of germany .
but for the pipeline to get moving , nabucco would need an initial cash injection of an estimated 300 million euros .
both the eib and ebrd said they were willing to invest in the early stages of the project through a series of loans , providing certain conditions are met .
" the eib is ready to finance projects that further eu objectives of increased sustainability and energy security , " said philippe maystadt , president of the european investment bank , during the opening addresses by participants at the " nabucco summit " in hungary .
the eib is prepared to finance " up to 25 percent of project cost , " provided a secure intergovernmental agreement on the nabucco pipeline is reached , he said .
maystadt noted that of 48 billion euros of financing it provided last year , a quarter was for energy projects .
ebrd president thomas mirow also offered financial backing to the nabucco pipeline , on the condition that it " meets the requirements of solid project financing . "
the bank would need to see concrete plans and completion guarantees , besides a stable political agreement , said mirow .
eu wary of future gas crises czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu , spoke about the recent gas crisis caused by a pricing dispute between russia and ukraine that affected supplies to europe .
" a new crisis could emerge at any time , and next time it could be even worse , " topolanek said .
he added that reaching an agreement on nabucco is a " test of european solidarity . "
the latest gas row between russia and ukraine has highlighted europe 's need to diversify its energy sources and thrown the spotlight on nabucco .
but critics insist that the vast project will remain nothing but a pipe dream because its backers can not guarantee that they will ever have sufficient gas supplies to make it profitable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political will could see the eu with an alternative gas source eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs urged political leaders to commit firmly to nabucco by the end of march , or risk jeopardizing the project .
in his opening address as host , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany called on the eu to provide 200 to 300 million euros within the next few weeks to get the construction of the pipeline off the ground .
gyurcsany stressed that he was not hoping for a loan , but rather for starting capital from the eu .
us deputy assistant secretary of state matthew bryza noted that the tuesday summit had made it clear that gyurcsany , who dismissed nabucco as " a dream " in 2007 , was now fully committed to the energy supply diversification project .
on the supply side , turkmenistan and azerbaijan both indicated they would be willing to supply some of the gas .
" azerbaijan , which is according to current plans is a transit country , could eventually serve as a supplier as well , " azerbaijani president ilham aliyev said .
azerbaijan 's gas reserves of some two or three trillion cubic meters would be sufficient to last " several decades , " he said .
austrian economy minister reinhold mitterlehner suggested that egypt and iran could also be brought in as suppliers in the long term .
but a deal currently seems unlikely with iran given the long-running international standoff over its disputed nuclear program .
russia , ukraine still wrangling meanwhile , russia and ukraine were still wrangling over the details of the deal which ended their gas quarrel earlier this month .
ukrainian president viktor yushchenko said on tuesday he would stand by the terms of the agreement with russia , even though not all the details are to his liking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrangling between russia and ukraine continues but russian officials questioned his reliability , saying that the political rivalry between yushchenko and prime minister yulia timoshenko could still lead kiev to cancel the contract .
" the agreements signed are not easy ones , but ukraine fully takes up the performance -lrb- of its commitments -rrb- and guarantees full-fledged transit to european consumers , " yushchenko told journalists in brussels after a meeting with the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso .
the assurance that yushchenko would abide by the terms of the agreement finalized by timoshenko was " an important step forward in allowing us to focus on our broader relationship , " barroso said .
but the spokesman for russian prime minister vladimir putin said that moscow still feared that the growing rivalry between yushchenko and timoshenko , who are set to face off in next year 's presidential election , could torpedo the deal .
eu in talks to upgrade ukraine 's transit system yushchenko 's working breakfast with barroso was dominated by the energy question , with both men highlighting the need to upgrade ukraine 's gas-transit system and build more links between ukrainian and european energy markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could help ukraine update its transit network the commission is set to host an international conference aimed at gathering donations to upgrade ukraine 's gas-transit system on march 23 in brussels .
the eu and ukraine have agreed to form a joint expert group to plan the meeting , the leaders said tuesday .
during the conflict , barroso had warned that both russia and ukraine were damaging their credibility as reliable partners .
but on monday he said that " in bilateral relations , we are not taking any negative consequences from -lrb- the gas row -rrb- because we believe ukraine wants to deepen the relationship with the eu , and we also want to deepen the relationship with ukraine . "
he also said that " we have to state very clearly that we were disappointed by the problems between ukraine and russia , " and called for political stability and reform in ukraine .
his diplomatic balancing act is likely to have a frosty reception in moscow , where peskov said that russia " would prefer to hear from the european states a very serious and severe evaluation of who is guilty for interrupting the transit .

27 , that they are prepared to provide financial backing for the nabucco gas pipeline . spurred on by europe 's worst-ever gas crisis earlier this month , which left millions of homes across the continent without heat in the depths of winter , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany invited top-ranking officials from both the eu and the countries involved in nabucco to inject fresh momentum into the slow-moving project .
nabucco , an ambitious but still-unbuilt gas pipeline aimed at reducing europe 's energy reliance on russia , is a 3,300-kilometer -lrb- 2,050-mile -rrb- pipeline between turkey and austria .
costing an estimated 7.9 billion euros , the aim is to transport up to 31 billion cubic meters of gas each year from the caspian sea to western europe , bypassing russia and ukraine .
nabucco currently has six shareholders - omv of austria , mol of hungary , transgaz of romania , bulgargaz of bulgaria , botas of turkey and rwe of germany .
but for the pipeline to get moving , nabucco would need an initial cash injection of an estimated 300 million euros .
both the eib and ebrd said they were willing to invest in the early stages of the project through a series of loans , providing certain conditions are met .
" the eib is ready to finance projects that further eu objectives of increased sustainability and energy security , " said philippe maystadt , president of the european investment bank , during the opening addresses by participants at the " nabucco summit " in hungary .
the eib is prepared to finance " up to 25 percent of project cost , " provided a secure intergovernmental agreement on the nabucco pipeline is reached , he said .
maystadt noted that of 48 billion euros of financing it provided last year , a quarter was for energy projects .
ebrd president thomas mirow also offered financial backing to the nabucco pipeline , on the condition that it " meets the requirements of solid project financing . "
the bank would need to see concrete plans and completion guarantees , besides a stable political agreement , said mirow .
eu wary of future gas crises czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu , spoke about the recent gas crisis caused by a pricing dispute between russia and ukraine that affected supplies to europe .
" a new crisis could emerge at any time , and next time it could be even worse , " topolanek said .
he added that reaching an agreement on nabucco is a " test of european solidarity . "
the latest gas row between russia and ukraine has highlighted europe 's need to diversify its energy sources and thrown the spotlight on nabucco .
but critics insist that the vast project will remain nothing but a pipe dream because its backers can not guarantee that they will ever have sufficient gas supplies to make it profitable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political will could see the eu with an alternative gas source eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs urged political leaders to commit firmly to nabucco by the end of march , or risk jeopardizing the project .
in his opening address as host , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany called on the eu to provide 200 to 300 million euros within the next few weeks to get the construction of the pipeline off the ground .
gyurcsany stressed that he was not hoping for a loan , but rather for starting capital from the eu .
us deputy assistant secretary of state matthew bryza noted that the tuesday summit had made it clear that gyurcsany , who dismissed nabucco as " a dream " in 2007 , was now fully committed to the energy supply diversification project .
on the supply side , turkmenistan and azerbaijan both indicated they would be willing to supply some of the gas .
" azerbaijan , which is according to current plans is a transit country , could eventually serve as a supplier as well , " azerbaijani president ilham aliyev said .
azerbaijan 's gas reserves of some two or three trillion cubic meters would be sufficient to last " several decades , " he said .
austrian economy minister reinhold mitterlehner suggested that egypt and iran could also be brought in as suppliers in the long term .
but a deal currently seems unlikely with iran given the long-running international standoff over its disputed nuclear program .
russia , ukraine still wrangling meanwhile , russia and ukraine were still wrangling over the details of the deal which ended their gas quarrel earlier this month .
ukrainian president viktor yushchenko said on tuesday he would stand by the terms of the agreement with russia , even though not all the details are to his liking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrangling between russia and ukraine continues but russian officials questioned his reliability , saying that the political rivalry between yushchenko and prime minister yulia timoshenko could still lead kiev to cancel the contract .
" the agreements signed are not easy ones , but ukraine fully takes up the performance -lrb- of its commitments -rrb- and guarantees full-fledged transit to european consumers , " yushchenko told journalists in brussels after a meeting with the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso .
the assurance that yushchenko would abide by the terms of the agreement finalized by timoshenko was " an important step forward in allowing us to focus on our broader relationship , " barroso said .
but the spokesman for russian prime minister vladimir putin said that moscow still feared that the growing rivalry between yushchenko and timoshenko , who are set to face off in next year 's presidential election , could torpedo the deal .
eu in talks to upgrade ukraine 's transit system yushchenko 's working breakfast with barroso was dominated by the energy question , with both men highlighting the need to upgrade ukraine 's gas-transit system and build more links between ukrainian and european energy markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could help ukraine update its transit network the commission is set to host an international conference aimed at gathering donations to upgrade ukraine 's gas-transit system on march 23 in brussels .
the eu and ukraine have agreed to form a joint expert group to plan the meeting , the leaders said tuesday .
during the conflict , barroso had warned that both russia and ukraine were damaging their credibility as reliable partners .
but on monday he said that " in bilateral relations , we are not taking any negative consequences from -lrb- the gas row -rrb- because we believe ukraine wants to deepen the relationship with the eu , and we also want to deepen the relationship with ukraine . "
he also said that " we have to state very clearly that we were disappointed by the problems between ukraine and russia , " and called for political stability and reform in ukraine .
his diplomatic balancing act is likely to have a frosty reception in moscow , where peskov said that russia " would prefer to hear from the european states a very serious and severe evaluation of who is guilty for interrupting the transit .

analysts had predicted that it would fall to 81.5 points . based on a survey of 7,000 german executives and drawn up by the munich-based ifo economic research institute , the index plummeted in december to 82.7 points , which was its lowest point since the 1980s oil crisis .

predictions of an increase in the expectations gauge come amid signs that the severe downturn that has hit germany and the world economy in recent months could be reaching its low point .

" due to the legal situation in different -lrb- eu -rrb- countries , we ca n't give a quick answer ...
it is not a question which can be solved in weeks or months , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the bloc 's rotating presidency . while the new administration of us president barack obama has not yet officially asked european governments to host any of the 60 guantanamo inmates eligible for release , a list of possible candidates has already begun circulating in european capitals . but the lack of a quick response from the eu is likely to be ill-received in washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans want to get off on a good foot with obama analysts had warned ahead of monday 's talks that the eu 's reaction on guantanamo represented the first real test of europe 's will to start relations with the obama administration on a positive note . as finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said , " we need to shake hands with the us : it 's a new , fresh start .

" then we will probably have another meeting , " he said . so far , portugal is the only eu member state to have clearly stated its intention of taking in former detainees who would face persecution and abuse if sent to their countries of origin in the middle east . the foreign ministers of germany and france both said in brussels that they would consider hosting the men in orange jumpsuits only on a " case-by-case " basis , with france 's bernard kouchner insisting that he would not accept any " impositions " from washington . and britain , which has already taken in 12 former detainees , has said it will not take in more . britain " feels it has already made a significant contribution but that we are keen to offer our experience on the repatriation of these people to other european countries who are ready to play their part , " british foreign secretary david miliband said ahead of the talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guantanamo prison outraged many europeans the eu has long called for the closure of the guantanamo detention center and welcomed the decision by obama to prepare the jail 's closure soon after assuming office . but securing a common european position on what to do next would likely take a long period of complex legal discussions , judging from the outcome of monday 's talks . opposition group there was further controversy when ministers removed the people 's mujahedin of iran -lrb- pmoi -rrb- from their list of terrorist organizations on monday , despite the opposition of france and public protests in tehran . the widely expected move followed a ruling by the european court in luxembourg , which in december said the eu was wrong to keep the pmoi 's assets frozen after it was taken off a british list of terrorist organizations . " what we are doing today is abiding by the resolution of the european court .
there 's nothing we can do about that resolution , " eu foreign-policy chief javier solana said . however , in light of objections from france , czech officials said the eu might reconsider its decision " if new evidence " against the pmoi were to emerge . founded in 1965 , the pmoi operated a military wing in its early years , but says it renounced violence in june 2001 and now advocates the political overthrow of iran 's current government . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , marks international holocaust day .
dw 's cornelia rabitz says that it 's time for europe to find a common discourse on remembering the darkest part of the continent 's past to ensure a bright future . about 1 million people from around the world visit the auschwitz memorial each year to commemorate the victims of the holocaust .
it 's a significant number of people , who still come to the museum to get an idea of living and dying in this former antechamber of hell - and to learn from history . memorial officials recently rang sounded an alarm , saying that the buildings are in danger of collapsing and that a lot of money is needed for their restoration .
germany reacted quickly and said that it would help out financially .
and rightly so .
more than six decades after the end of the war , it remains a duty for state and society to accept historic responsibility and keep the memory alive - even if this becomes more and more difficult as the distance of time keeps growing and eyewitnesses die . history books , museums , tv documentaries and movie films have to replace personal conversations .
the ability to relate to the topic - both in terms of time and emotions - continues to wane . to learn from history also means to look at today and arm ourselves against discrimination , racism , xenophobia and - needless to say - anti-semitism .
it 's depressing to see that the conflict between israelis and palestinians has led to falling inhibition thresholds and that jewish people are becoming the targets of hate mail - especially in germany . it 's alarming that anti-semitic stereotypes persist , as polls show again and again .
it 's alarming that neo-nazis drum people together for noisy demonstrations , that propaganda and historical misrepresentation find receptive audiences in our society . still : there will be a large number of events , lectures and concerts to commemorate tuesday 's holocaust day .
they will offer a chance to deal with the issue .
keeping the memory alive could become a european task .
a unifying europe should agree on a common discourse of memory .
dealing with the dark sides of one 's past still can not be taken for granted everywhere . germany , with its long and hard path towards coming to terms with its national socialist crimes and guilt , could certainly serve as an example . cornelia rabitz covers culture for dw-radio -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , marks international holocaust day .
dw 's cornelia rabitz says that it 's time for europe to find a common discourse on remembering the darkest part of the continent 's past to ensure a bright future . about 1 million people from around the world visit the auschwitz memorial each year to commemorate the victims of the holocaust .
it 's a significant number of people , who still come to the museum to get an idea of living and dying in this former antechamber of hell - and to learn from history . memorial officials recently rang sounded an alarm , saying that the buildings are in danger of collapsing and that a lot of money is needed for their restoration .
germany reacted quickly and said that it would help out financially .
and rightly so .
more than six decades after the end of the war , it remains a duty for state and society to accept historic responsibility and keep the memory alive - even if this becomes more and more difficult as the distance of time keeps growing and eyewitnesses die . history books , museums , tv documentaries and movie films have to replace personal conversations .
the ability to relate to the topic - both in terms of time and emotions - continues to wane . to learn from history also means to look at today and arm ourselves against discrimination , racism , xenophobia and - needless to say - anti-semitism .
it 's depressing to see that the conflict between israelis and palestinians has led to falling inhibition thresholds and that jewish people are becoming the targets of hate mail - especially in germany . it 's alarming that anti-semitic stereotypes persist , as polls show again and again .
it 's alarming that neo-nazis drum people together for noisy demonstrations , that propaganda and historical misrepresentation find receptive audiences in our society . still : there will be a large number of events , lectures and concerts to commemorate tuesday 's holocaust day .
they will offer a chance to deal with the issue .
keeping the memory alive could become a european task .
a unifying europe should agree on a common discourse of memory .
dealing with the dark sides of one 's past still can not be taken for granted everywhere . germany , with its long and hard path towards coming to terms with its national socialist crimes and guilt , could certainly serve as an example . cornelia rabitz covers culture for dw-radio -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany has about 3,500 soldiers stationed the country , where attacks remain a common occurance . seven years after the end of the taliban regime , afghanistan continues to be wracked by violence .
maurus wrixel , a first lieutenant in the german military , recently shared his experience at the front lines of the effort to rebuild afghanistan and restore order in the war-torn country .
wrixel is part of the german military 's " provincial reconstruction team " in feyzabad .
although the taliban never had control over this northern part of the country , german soldiers have become primary targets for islamist extremists in the region .
in november 2008 , four bundeswehr soldiers were injured near feyzabad when their patrol was attacked .
wrixel , a 27-year-old first lieutenant , said he did n't shirk away from deployment in afghanistan .
he knew of the dangers when he signed up to serve in the german military .
" it was clear to me that i was going to do it because i 'm a soldier and foreign assignments are part of that , " said the blond young man from a small town near the western german city of neuss .
facing daily danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops do n't have much contact with afghans despite months of preparation , wrixel 's deployment to afghanistan in june of 2008 made him feel queasy .
" on one hand , you 're excited because you can finally use what you 've learned for so long .
on the other hand , you wonder about all the things that could happen .
that is the double-edged part , " wrixel said .
more than 30 of his fellow soldiers have already lost their lives in afghanistan .
it 's not always easy to keep going out and doing the job , especially the day after an attack , he said .
" sometimes you hear that something has happened in the evening in kunduz and then the next day you have to go outside again , " he said .
" or you 're standing in the dark at a road crossing and people come up to you who you ca n't recognize despite night-vision devices and you just have to just hope that nothing happens . "
getting into the routine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 30 german soldiers have died in afghanistan the badakhshan province has terrain that is often compared with a lunar landscape .
there are brown , low mountain ranges with steep cliffs and the air seems to always be filled with dust .
despite its rich mineral resources , the region is the poorest in afghanistan .
the average life expectancy is 43 years and 90 percent of the population is illiterate .
it 's an area which , compared to europe , seems stuck in the middle ages .
the low level of development means there is plenty of work for german reconstruction team members , and they work hard .
it helps make the time pass more quickly .
during their free time , soldiers have few entertainment options , as security concerns make it nearly impossible for them to leave the camp .
there 's a small " fitness tent " where they can work out .
wrixel also spends afternoons playing foosball or darts or drinking coffee .
in the evening , they are allowed to drink a beer , but are limited by the so-called " two can rule " as they need to be ready to deploy at any time .
despite all the risks and annoyances , maurus wrixel is positive , calling his time in afghanistan a " super experience . "
the teamwork alone makes it worth it , he said .
" i 'd go again , if i got another offer , " he says .
but it 's unlikely that he will get another chance .
in a few months , his seven years of bundeswehr service will come to an end .
germany could become more involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks remain a near-daily occurance in afghanistan it 's possible that more soldiers like wrixel will be heading to afghanistan in the future .
germany is among those european nations bracing for demands from the new us administration that they do more in afghanistan .
but germany is reluctant to send more troops .
chancellor merkel has said that she would not accede to any request from president barack obama to send troops to southern afghanistan , the scene of much of the heavy fighting against taliban insurgents .
" wherever germany commits itself , a wholeness of military and civilian assistance should be visible , " she said .
german forces , the third-biggest component in the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , are based in safer northern afghanistan .

obama 's internationalist style is drawing positive reviews , but disagreements still loom . one week into his presidency , barack obama seems to be making good on his campaign pledge to adopt a more multilateral approach to global problems than his predecessor .
on monday , jan .
26 , obama gave his first formal television interview to the arab-language channel al-arabiya , in which he sought to reassure muslims in the middle east that " americans are not your enemy . "
he also put in telephone calls to french president nicolas sarkozy , german chancellor angela merkel and russia president dmitry medvedev .
obama and sarkozy conversed for 30 minutes .
afterwards , in a statement , the french president said they have agreed to work together in " resolute fashion " on the reconstruction of afghanistan , the global economic crisis and obama 's plan to shut down the controversial army detention center in guantanamo bay , cuba .
obama 's talks with merkel and medvedev reportedly focused on many of the same issues .
relations between the united states and france , germany and russia cooled under obama 's predecessor george w. bush - in part because those three countries refused to support the us-led war on iraq .
in the realm of foreign policy , obama concentrated much of his first week in office on the middle east .
but monday 's calls suggest that he wants to increase cooperation between the us and europe as well .
media hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama supports states ' effort to reduce co2 emissions the decisions taken by obama during his first seven days are going down well with european newspapers , most of which took a dim view of bush and what were perceived as his short-sighted , unilateral policies .
" the diversity of the decisions and directives in the past seven days gives us an idea not only of obama 's political caliber … but also of his modus operandi : his ability to decide cleverly and maneuver between hostile ideological fronts , " wrote the italian newspaper la repubblica .
european opinion-makers have welcomed the appointment of former senator george mitchell , the architect of peace in northern ireland , as us special envoy to the middle east .
" our hopes are with him and the new american government , " wrote the french paper paris-normandie .
" so that words and reason can finally silence weapons . "
europeans are also encouraged by obama 's environmental policies , which place greater emphasis on clean energy sources .
" it is truly a major event that the president of the world 's most powerful nation and one of its biggest polluters definitively acknowledges the need for new and more responsible policies , " wrote the french paper la presse de la manche .
guantanamo and other dilemmas bildunterschrift : how long will the smiles between obama and europe last ? but while the honeymoon continues for now , there are issues on which the obama administration and europe do not see eye to eye .
russia , for instance , has said it will cooperate with washington on fighting terrorism , especially in afghanistan , but has also stressed that it wants more understanding from the us in return .
and merkel 's conservative-led government in germany has been noticeably less enthusiastic than france about the idea that eu countries could take in some of the prisoners released from guantanamo .
some european newspapers are echoing the resistance to that idea .
" without any logic at all , the us is insisting that -lsb- detainees -rsb- be dispersed to countries that have more-or-less actively participated in the war on terror , " wrote the conservative-leaning danish paper jyllands-posten .
" it would be more obvious to send them back to their home countries . "
moreover , some left-wing commentators are disappointed in the sort of change obama has brought to us policies - and in particular his stated aim to step up america 's military efforts in afghanistan .
" the first democratic president in the modern era to be elected on an anti-war ticket is also , to the relief of neocons and the liberal belligerati , a hawk , " wrote richard seymour in britain 's guardian newspaper .
if obama follows through with his plan to seek a military solution in afghanistan , he will likely call on america 's european allies to do more - something that may not sit very well with eu leaders , who have been historically skittish about sending troops abroad . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

obama 's internationalist style is drawing positive reviews , but disagreements still loom . one week into his presidency , barack obama seems to be making good on his campaign pledge to adopt a more multilateral approach to global problems than his predecessor .
on monday , jan .
26 , obama gave his first formal television interview to the arab-language channel al-arabiya , in which he sought to reassure muslims in the middle east that " americans are not your enemy . "
he also put in telephone calls to french president nicolas sarkozy , german chancellor angela merkel and russia president dmitry medvedev .
obama and sarkozy conversed for 30 minutes .
afterwards , in a statement , the french president said they have agreed to work together in " resolute fashion " on the reconstruction of afghanistan , the global economic crisis and obama 's plan to shut down the controversial army detention center in guantanamo bay , cuba .
obama 's talks with merkel and medvedev reportedly focused on many of the same issues .
relations between the united states and france , germany and russia cooled under obama 's predecessor george w. bush - in part because those three countries refused to support the us-led war on iraq .
in the realm of foreign policy , obama concentrated much of his first week in office on the middle east .
but monday 's calls suggest that he wants to increase cooperation between the us and europe as well .
media hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama supports states ' effort to reduce co2 emissions the decisions taken by obama during his first seven days are going down well with european newspapers , most of which took a dim view of bush and what were perceived as his short-sighted , unilateral policies .
" the diversity of the decisions and directives in the past seven days gives us an idea not only of obama 's political caliber … but also of his modus operandi : his ability to decide cleverly and maneuver between hostile ideological fronts , " wrote the italian newspaper la repubblica .
european opinion-makers have welcomed the appointment of former senator george mitchell , the architect of peace in northern ireland , as us special envoy to the middle east .
" our hopes are with him and the new american government , " wrote the french paper paris-normandie .
" so that words and reason can finally silence weapons . "
europeans are also encouraged by obama 's environmental policies , which place greater emphasis on clean energy sources .
" it is truly a major event that the president of the world 's most powerful nation and one of its biggest polluters definitively acknowledges the need for new and more responsible policies , " wrote the french paper la presse de la manche .
guantanamo and other dilemmas bildunterschrift : how long will the smiles between obama and europe last ? but while the honeymoon continues for now , there are issues on which the obama administration and europe do not see eye to eye .
russia , for instance , has said it will cooperate with washington on fighting terrorism , especially in afghanistan , but has also stressed that it wants more understanding from the us in return .
and merkel 's conservative-led government in germany has been noticeably less enthusiastic than france about the idea that eu countries could take in some of the prisoners released from guantanamo .
some european newspapers are echoing the resistance to that idea .
" without any logic at all , the us is insisting that -lsb- detainees -rsb- be dispersed to countries that have more-or-less actively participated in the war on terror , " wrote the conservative-leaning danish paper jyllands-posten .
" it would be more obvious to send them back to their home countries . "
moreover , some left-wing commentators are disappointed in the sort of change obama has brought to us policies - and in particular his stated aim to step up america 's military efforts in afghanistan .
" the first democratic president in the modern era to be elected on an anti-war ticket is also , to the relief of neocons and the liberal belligerati , a hawk , " wrote richard seymour in britain 's guardian newspaper .
if obama follows through with his plan to seek a military solution in afghanistan , he will likely call on america 's european allies to do more - something that may not sit very well with eu leaders , who have been historically skittish about sending troops abroad . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , marks international holocaust day .
dw 's cornelia rabitz says that it 's time for europe to find a common discourse on remembering the darkest part of the continent 's past to ensure a bright future . about 1 million people from around the world visit the auschwitz memorial each year to commemorate the victims of the holocaust .
it 's a significant number of people , who still come to the museum to get an idea of living and dying in this former antechamber of hell - and to learn from history . memorial officials recently rang sounded an alarm , saying that the buildings are in danger of collapsing and that a lot of money is needed for their restoration .
germany reacted quickly and said that it would help out financially .
and rightly so .
more than six decades after the end of the war , it remains a duty for state and society to accept historic responsibility and keep the memory alive - even if this becomes more and more difficult as the distance of time keeps growing and eyewitnesses die . history books , museums , tv documentaries and movie films have to replace personal conversations .
the ability to relate to the topic - both in terms of time and emotions - continues to wane . to learn from history also means to look at today and arm ourselves against discrimination , racism , xenophobia and - needless to say - anti-semitism .
it 's depressing to see that the conflict between israelis and palestinians has led to falling inhibition thresholds and that jewish people are becoming the targets of hate mail - especially in germany . it 's alarming that anti-semitic stereotypes persist , as polls show again and again .
it 's alarming that neo-nazis drum people together for noisy demonstrations , that propaganda and historical misrepresentation find receptive audiences in our society . still : there will be a large number of events , lectures and concerts to commemorate tuesday 's holocaust day .
they will offer a chance to deal with the issue .
keeping the memory alive could become a european task .
a unifying europe should agree on a common discourse of memory .
dealing with the dark sides of one 's past still can not be taken for granted everywhere . germany , with its long and hard path towards coming to terms with its national socialist crimes and guilt , could certainly serve as an example . cornelia rabitz covers culture for dw-radio -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany has about 3,500 soldiers stationed the country , where attacks remain a common occurance . seven years after the end of the taliban regime , afghanistan continues to be wracked by violence .
maurus wrixel , a first lieutenant in the german military , recently shared his experience at the front lines of the effort to rebuild afghanistan and restore order in the war-torn country .
wrixel is part of the german military 's " provincial reconstruction team " in feyzabad .
although the taliban never had control over this northern part of the country , german soldiers have become primary targets for islamist extremists in the region .
in november 2008 , four bundeswehr soldiers were injured near feyzabad when their patrol was attacked .
wrixel , a 27-year-old first lieutenant , said he did n't shirk away from deployment in afghanistan .
he knew of the dangers when he signed up to serve in the german military .

on the other hand , you wonder about all the things that could happen .
that is the double-edged part , " wrixel said .
more than 30 of his fellow soldiers have already lost their lives in afghanistan .
it 's not always easy to keep going out and doing the job , especially the day after an attack , he said .
" sometimes you hear that something has happened in the evening in kunduz and then the next day you have to go outside again , " he said .

analysts had predicted that it would fall to 81.5 points . based on a survey of 7,000 german executives and drawn up by the munich-based ifo economic research institute , the index plummeted in december to 82.7 points , which was its lowest point since the 1980s oil crisis .
since the publication of the december survey , a slew of bleak indicators and data have continued to roll in .
economy may pick up soon the indicator 's component gauging expectations six months down the track is predicted to rise on hopes of an economic pickup later in the year .
predictions of an increase in the expectations gauge come amid signs that the severe downturn that has hit germany and the world economy in recent months could be reaching its low point .
indeed , hopes have been rising that the round of hefty global interest rate cuts , falling oil prices and government stimulus packages would help to form the basis of an economic pickup later in the year . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" due to the legal situation in different -lrb- eu -rrb- countries , we ca n't give a quick answer ...
it is not a question which can be solved in weeks or months , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the bloc 's rotating presidency . while the new administration of us president barack obama has not yet officially asked european governments to host any of the 60 guantanamo inmates eligible for release , a list of possible candidates has already begun circulating in european capitals . but the lack of a quick response from the eu is likely to be ill-received in washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans want to get off on a good foot with obama analysts had warned ahead of monday 's talks that the eu 's reaction on guantanamo represented the first real test of europe 's will to start relations with the obama administration on a positive note . as finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said , " we need to shake hands with the us : it 's a new , fresh start . " legal complications but ministers later insisted that legal complications made it impossible for them to commit themselves quickly . " we found during our discussions that the legal situations are different in different -lrb- eu -rrb- states , " schwarzenberg said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama signs an executive order closing the prison at guantanamo bay he said foreign ministers would first ask for a reasoned opinion from their justice and interior ministers .
" then we will probably have another meeting , " he said . so far , portugal is the only eu member state to have clearly stated its intention of taking in former detainees who would face persecution and abuse if sent to their countries of origin in the middle east . the foreign ministers of germany and france both said in brussels that they would consider hosting the men in orange jumpsuits only on a " case-by-case " basis , with france 's bernard kouchner insisting that he would not accept any " impositions " from washington . and britain , which has already taken in 12 former detainees , has said it will not take in more . britain " feels it has already made a significant contribution but that we are keen to offer our experience on the repatriation of these people to other european countries who are ready to play their part , " british foreign secretary david miliband said ahead of the talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guantanamo prison outraged many europeans the eu has long called for the closure of the guantanamo detention center and welcomed the decision by obama to prepare the jail 's closure soon after assuming office . but securing a common european position on what to do next would likely take a long period of complex legal discussions , judging from the outcome of monday 's talks . opposition group there was further controversy when ministers removed the people 's mujahedin of iran -lrb- pmoi -rrb- from their list of terrorist organizations on monday , despite the opposition of france and public protests in tehran . the widely expected move followed a ruling by the european court in luxembourg , which in december said the eu was wrong to keep the pmoi 's assets frozen after it was taken off a british list of terrorist organizations . " what we are doing today is abiding by the resolution of the european court .
there 's nothing we can do about that resolution , " eu foreign-policy chief javier solana said . however , in light of objections from france , czech officials said the eu might reconsider its decision " if new evidence " against the pmoi were to emerge . founded in 1965 , the pmoi operated a military wing in its early years , but says it renounced violence in june 2001 and now advocates the political overthrow of iran 's current government . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany has about 3,500 soldiers stationed the country , where attacks remain a common occurance . seven years after the end of the taliban regime , afghanistan continues to be wracked by violence .
maurus wrixel , a first lieutenant in the german military , recently shared his experience at the front lines of the effort to rebuild afghanistan and restore order in the war-torn country .
wrixel is part of the german military 's " provincial reconstruction team " in feyzabad .
although the taliban never had control over this northern part of the country , german soldiers have become primary targets for islamist extremists in the region .
in november 2008 , four bundeswehr soldiers were injured near feyzabad when their patrol was attacked .
wrixel , a 27-year-old first lieutenant , said he did n't shirk away from deployment in afghanistan .
he knew of the dangers when he signed up to serve in the german military .
" it was clear to me that i was going to do it because i 'm a soldier and foreign assignments are part of that , " said the blond young man from a small town near the western german city of neuss .
facing daily danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops do n't have much contact with afghans despite months of preparation , wrixel 's deployment to afghanistan in june of 2008 made him feel queasy .
" on one hand , you 're excited because you can finally use what you 've learned for so long .
on the other hand , you wonder about all the things that could happen .
that is the double-edged part , " wrixel said .
more than 30 of his fellow soldiers have already lost their lives in afghanistan .
it 's not always easy to keep going out and doing the job , especially the day after an attack , he said .
" sometimes you hear that something has happened in the evening in kunduz and then the next day you have to go outside again , " he said .
" or you 're standing in the dark at a road crossing and people come up to you who you ca n't recognize despite night-vision devices and you just have to just hope that nothing happens . "
getting into the routine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 30 german soldiers have died in afghanistan the badakhshan province has terrain that is often compared with a lunar landscape .
there are brown , low mountain ranges with steep cliffs and the air seems to always be filled with dust .
despite its rich mineral resources , the region is the poorest in afghanistan .
the average life expectancy is 43 years and 90 percent of the population is illiterate .
it 's an area which , compared to europe , seems stuck in the middle ages .
the low level of development means there is plenty of work for german reconstruction team members , and they work hard .
it helps make the time pass more quickly .
during their free time , soldiers have few entertainment options , as security concerns make it nearly impossible for them to leave the camp .
there 's a small " fitness tent " where they can work out .
wrixel also spends afternoons playing foosball or darts or drinking coffee .
in the evening , they are allowed to drink a beer , but are limited by the so-called " two can rule " as they need to be ready to deploy at any time .
despite all the risks and annoyances , maurus wrixel is positive , calling his time in afghanistan a " super experience . "
the teamwork alone makes it worth it , he said .
" i 'd go again , if i got another offer , " he says .
but it 's unlikely that he will get another chance .
in a few months , his seven years of bundeswehr service will come to an end .
germany could become more involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks remain a near-daily occurance in afghanistan it 's possible that more soldiers like wrixel will be heading to afghanistan in the future .
germany is among those european nations bracing for demands from the new us administration that they do more in afghanistan .
but germany is reluctant to send more troops .
chancellor merkel has said that she would not accede to any request from president barack obama to send troops to southern afghanistan , the scene of much of the heavy fighting against taliban insurgents .
" wherever germany commits itself , a wholeness of military and civilian assistance should be visible , " she said .
german forces , the third-biggest component in the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , are based in safer northern afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 27.01.2009 proposed nabucco gas pipeline gets european bank backing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech prime minister topolanek and hungary 's gyurcsany were confident of success the heads of the eu 's european investment bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development -lrb- ebrd -rrb- said tuesday , jan .
27 , that they are prepared to provide financial backing for the nabucco gas pipeline . spurred on by europe 's worst-ever gas crisis earlier this month , which left millions of homes across the continent without heat in the depths of winter , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany invited top-ranking officials from both the eu and the countries involved in nabucco to inject fresh momentum into the slow-moving project .
nabucco , an ambitious but still-unbuilt gas pipeline aimed at reducing europe 's energy reliance on russia , is a 3,300-kilometer -lrb- 2,050-mile -rrb- pipeline between turkey and austria .
costing an estimated 7.9 billion euros , the aim is to transport up to 31 billion cubic meters of gas each year from the caspian sea to western europe , bypassing russia and ukraine .
nabucco currently has six shareholders - omv of austria , mol of hungary , transgaz of romania , bulgargaz of bulgaria , botas of turkey and rwe of germany .
but for the pipeline to get moving , nabucco would need an initial cash injection of an estimated 300 million euros .
both the eib and ebrd said they were willing to invest in the early stages of the project through a series of loans , providing certain conditions are met .
" the eib is ready to finance projects that further eu objectives of increased sustainability and energy security , " said philippe maystadt , president of the european investment bank , during the opening addresses by participants at the " nabucco summit " in hungary .
the eib is prepared to finance " up to 25 percent of project cost , " provided a secure intergovernmental agreement on the nabucco pipeline is reached , he said .
maystadt noted that of 48 billion euros of financing it provided last year , a quarter was for energy projects .
ebrd president thomas mirow also offered financial backing to the nabucco pipeline , on the condition that it " meets the requirements of solid project financing . "
the bank would need to see concrete plans and completion guarantees , besides a stable political agreement , said mirow .
eu wary of future gas crises czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu , spoke about the recent gas crisis caused by a pricing dispute between russia and ukraine that affected supplies to europe .
" a new crisis could emerge at any time , and next time it could be even worse , " topolanek said .
he added that reaching an agreement on nabucco is a " test of european solidarity . "
the latest gas row between russia and ukraine has highlighted europe 's need to diversify its energy sources and thrown the spotlight on nabucco .
but critics insist that the vast project will remain nothing but a pipe dream because its backers can not guarantee that they will ever have sufficient gas supplies to make it profitable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political will could see the eu with an alternative gas source eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs urged political leaders to commit firmly to nabucco by the end of march , or risk jeopardizing the project .
in his opening address as host , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany called on the eu to provide 200 to 300 million euros within the next few weeks to get the construction of the pipeline off the ground .
gyurcsany stressed that he was not hoping for a loan , but rather for starting capital from the eu .
us deputy assistant secretary of state matthew bryza noted that the tuesday summit had made it clear that gyurcsany , who dismissed nabucco as " a dream " in 2007 , was now fully committed to the energy supply diversification project .
on the supply side , turkmenistan and azerbaijan both indicated they would be willing to supply some of the gas .
" azerbaijan , which is according to current plans is a transit country , could eventually serve as a supplier as well , " azerbaijani president ilham aliyev said .
azerbaijan 's gas reserves of some two or three trillion cubic meters would be sufficient to last " several decades , " he said .
austrian economy minister reinhold mitterlehner suggested that egypt and iran could also be brought in as suppliers in the long term .
but a deal currently seems unlikely with iran given the long-running international standoff over its disputed nuclear program .
russia , ukraine still wrangling meanwhile , russia and ukraine were still wrangling over the details of the deal which ended their gas quarrel earlier this month .
ukrainian president viktor yushchenko said on tuesday he would stand by the terms of the agreement with russia , even though not all the details are to his liking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrangling between russia and ukraine continues but russian officials questioned his reliability , saying that the political rivalry between yushchenko and prime minister yulia timoshenko could still lead kiev to cancel the contract .
" the agreements signed are not easy ones , but ukraine fully takes up the performance -lrb- of its commitments -rrb- and guarantees full-fledged transit to european consumers , " yushchenko told journalists in brussels after a meeting with the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso .
the assurance that yushchenko would abide by the terms of the agreement finalized by timoshenko was " an important step forward in allowing us to focus on our broader relationship , " barroso said .
but the spokesman for russian prime minister vladimir putin said that moscow still feared that the growing rivalry between yushchenko and timoshenko , who are set to face off in next year 's presidential election , could torpedo the deal .
eu in talks to upgrade ukraine 's transit system yushchenko 's working breakfast with barroso was dominated by the energy question , with both men highlighting the need to upgrade ukraine 's gas-transit system and build more links between ukrainian and european energy markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could help ukraine update its transit network the commission is set to host an international conference aimed at gathering donations to upgrade ukraine 's gas-transit system on march 23 in brussels .
the eu and ukraine have agreed to form a joint expert group to plan the meeting , the leaders said tuesday .
during the conflict , barroso had warned that both russia and ukraine were damaging their credibility as reliable partners .
but on monday he said that " in bilateral relations , we are not taking any negative consequences from -lrb- the gas row -rrb- because we believe ukraine wants to deepen the relationship with the eu , and we also want to deepen the relationship with ukraine . "
he also said that " we have to state very clearly that we were disappointed by the problems between ukraine and russia , " and called for political stability and reform in ukraine .
his diplomatic balancing act is likely to have a frosty reception in moscow , where peskov said that russia " would prefer to hear from the european states a very serious and severe evaluation of who is guilty for interrupting the transit .

but the country 's jewish leaders chose to skip the main government ceremony on tuesday in protest for what they say is lack of respect . germany 's leading jewish organization , the central council of jews in germany , said it was boycotting the memorial event in the german parliament because surviving victims had not been personally acknowledged in the past .
" i would understand it if we were talking about representatives of the second or third generations , " council general secretary stephan j. kramer told ap news agency .
" but it can not be that actual survivors are treated like mere onlookers . "
german president horst koehler addressed the bundestag in a speech marking the 64th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz concentration camp .

retail analysis specialist experian has estimated that nearly £ 30m could be lost on high streets in places such as winchester , fareham and eastleigh .
the study for bbc radio solent suggests smaller towns will struggle to compete with the pull of the furniture shop .
ikea said its new store " represents a massive investment in hampshire " .
ikea report ikea southampton impact research -lsb- 407kb -rsb- most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need adobe reader download the reader here the new shop has been built on the former pirelli site , in west quay road , and ikea has estimated that it will attract two million customers a year and generate an annual turnover of £ 55m .
experian 's report says : " retailers in the smaller centres are likely to bear the brunt of ikea 's opening and will see falls in shopper numbers and revenues . "
it suggests that when it opens on 12 february , winchester could see a £ 10.7m reduction in cash spent on the high street , fareham could see a £ 4.4m drop and eastleigh could lose £ 13.7m.
traders in eastleigh town centre are worried about the impact of ikea tracey bennett , manager of rosebys in eastleigh , said staff were expecting to be badly affected .
she said : " we 'll probably close because of the impact ikea will have .
" their stock is supposedly cheaper , better , service is better - you can just go in and pull it off the shelf .
they 've got a much , much bigger selection .
" we 're struggling now , we 're trying to keep our heads above water .
" people are just going to want to go to southampton .

" -lsb- eastleigh -rsb- is becoming a ghost town .
it 's not just eastleigh , it 's across the board . "
shirley jones , spokeswoman for ikea , said : " we do appreciate that the new ikea will be a big retail draw .
" the store does however represent a massive investment in hampshire as a whole .

president obama speaking to al-arabiya about iran us president barack obama has used his first formal tv interview since taking office to reach out to the muslim world - saying americans are not its enemy .
speaking to the dubai-based al-arabiya network , mr obama reiterated that the us would extend the hand of friendship to iran if it " unclenched its fist " .
it comes as his middle east envoy , george mitchell , travels to the region , heralding a new burst of diplomacy .
he will meet egypt 's leader to discuss the gaza ceasefire and peace efforts .
egypt has been mediating between israel and the palestinians , and between rival palestinian factions hamas and fatah .
mr obama told al-arabiya that the us sometimes made mistakes and stressed that his administration would adopt a more open diplomatic approach .
this interview is a big deal ...
it will confuse some in the middle east even further bbc north america editor justin webb justin webb 's america " as i said in my inauguration speech , if countries like iran are willing to unclench their fist , they will find an extended hand from us , " he said .
" it is very important for us to make sure that we are using all the tools of us power , including diplomacy , in our relationship with iran . "
on middle east peace , mr obama reiterated his administration 's support for israel and its security but also suggested israelis would have to make some tough choices .
" ultimately we can not tell either the israelis or the palestinians what is best for them .
they are going to have to make some decisions , " he said .
" but i do believe the moment is ripe for both sides to realise that the path that they are on is one that is not going to result in prosperity and security for their people .
and that instead , it 's time to return to the negotiating table . "
asked about verbal attacks made on him in recent videos released by al-qaeda , mr obama responded : " what that tells me is that their ideas are bankrupt . "
the bbc 's justin webb in washington says that for most of the interview , mr obama appeared determined to be emollient and - as he put it repeatedly - respectful , stressing that the us would begin by listening rather than dictating .
diplomatic moves as well as meeting egyptian president hosni mubarak , mr mitchell is to visit israel , the west bank , jordan , turkey and saudi arabia during a week-long tour , as well as making stops in europe , said state department spokesman robert wood .

middle east conflict : history in maps profile : gaza strip he said mr mitchell would meet " senior officials to discuss the peace process and the situation in gaza " .
speaking earlier at the white house , mr obama said the new envoy would take an active approach .
" the charge that senator mitchell has is to engage vigorously and consistently in order for us to achieve genuine progress , " he said .
" and when i say progress , not just photo ops but progress that is concrete . "
it remained unclear whether mr mitchell would travel to the gaza strip .
humanitarian crisis separately , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said he was heading to the middle east to join efforts to cement a permanent ceasefire .
aid agencies have called for crossings to open so more aid can reach gaza the diplomatic moves come a day after european union humanitarian aid chief louis michel blamed the militant movement hamas , which controls gaza , for the humanitarian crisis there .
he called the destruction left by israel 's offensive " abominable " , but said hamas bore " overwhelming responsibility " .
about 1,300 palestinians , including 400 children , were killed in israel 's 22-day assault , while 13 israelis died , some as a result of palestinian militant rocket fire .
israeli and palestinian faction representatives have visited cairo for talks with egyptian officials since a non-negotiated ceasefire came into effect on 18 january .

president obama speaking to al-arabiya about iran us president barack obama has used his first formal tv interview since taking office to reach out to the muslim world - saying americans are not its enemy .
speaking to the dubai-based al-arabiya network , mr obama reiterated that the us would extend the hand of friendship to iran if it " unclenched its fist " .
it comes as his middle east envoy , george mitchell , travels to the region , heralding a new burst of diplomacy .
he will meet egypt 's leader to discuss the gaza ceasefire and peace efforts .
egypt has been mediating between israel and the palestinians , and between rival palestinian factions hamas and fatah .
mr obama told al-arabiya that the us sometimes made mistakes and stressed that his administration would adopt a more open diplomatic approach .
this interview is a big deal ...
it will confuse some in the middle east even further bbc north america editor justin webb justin webb 's america " as i said in my inauguration speech , if countries like iran are willing to unclench their fist , they will find an extended hand from us , " he said .
" it is very important for us to make sure that we are using all the tools of us power , including diplomacy , in our relationship with iran . "
on middle east peace , mr obama reiterated his administration 's support for israel and its security but also suggested israelis would have to make some tough choices .
" ultimately we can not tell either the israelis or the palestinians what is best for them .
they are going to have to make some decisions , " he said .
" but i do believe the moment is ripe for both sides to realise that the path that they are on is one that is not going to result in prosperity and security for their people .
and that instead , it 's time to return to the negotiating table . "
asked about verbal attacks made on him in recent videos released by al-qaeda , mr obama responded : " what that tells me is that their ideas are bankrupt . "
the bbc 's justin webb in washington says that for most of the interview , mr obama appeared determined to be emollient and - as he put it repeatedly - respectful , stressing that the us would begin by listening rather than dictating .
diplomatic moves as well as meeting egyptian president hosni mubarak , mr mitchell is to visit israel , the west bank , jordan , turkey and saudi arabia during a week-long tour , as well as making stops in europe , said state department spokesman robert wood .

the tories and lib dems said they would oppose the proposals as well as others to hold some inquests in private .
minister jack straw said " responsible " data sharing would stop families having to speak to different agencies " many times over " when a relative died .
mps are debating the proposals in the coroners and justice bill .
opening a second reading debate , justice secretary mr straw said the bill would be the first major reform of the coroners ' service for more than 100 years and would improve it for bereaved families - especially those of servicemen and women .
' red rag ' but he was accused of using the controversial inquest proposals , dropped last year from counter-terrorism legislation , as a " red rag " to attract attention while data-sharing proposals were " smuggled " in .
the information sharing orders would remove data protection restrictions that mean information can only be used for the purpose it was taken .
for the liberal democrats , david howarth told mps the " amazingly broad " proposals on data sharing were " outrageous " enough to reject the bill on its own .
what the government is proposing is to drive a coach and horses through the duty of confidentiality that the state owes to individuals dominic grieve shadow justice secretary he said the plans were not confined to public bodies , private companies in any country could also see people 's information , he said , and there would be a greater risk of information being lost .
mr straw said bereaved families often had to speak to different departments and agencies over and over again when a loved one died .
he defended the plans , saying : " responsible data-sharing between the relevant agencies would reduce the number of people who need to be notified of a death , thereby helping to relieve distress at a very difficult time . "
inquest plans orders would be subject to safeguards and only be made when it was " in the public interest and proportionate to the impact it may have on the person affected , " he said .
but for the tories , dominic grieve said it amounted to a " seismic change in the relationship between the state and the citizen " and said it had " enormous " implications for civil liberties .
" what the government is proposing is to drive a coach and horses through the duty of confidentiality that the state owes to individuals , " he said .
it 's a real difficulty .
what we have to do is try and find a way through it jack straw justice secretary " the path we are on , i think , raises really serious possibilities of the oppressive state . "
he said such a " draconian transformation in the law " deserved its own bill .
among other measures in the bill is one to allow some inquests in england and wales to be held without juries .
a measure to exclude relatives and journalists from some inquests had been dropped last year from counter-terrorism legislation , having been opposed by military families .
mr straw said the proposals had been brought forward because the " current state of the law and process is unsatisfactory " and two inquests were already unable to go ahead in public .
he said inquests would only be held in private in " very extreme " cases where if information got out there would be a " grave risk of death of individuals " .
but his mr grieve said the plans " completely undermine " the point of an inquest and mr howarth said juries had traditionally provided " a check " on state power .
several labour backbenchers also criticised the plans during the debate - chris mullin questioned whether police might have used it to prevent a public interest inquest into the death of jean charles de menezes - shot dead after being mistaken for a terrorist by officers .
joan humble said service families depended on inquests to find out how their loved ones died and would be " dismayed " at the idea of private inquests while andrew dismore , suggested it may contravene the human rights act .
mr straw said there would be safeguards in place to stop the use of inquests without juries becoming widespread and said people would only be excluded from " parts of the inquest " .
but he added he understood why mps were " uncomfortable " , adding : " it 's a real difficulty .
what we have to do is try and find a way through it . "
the conservatives say while there is much they agree with in the bill , they will try to get the data-sharing proposal removed and the lib dems moved their own amendment to stop it getting a second reading .
but the lib dem bid was defeated by 278 votes to 47 , a government majority of 231 and the bill was given a second reading without a vote .

the tories and lib dems said they would oppose the proposals as well as others to hold some inquests in private .
minister jack straw said " responsible " data sharing would stop families having to speak to different agencies " many times over " when a relative died .
mps are debating the proposals in the coroners and justice bill .
opening a second reading debate , justice secretary mr straw said the bill would be the first major reform of the coroners ' service for more than 100 years and would improve it for bereaved families - especially those of servicemen and women .
' red rag ' but he was accused of using the controversial inquest proposals , dropped last year from counter-terrorism legislation , as a " red rag " to attract attention while data-sharing proposals were " smuggled " in .
the information sharing orders would remove data protection restrictions that mean information can only be used for the purpose it was taken .
for the liberal democrats , david howarth told mps the " amazingly broad " proposals on data sharing were " outrageous " enough to reject the bill on its own .
what the government is proposing is to drive a coach and horses through the duty of confidentiality that the state owes to individuals dominic grieve shadow justice secretary he said the plans were not confined to public bodies , private companies in any country could also see people 's information , he said , and there would be a greater risk of information being lost .
mr straw said bereaved families often had to speak to different departments and agencies over and over again when a loved one died .
he defended the plans , saying : " responsible data-sharing between the relevant agencies would reduce the number of people who need to be notified of a death , thereby helping to relieve distress at a very difficult time . "
inquest plans orders would be subject to safeguards and only be made when it was " in the public interest and proportionate to the impact it may have on the person affected , " he said .
but for the tories , dominic grieve said it amounted to a " seismic change in the relationship between the state and the citizen " and said it had " enormous " implications for civil liberties .
" what the government is proposing is to drive a coach and horses through the duty of confidentiality that the state owes to individuals , " he said .
it 's a real difficulty .
what we have to do is try and find a way through it jack straw justice secretary " the path we are on , i think , raises really serious possibilities of the oppressive state . "
he said such a " draconian transformation in the law " deserved its own bill .
among other measures in the bill is one to allow some inquests in england and wales to be held without juries .
a measure to exclude relatives and journalists from some inquests had been dropped last year from counter-terrorism legislation , having been opposed by military families .
mr straw said the proposals had been brought forward because the " current state of the law and process is unsatisfactory " and two inquests were already unable to go ahead in public .
he said inquests would only be held in private in " very extreme " cases where if information got out there would be a " grave risk of death of individuals " .
but his mr grieve said the plans " completely undermine " the point of an inquest and mr howarth said juries had traditionally provided " a check " on state power .
several labour backbenchers also criticised the plans during the debate - chris mullin questioned whether police might have used it to prevent a public interest inquest into the death of jean charles de menezes - shot dead after being mistaken for a terrorist by officers .
joan humble said service families depended on inquests to find out how their loved ones died and would be " dismayed " at the idea of private inquests while andrew dismore , suggested it may contravene the human rights act .
mr straw said there would be safeguards in place to stop the use of inquests without juries becoming widespread and said people would only be excluded from " parts of the inquest " .
but he added he understood why mps were " uncomfortable " , adding : " it 's a real difficulty .
what we have to do is try and find a way through it . "
the conservatives say while there is much they agree with in the bill , they will try to get the data-sharing proposal removed and the lib dems moved their own amendment to stop it getting a second reading .
but the lib dem bid was defeated by 278 votes to 47 , a government majority of 231 and the bill was given a second reading without a vote .

among other measures in the bill is one to allow some inquests in england and wales to be held without juries .
a measure to exclude relatives and journalists from some inquests had been dropped last year from counter-terrorism legislation , having been opposed by military families .
mr straw said the proposals had been brought forward because the " current state of the law and process is unsatisfactory " and two inquests were already unable to go ahead in public .
he said inquests would only be held in private in " very extreme " cases where if information got out there would be a " grave risk of death of individuals " .
but his mr grieve said the plans " completely undermine " the point of an inquest and mr howarth said juries had traditionally provided " a check " on state power .
several labour backbenchers also criticised the plans during the debate - chris mullin questioned whether police might have used it to prevent a public interest inquest into the death of jean charles de menezes - shot dead after being mistaken for a terrorist by officers .
joan humble said service families depended on inquests to find out how their loved ones died and would be " dismayed " at the idea of private inquests while andrew dismore , suggested it may contravene the human rights act .
mr straw said there would be safeguards in place to stop the use of inquests without juries becoming widespread and said people would only be excluded from " parts of the inquest " .
but he added he understood why mps were " uncomfortable " , adding : " it 's a real difficulty .
what we have to do is try and find a way through it . "
the conservatives say while there is much they agree with in the bill , they will try to get the data-sharing proposal removed and the lib dems moved their own amendment to stop it getting a second reading .
but the lib dem bid was defeated by 278 votes to 47 , a government majority of 231 and the bill was given a second reading without a vote .

the cameras have been put in to tackle the misuse of paper towels and soap , says aeron rhys , head of ysgol dyffryn teifi in llandysul , ceredigion .
the pupils 's father called it an " outrageous invasion " of privacy .
but mr rhys said children had been concerned about cleanliness , and the cameras had " done the trick " .
the leader of ceredigion council has also supported the move .
anthony white , from llandysul , has withdrawn his 14-year-old daughter from the school over the issue . "
obviously this decision was not taken lightly and cameras were installed in the best interest of pupils " aeron rhys , head teacher he told the carmarthen journal that the cameras at the welsh-medium school were an " outrageous invasion " of privacy .
but mr rhys denied it was an invasion of privacy or an over-reaction .
he said pupils had " expressed concern that the wash basin areas were not being respected by a small minority " of children .
he said some pupils had engaged in " horseplay " in the past and had misused paper towels and soap .
' significant improvement ' he added : " the cctv was installed to monitor these areas and it 's done the trick .
there 's been a significant improvement .
" obviously this decision was not taken lightly and cameras were installed in the best interest of pupils .
" it was discussed in school council and with pupils beforehand . "
he said the cameras had been in place for two months .
the leader of ceredigion council keith evans , who represents the town and is a school governor , supported mr rhys ' decision .
" toilets can be areas where misbehaviour occurs .
in this case cctv was installed , in the main , to overcome concerns about the misuse of paper and soap , " he said .
mr white told the carmarthen journal that he thought the decision was an " invasion of her privacy " .
" the whole place is like they 're on big brother .
there are cameras all around the school , outside and in the corridors , " he said .
ceredigion council said the cctv footage in the toilets was only examined if an incident was reported .
it said it understood the equipment was installed " owing to pupils and cleaning staff reporting incidents that were of major concern to them " .

it revealed that 81 gorillas were now living permanently inside the park .
in total , about 211 of the great apes were estimated to be currently residing in africa 's oldest national park .
it is the first census to be completed by the park 's wildlife rangers since rebel troops seized control of the area in august 2007 .
more than 50 rangers from the congolese wildlife authority -lrb- iccn -rrb- conducted more than 128 patrols during the eight-week census .
' wonderful news ' " mountain gorilla family structures change with each birth , death , interaction and migration , " explained iccn gorilla monitoring head innocent mburanumwe , who writes a regular " gorilla diary " for the bbc news website .
" the kabirizi family , our largest gorilla group with 33 individuals , has five newborns which is wonderful news , " he revealed .
" but we are still hoping to locate the two gorillas from this same family that we have not yet seen . "
during the 16-month period from august 2007 until january 2009 , 10 baby gorillas were born into four of the habituated families .
however , three gorillas that had been previously identified in the august 2007 census have not been found and are listed as missing .
diary : protecting mountain gorillas trackers are able to identify individual gorillas because each animal 's nose is uniquely patterned .
significantly , no evidence of gorilla mortality was reported by the rangers , but they did discover and remove 536 snares laid by poachers .
" the status of virunga 's mountain gorillas is a triumph for conservation , " said emmanuel de merode , virunga national park 's director .
" it is the product of 15 years ' effort and sacrifice on the part of congo 's rangers , -lrb- and the result -rrb- of the consistent support from international organisations and individuals , and of the sustained determination of three african nations to protect this globally important species , " he added .
mountain gorillas are listed as critically endangered , with only 720 remaining in the world .
about 380 of the animals are located in the virunga volcanoes conservation area -lrb- shared by dr congo , rwanda and uganda -rrb- , while a further 320 gorillas live in the bwindi impenetrable forest , uganda .
in recent years , the region has been gripped by conflict and civil war .
since august 2007 , the gorilla sector of the national park has been under the control of rebel forces .
until recently , officials had not been able to enter the area , and many of the 1,100 rangers had to flee to safety with their families .

it revealed that 81 gorillas were now living permanently inside the park .
in total , about 211 of the great apes were estimated to be currently residing in africa 's oldest national park .
it is the first census to be completed by the park 's wildlife rangers since rebel troops seized control of the area in august 2007 .
more than 50 rangers from the congolese wildlife authority -lrb- iccn -rrb- conducted more than 128 patrols during the eight-week census .
' wonderful news ' " mountain gorilla family structures change with each birth , death , interaction and migration , " explained iccn gorilla monitoring head innocent mburanumwe , who writes a regular " gorilla diary " for the bbc news website .
" the kabirizi family , our largest gorilla group with 33 individuals , has five newborns which is wonderful news , " he revealed .
" but we are still hoping to locate the two gorillas from this same family that we have not yet seen . "
during the 16-month period from august 2007 until january 2009 , 10 baby gorillas were born into four of the habituated families .
however , three gorillas that had been previously identified in the august 2007 census have not been found and are listed as missing .
diary : protecting mountain gorillas trackers are able to identify individual gorillas because each animal 's nose is uniquely patterned .
significantly , no evidence of gorilla mortality was reported by the rangers , but they did discover and remove 536 snares laid by poachers .
" the status of virunga 's mountain gorillas is a triumph for conservation , " said emmanuel de merode , virunga national park 's director .
" it is the product of 15 years ' effort and sacrifice on the part of congo 's rangers , -lrb- and the result -rrb- of the consistent support from international organisations and individuals , and of the sustained determination of three african nations to protect this globally important species , " he added .
mountain gorillas are listed as critically endangered , with only 720 remaining in the world .
about 380 of the animals are located in the virunga volcanoes conservation area -lrb- shared by dr congo , rwanda and uganda -rrb- , while a further 320 gorillas live in the bwindi impenetrable forest , uganda .
in recent years , the region has been gripped by conflict and civil war .
since august 2007 , the gorilla sector of the national park has been under the control of rebel forces .
until recently , officials had not been able to enter the area , and many of the 1,100 rangers had to flee to safety with their families .

' extreme pressures ' the bbpa said sales of beer from uk pubs , restaurants and shops in the last quarter of 2008 were down 8.3 % from the same period in 2007 . "
beer sales are sinking and many pubs are struggling to survive " bbpa chief executive rob hayward it blamed part of the fall on last year 's 18 % rise in beer duty .
the bbpa said six pubs a day were closing .
the treasury said the higher duty was used to help fight child poverty .
the bbpa said october to december 's 8.3 % decline from a year before represented 2.2 million less pints of beer - be it lager , stout or ale - being bought each day .
it added that sales for 2008 as a whole were down 5.5 % .
" these figures highlight the extreme economic pressures hitting britain 's beer and pub sector .

officers from 76 councils sampled 494 kebabs to test their nutritional value , during the local authority coordinators of regulatory services -lrb- lacors -rrb- study .
the average doner they tested contained almost 1,000 calories - half a woman 's recommended daily intake .
geoffrey theobald , of lacors , said : " the level of saturated fat and salt in some is a serious cause for concern . "
he added that while they " would never consider kebabs part of a calorie-controlled diet " the true content of the average kebab was worrying .
among the kebabs sampled - without salad or sauces - the average doner contained 98 % of an adult 's recommended daily salt and 148 % of their daily saturated fat allowance .
graph : kebab content compared to recommended daily allowances under the supermarket " traffic lights " system , red marks would be earned by 97 % for fat , 98 % for saturated fat and 96 % for salt .
some 35 % of labels listed a different meat species than that actually found in the kebab . "
this study has turned the spotlight on doner kebabs " geoffrey theobald lacors how unhealthy is a doner ?
six kebabs were found to include pork when it had not been declared as an ingredient .
two of the six were described as halal - food or drink permitted for muslims , which must not contain pork .
mr theobald said it was " totally unacceptable " that people with certain faiths were unknowingly eating meats that were against their beliefs .
the worst doners inspectors came across contained 1,990 calories before salad and sauces - over 95 % of a woman 's recommended daily calories , 346 % of a woman 's saturated fat intake and 277 % of an adult 's daily salt intake .
researchers uncovered significant regional variations , with the average kebab in the north-west of england containing 1,101 calories , compared with 1,084 in scotland , 1,055 in wales and 1,066 in england 's south-east .
northern ireland 's average of 843 was the lowest in the uk .
mr theobald said it was " totally unacceptable " that inaccurate labelling was so widespread .
in addition , there was little difference in weight between kebabs labelled as " small " and " large " , he added .
" while some people may think they are making sensible choices by ordering a small kebab , this study showed little difference between small and large kebab weight . "
he said with obesity rates rising so rapidly in the uk , portion size was as important as content , he said .
" this study has turned the spotlight on doner kebabs and we hope that manufacturers rise to the challenge and work with councils to provide a healthier product that contains only what it says on the label , " mr theobald said .
research by the uk 's food standards agency in 2006 found that 18.5 % of doner takeaways posed a " significant " threat to public health , and 0.8 % posed an " imminent " threat .

officers from 76 councils sampled 494 kebabs to test their nutritional value , during the local authority coordinators of regulatory services -lrb- lacors -rrb- study .
the average doner they tested contained almost 1,000 calories - half a woman 's recommended daily intake .
geoffrey theobald , of lacors , said : " the level of saturated fat and salt in some is a serious cause for concern . "
he added that while they " would never consider kebabs part of a calorie-controlled diet " the true content of the average kebab was worrying .
among the kebabs sampled - without salad or sauces - the average doner contained 98 % of an adult 's recommended daily salt and 148 % of their daily saturated fat allowance .
graph : kebab content compared to recommended daily allowances under the supermarket " traffic lights " system , red marks would be earned by 97 % for fat , 98 % for saturated fat and 96 % for salt .

six kebabs were found to include pork when it had not been declared as an ingredient .
two of the six were described as halal - food or drink permitted for muslims , which must not contain pork .
mr theobald said it was " totally unacceptable " that people with certain faiths were unknowingly eating meats that were against their beliefs .
the worst doners inspectors came across contained 1,990 calories before salad and sauces - over 95 % of a woman 's recommended daily calories , 346 % of a woman 's saturated fat intake and 277 % of an adult 's daily salt intake .

mr theobald said it was " totally unacceptable " that people with certain faiths were unknowingly eating meats that were against their beliefs .
the worst doners inspectors came across contained 1,990 calories before salad and sauces - over 95 % of a woman 's recommended daily calories , 346 % of a woman 's saturated fat intake and 277 % of an adult 's daily salt intake .

northern ireland 's average of 843 was the lowest in the uk .
