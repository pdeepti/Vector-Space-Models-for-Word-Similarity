police say regulations are strict enough but go unenforced . merkel called on sunday , march 15 , for tighter gun control in her country after a teenager used his father 's pistol to kill 15 people .
authorities have said the gunman then took his own life while in a shoot-out with police . " we will probably never be able to prevent -lrb- another such massacre -rrb- , but one of the lessons from this horrible event is to be vigilant , " merkel said in an interview with public radio station deutschlandfunk .
" the possession of weapons and munitions is a subject that we must strongly pay attention to - it must be controlled , rules must be applied . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim k. reportedly got the weapon for the shooting from his father 's night table the chancellor also mentioned conducting " spot checks " of legally owned weapons to ensure their proper storage . several calls to tighten gun laws and monitor gun owners ' accordance with storage requirement have been issued by politicians and other groups after 17-year-old tim k. , armed with a beretta gun taken from his father 's bedroom , killed 16 people in the small southwestern town of winnenden , near stuttgart . gun laws unenforced some 78 percent of germans said they supported banning guns from homes , according to an emnid study of 501 people published sunday by the bild am sonntag newspaper .
some 41 percent said they approved of students being searched before entering a school . the german police union , however , said the country 's current gun control laws were sufficient but have not been adequately enforced . " we restricted the right to own weapons after the school shooting in erfurt , but no one is checking if the strict requirements are being met , " union head rainer wendt told the dpa news agency .

but this week , they broadened their focus to the realm of the automobile . for the rest of this month , german customers of lidl will not only be able to pick up bargain-brand potato chips and six-packs of beer .
they can also purchase new cars . at the beginning of the week , the chain began selling the corsa model by opel and the vw polo cross at discounts of more than 25 percent off their list prices . but it 's not as if potential buyers can just show up at the check-out counter and take one out for a test drive . " customers put together the options they want online , " lidl spokesperson petra trabert told dw-world.de.
" we then pass that information on to our delivery partner atg , who contacts the customer .
if everything is okay , they draw up a sales contract , and the buyer can pick up the vehicle at atg 's headquarters . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these are some of lidl 's more familiar offerings in other words , lidl is merely responsible for the first steps in the transaction - chiefly the publicity , the " configurator " for putting together desired options and the contact between the customer and the dealer supplying the car . customers have to know which model they want , as there 's no opportunity to take vehicles out for a comparative spin .
but they can take advantage of the much-coveted 2,500-euro -lrb- $ 3,200 -rrb- government premium for people who scrap older cars and buy newer energy efficient ones . lidl is one of the largest supermarket chains in the world with an annual turnover of some 60 billion euros .
the company has 150,000 employees and runs some 8000 outlets in 22 countries . but the car offer is only available in germany . what makes a giant food retailer get involved in pushing passenger cars ?
in a word : publicity . " cars have been a hot topic of discussion everywhere recently , " trabert said .
" once we found a suitable partner , we went ahead - we have special promotions every few weeks . " the unusual car offer only runs until the final week of march .
after that , buyers seeking an automotive bargain will have to do things the traditional way - by going to a dealership and haggling with a salesman . author : jefferson chase editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but this week , they broadened their focus to the realm of the automobile . for the rest of this month , german customers of lidl will not only be able to pick up bargain-brand potato chips and six-packs of beer .
they can also purchase new cars . at the beginning of the week , the chain began selling the corsa model by opel and the vw polo cross at discounts of more than 25 percent off their list prices . but it 's not as if potential buyers can just show up at the check-out counter and take one out for a test drive . " customers put together the options they want online , " lidl spokesperson petra trabert told dw-world.de.
" we then pass that information on to our delivery partner atg , who contacts the customer .
if everything is okay , they draw up a sales contract , and the buyer can pick up the vehicle at atg 's headquarters . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these are some of lidl 's more familiar offerings in other words , lidl is merely responsible for the first steps in the transaction - chiefly the publicity , the " configurator " for putting together desired options and the contact between the customer and the dealer supplying the car . customers have to know which model they want , as there 's no opportunity to take vehicles out for a comparative spin .
but they can take advantage of the much-coveted 2,500-euro -lrb- $ 3,200 -rrb- government premium for people who scrap older cars and buy newer energy efficient ones . lidl is one of the largest supermarket chains in the world with an annual turnover of some 60 billion euros .
the company has 150,000 employees and runs some 8000 outlets in 22 countries . but the car offer is only available in germany . what makes a giant food retailer get involved in pushing passenger cars ?
in a word : publicity . " cars have been a hot topic of discussion everywhere recently , " trabert said .
" once we found a suitable partner , we went ahead - we have special promotions every few weeks . " the unusual car offer only runs until the final week of march .
after that , buyers seeking an automotive bargain will have to do things the traditional way - by going to a dealership and haggling with a salesman . author : jefferson chase editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but this week , they broadened their focus to the realm of the automobile . for the rest of this month , german customers of lidl will not only be able to pick up bargain-brand potato chips and six-packs of beer .
they can also purchase new cars . at the beginning of the week , the chain began selling the corsa model by opel and the vw polo cross at discounts of more than 25 percent off their list prices . but it 's not as if potential buyers can just show up at the check-out counter and take one out for a test drive . " customers put together the options they want online , " lidl spokesperson petra trabert told dw-world.de.
" we then pass that information on to our delivery partner atg , who contacts the customer .
if everything is okay , they draw up a sales contract , and the buyer can pick up the vehicle at atg 's headquarters . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these are some of lidl 's more familiar offerings in other words , lidl is merely responsible for the first steps in the transaction - chiefly the publicity , the " configurator " for putting together desired options and the contact between the customer and the dealer supplying the car . customers have to know which model they want , as there 's no opportunity to take vehicles out for a comparative spin .
but they can take advantage of the much-coveted 2,500-euro -lrb- $ 3,200 -rrb- government premium for people who scrap older cars and buy newer energy efficient ones . lidl is one of the largest supermarket chains in the world with an annual turnover of some 60 billion euros .
the company has 150,000 employees and runs some 8000 outlets in 22 countries . but the car offer is only available in germany . what makes a giant food retailer get involved in pushing passenger cars ?
in a word : publicity . " cars have been a hot topic of discussion everywhere recently , " trabert said .
" once we found a suitable partner , we went ahead - we have special promotions every few weeks . " the unusual car offer only runs until the final week of march .
after that , buyers seeking an automotive bargain will have to do things the traditional way - by going to a dealership and haggling with a salesman . author : jefferson chase editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but this week , they broadened their focus to the realm of the automobile . for the rest of this month , german customers of lidl will not only be able to pick up bargain-brand potato chips and six-packs of beer .
they can also purchase new cars . at the beginning of the week , the chain began selling the corsa model by opel and the vw polo cross at discounts of more than 25 percent off their list prices . but it 's not as if potential buyers can just show up at the check-out counter and take one out for a test drive . " customers put together the options they want online , " lidl spokesperson petra trabert told dw-world.de.
" we then pass that information on to our delivery partner atg , who contacts the customer .
if everything is okay , they draw up a sales contract , and the buyer can pick up the vehicle at atg 's headquarters . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these are some of lidl 's more familiar offerings in other words , lidl is merely responsible for the first steps in the transaction - chiefly the publicity , the " configurator " for putting together desired options and the contact between the customer and the dealer supplying the car . customers have to know which model they want , as there 's no opportunity to take vehicles out for a comparative spin .
but they can take advantage of the much-coveted 2,500-euro -lrb- $ 3,200 -rrb- government premium for people who scrap older cars and buy newer energy efficient ones . lidl is one of the largest supermarket chains in the world with an annual turnover of some 60 billion euros .

but this week , they broadened their focus to the realm of the automobile . for the rest of this month , german customers of lidl will not only be able to pick up bargain-brand potato chips and six-packs of beer .
they can also purchase new cars . at the beginning of the week , the chain began selling the corsa model by opel and the vw polo cross at discounts of more than 25 percent off their list prices . but it 's not as if potential buyers can just show up at the check-out counter and take one out for a test drive . " customers put together the options they want online , " lidl spokesperson petra trabert told dw-world.de.
" we then pass that information on to our delivery partner atg , who contacts the customer .
if everything is okay , they draw up a sales contract , and the buyer can pick up the vehicle at atg 's headquarters . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these are some of lidl 's more familiar offerings in other words , lidl is merely responsible for the first steps in the transaction - chiefly the publicity , the " configurator " for putting together desired options and the contact between the customer and the dealer supplying the car . customers have to know which model they want , as there 's no opportunity to take vehicles out for a comparative spin .
but they can take advantage of the much-coveted 2,500-euro -lrb- $ 3,200 -rrb- government premium for people who scrap older cars and buy newer energy efficient ones . lidl is one of the largest supermarket chains in the world with an annual turnover of some 60 billion euros .
the company has 150,000 employees and runs some 8000 outlets in 22 countries . but the car offer is only available in germany . what makes a giant food retailer get involved in pushing passenger cars ?
in a word : publicity . " cars have been a hot topic of discussion everywhere recently , " trabert said .
" once we found a suitable partner , we went ahead - we have special promotions every few weeks . " the unusual car offer only runs until the final week of march .
after that , buyers seeking an automotive bargain will have to do things the traditional way - by going to a dealership and haggling with a salesman . author : jefferson chase editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
