both countries moved quickly to recall their respective ambassadors with thailand announcing a review of bilateral ties . thai prime minister abhisit vejjajiva said thursday the recall of thailand ’ s ambassador to cambodia was in retaliation over the appointment of former leader thaksin shinawatra as an advisor to cambodian leader , hun sen. the move by thailand was quickly followed by cambodia which later announced it was recalling its ambassador to thailand .
the appointment of thaksin follows a recent increase in tensions between cambodia and thailand over the former fugitive leader during a recent summit of south east asian leaders when prime minister hun sen praised thaksin .
thaksin , ousted from power in a 2006 coup , was found guilty last year by a thai court on charges of corruption and conflict of interest in a land deal involving his wife .
he fled thailand before the two year jail sentence was handed down .
kraisak choonhavan , a member of abhisit ’ s governing democrat party , says bilateral ties have been severely damaged by hun sen ’ s decision .
" as i see it , unless hun sen does a big reversal of his policy appointing thaksin , this is going to take us towards very serious problems in our relations .
it was totally unpredictable that hun sen would go to this extent , i must say . "
further escalation possible kraisak said there was a danger of the dispute escalating further , possibly with vital border crossings between the neighbouring countries being shut down .
in recent years , thailand and cambodia have faced strained bilateral relations over disputed land surrounding an 11th century khmer temple .
brief border clashes have led to casualties on both sides .
thaksin is known to have long standing close ties with hun sen in both business and politics .
but senior cambodian opposition parliamentarian son chhay says he does not expect thaksin to make a major contribution to the cambodian economy .
" it will be better if thaksin stays away from cambodia .
we do not understand the decision of our prime minister here in appointing mr. thaksin .
in cambodia we have so many advisors already .
thaksin was perhaps a successful businessman in thailand but his kind of knowledge is not suitable for cambodia where we have so many problems with corruption already . "
a campaign by thaksin 's supporters ?
obervers in thailand say the cambodian appointment appears to be part of a plan by thaksin 's supporters to undermine the abhisit government in a bid to return their former leader to power .
human rights watch ’ s representative sunai pasuk calls it a " two-pronged strategy " .
according to him , thaksin 's supporters are trying " to discredit the government through the media , in parliament , on the street .
the other theatre of thaksin ’ s political operations is outside thailand using malaysia , cambodia as well as dubai to show that the government is not respected . "
analysts say thaksin ’ s supporters are trying to weaken the government before the thai economy starts to fully recover from the recent reecession , and to force abhisit to call fresh elections in 2010 .

these questions from parents , teachers , and later on from employers are driving millions of indian students into private tuition classes after school .
shiladitya bhaduri , a class ten student studying in an elite private school in kolkata also attends tuition classes instead of playing with his friends . " for a bright future , private tuitions are needed because schools are not always guiding us in the right way " , he explains .
sharmistha , a private tutor in kolkata , agrees : " it is impossible for the teachers to give all the required knowledge that they want to impart in the school ; so the students simply require some special care in order to know all that they need to know . "
fierce competition besides teaching deficits in the government and even private schools , it is mainly the tough competition for popular careers like those of a doctor , an engineer or a civil servant which makes parents and students go for coaching centres .

" how many marks you score decides your future prospects .
in order to make sure that knowledge becomes more important in education than marks , you 'd have to introduce a system where your knowledge is tested .
so you don ’ t just have to memorise something , you have to internalise something .

coaching centres are a lucrative business as they hardly pay any taxes .
some indian states have even put a ban on full time teachers running private tuition classes , as this might impact their performance in school .
in order to secure an additional income , teachers have also been known to teach only part of the curriculum in class and then request the students to come for private tuition for the rest .
so far , government orders have not proven effective in stopping such practices ; and as long as fierce competition and the craze for better marks continue to put pressure on both parents and children , the tuition boom is likely to continue .

shiladitya bhaduri , a class ten student studying in an elite private school in kolkata also attends tuition classes instead of playing with his friends . " for a bright future , private tuitions are needed because schools are not always guiding us in the right way " , he explains .
sharmistha , a private tutor in kolkata , agrees : " it is impossible for the teachers to give all the required knowledge that they want to impart in the school ; so the students simply require some special care in order to know all that they need to know . "
fierce competition besides teaching deficits in the government and even private schools , it is mainly the tough competition for popular careers like those of a doctor , an engineer or a civil servant which makes parents and students go for coaching centres .
utpal moitra wants his son to be a government officer , a dream that many indian parents have for their children .
" i want him to be a civil servant but i don ’ t really know whether he will be able to do it or not , " says moitra .
" if i get some good institution which can give him the coaching to get him into a good position , i don ’ t mind sending him to a coaching centre . "

" how many marks you score decides your future prospects .
in order to make sure that knowledge becomes more important in education than marks , you 'd have to introduce a system where your knowledge is tested .
so you don ’ t just have to memorise something , you have to internalise something .
you have to read the book and the teacher has to guide you through the whole course , which is not done . "
coaching centres are a lucrative business as they hardly pay any taxes .
some indian states have even put a ban on full time teachers running private tuition classes , as this might impact their performance in school .
in order to secure an additional income , teachers have also been known to teach only part of the curriculum in class and then request the students to come for private tuition for the rest .
so far , government orders have not proven effective in stopping such practices ; and as long as fierce competition and the craze for better marks continue to put pressure on both parents and children , the tuition boom is likely to continue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 05.11.2009 cambodia , thailand recall ambassadors in row over thaksin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime ministers hun sen , left , and abhisit vejjajiva at a meeting earlier this year political tensions between thailand and cambodia have escalated after cambodian prime minister hun sen appointed former thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra as an advisor .
both countries moved quickly to recall their respective ambassadors with thailand announcing a review of bilateral ties . thai prime minister abhisit vejjajiva said thursday the recall of thailand ’ s ambassador to cambodia was in retaliation over the appointment of former leader thaksin shinawatra as an advisor to cambodian leader , hun sen. the move by thailand was quickly followed by cambodia which later announced it was recalling its ambassador to thailand .
the appointment of thaksin follows a recent increase in tensions between cambodia and thailand over the former fugitive leader during a recent summit of south east asian leaders when prime minister hun sen praised thaksin .
thaksin , ousted from power in a 2006 coup , was found guilty last year by a thai court on charges of corruption and conflict of interest in a land deal involving his wife .
he fled thailand before the two year jail sentence was handed down .
kraisak choonhavan , a member of abhisit ’ s governing democrat party , says bilateral ties have been severely damaged by hun sen ’ s decision .
" as i see it , unless hun sen does a big reversal of his policy appointing thaksin , this is going to take us towards very serious problems in our relations .
it was totally unpredictable that hun sen would go to this extent , i must say . "
further escalation possible kraisak said there was a danger of the dispute escalating further , possibly with vital border crossings between the neighbouring countries being shut down .
in recent years , thailand and cambodia have faced strained bilateral relations over disputed land surrounding an 11th century khmer temple .
brief border clashes have led to casualties on both sides .
thaksin is known to have long standing close ties with hun sen in both business and politics .
but senior cambodian opposition parliamentarian son chhay says he does not expect thaksin to make a major contribution to the cambodian economy .
" it will be better if thaksin stays away from cambodia .
we do not understand the decision of our prime minister here in appointing mr. thaksin .
in cambodia we have so many advisors already .
thaksin was perhaps a successful businessman in thailand but his kind of knowledge is not suitable for cambodia where we have so many problems with corruption already . "
a campaign by thaksin 's supporters ?
obervers in thailand say the cambodian appointment appears to be part of a plan by thaksin 's supporters to undermine the abhisit government in a bid to return their former leader to power .
human rights watch ’ s representative sunai pasuk calls it a " two-pronged strategy " .
according to him , thaksin 's supporters are trying " to discredit the government through the media , in parliament , on the street .
the other theatre of thaksin ’ s political operations is outside thailand using malaysia , cambodia as well as dubai to show that the government is not respected . "
analysts say thaksin ’ s supporters are trying to weaken the government before the thai economy starts to fully recover from the recent reecession , and to force abhisit to call fresh elections in 2010 .

both countries moved quickly to recall their respective ambassadors with thailand announcing a review of bilateral ties . thai prime minister abhisit vejjajiva said thursday the recall of thailand ’ s ambassador to cambodia was in retaliation over the appointment of former leader thaksin shinawatra as an advisor to cambodian leader , hun sen. the move by thailand was quickly followed by cambodia which later announced it was recalling its ambassador to thailand .
the appointment of thaksin follows a recent increase in tensions between cambodia and thailand over the former fugitive leader during a recent summit of south east asian leaders when prime minister hun sen praised thaksin .
thaksin , ousted from power in a 2006 coup , was found guilty last year by a thai court on charges of corruption and conflict of interest in a land deal involving his wife .
he fled thailand before the two year jail sentence was handed down .
kraisak choonhavan , a member of abhisit ’ s governing democrat party , says bilateral ties have been severely damaged by hun sen ’ s decision .
" as i see it , unless hun sen does a big reversal of his policy appointing thaksin , this is going to take us towards very serious problems in our relations .
it was totally unpredictable that hun sen would go to this extent , i must say . "
further escalation possible kraisak said there was a danger of the dispute escalating further , possibly with vital border crossings between the neighbouring countries being shut down .
in recent years , thailand and cambodia have faced strained bilateral relations over disputed land surrounding an 11th century khmer temple .
brief border clashes have led to casualties on both sides .
thaksin is known to have long standing close ties with hun sen in both business and politics .
but senior cambodian opposition parliamentarian son chhay says he does not expect thaksin to make a major contribution to the cambodian economy .
" it will be better if thaksin stays away from cambodia .
we do not understand the decision of our prime minister here in appointing mr. thaksin .
in cambodia we have so many advisors already .
thaksin was perhaps a successful businessman in thailand but his kind of knowledge is not suitable for cambodia where we have so many problems with corruption already . "
a campaign by thaksin 's supporters ?
obervers in thailand say the cambodian appointment appears to be part of a plan by thaksin 's supporters to undermine the abhisit government in a bid to return their former leader to power .
human rights watch ’ s representative sunai pasuk calls it a " two-pronged strategy " .
according to him , thaksin 's supporters are trying " to discredit the government through the media , in parliament , on the street .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de india -pipe- 05.11.2009 european union 's relations to india growing in intensity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts foresee a continued warming of relations between the european union and india the eu and india will focus on pushing their free trade pact during their 10th annual summit in new delhi on friday .
but other significant issues are also on the agenda , though the two sides do n't always see eye-to-eye . a major sticking point at the eu-india summit is the planned free trade agreement -lrb- fta -rrb- between the two sides .
daniele smadja , head of the european commission 's delegation to india , said on wednesday that the talks needed a boost .
" the fta negotiations are very complex , " smadja said .
" we have to jump into the cold water of give and take . "
the time had come to exchange concessions , she said .
but clemens spiess , a lecturer at the south asia institute at the university of heidelberg , said he did not expect a final agreement to be reached .
" there are still a lot of hurdles , " spiess told deutsche welle .
these include intellectual property rights disputes and tariff disagreements .
he said he did not expect fta talks to conclude successfully until 2010 or 2011 .
security has become a common challenge in the past , the eu 's relations to india have focused primarily on trade and economic issues .
this comes as no surprise , as the eu is india 's largest trading partner .
graham watson , chairman of the european parliament delegation for relations with india , said trade has more than doubled between the two partners over the past five years .
according to parliament figures , bilateral trade is expected to exceed 70.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 104.5 billion -rrb- by 2010 and 160.6 billion euros by 2015 .
" clearly it 's mainly in the trade area that we want to talk , but we also recognize on both sides that we have a common challenge in promoting peace and comprehensive security , " watson told deutsche welle .
a security dialogue has been in place since 2006 .
the eu not only recognized india 's role as a force of stability in a volatile region , but also as one of the few democracies in the region , he said .
" democracy gives india a huge advantage over china in the medium and long-term , " watson said .
" it makes it far easier for the eu to deal with india , not least because once a decision is taken it represents a consensus of opinion and therefore to be stuck to . "
this perception was n't always the case , though , said rajendra k jain , professor and former chairman of the center for european studies at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many westerners were also taken hostage in mumbai , such as at the taj hotel " the eu never viewed india as an important security partner halfway around the world because their issues and priorities were very different , " jain said in an interview with deutsche welle .
but this changed after the terrorist attacks in mumbai last november .
the eu recognized that india was a significant player in anti-terrorism collaboration .
however , jain said the structure of the eu did not allow for too much optimism in what could be possibly achieved in this area .
" the eu is a very strange political creature , " jain said .
" we should not have too high expectations of what is going to be possible in the realm of security cooperation because insofar as intelligence is concerned , it is a very sensitive issue and not the competence of the european union .
that is clearly with the member states . "
security in particular played a more central role in india 's relations to the united states , spiess said .
" a problem is the interaction between one country , india , on the one side and the 27-member state community , " spiess said .
" we all know there is no such thing as a consistent eu foreign policy , and security policy is now the domain of us-indo relations , which overshadows india 's interactions with the eu in terms of security relations . "
india wo n't succumb to climate pressure with the un conference in copenhagen just a few weeks away , climate change will also be a point of debate in new delhi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is also significantly affecting india " the western countries are pressuring india to join the fight against climate change more thoroughly , " spiess said .
" but india under no circumstances will accept any sort of legally binding reductions on its future greenhouse gas emissions trajectory . "
new delhi is resisting any binding emission cuts and demanding finance and technology from wealthy countries to help reduce emissions .
but there are other areas in which the two sides cooperate closely , such as energy , technology transfer , science and academic cooperation .
at this week 's summit , a cooperation agreement between the european atomic energy community euratom and india will be signed in the field of fusion energy research .
representatives will also launch a call for proposals for research in the field of solar energy , the european commission said .
" there 's plenty there for our leaders to get their teeth into , " watson said .
" the question is : where can we best find areas where we can make progress together and where there 's a real added value in cooperation . "
an equal partnership ?
for the eu , experts agreed , india is certainly an international partner to be taken seriously .
this was evident from the strategic partnership agreement in 2004 and the joint action plan in 2005 , revised in 2008 , which aims to deepen dialogue and cooperation .
" the eu does n't identify too many countries in the world with which they will enter into strategic partnerships , " said spiess .
" from the perspective of the eu , it 's crystal clear that india is identified as a stabilizing factor in the region and as a growing global player .
that 's why it 's a partner to count on . "
but it would go too far to say india was an equal partner , said christian wagner from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" for the eu , india is a developing country , " wagner told deutsche welle .
" the lion 's share of eu resources allocated to india in the next years deal with development goals . "
eu support is earmarked for helping india achieve the un millennium development goals , he said .
with respect to sentiments from new delhi , jain said there has been a shift in perception - despite the strong emphasis on trade and economic issues in the relationship .
" i think there has been a perceptible change in recent years and growing recognition among indian policymakers about the importance of the european union in world affairs , " jain said .

but other significant issues are also on the agenda , though the two sides do n't always see eye-to-eye . a major sticking point at the eu-india summit is the planned free trade agreement -lrb- fta -rrb- between the two sides .
daniele smadja , head of the european commission 's delegation to india , said on wednesday that the talks needed a boost .
" the fta negotiations are very complex , " smadja said .
" we have to jump into the cold water of give and take . "
the time had come to exchange concessions , she said .
but clemens spiess , a lecturer at the south asia institute at the university of heidelberg , said he did not expect a final agreement to be reached .
" there are still a lot of hurdles , " spiess told deutsche welle .
these include intellectual property rights disputes and tariff disagreements .
he said he did not expect fta talks to conclude successfully until 2010 or 2011 .
security has become a common challenge in the past , the eu 's relations to india have focused primarily on trade and economic issues .
this comes as no surprise , as the eu is india 's largest trading partner .
graham watson , chairman of the european parliament delegation for relations with india , said trade has more than doubled between the two partners over the past five years .
according to parliament figures , bilateral trade is expected to exceed 70.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 104.5 billion -rrb- by 2010 and 160.6 billion euros by 2015 .
" clearly it 's mainly in the trade area that we want to talk , but we also recognize on both sides that we have a common challenge in promoting peace and comprehensive security , " watson told deutsche welle .
a security dialogue has been in place since 2006 .
the eu not only recognized india 's role as a force of stability in a volatile region , but also as one of the few democracies in the region , he said .
" democracy gives india a huge advantage over china in the medium and long-term , " watson said .
" it makes it far easier for the eu to deal with india , not least because once a decision is taken it represents a consensus of opinion and therefore to be stuck to . "
this perception was n't always the case , though , said rajendra k jain , professor and former chairman of the center for european studies at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many westerners were also taken hostage in mumbai , such as at the taj hotel " the eu never viewed india as an important security partner halfway around the world because their issues and priorities were very different , " jain said in an interview with deutsche welle .
but this changed after the terrorist attacks in mumbai last november .
the eu recognized that india was a significant player in anti-terrorism collaboration .
however , jain said the structure of the eu did not allow for too much optimism in what could be possibly achieved in this area .
" the eu is a very strange political creature , " jain said .
" we should not have too high expectations of what is going to be possible in the realm of security cooperation because insofar as intelligence is concerned , it is a very sensitive issue and not the competence of the european union .
that is clearly with the member states . "
security in particular played a more central role in india 's relations to the united states , spiess said .
" a problem is the interaction between one country , india , on the one side and the 27-member state community , " spiess said .
" we all know there is no such thing as a consistent eu foreign policy , and security policy is now the domain of us-indo relations , which overshadows india 's interactions with the eu in terms of security relations . "
india wo n't succumb to climate pressure with the un conference in copenhagen just a few weeks away , climate change will also be a point of debate in new delhi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is also significantly affecting india " the western countries are pressuring india to join the fight against climate change more thoroughly , " spiess said .
" but india under no circumstances will accept any sort of legally binding reductions on its future greenhouse gas emissions trajectory . "
new delhi is resisting any binding emission cuts and demanding finance and technology from wealthy countries to help reduce emissions .
but there are other areas in which the two sides cooperate closely , such as energy , technology transfer , science and academic cooperation .
at this week 's summit , a cooperation agreement between the european atomic energy community euratom and india will be signed in the field of fusion energy research .
representatives will also launch a call for proposals for research in the field of solar energy , the european commission said .
" there 's plenty there for our leaders to get their teeth into , " watson said .
" the question is : where can we best find areas where we can make progress together and where there 's a real added value in cooperation . "
an equal partnership ?
for the eu , experts agreed , india is certainly an international partner to be taken seriously .
this was evident from the strategic partnership agreement in 2004 and the joint action plan in 2005 , revised in 2008 , which aims to deepen dialogue and cooperation .
" the eu does n't identify too many countries in the world with which they will enter into strategic partnerships , " said spiess .
" from the perspective of the eu , it 's crystal clear that india is identified as a stabilizing factor in the region and as a growing global player .
that 's why it 's a partner to count on . "
but it would go too far to say india was an equal partner , said christian wagner from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" for the eu , india is a developing country , " wagner told deutsche welle .
" the lion 's share of eu resources allocated to india in the next years deal with development goals . "
eu support is earmarked for helping india achieve the un millennium development goals , he said .
with respect to sentiments from new delhi , jain said there has been a shift in perception - despite the strong emphasis on trade and economic issues in the relationship .
" i think there has been a perceptible change in recent years and growing recognition among indian policymakers about the importance of the european union in world affairs , " jain said .

he said he did not expect fta talks to conclude successfully until 2010 or 2011 .
security has become a common challenge in the past , the eu 's relations to india have focused primarily on trade and economic issues .
this comes as no surprise , as the eu is india 's largest trading partner .
graham watson , chairman of the european parliament delegation for relations with india , said trade has more than doubled between the two partners over the past five years .
according to parliament figures , bilateral trade is expected to exceed 70.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 104.5 billion -rrb- by 2010 and 160.6 billion euros by 2015 .
" clearly it 's mainly in the trade area that we want to talk , but we also recognize on both sides that we have a common challenge in promoting peace and comprehensive security , " watson told deutsche welle .
a security dialogue has been in place since 2006 .
the eu not only recognized india 's role as a force of stability in a volatile region , but also as one of the few democracies in the region , he said .
" democracy gives india a huge advantage over china in the medium and long-term , " watson said .
" it makes it far easier for the eu to deal with india , not least because once a decision is taken it represents a consensus of opinion and therefore to be stuck to . "
this perception was n't always the case , though , said rajendra k jain , professor and former chairman of the center for european studies at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many westerners were also taken hostage in mumbai , such as at the taj hotel " the eu never viewed india as an important security partner halfway around the world because their issues and priorities were very different , " jain said in an interview with deutsche welle .
but this changed after the terrorist attacks in mumbai last november .
the eu recognized that india was a significant player in anti-terrorism collaboration .
however , jain said the structure of the eu did not allow for too much optimism in what could be possibly achieved in this area .
" the eu is a very strange political creature , " jain said .
" we should not have too high expectations of what is going to be possible in the realm of security cooperation because insofar as intelligence is concerned , it is a very sensitive issue and not the competence of the european union .
that is clearly with the member states . "
security in particular played a more central role in india 's relations to the united states , spiess said .
" a problem is the interaction between one country , india , on the one side and the 27-member state community , " spiess said .
" we all know there is no such thing as a consistent eu foreign policy , and security policy is now the domain of us-indo relations , which overshadows india 's interactions with the eu in terms of security relations . "
india wo n't succumb to climate pressure with the un conference in copenhagen just a few weeks away , climate change will also be a point of debate in new delhi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is also significantly affecting india " the western countries are pressuring india to join the fight against climate change more thoroughly , " spiess said .
" but india under no circumstances will accept any sort of legally binding reductions on its future greenhouse gas emissions trajectory . "
new delhi is resisting any binding emission cuts and demanding finance and technology from wealthy countries to help reduce emissions .
but there are other areas in which the two sides cooperate closely , such as energy , technology transfer , science and academic cooperation .
at this week 's summit , a cooperation agreement between the european atomic energy community euratom and india will be signed in the field of fusion energy research .
representatives will also launch a call for proposals for research in the field of solar energy , the european commission said .
" there 's plenty there for our leaders to get their teeth into , " watson said .
" the question is : where can we best find areas where we can make progress together and where there 's a real added value in cooperation . "
an equal partnership ?
for the eu , experts agreed , india is certainly an international partner to be taken seriously .
this was evident from the strategic partnership agreement in 2004 and the joint action plan in 2005 , revised in 2008 , which aims to deepen dialogue and cooperation .
" the eu does n't identify too many countries in the world with which they will enter into strategic partnerships , " said spiess .
" from the perspective of the eu , it 's crystal clear that india is identified as a stabilizing factor in the region and as a growing global player .
that 's why it 's a partner to count on . "
but it would go too far to say india was an equal partner , said christian wagner from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" for the eu , india is a developing country , " wagner told deutsche welle .
" the lion 's share of eu resources allocated to india in the next years deal with development goals . "
eu support is earmarked for helping india achieve the un millennium development goals , he said .
with respect to sentiments from new delhi , jain said there has been a shift in perception - despite the strong emphasis on trade and economic issues in the relationship .
" i think there has been a perceptible change in recent years and growing recognition among indian policymakers about the importance of the european union in world affairs , " jain said .

the announcement follows a decision by gm not to sell off the carmaker to canadian car-parts maker magna . general motors vice president john smith said wednesday that around 10,000 jobs would be slashed at the company 's european unit opel , which employs some 55,000 europeans in germany , spain , belgium , poland and the uk .
smith did not specify where the cuts would be made . the announcement comes less than a day after gm announced its decision not to sell off opel to a consortium led by canadian car-parts maker magna and russian state bank sberbank . the job cuts would be undertaken with the view to reduce costs at opel by around 30 percent , smith said , adding that the plan did not differ substantially from proposals for opel tabled by magna and sberbank . gm said it wanted to finalize its restructuring plans for opel as soon as possible for presentation to european governments . muted response the european commission has responded so far in neutral tones to the decision by gm to hold on to opel and its other european unit vauxhall . european union competition spokesman jonathan todd said merely that the commission , the eu 's executive body , " takes note " of the decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government was closely involved in bringing about the magna deal gm said it would keep its european operations because of an improvement in the economic environment . it 's also understood that gm was concerned that its position as a global company would be damaged if opel and vauxhall were competing with it in europe . european governments are now awaiting a possible request by gm for aid to help it restructure opel .
the magna-sberbank consortium had been set to receive a massive state aid package from germany to help along its restructuring plans . the german state support had been the subject of an eu investigation into whether the funds were linked to the maintenance of jobs in germany ahead of other european countries which host opel plants , a move which would have violated eu competition rules . juergen ruettgers , the state premier of north rhine-westphalia , where opel 's bochum plant is located , demanded that gm keep all its opel factories in germany running .
he told broadcaster zdf on wednesday that this should be a condition of any german state help . he also demanded that there be no operational redundancies in germany , and that any job cuts should be " socially responsible " .
ruettgers promised there would be no financial aid from north rhine-westphalia if the bochum plant were closed down .
" no-one can expect us to pay for the closure of the bochum factory , " he said . 3,000 opel workers are expected to appear at a demonstration on the bochum factory grounds on thursday afternoon .
the rally is being organized by industrial trade union ig metall , and production is expected to stop for its duration . ruettgers will speak at the demonstration , as will local social democrat party head hannelore kraft , and trade union leaders rainer einenkel and oliver burkhard . " germany 's decision " todd said the same rules would apply if gm applied to european governments for funding now it has decided not to sell opel .
the german government had confirmed to the eu that the money would have been available to any of the potential buyers , todd said , adding that it was not for the eu to tell germany what to do with its money now . " that is a matter for the german government , " he said .
" the commission can not suggest or oblige member states to give state aid ; we can however and do verify the conditions of any state aid that is given . " the commission insisted it is ready to facilitate discussions between gm and its european partners if needed . but now gm has backed away from a deal at the very last minute , it may be significantly harder to establish trust between the parties . author : nina-maria potts / mll / dfm editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

smith did not specify where the cuts would be made . the announcement comes less than a day after gm announced its decision not to sell off opel to a consortium led by canadian car-parts maker magna and russian state bank sberbank . the job cuts would be undertaken with the view to reduce costs at opel by around 30 percent , smith said , adding that the plan did not differ substantially from proposals for opel tabled by magna and sberbank . gm said it wanted to finalize its restructuring plans for opel as soon as possible for presentation to european governments . muted response the european commission has responded so far in neutral tones to the decision by gm to hold on to opel and its other european unit vauxhall . european union competition spokesman jonathan todd said merely that the commission , the eu 's executive body , " takes note " of the decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government was closely involved in bringing about the magna deal gm said it would keep its european operations because of an improvement in the economic environment . it 's also understood that gm was concerned that its position as a global company would be damaged if opel and vauxhall were competing with it in europe . european governments are now awaiting a possible request by gm for aid to help it restructure opel .
the magna-sberbank consortium had been set to receive a massive state aid package from germany to help along its restructuring plans . the german state support had been the subject of an eu investigation into whether the funds were linked to the maintenance of jobs in germany ahead of other european countries which host opel plants , a move which would have violated eu competition rules . juergen ruettgers , the state premier of north rhine-westphalia , where opel 's bochum plant is located , demanded that gm keep all its opel factories in germany running .
he told broadcaster zdf on wednesday that this should be a condition of any german state help . he also demanded that there be no operational redundancies in germany , and that any job cuts should be " socially responsible " .
ruettgers promised there would be no financial aid from north rhine-westphalia if the bochum plant were closed down .
" no-one can expect us to pay for the closure of the bochum factory , " he said . 3,000 opel workers are expected to appear at a demonstration on the bochum factory grounds on thursday afternoon .
the rally is being organized by industrial trade union ig metall , and production is expected to stop for its duration . ruettgers will speak at the demonstration , as will local social democrat party head hannelore kraft , and trade union leaders rainer einenkel and oliver burkhard . " germany 's decision " todd said the same rules would apply if gm applied to european governments for funding now it has decided not to sell opel .
the german government had confirmed to the eu that the money would have been available to any of the potential buyers , todd said , adding that it was not for the eu to tell germany what to do with its money now . " that is a matter for the german government , " he said .
" the commission can not suggest or oblige member states to give state aid ; we can however and do verify the conditions of any state aid that is given . " the commission insisted it is ready to facilitate discussions between gm and its european partners if needed . but now gm has backed away from a deal at the very last minute , it may be significantly harder to establish trust between the parties . author : nina-maria potts / mll / dfm editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite having only three points from their four champions league group games , and still without a win , stuttgart can now progress to the knockout stages of the competition without having to rely on other results .
their next game is away to glasgow rangers at ibrox .
if they win that , stuttgart 's final game at home against unirea on december 9 could well be the decider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jesus navas scored to give the hosts a first-half lead a goal at last stuttgart had not scored in their last three matches , and showed why when a great counter-attacking chance after two minutes was scuppered by a terrible pass from captain thomas hitzlsperger .
in response , jesus navas put the home team in front from their first opening in the 14th minute , which allowed seville to settle into cruise control for the remainder of the game .
seville played with the assurance that even a draw would ensure qualification and the knowledge they had never conceded to a german side in their home stadium .
but in the end stuttgart found reserves of determination that had gone missing in their season so far , and conjured an equalizer in the 79th minute with a deflected long range effort from zdravko kuzmanovic .
it was only their third goal in seven matches .
the germans then nearly got a winner in the closing minutes of the game , but seville held on for the point they needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus babbel has had little to celebrate recently getting loud " now we have it in our own hands , " said stuttgart manager markus babbel , under pressure to turn the club 's fortunes around , " the first half was a catastrophe , and inexplicable for me .
i had to get a bit loud in the interval .
after that we were braver and showed what we could do .
now we will do everything in our power to reach the last 16 . " they were aided by an inconclusive result in the other group game , in which glasgow rangers and romanian team unirea urziceni also drew 1-1 .
stuttgart are third in the group with three points , one ahead of rangers , and two behind unirea. bk / dpa / sid / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move is in response to a boycott of the trial by karadzic . the judges at the un war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia ordered a court-appointed counsel to represent karadzic in the event he continued to boycott the hearings .
the genocide trial began on october 26 but the accused did not appear , claiming he had not been given enough time to prepare his defense .
karadzic had been warned on four occasions that his continued boycott would result in the appointment of a counsel to represent him .
" the accused has indeed substantially and persistently obstructed the proper and expeditious conduct of his trial by refusing to attend the proceedings , " said the written decision imposing the legal counsel .
" the accused 's conduct has effectively brought the trial to a halt , which is evidently his purpose . "
the icc judges said karadzic would still be able to represent himself following the appointment of the legal counsel , but that if he continued his boycott of the proceedings when the trial resumes on march 1 , 2010 , then the legal counsel would step in .
karadzic currently has a legal team consisting of 20 mainly volunteer legal advisors , but would forfeit that privilege if he continues his boycott .
the un court has charged karadzic with 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his role in the 1992-1995 war in bosnia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 05.11.2009 gm 's decision to keep opel could create problems for merkel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new confidence in global strategies as german foreign minister guido westerwelle prepared for talks in the us expected to address gm 's surprise u-turn on the sale of opel , the government in berlin was still smarting on thursday from the shock . general motors ' decision to back out of selling its german-based opel unit has sparked a mix of fury and surprise among german politicians , with reaction reaching from condemnation of gm 's behavior as " entirely unacceptable , " to " shock and annoyance " at detroit 's move .
the announcement was certainly embarrassing for german chancellor angela merkel .
it came just hours after she gave a historic speech before a joint session of the us congress in washington .
the newly re-elected chancellor had invested a lot of political capital backing a deal for gm to sell its troubled european subsidiary to a consortium led by canada 's magna and its russian banking partner sberbank .
apart from being embarrassing , gm 's reversal has created a complicated situation for the chancellor and several german state premiers , said gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn and merkel biographer .
it is almost as if gm had mugged leading german politicians , he told deutsche welle .
and now , no one knows what will happen next .
gm needs cash to restructure opel while gm has already declared it will repay a 1.5 billion euro bridge loan the german government had granted in may to keep gm 's european operations alive during negotiations to find an investor , berlin has been non-committal about whether to offer gm fresh government aid to save thousands of jobs at german opel plants .
the us auto giant faces the question of how to come up with the three-billions euros it estimates it needs to restructure its european operations .
but langguth pointed out that the german federal government is deeply in debt , and needs to try and balance its budget .
“ at the moment , merkel does not have a lot of room for maneuvering , ” lagguth said .
german political leaders may be angry , bonn political scientist langguth said , but that was not necessarily true for german taxpayers who had been wondering why state help was needed for the rüsselsheim-based automaker and were not happy with the government 's policy on opel in the first place .
“ the taxpayers do n't like to pay the insolvencies of the big companies , while the state would normally do nothing for smaller and medium-sized companies when they are insolvent , ” langguth said .
merkel 's previous coalition government with the social democrats had made billions of euros in public funds available to prop up companies hit by the crisis . ”
angry opel workers protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of opel workers vent their anger in protests gm vice president john smith , meanwhile , said there was very little difference between the offers put forward by magna and what gm had in mind for opel .
gm announced it planned to cut about 10,000 jobs , almost a fifth of the workers employed by gm in europe .
meanwhile on thursday , thousands of opel employees in germany walked off their jobs to join mass rallyes in protest of gm 's decision . there are four opel plants in germany , but the future of the plant in bochum in north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- is likely to be of major concern for chancellor merkel .
the prospect of job losses at the plant in germany 's most populous state could cost her christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- party votes in state elections in nrw in may 2010 .
should the cdu lose power in the state , merkel 's government would no longer have a centre-right majority in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , and that would in turn allow opposition parties to block legislation .

the announcement was certainly embarrassing for german chancellor angela merkel .
it came just hours after she gave a historic speech before a joint session of the us congress in washington .
the newly re-elected chancellor had invested a lot of political capital backing a deal for gm to sell its troubled european subsidiary to a consortium led by canada 's magna and its russian banking partner sberbank .
apart from being embarrassing , gm 's reversal has created a complicated situation for the chancellor and several german state premiers , said gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn and merkel biographer .
it is almost as if gm had mugged leading german politicians , he told deutsche welle .
and now , no one knows what will happen next .
gm needs cash to restructure opel while gm has already declared it will repay a 1.5 billion euro bridge loan the german government had granted in may to keep gm 's european operations alive during negotiations to find an investor , berlin has been non-committal about whether to offer gm fresh government aid to save thousands of jobs at german opel plants .
the us auto giant faces the question of how to come up with the three-billions euros it estimates it needs to restructure its european operations .
but langguth pointed out that the german federal government is deeply in debt , and needs to try and balance its budget .
“ at the moment , merkel does not have a lot of room for maneuvering , ” lagguth said .
german political leaders may be angry , bonn political scientist langguth said , but that was not necessarily true for german taxpayers who had been wondering why state help was needed for the rüsselsheim-based automaker and were not happy with the government 's policy on opel in the first place .
“ the taxpayers do n't like to pay the insolvencies of the big companies , while the state would normally do nothing for smaller and medium-sized companies when they are insolvent , ” langguth said .
merkel 's previous coalition government with the social democrats had made billions of euros in public funds available to prop up companies hit by the crisis . ”
angry opel workers protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of opel workers vent their anger in protests gm vice president john smith , meanwhile , said there was very little difference between the offers put forward by magna and what gm had in mind for opel .
gm announced it planned to cut about 10,000 jobs , almost a fifth of the workers employed by gm in europe .
meanwhile on thursday , thousands of opel employees in germany walked off their jobs to join mass rallyes in protest of gm 's decision . there are four opel plants in germany , but the future of the plant in bochum in north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- is likely to be of major concern for chancellor merkel .
the prospect of job losses at the plant in germany 's most populous state could cost her christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- party votes in state elections in nrw in may 2010 .
should the cdu lose power in the state , merkel 's government would no longer have a centre-right majority in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , and that would in turn allow opposition parties to block legislation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 05.11.2009 top athlete escaped the gdr using his aquatic talents großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cold water was the biggest challenge in escaping not everyone in the former east germany waited until the wall came down to go west .
axel mitbauer , a member of the gdr national swim team , was the only top athlete to actually use his sport to flee east germany . axel mitbauer 's escape from the german democratic republic 20 years before the fall of the wall was one of the most spectacular ways people chose to flee then east germany . as a member of the gdr national swim team and a master in the 400-meter freestyle , he used his athletic talent to cut through the iron curtain .
on the night of august 17 , 1969 , the then 19-year-old mitbauer swam from the boltenhagen resort area on the baltic sea to luebeck 's bay area . " water is my element , " mitbauer said , reminiscing about his career .
" it 's been my companion , as it were , for the past 51 years , and i still love it . " petroleum jelly to keep out the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 600 athletes escaped the gdr but 40 years ago , crossing the border presented a challenge .
the baltic sea was an area many used in their attempts to flee east germany , and guards were always on the alert as a result .
mitbauer studied the guards ' habits for a week and learned that they turned off the search lights shortly once an hour to allow them to cool .
on august 17 , around 9 p.m. , he grabbed his chance and dove into the water .
as the lights were turned back on , he went under water again and swam 25 kilometers -lrb- 15.5 miles -rrb- . " i had one minute to cross both the first and second sandbanks , " he recalled .
" but the biggest problem was the very cold water .
swimming in it for four to six hours is quite difficult .
nowadays , people can use neoprene suits , but back then , the only thing we could do was smear vaseline all over our bodies . " the baltic sea was just 18 degrees celsius -lrb- 64 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- the night he fled .

on the night of august 17 , 1969 , the then 19-year-old mitbauer swam from the boltenhagen resort area on the baltic sea to luebeck 's bay area . " water is my element , " mitbauer said , reminiscing about his career .

axel mitbauer , a member of the gdr national swim team , was the only top athlete to actually use his sport to flee east germany . axel mitbauer 's escape from the german democratic republic 20 years before the fall of the wall was one of the most spectacular ways people chose to flee then east germany . as a member of the gdr national swim team and a master in the 400-meter freestyle , he used his athletic talent to cut through the iron curtain .
on the night of august 17 , 1969 , the then 19-year-old mitbauer swam from the boltenhagen resort area on the baltic sea to luebeck 's bay area . " water is my element , " mitbauer said , reminiscing about his career .
" it 's been my companion , as it were , for the past 51 years , and i still love it . " petroleum jelly to keep out the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 600 athletes escaped the gdr but 40 years ago , crossing the border presented a challenge .
the baltic sea was an area many used in their attempts to flee east germany , and guards were always on the alert as a result .
mitbauer studied the guards ' habits for a week and learned that they turned off the search lights shortly once an hour to allow them to cool .
on august 17 , around 9 p.m. , he grabbed his chance and dove into the water .
as the lights were turned back on , he went under water again and swam 25 kilometers -lrb- 15.5 miles -rrb- . " i had one minute to cross both the first and second sandbanks , " he recalled .
" but the biggest problem was the very cold water .
swimming in it for four to six hours is quite difficult .
nowadays , people can use neoprene suits , but back then , the only thing we could do was smear vaseline all over our bodies . " the baltic sea was just 18 degrees celsius -lrb- 64 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- the night he fled .
he used 30 tubes of petroleum jelly to protect himself against the cold . unhappy with life mitbauer said he was happy as an athlete in the gdr system , but he was n't pleased with life in the country .
when he traveled abroad for competitions , he also saw a huge discrepancy between reality and east german propaganda .
he said he felt his home country was a lawless state and realized early on that he wanted to leave - and that he could use his aquatic talents to do it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a divided east and west berlin " i basically used the east german system that promoted sports in the way it did to ultimately escape it and pursue my own goals , " he said . according to records kept by the former east german secret police , or stasi , more than 600 athletes escaped to the west by 1989 , the year the wall came down .
soccer player falko goetz , cyclist juergen kissner and coach joerg berger were some of them .
the stasi called referred to them as sports traitors . mitbauer 's frequent conversations with west german athletes during foreign competitions also aroused the suspicion of east german state security officials and he was even arrested before he fled .
they kept him in custody for seven weeks - in the stasi prison hohenschoenhausen in berlin .
he went through the gamut : solitary confinement , light deprivation , torture . planning his escape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parts of the wall have been turned into the open-air east side gallery but mitbauer divulged nothing and immediately began training for his escape in water holes at old coal-mining plants once he was released from prison .
yet even after fleeing to the west , mitbauer was still scared of the stasi . " of course i was scared , " he said .
" some people were killed after all .
others were drugged and dragged back to east germany .
someone even loosened the lug nuts on the wheels of my car once .
in the beginning , right after fleeing , i used to push a big cabinet in front of my apartment door . " still , once in the west , mitbauer quickly learned how to market himself .
he received 10,000 german marks back then from stern magazine for his personal story .
he certainly needed the money - considering that he started a new life nearly naked after his escape .
the only thing in his possession when he arrived on shore at travemuende were his swim trunks , his flippers , a ring sewed into one of them , and a medal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swimmer axel mitbauer -lrb- l -rrb- , as a coach later in life " i left at 9 p.m. at night and arrived at a buoy at around 1 o 'clock in the morning , " he recalled .
" i had wanted to spend the night on it , warm up from the sun the next morning and then swim on .
but a german ship ended up picking me up around 7 a.m. " it was a west german ship that took him to travemuende .
he was then taken to a reception camp in giessen , where he received identification documents .
stern journalists met him there and took him to hamburg , where he told them his story of escape . coaching fame mitbauer later studied sports education in cologne and worked as a coach in italy and switzerland .
he continues to live in switzerland and also coaches up-and-coming swim talents in karlsruhe , germany .
he 's coached swimming great jacques mayol , a frenchman , whose legendary two-man competition with italian enzo mairoca later appeared in the film " the big blue . " even today he said he understands why people in eastern and western germany do n't quite understand each other , even though the wall fell 20 years ago . " that gap will not be bridged until the next generation is at the fore - a generation that has grown up familiar only with a united germany , " he said .
" only then will the two sides have grown together into a unified whole . " author : marcus neu boelz -lrb- als -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 05.11.2009 european press review : good for opel but bad for the german government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of anxiety about opel the news that general motors would not sell off its european unit , opel , was greeted in european newspapers mostly with sympathy for the us carmaker 's business decision , but also with criticism of the german government . austria 's die presse from vienna noted that the response from germany 's political leaders ranged from " huffy to hopping mad " , but what actually happened , the paper asks ?
" gm had the gall to make the decision that was best for the company , " the paper writes . " after months of hemming and hawing , the americans are only partly to blame , " the paper says .
" the gm decision was only made possible after the european commission forced germany in october to offer any opel suitor the same financial conditions as magna .
for the german government , the whole rescue maneuver was a complete waste of effort . " like austria , spain is also a country that stands to lose jobs in the wake of an opel restructuring .
madrid 's el pais thinks that general motors " must provide a convincing explanation for its radical change of mind . " but , the paper notes , " the german government and opel 's works council also owe us a justification why they are so hostile toward gm .
the us company understands the auto business and has the experience - something that can not necessarily be said for magna and -lsb- its russian partner -rsb- sberbank . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general motors has decided not to sell opel russia also stands to lose important opel technology for its car industry following gm 's decision , but the moscow daily komsomolskaya pravda greeted the move with a shot of sarcasm . " oopps !
they did n't give us opel , " the paper writes .
" the situation recalls the old russian fairy tale of the grandfather and his cow .
in faraway germany , opel was a millstone for gm , but as soon as the new investor figured out how it could make the company profitable , gm thought maybe it could use this cow itself . " under the headline " detroit ex machina " , britain 's financial times argues that gm 's change of heart is good for the european car industry .
" general motors , a dinosaur only a year ago , has emerged phoenix-like from the ashes of bankruptcy , " the paper writes .
" continued gm ownership has benefits , " the paper says , because its " recent domestic transformation gives credibility to its plans for shrinking opel / vauxhall .
moreover , conditions on its bankruptcy financing prohibit it from subsidizing loss-making operations overseas . "
" gm is not bluffing , " the paper notes , " it must turn opel around . " the dutch daily de volkskrant provides a sober assessment of the circumstances , pointing out that " it was clear from the beginning that gm really did n't want to get rid of opel . "
" after all , " the paper says , " german leaders are not blind to the realities : opel factories will be closed one way or the other , regardless of whether magna or gm are the majority owners . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german newspapers reacted with dismay to the news not surprisingly , the news has also been very sobering for german newspapers .
the berlin-based tagesspiegel did n't mince words , calling it " an unprecedented effrontery , a disaster , a blow to us-german relations . " the paper fumed that it was " worse than the worst times under george bush junior and gerhard schroeder .
and so inexplicable that it triggers three feelings : pity , sorrow and rage . " the stuttgarter nachrichten comments with a hint of resignation .
opel , it writes , " will certainly have to shrink .
it will be painful and many jobs will be lost .
but , our policymakers could not have prevented it , no matter how many billions in taxpayer 's money are spent . " cologne 's rundschau daily calls it " an embarrassing lesson " for germany 's leaders .
the paper said it hopes that the state will avoid becoming bogged down with struggling companies in the future .
" if gm knocks on the door in berlin asking for state aid , the answer can only be a clear and resounding no " , it says emphatically .
" if general motors needs opel so urgently for its own strategic restructuring , as it claims , then its european subsidiary ought to be worth the billions needed to get it back on its feet , " the paper concludes . gb / dpa / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de general motors plans huge job cuts at european unit opel us auto giant general motors says its planned restructuring of opel would involve massive job cuts .
the announcement follows a decision by gm not to sell off the carmaker to canadian car-parts maker magna .
-lrb- 05.11.2009 -rrb- surprise and anger greet gm decision to keep opel political leaders and employees expressed dismay and surprise at the announcement by us carmaker general motors not to sell its european unit , opel .
-lrb- 04.11.2009 -rrb- should germany be surprised by gm 's opel decision ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 05.11.2009 european press review : good for opel but bad for the german government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of anxiety about opel the news that general motors would not sell off its european unit , opel , was greeted in european newspapers mostly with sympathy for the us carmaker 's business decision , but also with criticism of the german government . austria 's die presse from vienna noted that the response from germany 's political leaders ranged from " huffy to hopping mad " , but what actually happened , the paper asks ?
" gm had the gall to make the decision that was best for the company , " the paper writes . " after months of hemming and hawing , the americans are only partly to blame , " the paper says .
" the gm decision was only made possible after the european commission forced germany in october to offer any opel suitor the same financial conditions as magna .
for the german government , the whole rescue maneuver was a complete waste of effort . " like austria , spain is also a country that stands to lose jobs in the wake of an opel restructuring .
madrid 's el pais thinks that general motors " must provide a convincing explanation for its radical change of mind . " but , the paper notes , " the german government and opel 's works council also owe us a justification why they are so hostile toward gm .
the us company understands the auto business and has the experience - something that can not necessarily be said for magna and -lsb- its russian partner -rsb- sberbank . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general motors has decided not to sell opel russia also stands to lose important opel technology for its car industry following gm 's decision , but the moscow daily komsomolskaya pravda greeted the move with a shot of sarcasm . " oopps !
they did n't give us opel , " the paper writes .
" the situation recalls the old russian fairy tale of the grandfather and his cow .
in faraway germany , opel was a millstone for gm , but as soon as the new investor figured out how it could make the company profitable , gm thought maybe it could use this cow itself . " under the headline " detroit ex machina " , britain 's financial times argues that gm 's change of heart is good for the european car industry .
" general motors , a dinosaur only a year ago , has emerged phoenix-like from the ashes of bankruptcy , " the paper writes .
" continued gm ownership has benefits , " the paper says , because its " recent domestic transformation gives credibility to its plans for shrinking opel / vauxhall .
moreover , conditions on its bankruptcy financing prohibit it from subsidizing loss-making operations overseas . "
" gm is not bluffing , " the paper notes , " it must turn opel around . " the dutch daily de volkskrant provides a sober assessment of the circumstances , pointing out that " it was clear from the beginning that gm really did n't want to get rid of opel . "
" after all , " the paper says , " german leaders are not blind to the realities : opel factories will be closed one way or the other , regardless of whether magna or gm are the majority owners . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german newspapers reacted with dismay to the news not surprisingly , the news has also been very sobering for german newspapers .
the berlin-based tagesspiegel did n't mince words , calling it " an unprecedented effrontery , a disaster , a blow to us-german relations . " the paper fumed that it was " worse than the worst times under george bush junior and gerhard schroeder .
and so inexplicable that it triggers three feelings : pity , sorrow and rage . " the stuttgarter nachrichten comments with a hint of resignation .
opel , it writes , " will certainly have to shrink .
it will be painful and many jobs will be lost .
but , our policymakers could not have prevented it , no matter how many billions in taxpayer 's money are spent . " cologne 's rundschau daily calls it " an embarrassing lesson " for germany 's leaders .
the paper said it hopes that the state will avoid becoming bogged down with struggling companies in the future .
" if gm knocks on the door in berlin asking for state aid , the answer can only be a clear and resounding no " , it says emphatically .
" if general motors needs opel so urgently for its own strategic restructuring , as it claims , then its european subsidiary ought to be worth the billions needed to get it back on its feet , " the paper concludes . gb / dpa / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de general motors plans huge job cuts at european unit opel us auto giant general motors says its planned restructuring of opel would involve massive job cuts .

under that pact , germans pay an income-dependent amount of their earnings towards improving infrastructure in the east .
klaus heiner roehl , a regional policy analyst at the cologne-based institute , said this is partly a matter of statistics and the ironic fact that the global economic crisis has hit germany 's western states harder than its eastern states .
" of course the economic crisis has affected eastern germany too , but to a smaller extent than western germany , " he told deutsche welle .
" this is because the big export companies are located in the western part of the country and this year , the convergence will be even faster than in the last year because the western german economy will shrink about 5 percent while with the eastern german economy , the negative growth is about 3 percent . "
the institute 's study shows that the eastern states lose half a percent of their population to western states each year , a fact that is often overlooked .
despite this however , annual growth in the eastern states is half a percent higher than growth in the western states .
east-west divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germans flooded into the west after the fall of the berlin wall these findings contradict the more populist belief that , even after 19 years of reunification , eastern germany is floundering not only economically but also psychologically .
reiner eckert , director of the forum of contemporary history in leipzig , told deutsche welle that the peaceful revolution of the late ' 80s had achieved its ideals of democracy , freedom and unity in a reunited germany , but that problems remained between the two halves .
" the cities have adapted well and have developed their infrastructure , but there are still deficits , and in some ways , some of the pride in the peaceful revolution has evaporated , " he said .
" basically this has to do with the fact that amongst germans living in the eastern states , there is a feeling that they have not yet ‘ arrived ' and are still perceived as second-class citizens . "
east catching up although there are stark differences between development in cities and rural areas in the eastern states , roehl said that statistics for the east as a whole indicate that per capita gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- could reach 80 percent of those in the west of the country by 2020 .
this means that by then , some of the wealthiest eastern states could have overtaken some of their poorest western counterparts , another indicator that the time of the solidarity pact may have passed .
" the solidarity pact will continue to 2019 but from this -lrb- year -rrb- onwards … the amount of money is reduced year per year , " said roehl .
" and it is quite right to do it that way and we think it is also right that the solidarity pact will end in 2019 . "
roehl added that the iw institute 's findings could lead to increased resentment amongst many germans in the western part of the country at having to pay the solidarity tax .
" there is always some resentment on the side of the paying state , and also some resentment in the east that the solidarity pact will end , " he said .

" there is always some resentment on the side of the paying state , and also some resentment in the east that the solidarity pact will end , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 05.11.2009 eastern germany catching up to west " faster than thought " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern german cities like dresden are catching up to western cities a recent study suggests that the economies of germany ’ s eastern states , once under the gdr 's communist regime , may be catching up to those of their western counterparts faster than previously thought . according to the iw german economic research institute , standards of living in the east have soared so much that the german solidarity pact may not be needed after its scheduled expiry date in 2019 .
under that pact , germans pay an income-dependent amount of their earnings towards improving infrastructure in the east .
klaus heiner roehl , a regional policy analyst at the cologne-based institute , said this is partly a matter of statistics and the ironic fact that the global economic crisis has hit germany 's western states harder than its eastern states .
" of course the economic crisis has affected eastern germany too , but to a smaller extent than western germany , " he told deutsche welle .
" this is because the big export companies are located in the western part of the country and this year , the convergence will be even faster than in the last year because the western german economy will shrink about 5 percent while with the eastern german economy , the negative growth is about 3 percent . "
the institute 's study shows that the eastern states lose half a percent of their population to western states each year , a fact that is often overlooked .
despite this however , annual growth in the eastern states is half a percent higher than growth in the western states .
east-west divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germans flooded into the west after the fall of the berlin wall these findings contradict the more populist belief that , even after 19 years of reunification , eastern germany is floundering not only economically but also psychologically .
reiner eckert , director of the forum of contemporary history in leipzig , told deutsche welle that the peaceful revolution of the late ' 80s had achieved its ideals of democracy , freedom and unity in a reunited germany , but that problems remained between the two halves .
" the cities have adapted well and have developed their infrastructure , but there are still deficits , and in some ways , some of the pride in the peaceful revolution has evaporated , " he said .
" basically this has to do with the fact that amongst germans living in the eastern states , there is a feeling that they have not yet ‘ arrived ' and are still perceived as second-class citizens . "
east catching up although there are stark differences between development in cities and rural areas in the eastern states , roehl said that statistics for the east as a whole indicate that per capita gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- could reach 80 percent of those in the west of the country by 2020 .
this means that by then , some of the wealthiest eastern states could have overtaken some of their poorest western counterparts , another indicator that the time of the solidarity pact may have passed .
" the solidarity pact will continue to 2019 but from this -lrb- year -rrb- onwards … the amount of money is reduced year per year , " said roehl .
" and it is quite right to do it that way and we think it is also right that the solidarity pact will end in 2019 . "
roehl added that the iw institute 's findings could lead to increased resentment amongst many germans in the western part of the country at having to pay the solidarity tax .
" there is always some resentment on the side of the paying state , and also some resentment in the east that the solidarity pact will end , " he said .

dan mcnorton , a un spokesman , said the relocations would involve mostly workers without " essential " responsibilities .
" the only people who will remain are regarded as essential staff , " he said , adding that this would be to ensure the safety of all other un staff in afghanistan .
direct link to taliban attack the move comes eight days after an attack on a guesthouse in kabul used by the un , in which five of its workers were killed .
the taliban claimed responsibility for that attack , which saw taliban members storm into the bekhtar house with machine guns after a bomb went off outside .
two afghan security officers were also killed in the gunfire , along with three of the attackers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the october attack was the most severe on a un building in afghanistan un secretary general ban ki-moon held talks with security advisors in kabul earlier this week to asses the situation after the attack , which was the most severe in the organization 's fifty year history in afghanistan .
at present , the un has 5,600 staff in afghanistan , including 1,100 international workers .
speaking in the afghan capital on monday , ban said the un was not daunted by acts of violence and that it would remain in the war-torn country .
" there has been speculation that the united nations will evacuate afghanistan .
we will not be deterred , can not be deterred and must not be deterred and the work of the united nations will continue , " said ban .
in a statement , the un said the relocations were a temporary measure " while additional security was being put in place . "

about $ 3 million , when the sport is basketball , the subject is sneakers , and the name is jordan . marcus jordan clearly wants to walk in his father 's shoes .
but doing so has turned out to be harder than he thought - in fact , it 's turned into a diss of million-dollar proportions .
on wednesday , the university of central florida and german sporting-goods company adidas learned the hard way that blood is sometimes thicker than even a massive wad of money , when the son of legendary chicago bulls guard michael jordan stepped into a pair of nikes instead of adidas basketball shoes , as planned .
now , the fight over what shoes marcus jordan can wear when he plays basketball for ucf means the school may have lost a $ 3-million-dollar sponsorship deal with adidas .
marcus wore a pair of white air jordans - the nike shoe made famous by his father - during an exhibition game between ucf and st. leo on wednesday night , the orlando sentinel reported .
but ucf is in the final year of a five-year contract with adidas that requires coaches and athletes to use the company 's apparel and equipment , which is distinctively marked with three black stripes .
deal or no deal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas shoes bear the company 's three-stripe logo regional adidas representatives say they had made a deal with the university to allow marcus jordan to wear the plain white nikes , but adidas higher-ups later begged to differ .
now , they say they will pull their funding .
adidas was seemingly unmoved by the fact that marcus wore black ankle cuffs distintively marked with the adidas logo , on top of his nikes .
in correspondence published by the associated press , a spokeswoman for adidas said the school has " chosen not to deliver on their contractual commitment to adidas , " and that , in turn , the company will not continue its relationship with the school .
the news has not been officially given to ucf yet , however .
while the school said it was " disappointed " by the possible loss of funding , ucf spokesman joe hornstein said they would respond further " once we receive official notice . " meanwhile , the sting of the loss may have been offset by the win in the exhibition game , where ucf beat st. leo , 84 to 65. jen / ap / afp / reuters editor : deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

children are very susceptible to the disease and die at a rate of one every 30 seconds . scientists from throughout the world are meeting in nairobi to consider new research and treatments that may help eradicate malaria .
the disease poses a serious health threat in africa , but a promising new treatment is on the horizon . the treatment is a vaccine called rtss and has been tested for 20 years by scientists in africa .
experts hope that its effectiveness will be confirmed within three years , following the evaluation of field trials with infected children . the best results to date kenyan pediatrician walter otieno confirmed the significance of scientists ' recent research into treating malaria . " it is the first time that a vaccine against malaria has made it to the third and final testing phase , " he said .
" if it succeeds here , then the vaccine is ready for the market .
we are confident that in three to five years we will have an effective treatment that can be combined with other vaccinations to treat kids . " to date , the vaccine has shown promising results .
in the second testing phase , more than half of the children who received the vaccination no longer suffered severely from the mosquito-borne disease .
rtss has produced better results than any previous malaria treatment but still does not offer complete protection .

" people are bitten nearly every day by mosquitoes bearing the disease .
seven out of 10 children are brought to our hospital because of malaria . " mothers with their babies often fill the waiting rooms of the medical research center in kombewa , kenya .
they hope their children can take part in rtss trials . " we keep having problems with malaria in our family , " said patricia mrunde , a mother of six , was recently among those seeking a vaccination for her daughter .
" a few weeks ago , my oldest son experienced a high fever as part of an outbreak .
when an outbreak is especially bad , his whole body jerks and cramps uncontrollably . " the mothers whose children take part in the trial swill not know whether their children will receive placebo injections or injections containing the anti-malaria vaccine . nevertheless , mrunde said she is still optimistic . " my daughter already had stomach pain and diarrhea after her first injection , " she said .

about $ 3 million , when the sport is basketball , the subject is sneakers , and the name is jordan . marcus jordan clearly wants to walk in his father 's shoes .
but doing so has turned out to be harder than he thought - in fact , it 's turned into a diss of million-dollar proportions .
on wednesday , the university of central florida and german sporting-goods company adidas learned the hard way that blood is sometimes thicker than even a massive wad of money , when the son of legendary chicago bulls guard michael jordan stepped into a pair of nikes instead of adidas basketball shoes , as planned .
now , the fight over what shoes marcus jordan can wear when he plays basketball for ucf means the school may have lost a $ 3-million-dollar sponsorship deal with adidas .
marcus wore a pair of white air jordans - the nike shoe made famous by his father - during an exhibition game between ucf and st. leo on wednesday night , the orlando sentinel reported .
but ucf is in the final year of a five-year contract with adidas that requires coaches and athletes to use the company 's apparel and equipment , which is distinctively marked with three black stripes .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas shoes bear the company 's three-stripe logo regional adidas representatives say they had made a deal with the university to allow marcus jordan to wear the plain white nikes , but adidas higher-ups later begged to differ .
now , they say they will pull their funding .
adidas was seemingly unmoved by the fact that marcus wore black ankle cuffs distintively marked with the adidas logo , on top of his nikes .
in correspondence published by the associated press , a spokeswoman for adidas said the school has " chosen not to deliver on their contractual commitment to adidas , " and that , in turn , the company will not continue its relationship with the school .
the news has not been officially given to ucf yet , however .
while the school said it was " disappointed " by the possible loss of funding , ucf spokesman joe hornstein said they would respond further " once we receive official notice .

gun battles , suicide bombings , and outdated or heavily damaged infrastructure have taken their toll on reconstruction efforts .
although iraq receives millions of euros in development aid , putting the country together again also requires foreign private investment .
the iraq investment and business forum , a two-day conference for german and iraqi investors , began on thursday in berlin .
sponsored by germany 's foreign office and the arab-german chamber of commerce and industry , among others , it comes on the heels of a similar conference in washington held last month , and in the midst of the 10-day baghdad international fair taking place from november 1-10 in iraq 's capital .
last november , iraqi finance minister bayan jabr estimated that iraq would need $ 400 billion -lrb- 270 billion euros -rrb- to rebuild , a figure that would be beyond the country 's reach without foreign investment .
the 2010 budget approved in october was just $ 67 billion .
forum organizers were expecting about 200 german entrepreneurs and 100 of their iraqi counterparts .
newly installed german economics minister rainer bruederle was also expected to attend .
abdulaziz al-mikhlafi , the general secretary of the arab-german chamber of commerce and industry , told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper that iraq was ripe for investment in sectors ranging from airports and highways to universities and the water supply .
" we will present a detailed picture of about 500 projects that iraq can only undertake with foreign support , " al-mikhlafi said .
" getting in on the ground floor " germany 's economic connection to iraq is growing .
german exports to iraq in the first half of this year were up by 96.2 percent compared to january to june 2008 , the organizers told afp .
machinery and vehicles account for most of the nearly 300 million euros -lrb- $ 446 million -rrb- in exports .
" the germans should make their move , " al-mikhlafi said .
" many others are already there - the french , koreans , chinese , japanese . "
the same advice was offered to the uk when it hosted the invest iraq 2009 conference in may . iraq 's deputy prime minister barham salih called on uk firms to recognize the potential his country holds for investors , telling them there was a " unique opportunity to get in on the ground floor of the new iraq . "
the british government sent several ministers to speak at the event as well , as if to demonstrate how seriously it takes the matter , and how badly it wants to encourage trading with iraq .
but have uk firms heeded the call ?
british trade with iraq is certainly on the increase : uk exports of services to the country were worth 273 million pounds -lrb- around 300 million euros -rrb- in 2007 , and 433 million pounds -lrb- around 480 million euros -rrb- in 2008 .
and uk exports of goods to iraq were up 6 percent in 2009 between january and july , compared to the same period last year .
but many say it 's still not enough .
according to mostafa bazergan of the iraqi british business and investment council , british companies are being left behind by international rivals when it comes to investing in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and gas are still predominant parts of the economy , but other areas also need investment " personally i criticize the british companies .
german companies , australian , italians - they are there , before the british companies .
i wonder when they will realize this is a mistake and they should correct it , " bazergan said .
“ brits are moving in , little by little ” but michael thomas , director general of the london-based middle east association , says british companies are moving into iraq .
a short while ago he arrived back from iraq on the largest uk trade mission ever to visit the country .
he traveled with british business leaders and was granted audiences with several iraqi government ministers keen to talk about opportunities for increased trade .
thomas insists british companies are already on the ground , investing .
“ oil and gas is moving ahead quite nicely , " thomas said .
" bp -lsb- british petroleum -rsb- have got a big deal down in the south with the chinese .
shell are also there .
penspen , a big pipeline company , are there .
we 've got a huge number of british companies there at the moment - little by little the brits are moving in . "
but thomas admits the brits might be moving in more slowly than competitors when it comes to investing in iraq , preferring to spend time building business relationships .
" it takes a bit longer , we do n't rush in madly , but once we 're there , we 're there for the long haul , " thomas said most of the british companies already in iraq are oil and gas firms - that sector is already proving very lucrative for uk business .
the hope is now that other british industries will move in - although security issues remain an overriding and often prohibitive concern . beyond gas and oil the uk government is now keen to encourage investment in iraq , having played a large role in the 2003 invasion of the country .
not only to help with its rebuilding and economic growth , but also because of the potential for money to be made for british firms .
investment is growing , and there have been notable successes already . thomas and bazergan agree that the opportunities for business investment in iraq are wide and plentiful , in industries including telecommunications , industry , agriculture , housing , water , waste water , and electricity .
thomas insists the list of services that british companies could be supplying to iraq is " absolutely endless . "

the same advice was offered to the uk when it hosted the invest iraq 2009 conference in may . iraq 's deputy prime minister barham salih called on uk firms to recognize the potential his country holds for investors , telling them there was a " unique opportunity to get in on the ground floor of the new iraq . "
the british government sent several ministers to speak at the event as well , as if to demonstrate how seriously it takes the matter , and how badly it wants to encourage trading with iraq .
but have uk firms heeded the call ?
british trade with iraq is certainly on the increase : uk exports of services to the country were worth 273 million pounds -lrb- around 300 million euros -rrb- in 2007 , and 433 million pounds -lrb- around 480 million euros -rrb- in 2008 .
and uk exports of goods to iraq were up 6 percent in 2009 between january and july , compared to the same period last year .
but many say it 's still not enough .
according to mostafa bazergan of the iraqi british business and investment council , british companies are being left behind by international rivals when it comes to investing in iraq .

german companies , australian , italians - they are there , before the british companies .

“ brits are moving in , little by little ” but michael thomas , director general of the london-based middle east association , says british companies are moving into iraq .
a short while ago he arrived back from iraq on the largest uk trade mission ever to visit the country .
he traveled with british business leaders and was granted audiences with several iraqi government ministers keen to talk about opportunities for increased trade .

gun battles , suicide bombings , and outdated or heavily damaged infrastructure have taken their toll on reconstruction efforts .
although iraq receives millions of euros in development aid , putting the country together again also requires foreign private investment .
the iraq investment and business forum , a two-day conference for german and iraqi investors , began on thursday in berlin .
sponsored by germany 's foreign office and the arab-german chamber of commerce and industry , among others , it comes on the heels of a similar conference in washington held last month , and in the midst of the 10-day baghdad international fair taking place from november 1-10 in iraq 's capital .
last november , iraqi finance minister bayan jabr estimated that iraq would need $ 400 billion -lrb- 270 billion euros -rrb- to rebuild , a figure that would be beyond the country 's reach without foreign investment .
the 2010 budget approved in october was just $ 67 billion .
forum organizers were expecting about 200 german entrepreneurs and 100 of their iraqi counterparts .
newly installed german economics minister rainer bruederle was also expected to attend .
abdulaziz al-mikhlafi , the general secretary of the arab-german chamber of commerce and industry , told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper that iraq was ripe for investment in sectors ranging from airports and highways to universities and the water supply .
" we will present a detailed picture of about 500 projects that iraq can only undertake with foreign support , " al-mikhlafi said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de india -pipe- 05.11.2009 european union 's relations to india growing in intensity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts foresee a continued warming of relations between the european union and india the eu and india will focus on pushing their free trade pact during their 10th annual summit in new delhi on friday .
but other significant issues are also on the agenda , though the two sides do n't always see eye-to-eye . a major sticking point at the eu-india summit is the planned free trade agreement -lrb- fta -rrb- between the two sides .
daniele smadja , head of the european commission 's delegation to india , said on wednesday that the talks needed a boost .
" the fta negotiations are very complex , " smadja said .
" we have to jump into the cold water of give and take . "
the time had come to exchange concessions , she said .
but clemens spiess , a lecturer at the south asia institute at the university of heidelberg , said he did not expect a final agreement to be reached .
" there are still a lot of hurdles , " spiess told deutsche welle .
these include intellectual property rights disputes and tariff disagreements .
he said he did not expect fta talks to conclude successfully until 2010 or 2011 .
security has become a common challenge in the past , the eu 's relations to india have focused primarily on trade and economic issues .
this comes as no surprise , as the eu is india 's largest trading partner .
graham watson , chairman of the european parliament delegation for relations with india , said trade has more than doubled between the two partners over the past five years .
according to parliament figures , bilateral trade is expected to exceed 70.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 104.5 billion -rrb- by 2010 and 160.6 billion euros by 2015 .
" clearly it 's mainly in the trade area that we want to talk , but we also recognize on both sides that we have a common challenge in promoting peace and comprehensive security , " watson told deutsche welle .
a security dialogue has been in place since 2006 .
the eu not only recognized india 's role as a force of stability in a volatile region , but also as one of the few democracies in the region , he said .
" democracy gives india a huge advantage over china in the medium and long-term , " watson said .
" it makes it far easier for the eu to deal with india , not least because once a decision is taken it represents a consensus of opinion and therefore to be stuck to . "
this perception was n't always the case , though , said rajendra k jain , professor and former chairman of the center for european studies at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many westerners were also taken hostage in mumbai , such as at the taj hotel " the eu never viewed india as an important security partner halfway around the world because their issues and priorities were very different , " jain said in an interview with deutsche welle .
but this changed after the terrorist attacks in mumbai last november .
the eu recognized that india was a significant player in anti-terrorism collaboration .
however , jain said the structure of the eu did not allow for too much optimism in what could be possibly achieved in this area .
" the eu is a very strange political creature , " jain said .
" we should not have too high expectations of what is going to be possible in the realm of security cooperation because insofar as intelligence is concerned , it is a very sensitive issue and not the competence of the european union .
that is clearly with the member states . "
security in particular played a more central role in india 's relations to the united states , spiess said .
" a problem is the interaction between one country , india , on the one side and the 27-member state community , " spiess said .
" we all know there is no such thing as a consistent eu foreign policy , and security policy is now the domain of us-indo relations , which overshadows india 's interactions with the eu in terms of security relations . "
india wo n't succumb to climate pressure with the un conference in copenhagen just a few weeks away , climate change will also be a point of debate in new delhi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is also significantly affecting india " the western countries are pressuring india to join the fight against climate change more thoroughly , " spiess said .
" but india under no circumstances will accept any sort of legally binding reductions on its future greenhouse gas emissions trajectory . "
new delhi is resisting any binding emission cuts and demanding finance and technology from wealthy countries to help reduce emissions .
but there are other areas in which the two sides cooperate closely , such as energy , technology transfer , science and academic cooperation .
at this week 's summit , a cooperation agreement between the european atomic energy community euratom and india will be signed in the field of fusion energy research .
representatives will also launch a call for proposals for research in the field of solar energy , the european commission said .
" there 's plenty there for our leaders to get their teeth into , " watson said .
" the question is : where can we best find areas where we can make progress together and where there 's a real added value in cooperation . "
an equal partnership ?
for the eu , experts agreed , india is certainly an international partner to be taken seriously .
this was evident from the strategic partnership agreement in 2004 and the joint action plan in 2005 , revised in 2008 , which aims to deepen dialogue and cooperation .
" the eu does n't identify too many countries in the world with which they will enter into strategic partnerships , " said spiess .
" from the perspective of the eu , it 's crystal clear that india is identified as a stabilizing factor in the region and as a growing global player .
that 's why it 's a partner to count on . "
but it would go too far to say india was an equal partner , said christian wagner from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" for the eu , india is a developing country , " wagner told deutsche welle .
" the lion 's share of eu resources allocated to india in the next years deal with development goals . "
eu support is earmarked for helping india achieve the un millennium development goals , he said .
with respect to sentiments from new delhi , jain said there has been a shift in perception - despite the strong emphasis on trade and economic issues in the relationship .
" i think there has been a perceptible change in recent years and growing recognition among indian policymakers about the importance of the european union in world affairs , " jain said .

despite having only three points from their four champions league group games , and still without a win , stuttgart can now progress to the knockout stages of the competition without having to rely on other results .
their next game is away to glasgow rangers at ibrox .
if they win that , stuttgart 's final game at home against unirea on december 9 could well be the decider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jesus navas scored to give the hosts a first-half lead a goal at last stuttgart had not scored in their last three matches , and showed why when a great counter-attacking chance after two minutes was scuppered by a terrible pass from captain thomas hitzlsperger .
in response , jesus navas put the home team in front from their first opening in the 14th minute , which allowed seville to settle into cruise control for the remainder of the game .
seville played with the assurance that even a draw would ensure qualification and the knowledge they had never conceded to a german side in their home stadium .
but in the end stuttgart found reserves of determination that had gone missing in their season so far , and conjured an equalizer in the 79th minute with a deflected long range effort from zdravko kuzmanovic .
it was only their third goal in seven matches .
the germans then nearly got a winner in the closing minutes of the game , but seville held on for the point they needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus babbel has had little to celebrate recently getting loud " now we have it in our own hands , " said stuttgart manager markus babbel , under pressure to turn the club 's fortunes around , " the first half was a catastrophe , and inexplicable for me .
i had to get a bit loud in the interval .
after that we were braver and showed what we could do .
now we will do everything in our power to reach the last 16 . " they were aided by an inconclusive result in the other group game , in which glasgow rangers and romanian team unirea urziceni also drew 1-1 .
stuttgart are third in the group with three points , one ahead of rangers , and two behind unirea. bk / dpa / sid / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 05.11.2009 eastern germany catching up to west " faster than thought " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern german cities like dresden are catching up to western cities a recent study suggests that the economies of germany ’ s eastern states , once under the gdr 's communist regime , may be catching up to those of their western counterparts faster than previously thought . according to the iw german economic research institute , standards of living in the east have soared so much that the german solidarity pact may not be needed after its scheduled expiry date in 2019 .
under that pact , germans pay an income-dependent amount of their earnings towards improving infrastructure in the east .
klaus heiner roehl , a regional policy analyst at the cologne-based institute , said this is partly a matter of statistics and the ironic fact that the global economic crisis has hit germany 's western states harder than its eastern states .
" of course the economic crisis has affected eastern germany too , but to a smaller extent than western germany , " he told deutsche welle .
" this is because the big export companies are located in the western part of the country and this year , the convergence will be even faster than in the last year because the western german economy will shrink about 5 percent while with the eastern german economy , the negative growth is about 3 percent . "
the institute 's study shows that the eastern states lose half a percent of their population to western states each year , a fact that is often overlooked .
despite this however , annual growth in the eastern states is half a percent higher than growth in the western states .
east-west divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germans flooded into the west after the fall of the berlin wall these findings contradict the more populist belief that , even after 19 years of reunification , eastern germany is floundering not only economically but also psychologically .
reiner eckert , director of the forum of contemporary history in leipzig , told deutsche welle that the peaceful revolution of the late ' 80s had achieved its ideals of democracy , freedom and unity in a reunited germany , but that problems remained between the two halves .
" the cities have adapted well and have developed their infrastructure , but there are still deficits , and in some ways , some of the pride in the peaceful revolution has evaporated , " he said .
" basically this has to do with the fact that amongst germans living in the eastern states , there is a feeling that they have not yet ‘ arrived ' and are still perceived as second-class citizens . "
east catching up although there are stark differences between development in cities and rural areas in the eastern states , roehl said that statistics for the east as a whole indicate that per capita gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- could reach 80 percent of those in the west of the country by 2020 .
this means that by then , some of the wealthiest eastern states could have overtaken some of their poorest western counterparts , another indicator that the time of the solidarity pact may have passed .
" the solidarity pact will continue to 2019 but from this -lrb- year -rrb- onwards … the amount of money is reduced year per year , " said roehl .
" and it is quite right to do it that way and we think it is also right that the solidarity pact will end in 2019 . "
roehl added that the iw institute 's findings could lead to increased resentment amongst many germans in the western part of the country at having to pay the solidarity tax .
" there is always some resentment on the side of the paying state , and also some resentment in the east that the solidarity pact will end , " he said .

about $ 3 million , when the sport is basketball , the subject is sneakers , and the name is jordan . marcus jordan clearly wants to walk in his father 's shoes .
but doing so has turned out to be harder than he thought - in fact , it 's turned into a diss of million-dollar proportions .
on wednesday , the university of central florida and german sporting-goods company adidas learned the hard way that blood is sometimes thicker than even a massive wad of money , when the son of legendary chicago bulls guard michael jordan stepped into a pair of nikes instead of adidas basketball shoes , as planned .
now , the fight over what shoes marcus jordan can wear when he plays basketball for ucf means the school may have lost a $ 3-million-dollar sponsorship deal with adidas .
marcus wore a pair of white air jordans - the nike shoe made famous by his father - during an exhibition game between ucf and st. leo on wednesday night , the orlando sentinel reported .
but ucf is in the final year of a five-year contract with adidas that requires coaches and athletes to use the company 's apparel and equipment , which is distinctively marked with three black stripes .
deal or no deal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas shoes bear the company 's three-stripe logo regional adidas representatives say they had made a deal with the university to allow marcus jordan to wear the plain white nikes , but adidas higher-ups later begged to differ .
now , they say they will pull their funding .
adidas was seemingly unmoved by the fact that marcus wore black ankle cuffs distintively marked with the adidas logo , on top of his nikes .
in correspondence published by the associated press , a spokeswoman for adidas said the school has " chosen not to deliver on their contractual commitment to adidas , " and that , in turn , the company will not continue its relationship with the school .
the news has not been officially given to ucf yet , however .
while the school said it was " disappointed " by the possible loss of funding , ucf spokesman joe hornstein said they would respond further " once we receive official notice . " meanwhile , the sting of the loss may have been offset by the win in the exhibition game , where ucf beat st. leo , 84 to 65. jen / ap / afp / reuters editor : deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 05.11.2009 top athlete escaped the gdr using his aquatic talents großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cold water was the biggest challenge in escaping not everyone in the former east germany waited until the wall came down to go west .
axel mitbauer , a member of the gdr national swim team , was the only top athlete to actually use his sport to flee east germany . axel mitbauer 's escape from the german democratic republic 20 years before the fall of the wall was one of the most spectacular ways people chose to flee then east germany . as a member of the gdr national swim team and a master in the 400-meter freestyle , he used his athletic talent to cut through the iron curtain .
on the night of august 17 , 1969 , the then 19-year-old mitbauer swam from the boltenhagen resort area on the baltic sea to luebeck 's bay area . " water is my element , " mitbauer said , reminiscing about his career .
" it 's been my companion , as it were , for the past 51 years , and i still love it . " petroleum jelly to keep out the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 600 athletes escaped the gdr but 40 years ago , crossing the border presented a challenge .
the baltic sea was an area many used in their attempts to flee east germany , and guards were always on the alert as a result .
mitbauer studied the guards ' habits for a week and learned that they turned off the search lights shortly once an hour to allow them to cool .
on august 17 , around 9 p.m. , he grabbed his chance and dove into the water .
as the lights were turned back on , he went under water again and swam 25 kilometers -lrb- 15.5 miles -rrb- . " i had one minute to cross both the first and second sandbanks , " he recalled .
" but the biggest problem was the very cold water .
swimming in it for four to six hours is quite difficult .
nowadays , people can use neoprene suits , but back then , the only thing we could do was smear vaseline all over our bodies . " the baltic sea was just 18 degrees celsius -lrb- 64 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- the night he fled .
he used 30 tubes of petroleum jelly to protect himself against the cold . unhappy with life mitbauer said he was happy as an athlete in the gdr system , but he was n't pleased with life in the country .
when he traveled abroad for competitions , he also saw a huge discrepancy between reality and east german propaganda .
he said he felt his home country was a lawless state and realized early on that he wanted to leave - and that he could use his aquatic talents to do it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a divided east and west berlin " i basically used the east german system that promoted sports in the way it did to ultimately escape it and pursue my own goals , " he said . according to records kept by the former east german secret police , or stasi , more than 600 athletes escaped to the west by 1989 , the year the wall came down .
soccer player falko goetz , cyclist juergen kissner and coach joerg berger were some of them .
the stasi called referred to them as sports traitors . mitbauer 's frequent conversations with west german athletes during foreign competitions also aroused the suspicion of east german state security officials and he was even arrested before he fled .
they kept him in custody for seven weeks - in the stasi prison hohenschoenhausen in berlin .
he went through the gamut : solitary confinement , light deprivation , torture . planning his escape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parts of the wall have been turned into the open-air east side gallery but mitbauer divulged nothing and immediately began training for his escape in water holes at old coal-mining plants once he was released from prison .
yet even after fleeing to the west , mitbauer was still scared of the stasi . " of course i was scared , " he said .
" some people were killed after all .
others were drugged and dragged back to east germany .
someone even loosened the lug nuts on the wheels of my car once .
in the beginning , right after fleeing , i used to push a big cabinet in front of my apartment door . " still , once in the west , mitbauer quickly learned how to market himself .
he received 10,000 german marks back then from stern magazine for his personal story .
he certainly needed the money - considering that he started a new life nearly naked after his escape .
the only thing in his possession when he arrived on shore at travemuende were his swim trunks , his flippers , a ring sewed into one of them , and a medal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swimmer axel mitbauer -lrb- l -rrb- , as a coach later in life " i left at 9 p.m. at night and arrived at a buoy at around 1 o 'clock in the morning , " he recalled .
" i had wanted to spend the night on it , warm up from the sun the next morning and then swim on .
but a german ship ended up picking me up around 7 a.m. " it was a west german ship that took him to travemuende .
he was then taken to a reception camp in giessen , where he received identification documents .
stern journalists met him there and took him to hamburg , where he told them his story of escape . coaching fame mitbauer later studied sports education in cologne and worked as a coach in italy and switzerland .
he continues to live in switzerland and also coaches up-and-coming swim talents in karlsruhe , germany .
he 's coached swimming great jacques mayol , a frenchman , whose legendary two-man competition with italian enzo mairoca later appeared in the film " the big blue . " even today he said he understands why people in eastern and western germany do n't quite understand each other , even though the wall fell 20 years ago . " that gap will not be bridged until the next generation is at the fore - a generation that has grown up familiar only with a united germany , " he said .
" only then will the two sides have grown together into a unified whole . " author : marcus neu boelz -lrb- als -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de india -pipe- 05.11.2009 european union 's relations to india growing in intensity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts foresee a continued warming of relations between the european union and india the eu and india will focus on pushing their free trade pact during their 10th annual summit in new delhi on friday .
but other significant issues are also on the agenda , though the two sides do n't always see eye-to-eye . a major sticking point at the eu-india summit is the planned free trade agreement -lrb- fta -rrb- between the two sides .
daniele smadja , head of the european commission 's delegation to india , said on wednesday that the talks needed a boost .
" the fta negotiations are very complex , " smadja said .
" we have to jump into the cold water of give and take . "
the time had come to exchange concessions , she said .
but clemens spiess , a lecturer at the south asia institute at the university of heidelberg , said he did not expect a final agreement to be reached .
" there are still a lot of hurdles , " spiess told deutsche welle .
these include intellectual property rights disputes and tariff disagreements .
he said he did not expect fta talks to conclude successfully until 2010 or 2011 .
security has become a common challenge in the past , the eu 's relations to india have focused primarily on trade and economic issues .
this comes as no surprise , as the eu is india 's largest trading partner .
graham watson , chairman of the european parliament delegation for relations with india , said trade has more than doubled between the two partners over the past five years .
according to parliament figures , bilateral trade is expected to exceed 70.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 104.5 billion -rrb- by 2010 and 160.6 billion euros by 2015 .
" clearly it 's mainly in the trade area that we want to talk , but we also recognize on both sides that we have a common challenge in promoting peace and comprehensive security , " watson told deutsche welle .
a security dialogue has been in place since 2006 .
the eu not only recognized india 's role as a force of stability in a volatile region , but also as one of the few democracies in the region , he said .
" democracy gives india a huge advantage over china in the medium and long-term , " watson said .
" it makes it far easier for the eu to deal with india , not least because once a decision is taken it represents a consensus of opinion and therefore to be stuck to . "
this perception was n't always the case , though , said rajendra k jain , professor and former chairman of the center for european studies at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many westerners were also taken hostage in mumbai , such as at the taj hotel " the eu never viewed india as an important security partner halfway around the world because their issues and priorities were very different , " jain said in an interview with deutsche welle .
but this changed after the terrorist attacks in mumbai last november .
the eu recognized that india was a significant player in anti-terrorism collaboration .
however , jain said the structure of the eu did not allow for too much optimism in what could be possibly achieved in this area .
" the eu is a very strange political creature , " jain said .
" we should not have too high expectations of what is going to be possible in the realm of security cooperation because insofar as intelligence is concerned , it is a very sensitive issue and not the competence of the european union .
that is clearly with the member states . "
security in particular played a more central role in india 's relations to the united states , spiess said .
" a problem is the interaction between one country , india , on the one side and the 27-member state community , " spiess said .
" we all know there is no such thing as a consistent eu foreign policy , and security policy is now the domain of us-indo relations , which overshadows india 's interactions with the eu in terms of security relations . "
india wo n't succumb to climate pressure with the un conference in copenhagen just a few weeks away , climate change will also be a point of debate in new delhi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is also significantly affecting india " the western countries are pressuring india to join the fight against climate change more thoroughly , " spiess said .
" but india under no circumstances will accept any sort of legally binding reductions on its future greenhouse gas emissions trajectory . "
new delhi is resisting any binding emission cuts and demanding finance and technology from wealthy countries to help reduce emissions .
but there are other areas in which the two sides cooperate closely , such as energy , technology transfer , science and academic cooperation .
at this week 's summit , a cooperation agreement between the european atomic energy community euratom and india will be signed in the field of fusion energy research .
representatives will also launch a call for proposals for research in the field of solar energy , the european commission said .
" there 's plenty there for our leaders to get their teeth into , " watson said .
" the question is : where can we best find areas where we can make progress together and where there 's a real added value in cooperation . "
an equal partnership ?
for the eu , experts agreed , india is certainly an international partner to be taken seriously .
this was evident from the strategic partnership agreement in 2004 and the joint action plan in 2005 , revised in 2008 , which aims to deepen dialogue and cooperation .
" the eu does n't identify too many countries in the world with which they will enter into strategic partnerships , " said spiess .
" from the perspective of the eu , it 's crystal clear that india is identified as a stabilizing factor in the region and as a growing global player .
that 's why it 's a partner to count on . "
but it would go too far to say india was an equal partner , said christian wagner from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" for the eu , india is a developing country , " wagner told deutsche welle .
" the lion 's share of eu resources allocated to india in the next years deal with development goals . "
eu support is earmarked for helping india achieve the un millennium development goals , he said .
with respect to sentiments from new delhi , jain said there has been a shift in perception - despite the strong emphasis on trade and economic issues in the relationship .
" i think there has been a perceptible change in recent years and growing recognition among indian policymakers about the importance of the european union in world affairs , " jain said .

but other significant issues are also on the agenda , though the two sides do n't always see eye-to-eye . a major sticking point at the eu-india summit is the planned free trade agreement -lrb- fta -rrb- between the two sides .
daniele smadja , head of the european commission 's delegation to india , said on wednesday that the talks needed a boost .
" the fta negotiations are very complex , " smadja said .
" we have to jump into the cold water of give and take . "
the time had come to exchange concessions , she said .
but clemens spiess , a lecturer at the south asia institute at the university of heidelberg , said he did not expect a final agreement to be reached .
" there are still a lot of hurdles , " spiess told deutsche welle .
these include intellectual property rights disputes and tariff disagreements .
he said he did not expect fta talks to conclude successfully until 2010 or 2011 .
security has become a common challenge in the past , the eu 's relations to india have focused primarily on trade and economic issues .
this comes as no surprise , as the eu is india 's largest trading partner .
graham watson , chairman of the european parliament delegation for relations with india , said trade has more than doubled between the two partners over the past five years .
according to parliament figures , bilateral trade is expected to exceed 70.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 104.5 billion -rrb- by 2010 and 160.6 billion euros by 2015 .
" clearly it 's mainly in the trade area that we want to talk , but we also recognize on both sides that we have a common challenge in promoting peace and comprehensive security , " watson told deutsche welle .
a security dialogue has been in place since 2006 .
the eu not only recognized india 's role as a force of stability in a volatile region , but also as one of the few democracies in the region , he said .
" democracy gives india a huge advantage over china in the medium and long-term , " watson said .
" it makes it far easier for the eu to deal with india , not least because once a decision is taken it represents a consensus of opinion and therefore to be stuck to . "
this perception was n't always the case , though , said rajendra k jain , professor and former chairman of the center for european studies at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many westerners were also taken hostage in mumbai , such as at the taj hotel " the eu never viewed india as an important security partner halfway around the world because their issues and priorities were very different , " jain said in an interview with deutsche welle .
but this changed after the terrorist attacks in mumbai last november .
the eu recognized that india was a significant player in anti-terrorism collaboration .
however , jain said the structure of the eu did not allow for too much optimism in what could be possibly achieved in this area .
" the eu is a very strange political creature , " jain said .
" we should not have too high expectations of what is going to be possible in the realm of security cooperation because insofar as intelligence is concerned , it is a very sensitive issue and not the competence of the european union .
that is clearly with the member states . "
security in particular played a more central role in india 's relations to the united states , spiess said .
" a problem is the interaction between one country , india , on the one side and the 27-member state community , " spiess said .
" we all know there is no such thing as a consistent eu foreign policy , and security policy is now the domain of us-indo relations , which overshadows india 's interactions with the eu in terms of security relations . "
india wo n't succumb to climate pressure with the un conference in copenhagen just a few weeks away , climate change will also be a point of debate in new delhi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is also significantly affecting india " the western countries are pressuring india to join the fight against climate change more thoroughly , " spiess said .
" but india under no circumstances will accept any sort of legally binding reductions on its future greenhouse gas emissions trajectory . "
new delhi is resisting any binding emission cuts and demanding finance and technology from wealthy countries to help reduce emissions .
but there are other areas in which the two sides cooperate closely , such as energy , technology transfer , science and academic cooperation .
at this week 's summit , a cooperation agreement between the european atomic energy community euratom and india will be signed in the field of fusion energy research .
representatives will also launch a call for proposals for research in the field of solar energy , the european commission said .
" there 's plenty there for our leaders to get their teeth into , " watson said .
" the question is : where can we best find areas where we can make progress together and where there 's a real added value in cooperation . "
an equal partnership ?
for the eu , experts agreed , india is certainly an international partner to be taken seriously .
this was evident from the strategic partnership agreement in 2004 and the joint action plan in 2005 , revised in 2008 , which aims to deepen dialogue and cooperation .
" the eu does n't identify too many countries in the world with which they will enter into strategic partnerships , " said spiess .
" from the perspective of the eu , it 's crystal clear that india is identified as a stabilizing factor in the region and as a growing global player .
that 's why it 's a partner to count on . "
but it would go too far to say india was an equal partner , said christian wagner from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" for the eu , india is a developing country , " wagner told deutsche welle .
" the lion 's share of eu resources allocated to india in the next years deal with development goals . "
eu support is earmarked for helping india achieve the un millennium development goals , he said .
with respect to sentiments from new delhi , jain said there has been a shift in perception - despite the strong emphasis on trade and economic issues in the relationship .
" i think there has been a perceptible change in recent years and growing recognition among indian policymakers about the importance of the european union in world affairs , " jain said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de east germany -pipe- 05.11.2009 a leipzig museum depicts the power and the banality of stasi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this device was used to steam letters open in leipzig 's stasi museum , visitors learn about that city 's role in bringing down the wall .
protestors did more than just chant " we are the people ! " – they actually deposed the ministry for state security . along with dresden , magdeburg and berlin , leipzig was a starting point for the now famous monday prayers and protests against the former east german government .
for weeks , demonstrators in leipzig placed burning candles in front of the headquarters of the ministry for state security .
then on december 4 , 1989 , the demonstrators managed to occupy the building .
their actions effectively ended the surveillance and informing upon suspect citizens that were the central tasks of the agency , referred to as the stasi .
it was the beginning of a long process of recovery .
eavesdropped and spied on here in the museum , it smells like linoleum floors and old files .
this is no coincidence , since today 's stasi museum occupies the same rooms formerly used by the ministry for state security .
now the museum belongs to the leipzig citizens ' association .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even brick walls were no challenge for the stasi 's bugging devices twelve rooms are devoted to the museum 's permanent exhibit , called " stasi – power and banality . "
the museum recreates the history of the stasi and of the communist german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- .
with the stasi 's help , the gdr extinguished its citizens ' rights to privacy and freedom of opinion .
the museum 's 40,000 exhibit pieces provide insight into all aspects of the stasi .
their methods were manipulative and dehumanizing .
visitors are shown wiretaps and tapes used to eavesdrop on citizens , stasi uniforms , surveillance cameras and the disguises used by the complicit citizens who worked as unofficial informers .
photos and original documents from the stasi headquarters tell the rest of the story .
original building the museum is one of only a handful of buildings being used that once belonged to the stasi .
its location underscores the repression and psychological damage inflicted by the security ministry over several decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a portrait of gdr leader erich honecker on the wall of a stasi office an original cell from an interrogation unit demonstrates the disturbing conditions faced by those the stasi imprisoned .
another part of the exhibit concerns the death penalty in the gdr and memorializes those who were sentenced to death by the regime .
the gdr 's former execution chamber in leipzig sheds further light on these deaths and is occasionally open to visitors .
a memorial and a warning the leipzig citizens ' association operates the museum , which is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
there is no entrance fee .
guided tours are led at 3 p.m.
those interested in a tour should meet at the museum 's main entrance at dittrichring 24 .
group tours in other languages including english , french , hungarian and spanish are available for registered parties .

the move is in response to a boycott of the trial by karadzic . the judges at the un war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia ordered a court-appointed counsel to represent karadzic in the event he continued to boycott the hearings .
the genocide trial began on october 26 but the accused did not appear , claiming he had not been given enough time to prepare his defense .
karadzic had been warned on four occasions that his continued boycott would result in the appointment of a counsel to represent him .
" the accused has indeed substantially and persistently obstructed the proper and expeditious conduct of his trial by refusing to attend the proceedings , " said the written decision imposing the legal counsel .
" the accused 's conduct has effectively brought the trial to a halt , which is evidently his purpose . "
the icc judges said karadzic would still be able to represent himself following the appointment of the legal counsel , but that if he continued his boycott of the proceedings when the trial resumes on march 1 , 2010 , then the legal counsel would step in .
karadzic currently has a legal team consisting of 20 mainly volunteer legal advisors , but would forfeit that privilege if he continues his boycott .
the un court has charged karadzic with 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his role in the 1992-1995 war in bosnia .
the conflict killed an estimated 100,000 people and displaced 2.2 million others. dfm / afp / ap / reuters editor : deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de india -pipe- 05.11.2009 european union 's relations to india growing in intensity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts foresee a continued warming of relations between the european union and india the eu and india will focus on pushing their free trade pact during their 10th annual summit in new delhi on friday .
but other significant issues are also on the agenda , though the two sides do n't always see eye-to-eye . a major sticking point at the eu-india summit is the planned free trade agreement -lrb- fta -rrb- between the two sides .
daniele smadja , head of the european commission 's delegation to india , said on wednesday that the talks needed a boost .
" the fta negotiations are very complex , " smadja said .
" we have to jump into the cold water of give and take . "
the time had come to exchange concessions , she said .
but clemens spiess , a lecturer at the south asia institute at the university of heidelberg , said he did not expect a final agreement to be reached .
" there are still a lot of hurdles , " spiess told deutsche welle .
these include intellectual property rights disputes and tariff disagreements .
he said he did not expect fta talks to conclude successfully until 2010 or 2011 .
security has become a common challenge in the past , the eu 's relations to india have focused primarily on trade and economic issues .
this comes as no surprise , as the eu is india 's largest trading partner .
graham watson , chairman of the european parliament delegation for relations with india , said trade has more than doubled between the two partners over the past five years .
according to parliament figures , bilateral trade is expected to exceed 70.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 104.5 billion -rrb- by 2010 and 160.6 billion euros by 2015 .
" clearly it 's mainly in the trade area that we want to talk , but we also recognize on both sides that we have a common challenge in promoting peace and comprehensive security , " watson told deutsche welle .
a security dialogue has been in place since 2006 .
the eu not only recognized india 's role as a force of stability in a volatile region , but also as one of the few democracies in the region , he said .
" democracy gives india a huge advantage over china in the medium and long-term , " watson said .
" it makes it far easier for the eu to deal with india , not least because once a decision is taken it represents a consensus of opinion and therefore to be stuck to . "
this perception was n't always the case , though , said rajendra k jain , professor and former chairman of the center for european studies at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many westerners were also taken hostage in mumbai , such as at the taj hotel " the eu never viewed india as an important security partner halfway around the world because their issues and priorities were very different , " jain said in an interview with deutsche welle .
but this changed after the terrorist attacks in mumbai last november .
the eu recognized that india was a significant player in anti-terrorism collaboration .
however , jain said the structure of the eu did not allow for too much optimism in what could be possibly achieved in this area .
" the eu is a very strange political creature , " jain said .
" we should not have too high expectations of what is going to be possible in the realm of security cooperation because insofar as intelligence is concerned , it is a very sensitive issue and not the competence of the european union .
that is clearly with the member states . "
security in particular played a more central role in india 's relations to the united states , spiess said .
" a problem is the interaction between one country , india , on the one side and the 27-member state community , " spiess said .
" we all know there is no such thing as a consistent eu foreign policy , and security policy is now the domain of us-indo relations , which overshadows india 's interactions with the eu in terms of security relations . "
india wo n't succumb to climate pressure with the un conference in copenhagen just a few weeks away , climate change will also be a point of debate in new delhi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is also significantly affecting india " the western countries are pressuring india to join the fight against climate change more thoroughly , " spiess said .
" but india under no circumstances will accept any sort of legally binding reductions on its future greenhouse gas emissions trajectory . "
new delhi is resisting any binding emission cuts and demanding finance and technology from wealthy countries to help reduce emissions .
but there are other areas in which the two sides cooperate closely , such as energy , technology transfer , science and academic cooperation .
at this week 's summit , a cooperation agreement between the european atomic energy community euratom and india will be signed in the field of fusion energy research .
representatives will also launch a call for proposals for research in the field of solar energy , the european commission said .
" there 's plenty there for our leaders to get their teeth into , " watson said .
" the question is : where can we best find areas where we can make progress together and where there 's a real added value in cooperation . "
an equal partnership ?
for the eu , experts agreed , india is certainly an international partner to be taken seriously .
this was evident from the strategic partnership agreement in 2004 and the joint action plan in 2005 , revised in 2008 , which aims to deepen dialogue and cooperation .
" the eu does n't identify too many countries in the world with which they will enter into strategic partnerships , " said spiess .
" from the perspective of the eu , it 's crystal clear that india is identified as a stabilizing factor in the region and as a growing global player .
that 's why it 's a partner to count on . "
but it would go too far to say india was an equal partner , said christian wagner from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" for the eu , india is a developing country , " wagner told deutsche welle .
" the lion 's share of eu resources allocated to india in the next years deal with development goals . "
eu support is earmarked for helping india achieve the un millennium development goals , he said .
with respect to sentiments from new delhi , jain said there has been a shift in perception - despite the strong emphasis on trade and economic issues in the relationship .
" i think there has been a perceptible change in recent years and growing recognition among indian policymakers about the importance of the european union in world affairs , " jain said .

children are very susceptible to the disease and die at a rate of one every 30 seconds . scientists from throughout the world are meeting in nairobi to consider new research and treatments that may help eradicate malaria .
the disease poses a serious health threat in africa , but a promising new treatment is on the horizon . the treatment is a vaccine called rtss and has been tested for 20 years by scientists in africa .
experts hope that its effectiveness will be confirmed within three years , following the evaluation of field trials with infected children . the best results to date kenyan pediatrician walter otieno confirmed the significance of scientists ' recent research into treating malaria . " it is the first time that a vaccine against malaria has made it to the third and final testing phase , " he said .
" if it succeeds here , then the vaccine is ready for the market .
we are confident that in three to five years we will have an effective treatment that can be combined with other vaccinations to treat kids . " to date , the vaccine has shown promising results .
in the second testing phase , more than half of the children who received the vaccination no longer suffered severely from the mosquito-borne disease .
rtss has produced better results than any previous malaria treatment but still does not offer complete protection .
otieno advises parents to take precautionary measures against malaria , like using mosquito netting around kids ' beds . children especially at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malaria is a big health concern for african children children suffering from a severe case of malaria may experience blood loss , brain damage and eventually comas .

" people are bitten nearly every day by mosquitoes bearing the disease .
seven out of 10 children are brought to our hospital because of malaria . " mothers with their babies often fill the waiting rooms of the medical research center in kombewa , kenya .
they hope their children can take part in rtss trials . " we keep having problems with malaria in our family , " said patricia mrunde , a mother of six , was recently among those seeking a vaccination for her daughter .
" a few weeks ago , my oldest son experienced a high fever as part of an outbreak .
when an outbreak is especially bad , his whole body jerks and cramps uncontrollably . " the mothers whose children take part in the trial swill not know whether their children will receive placebo injections or injections containing the anti-malaria vaccine . nevertheless , mrunde said she is still optimistic .

both countries moved quickly to recall their respective ambassadors with thailand announcing a review of bilateral ties . thai prime minister abhisit vejjajiva said thursday the recall of thailand ’ s ambassador to cambodia was in retaliation over the appointment of former leader thaksin shinawatra as an advisor to cambodian leader , hun sen. the move by thailand was quickly followed by cambodia which later announced it was recalling its ambassador to thailand .
the appointment of thaksin follows a recent increase in tensions between cambodia and thailand over the former fugitive leader during a recent summit of south east asian leaders when prime minister hun sen praised thaksin .
thaksin , ousted from power in a 2006 coup , was found guilty last year by a thai court on charges of corruption and conflict of interest in a land deal involving his wife .
he fled thailand before the two year jail sentence was handed down .
kraisak choonhavan , a member of abhisit ’ s governing democrat party , says bilateral ties have been severely damaged by hun sen ’ s decision .
" as i see it , unless hun sen does a big reversal of his policy appointing thaksin , this is going to take us towards very serious problems in our relations .
it was totally unpredictable that hun sen would go to this extent , i must say . "
further escalation possible kraisak said there was a danger of the dispute escalating further , possibly with vital border crossings between the neighbouring countries being shut down .
in recent years , thailand and cambodia have faced strained bilateral relations over disputed land surrounding an 11th century khmer temple .
brief border clashes have led to casualties on both sides .
thaksin is known to have long standing close ties with hun sen in both business and politics .
but senior cambodian opposition parliamentarian son chhay says he does not expect thaksin to make a major contribution to the cambodian economy .
" it will be better if thaksin stays away from cambodia .
we do not understand the decision of our prime minister here in appointing mr. thaksin .
in cambodia we have so many advisors already .
thaksin was perhaps a successful businessman in thailand but his kind of knowledge is not suitable for cambodia where we have so many problems with corruption already . "
a campaign by thaksin 's supporters ?
obervers in thailand say the cambodian appointment appears to be part of a plan by thaksin 's supporters to undermine the abhisit government in a bid to return their former leader to power .
human rights watch ’ s representative sunai pasuk calls it a " two-pronged strategy " .
according to him , thaksin 's supporters are trying " to discredit the government through the media , in parliament , on the street .
the other theatre of thaksin ’ s political operations is outside thailand using malaysia , cambodia as well as dubai to show that the government is not respected . "
analysts say thaksin ’ s supporters are trying to weaken the government before the thai economy starts to fully recover from the recent reecession , and to force abhisit to call fresh elections in 2010 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 05.11.2009 tuition boom in india großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian students might get a meal at school , but not always a good education private tuition has become a standard part of the education system in india .
more and more coaching centres are mushrooming all over the country .
the practice is now so widespread that not going to a private tuition class is seen as an abnormality . marks , marks and more marks !
what was your score in mathematics , english and the sciences ?
these questions from parents , teachers , and later on from employers are driving millions of indian students into private tuition classes after school .
shiladitya bhaduri , a class ten student studying in an elite private school in kolkata also attends tuition classes instead of playing with his friends . " for a bright future , private tuitions are needed because schools are not always guiding us in the right way " , he explains .
sharmistha , a private tutor in kolkata , agrees : " it is impossible for the teachers to give all the required knowledge that they want to impart in the school ; so the students simply require some special care in order to know all that they need to know . "
fierce competition besides teaching deficits in the government and even private schools , it is mainly the tough competition for popular careers like those of a doctor , an engineer or a civil servant which makes parents and students go for coaching centres .
utpal moitra wants his son to be a government officer , a dream that many indian parents have for their children .
" i want him to be a civil servant but i don ’ t really know whether he will be able to do it or not , " says moitra .
" if i get some good institution which can give him the coaching to get him into a good position , i don ’ t mind sending him to a coaching centre . "
specialized tutorial institutes for the different professions advertise everywhere .
some students spend years in the hostels of these tutorial homes hoping to gain entry to their dream profession .
" quantity education " saswati goswami , who teaches at the indian institute of mass communication in new delhi , believes that a fundamental problem with the indian education system is behind the tuition craze : " it is not quality education but more about quantity education " , she says .
" how many marks you score decides your future prospects .
in order to make sure that knowledge becomes more important in education than marks , you 'd have to introduce a system where your knowledge is tested .
so you don ’ t just have to memorise something , you have to internalise something .
you have to read the book and the teacher has to guide you through the whole course , which is not done . "
coaching centres are a lucrative business as they hardly pay any taxes .
some indian states have even put a ban on full time teachers running private tuition classes , as this might impact their performance in school .
in order to secure an additional income , teachers have also been known to teach only part of the curriculum in class and then request the students to come for private tuition for the rest .
so far , government orders have not proven effective in stopping such practices ; and as long as fierce competition and the craze for better marks continue to put pressure on both parents and children , the tuition boom is likely to continue .

the fate of german carmaker opel is germany 's biggest concern . the german foreign minister used his visit to washington to demand that us auto giant general motors take measures to protect german jobs at its troubled european subsidiary opel .
following a meeting with hillary clinton , foreign minister westerwelle said he was satisfied that the us government was not involved in general motors ' sudden decision this week to keep its european subsidiary opel .
clinton had stressed that gm alone chose to abandon a deal to sell opel to canadian-austrian parts-maker magna , westerwelle said after the meeting .
clinton had " strongly underlined the fact that the decision taken by general motors was a decision taken without any political influence , " westerwelle said .
" it 's very good news to receive . "
the meeting between the two foreign ministers came two days after gm dramatically reneged on its plans to sell opel , instead opting to restructure the company itself .
the german government had clearly favored the magna bid above others .
to sweeten the deal with magna and russian backers sberbank , the german government offered a 1.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 2.2 billion -rrb- bridging loan to gm to keep opel afloat until negotiations could be finalized .
westerwelle said thursday he had made clear that the loan " must be paid back , " adding that clinton had shown " understanding for our position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton thanked germany for its afghan troop deployment germany 's afghan role clinton did not address gm 's plans for opel at a press conference after the meeting , instead shifting the focus to germany 's military deployment in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 05.11.2009 cambodia , thailand recall ambassadors in row over thaksin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime ministers hun sen , left , and abhisit vejjajiva at a meeting earlier this year political tensions between thailand and cambodia have escalated after cambodian prime minister hun sen appointed former thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra as an advisor .
both countries moved quickly to recall their respective ambassadors with thailand announcing a review of bilateral ties . thai prime minister abhisit vejjajiva said thursday the recall of thailand ’ s ambassador to cambodia was in retaliation over the appointment of former leader thaksin shinawatra as an advisor to cambodian leader , hun sen. the move by thailand was quickly followed by cambodia which later announced it was recalling its ambassador to thailand .
the appointment of thaksin follows a recent increase in tensions between cambodia and thailand over the former fugitive leader during a recent summit of south east asian leaders when prime minister hun sen praised thaksin .
thaksin , ousted from power in a 2006 coup , was found guilty last year by a thai court on charges of corruption and conflict of interest in a land deal involving his wife .
he fled thailand before the two year jail sentence was handed down .
kraisak choonhavan , a member of abhisit ’ s governing democrat party , says bilateral ties have been severely damaged by hun sen ’ s decision .
" as i see it , unless hun sen does a big reversal of his policy appointing thaksin , this is going to take us towards very serious problems in our relations .
it was totally unpredictable that hun sen would go to this extent , i must say . "
further escalation possible kraisak said there was a danger of the dispute escalating further , possibly with vital border crossings between the neighbouring countries being shut down .
in recent years , thailand and cambodia have faced strained bilateral relations over disputed land surrounding an 11th century khmer temple .
brief border clashes have led to casualties on both sides .
thaksin is known to have long standing close ties with hun sen in both business and politics .
but senior cambodian opposition parliamentarian son chhay says he does not expect thaksin to make a major contribution to the cambodian economy .
" it will be better if thaksin stays away from cambodia .
we do not understand the decision of our prime minister here in appointing mr. thaksin .
in cambodia we have so many advisors already .
thaksin was perhaps a successful businessman in thailand but his kind of knowledge is not suitable for cambodia where we have so many problems with corruption already . "
a campaign by thaksin 's supporters ?
obervers in thailand say the cambodian appointment appears to be part of a plan by thaksin 's supporters to undermine the abhisit government in a bid to return their former leader to power .
human rights watch ’ s representative sunai pasuk calls it a " two-pronged strategy " .
according to him , thaksin 's supporters are trying " to discredit the government through the media , in parliament , on the street .
the other theatre of thaksin ’ s political operations is outside thailand using malaysia , cambodia as well as dubai to show that the government is not respected . "
analysts say thaksin ’ s supporters are trying to weaken the government before the thai economy starts to fully recover from the recent reecession , and to force abhisit to call fresh elections in 2010 .

these questions from parents , teachers , and later on from employers are driving millions of indian students into private tuition classes after school .
shiladitya bhaduri , a class ten student studying in an elite private school in kolkata also attends tuition classes instead of playing with his friends . " for a bright future , private tuitions are needed because schools are not always guiding us in the right way " , he explains .
sharmistha , a private tutor in kolkata , agrees : " it is impossible for the teachers to give all the required knowledge that they want to impart in the school ; so the students simply require some special care in order to know all that they need to know . "
fierce competition besides teaching deficits in the government and even private schools , it is mainly the tough competition for popular careers like those of a doctor , an engineer or a civil servant which makes parents and students go for coaching centres .
utpal moitra wants his son to be a government officer , a dream that many indian parents have for their children .
" i want him to be a civil servant but i don ’ t really know whether he will be able to do it or not , " says moitra .

" how many marks you score decides your future prospects .
in order to make sure that knowledge becomes more important in education than marks , you 'd have to introduce a system where your knowledge is tested .
so you don ’ t just have to memorise something , you have to internalise something .
you have to read the book and the teacher has to guide you through the whole course , which is not done . "
coaching centres are a lucrative business as they hardly pay any taxes .
some indian states have even put a ban on full time teachers running private tuition classes , as this might impact their performance in school .
in order to secure an additional income , teachers have also been known to teach only part of the curriculum in class and then request the students to come for private tuition for the rest .
so far , government orders have not proven effective in stopping such practices ; and as long as fierce competition and the craze for better marks continue to put pressure on both parents and children , the tuition boom is likely to continue .

both countries moved quickly to recall their respective ambassadors with thailand announcing a review of bilateral ties . thai prime minister abhisit vejjajiva said thursday the recall of thailand ’ s ambassador to cambodia was in retaliation over the appointment of former leader thaksin shinawatra as an advisor to cambodian leader , hun sen. the move by thailand was quickly followed by cambodia which later announced it was recalling its ambassador to thailand .
the appointment of thaksin follows a recent increase in tensions between cambodia and thailand over the former fugitive leader during a recent summit of south east asian leaders when prime minister hun sen praised thaksin .
thaksin , ousted from power in a 2006 coup , was found guilty last year by a thai court on charges of corruption and conflict of interest in a land deal involving his wife .
he fled thailand before the two year jail sentence was handed down .
kraisak choonhavan , a member of abhisit ’ s governing democrat party , says bilateral ties have been severely damaged by hun sen ’ s decision .
" as i see it , unless hun sen does a big reversal of his policy appointing thaksin , this is going to take us towards very serious problems in our relations .
it was totally unpredictable that hun sen would go to this extent , i must say . "
further escalation possible kraisak said there was a danger of the dispute escalating further , possibly with vital border crossings between the neighbouring countries being shut down .
in recent years , thailand and cambodia have faced strained bilateral relations over disputed land surrounding an 11th century khmer temple .
brief border clashes have led to casualties on both sides .
thaksin is known to have long standing close ties with hun sen in both business and politics .
but senior cambodian opposition parliamentarian son chhay says he does not expect thaksin to make a major contribution to the cambodian economy .
" it will be better if thaksin stays away from cambodia .
we do not understand the decision of our prime minister here in appointing mr. thaksin .
in cambodia we have so many advisors already .
thaksin was perhaps a successful businessman in thailand but his kind of knowledge is not suitable for cambodia where we have so many problems with corruption already . "
a campaign by thaksin 's supporters ?
obervers in thailand say the cambodian appointment appears to be part of a plan by thaksin 's supporters to undermine the abhisit government in a bid to return their former leader to power .
human rights watch ’ s representative sunai pasuk calls it a " two-pronged strategy " .
according to him , thaksin 's supporters are trying " to discredit the government through the media , in parliament , on the street .
the other theatre of thaksin ’ s political operations is outside thailand using malaysia , cambodia as well as dubai to show that the government is not respected . "
analysts say thaksin ’ s supporters are trying to weaken the government before the thai economy starts to fully recover from the recent reecession , and to force abhisit to call fresh elections in 2010 .

both countries moved quickly to recall their respective ambassadors with thailand announcing a review of bilateral ties . thai prime minister abhisit vejjajiva said thursday the recall of thailand ’ s ambassador to cambodia was in retaliation over the appointment of former leader thaksin shinawatra as an advisor to cambodian leader , hun sen. the move by thailand was quickly followed by cambodia which later announced it was recalling its ambassador to thailand .
the appointment of thaksin follows a recent increase in tensions between cambodia and thailand over the former fugitive leader during a recent summit of south east asian leaders when prime minister hun sen praised thaksin .
thaksin , ousted from power in a 2006 coup , was found guilty last year by a thai court on charges of corruption and conflict of interest in a land deal involving his wife .
he fled thailand before the two year jail sentence was handed down .
kraisak choonhavan , a member of abhisit ’ s governing democrat party , says bilateral ties have been severely damaged by hun sen ’ s decision .
" as i see it , unless hun sen does a big reversal of his policy appointing thaksin , this is going to take us towards very serious problems in our relations .
it was totally unpredictable that hun sen would go to this extent , i must say . "
further escalation possible kraisak said there was a danger of the dispute escalating further , possibly with vital border crossings between the neighbouring countries being shut down .
in recent years , thailand and cambodia have faced strained bilateral relations over disputed land surrounding an 11th century khmer temple .
brief border clashes have led to casualties on both sides .
thaksin is known to have long standing close ties with hun sen in both business and politics .
but senior cambodian opposition parliamentarian son chhay says he does not expect thaksin to make a major contribution to the cambodian economy .
" it will be better if thaksin stays away from cambodia .
we do not understand the decision of our prime minister here in appointing mr. thaksin .
in cambodia we have so many advisors already .
thaksin was perhaps a successful businessman in thailand but his kind of knowledge is not suitable for cambodia where we have so many problems with corruption already . "
a campaign by thaksin 's supporters ?
obervers in thailand say the cambodian appointment appears to be part of a plan by thaksin 's supporters to undermine the abhisit government in a bid to return their former leader to power .
human rights watch ’ s representative sunai pasuk calls it a " two-pronged strategy " .
according to him , thaksin 's supporters are trying " to discredit the government through the media , in parliament , on the street .
the other theatre of thaksin ’ s political operations is outside thailand using malaysia , cambodia as well as dubai to show that the government is not respected . "
analysts say thaksin ’ s supporters are trying to weaken the government before the thai economy starts to fully recover from the recent reecession , and to force abhisit to call fresh elections in 2010 .

thaksin is known to have long standing close ties with hun sen in both business and politics .
but senior cambodian opposition parliamentarian son chhay says he does not expect thaksin to make a major contribution to the cambodian economy .
" it will be better if thaksin stays away from cambodia .
we do not understand the decision of our prime minister here in appointing mr. thaksin .
in cambodia we have so many advisors already .
thaksin was perhaps a successful businessman in thailand but his kind of knowledge is not suitable for cambodia where we have so many problems with corruption already . "
a campaign by thaksin 's supporters ?
obervers in thailand say the cambodian appointment appears to be part of a plan by thaksin 's supporters to undermine the abhisit government in a bid to return their former leader to power .
human rights watch ’ s representative sunai pasuk calls it a " two-pronged strategy " .
according to him , thaksin 's supporters are trying " to discredit the government through the media , in parliament , on the street .
the other theatre of thaksin ’ s political operations is outside thailand using malaysia , cambodia as well as dubai to show that the government is not respected . "
analysts say thaksin ’ s supporters are trying to weaken the government before the thai economy starts to fully recover from the recent reecession , and to force abhisit to call fresh elections in 2010 .

but other significant issues are also on the agenda , though the two sides do n't always see eye-to-eye . a major sticking point at the eu-india summit is the planned free trade agreement -lrb- fta -rrb- between the two sides .
daniele smadja , head of the european commission 's delegation to india , said on wednesday that the talks needed a boost .
" the fta negotiations are very complex , " smadja said .
" we have to jump into the cold water of give and take . "
the time had come to exchange concessions , she said .
but clemens spiess , a lecturer at the south asia institute at the university of heidelberg , said he did not expect a final agreement to be reached .
" there are still a lot of hurdles , " spiess told deutsche welle .
these include intellectual property rights disputes and tariff disagreements .
he said he did not expect fta talks to conclude successfully until 2010 or 2011 .
security has become a common challenge in the past , the eu 's relations to india have focused primarily on trade and economic issues .
this comes as no surprise , as the eu is india 's largest trading partner .
graham watson , chairman of the european parliament delegation for relations with india , said trade has more than doubled between the two partners over the past five years .
according to parliament figures , bilateral trade is expected to exceed 70.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 104.5 billion -rrb- by 2010 and 160.6 billion euros by 2015 .
" clearly it 's mainly in the trade area that we want to talk , but we also recognize on both sides that we have a common challenge in promoting peace and comprehensive security , " watson told deutsche welle .
a security dialogue has been in place since 2006 .
the eu not only recognized india 's role as a force of stability in a volatile region , but also as one of the few democracies in the region , he said .
" democracy gives india a huge advantage over china in the medium and long-term , " watson said .
" it makes it far easier for the eu to deal with india , not least because once a decision is taken it represents a consensus of opinion and therefore to be stuck to . "
this perception was n't always the case , though , said rajendra k jain , professor and former chairman of the center for european studies at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many westerners were also taken hostage in mumbai , such as at the taj hotel " the eu never viewed india as an important security partner halfway around the world because their issues and priorities were very different , " jain said in an interview with deutsche welle .
but this changed after the terrorist attacks in mumbai last november .
the eu recognized that india was a significant player in anti-terrorism collaboration .
however , jain said the structure of the eu did not allow for too much optimism in what could be possibly achieved in this area .
" the eu is a very strange political creature , " jain said .
" we should not have too high expectations of what is going to be possible in the realm of security cooperation because insofar as intelligence is concerned , it is a very sensitive issue and not the competence of the european union .
that is clearly with the member states . "
security in particular played a more central role in india 's relations to the united states , spiess said .
" a problem is the interaction between one country , india , on the one side and the 27-member state community , " spiess said .
" we all know there is no such thing as a consistent eu foreign policy , and security policy is now the domain of us-indo relations , which overshadows india 's interactions with the eu in terms of security relations . "
india wo n't succumb to climate pressure with the un conference in copenhagen just a few weeks away , climate change will also be a point of debate in new delhi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is also significantly affecting india " the western countries are pressuring india to join the fight against climate change more thoroughly , " spiess said .
" but india under no circumstances will accept any sort of legally binding reductions on its future greenhouse gas emissions trajectory . "
new delhi is resisting any binding emission cuts and demanding finance and technology from wealthy countries to help reduce emissions .
but there are other areas in which the two sides cooperate closely , such as energy , technology transfer , science and academic cooperation .
at this week 's summit , a cooperation agreement between the european atomic energy community euratom and india will be signed in the field of fusion energy research .
representatives will also launch a call for proposals for research in the field of solar energy , the european commission said .
" there 's plenty there for our leaders to get their teeth into , " watson said .
" the question is : where can we best find areas where we can make progress together and where there 's a real added value in cooperation . "
an equal partnership ?
for the eu , experts agreed , india is certainly an international partner to be taken seriously .
this was evident from the strategic partnership agreement in 2004 and the joint action plan in 2005 , revised in 2008 , which aims to deepen dialogue and cooperation .
" the eu does n't identify too many countries in the world with which they will enter into strategic partnerships , " said spiess .
" from the perspective of the eu , it 's crystal clear that india is identified as a stabilizing factor in the region and as a growing global player .
that 's why it 's a partner to count on . "
but it would go too far to say india was an equal partner , said christian wagner from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" for the eu , india is a developing country , " wagner told deutsche welle .
" the lion 's share of eu resources allocated to india in the next years deal with development goals . "
eu support is earmarked for helping india achieve the un millennium development goals , he said .
with respect to sentiments from new delhi , jain said there has been a shift in perception - despite the strong emphasis on trade and economic issues in the relationship .
" i think there has been a perceptible change in recent years and growing recognition among indian policymakers about the importance of the european union in world affairs , " jain said .

but other significant issues are also on the agenda , though the two sides do n't always see eye-to-eye . a major sticking point at the eu-india summit is the planned free trade agreement -lrb- fta -rrb- between the two sides .
daniele smadja , head of the european commission 's delegation to india , said on wednesday that the talks needed a boost .
" the fta negotiations are very complex , " smadja said .
" we have to jump into the cold water of give and take . "
the time had come to exchange concessions , she said .
but clemens spiess , a lecturer at the south asia institute at the university of heidelberg , said he did not expect a final agreement to be reached .
" there are still a lot of hurdles , " spiess told deutsche welle .
these include intellectual property rights disputes and tariff disagreements .
he said he did not expect fta talks to conclude successfully until 2010 or 2011 .
security has become a common challenge in the past , the eu 's relations to india have focused primarily on trade and economic issues .
this comes as no surprise , as the eu is india 's largest trading partner .
graham watson , chairman of the european parliament delegation for relations with india , said trade has more than doubled between the two partners over the past five years .
according to parliament figures , bilateral trade is expected to exceed 70.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 104.5 billion -rrb- by 2010 and 160.6 billion euros by 2015 .
" clearly it 's mainly in the trade area that we want to talk , but we also recognize on both sides that we have a common challenge in promoting peace and comprehensive security , " watson told deutsche welle .
a security dialogue has been in place since 2006 .
the eu not only recognized india 's role as a force of stability in a volatile region , but also as one of the few democracies in the region , he said .
" democracy gives india a huge advantage over china in the medium and long-term , " watson said .
" it makes it far easier for the eu to deal with india , not least because once a decision is taken it represents a consensus of opinion and therefore to be stuck to . "
this perception was n't always the case , though , said rajendra k jain , professor and former chairman of the center for european studies at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many westerners were also taken hostage in mumbai , such as at the taj hotel " the eu never viewed india as an important security partner halfway around the world because their issues and priorities were very different , " jain said in an interview with deutsche welle .
but this changed after the terrorist attacks in mumbai last november .
the eu recognized that india was a significant player in anti-terrorism collaboration .
however , jain said the structure of the eu did not allow for too much optimism in what could be possibly achieved in this area .
" the eu is a very strange political creature , " jain said .
" we should not have too high expectations of what is going to be possible in the realm of security cooperation because insofar as intelligence is concerned , it is a very sensitive issue and not the competence of the european union .
that is clearly with the member states . "
security in particular played a more central role in india 's relations to the united states , spiess said .
" a problem is the interaction between one country , india , on the one side and the 27-member state community , " spiess said .
" we all know there is no such thing as a consistent eu foreign policy , and security policy is now the domain of us-indo relations , which overshadows india 's interactions with the eu in terms of security relations . "
india wo n't succumb to climate pressure with the un conference in copenhagen just a few weeks away , climate change will also be a point of debate in new delhi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is also significantly affecting india " the western countries are pressuring india to join the fight against climate change more thoroughly , " spiess said .
" but india under no circumstances will accept any sort of legally binding reductions on its future greenhouse gas emissions trajectory . "
new delhi is resisting any binding emission cuts and demanding finance and technology from wealthy countries to help reduce emissions .
but there are other areas in which the two sides cooperate closely , such as energy , technology transfer , science and academic cooperation .
at this week 's summit , a cooperation agreement between the european atomic energy community euratom and india will be signed in the field of fusion energy research .
representatives will also launch a call for proposals for research in the field of solar energy , the european commission said .
" there 's plenty there for our leaders to get their teeth into , " watson said .
" the question is : where can we best find areas where we can make progress together and where there 's a real added value in cooperation . "
an equal partnership ?
for the eu , experts agreed , india is certainly an international partner to be taken seriously .
this was evident from the strategic partnership agreement in 2004 and the joint action plan in 2005 , revised in 2008 , which aims to deepen dialogue and cooperation .
" the eu does n't identify too many countries in the world with which they will enter into strategic partnerships , " said spiess .
" from the perspective of the eu , it 's crystal clear that india is identified as a stabilizing factor in the region and as a growing global player .
that 's why it 's a partner to count on . "
but it would go too far to say india was an equal partner , said christian wagner from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" for the eu , india is a developing country , " wagner told deutsche welle .
" the lion 's share of eu resources allocated to india in the next years deal with development goals . "
eu support is earmarked for helping india achieve the un millennium development goals , he said .
with respect to sentiments from new delhi , jain said there has been a shift in perception - despite the strong emphasis on trade and economic issues in the relationship .
" i think there has been a perceptible change in recent years and growing recognition among indian policymakers about the importance of the european union in world affairs , " jain said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many westerners were also taken hostage in mumbai , such as at the taj hotel " the eu never viewed india as an important security partner halfway around the world because their issues and priorities were very different , " jain said in an interview with deutsche welle .
but this changed after the terrorist attacks in mumbai last november .
the eu recognized that india was a significant player in anti-terrorism collaboration .
however , jain said the structure of the eu did not allow for too much optimism in what could be possibly achieved in this area .
" the eu is a very strange political creature , " jain said .
" we should not have too high expectations of what is going to be possible in the realm of security cooperation because insofar as intelligence is concerned , it is a very sensitive issue and not the competence of the european union .
that is clearly with the member states . "
security in particular played a more central role in india 's relations to the united states , spiess said .
" a problem is the interaction between one country , india , on the one side and the 27-member state community , " spiess said .
" we all know there is no such thing as a consistent eu foreign policy , and security policy is now the domain of us-indo relations , which overshadows india 's interactions with the eu in terms of security relations . "
india wo n't succumb to climate pressure with the un conference in copenhagen just a few weeks away , climate change will also be a point of debate in new delhi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is also significantly affecting india " the western countries are pressuring india to join the fight against climate change more thoroughly , " spiess said .
" but india under no circumstances will accept any sort of legally binding reductions on its future greenhouse gas emissions trajectory . "
new delhi is resisting any binding emission cuts and demanding finance and technology from wealthy countries to help reduce emissions .
but there are other areas in which the two sides cooperate closely , such as energy , technology transfer , science and academic cooperation .
at this week 's summit , a cooperation agreement between the european atomic energy community euratom and india will be signed in the field of fusion energy research .
representatives will also launch a call for proposals for research in the field of solar energy , the european commission said .
" there 's plenty there for our leaders to get their teeth into , " watson said .
" the question is : where can we best find areas where we can make progress together and where there 's a real added value in cooperation . "
an equal partnership ?
for the eu , experts agreed , india is certainly an international partner to be taken seriously .
this was evident from the strategic partnership agreement in 2004 and the joint action plan in 2005 , revised in 2008 , which aims to deepen dialogue and cooperation .
" the eu does n't identify too many countries in the world with which they will enter into strategic partnerships , " said spiess .
" from the perspective of the eu , it 's crystal clear that india is identified as a stabilizing factor in the region and as a growing global player .
that 's why it 's a partner to count on . "
but it would go too far to say india was an equal partner , said christian wagner from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" for the eu , india is a developing country , " wagner told deutsche welle .
" the lion 's share of eu resources allocated to india in the next years deal with development goals . "
eu support is earmarked for helping india achieve the un millennium development goals , he said .
with respect to sentiments from new delhi , jain said there has been a shift in perception - despite the strong emphasis on trade and economic issues in the relationship .
" i think there has been a perceptible change in recent years and growing recognition among indian policymakers about the importance of the european union in world affairs , " jain said .

but other significant issues are also on the agenda , though the two sides do n't always see eye-to-eye . a major sticking point at the eu-india summit is the planned free trade agreement -lrb- fta -rrb- between the two sides .
daniele smadja , head of the european commission 's delegation to india , said on wednesday that the talks needed a boost .
" the fta negotiations are very complex , " smadja said .
" we have to jump into the cold water of give and take . "
the time had come to exchange concessions , she said .
but clemens spiess , a lecturer at the south asia institute at the university of heidelberg , said he did not expect a final agreement to be reached .
" there are still a lot of hurdles , " spiess told deutsche welle .
these include intellectual property rights disputes and tariff disagreements .
he said he did not expect fta talks to conclude successfully until 2010 or 2011 .
security has become a common challenge in the past , the eu 's relations to india have focused primarily on trade and economic issues .
this comes as no surprise , as the eu is india 's largest trading partner .
graham watson , chairman of the european parliament delegation for relations with india , said trade has more than doubled between the two partners over the past five years .
according to parliament figures , bilateral trade is expected to exceed 70.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 104.5 billion -rrb- by 2010 and 160.6 billion euros by 2015 .
" clearly it 's mainly in the trade area that we want to talk , but we also recognize on both sides that we have a common challenge in promoting peace and comprehensive security , " watson told deutsche welle .
a security dialogue has been in place since 2006 .
the eu not only recognized india 's role as a force of stability in a volatile region , but also as one of the few democracies in the region , he said .
" democracy gives india a huge advantage over china in the medium and long-term , " watson said .
" it makes it far easier for the eu to deal with india , not least because once a decision is taken it represents a consensus of opinion and therefore to be stuck to . "
this perception was n't always the case , though , said rajendra k jain , professor and former chairman of the center for european studies at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de india -pipe- 05.11.2009 european union 's relations to india growing in intensity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts foresee a continued warming of relations between the european union and india the eu and india will focus on pushing their free trade pact during their 10th annual summit in new delhi on friday .
but other significant issues are also on the agenda , though the two sides do n't always see eye-to-eye . a major sticking point at the eu-india summit is the planned free trade agreement -lrb- fta -rrb- between the two sides .
daniele smadja , head of the european commission 's delegation to india , said on wednesday that the talks needed a boost .
" the fta negotiations are very complex , " smadja said .
" we have to jump into the cold water of give and take . "
the time had come to exchange concessions , she said .
but clemens spiess , a lecturer at the south asia institute at the university of heidelberg , said he did not expect a final agreement to be reached .
" there are still a lot of hurdles , " spiess told deutsche welle .
these include intellectual property rights disputes and tariff disagreements .
he said he did not expect fta talks to conclude successfully until 2010 or 2011 .
security has become a common challenge in the past , the eu 's relations to india have focused primarily on trade and economic issues .
this comes as no surprise , as the eu is india 's largest trading partner .
graham watson , chairman of the european parliament delegation for relations with india , said trade has more than doubled between the two partners over the past five years .
according to parliament figures , bilateral trade is expected to exceed 70.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 104.5 billion -rrb- by 2010 and 160.6 billion euros by 2015 .
" clearly it 's mainly in the trade area that we want to talk , but we also recognize on both sides that we have a common challenge in promoting peace and comprehensive security , " watson told deutsche welle .
a security dialogue has been in place since 2006 .
the eu not only recognized india 's role as a force of stability in a volatile region , but also as one of the few democracies in the region , he said .
" democracy gives india a huge advantage over china in the medium and long-term , " watson said .
" it makes it far easier for the eu to deal with india , not least because once a decision is taken it represents a consensus of opinion and therefore to be stuck to . "
this perception was n't always the case , though , said rajendra k jain , professor and former chairman of the center for european studies at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many westerners were also taken hostage in mumbai , such as at the taj hotel " the eu never viewed india as an important security partner halfway around the world because their issues and priorities were very different , " jain said in an interview with deutsche welle .
but this changed after the terrorist attacks in mumbai last november .
the eu recognized that india was a significant player in anti-terrorism collaboration .
however , jain said the structure of the eu did not allow for too much optimism in what could be possibly achieved in this area .
" the eu is a very strange political creature , " jain said .
" we should not have too high expectations of what is going to be possible in the realm of security cooperation because insofar as intelligence is concerned , it is a very sensitive issue and not the competence of the european union .
that is clearly with the member states . "
security in particular played a more central role in india 's relations to the united states , spiess said .
" a problem is the interaction between one country , india , on the one side and the 27-member state community , " spiess said .
" we all know there is no such thing as a consistent eu foreign policy , and security policy is now the domain of us-indo relations , which overshadows india 's interactions with the eu in terms of security relations . "
india wo n't succumb to climate pressure with the un conference in copenhagen just a few weeks away , climate change will also be a point of debate in new delhi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is also significantly affecting india " the western countries are pressuring india to join the fight against climate change more thoroughly , " spiess said .
" but india under no circumstances will accept any sort of legally binding reductions on its future greenhouse gas emissions trajectory . "
new delhi is resisting any binding emission cuts and demanding finance and technology from wealthy countries to help reduce emissions .
but there are other areas in which the two sides cooperate closely , such as energy , technology transfer , science and academic cooperation .
at this week 's summit , a cooperation agreement between the european atomic energy community euratom and india will be signed in the field of fusion energy research .
representatives will also launch a call for proposals for research in the field of solar energy , the european commission said .
" there 's plenty there for our leaders to get their teeth into , " watson said .
" the question is : where can we best find areas where we can make progress together and where there 's a real added value in cooperation . "
an equal partnership ?
for the eu , experts agreed , india is certainly an international partner to be taken seriously .
this was evident from the strategic partnership agreement in 2004 and the joint action plan in 2005 , revised in 2008 , which aims to deepen dialogue and cooperation .
" the eu does n't identify too many countries in the world with which they will enter into strategic partnerships , " said spiess .
" from the perspective of the eu , it 's crystal clear that india is identified as a stabilizing factor in the region and as a growing global player .
that 's why it 's a partner to count on . "
but it would go too far to say india was an equal partner , said christian wagner from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" for the eu , india is a developing country , " wagner told deutsche welle .
" the lion 's share of eu resources allocated to india in the next years deal with development goals . "
eu support is earmarked for helping india achieve the un millennium development goals , he said .
with respect to sentiments from new delhi , jain said there has been a shift in perception - despite the strong emphasis on trade and economic issues in the relationship .
" i think there has been a perceptible change in recent years and growing recognition among indian policymakers about the importance of the european union in world affairs , " jain said .

the announcement follows a decision by gm not to sell off the carmaker to canadian car-parts maker magna . general motors vice president john smith said wednesday that around 10,000 jobs would be slashed at the company 's european unit opel , which employs some 55,000 europeans in germany , spain , belgium , poland and the uk .
smith did not specify where the cuts would be made . the announcement comes less than a day after gm announced its decision not to sell off opel to a consortium led by canadian car-parts maker magna and russian state bank sberbank . the job cuts would be undertaken with the view to reduce costs at opel by around 30 percent , smith said , adding that the plan did not differ substantially from proposals for opel tabled by magna and sberbank . gm said it wanted to finalize its restructuring plans for opel as soon as possible for presentation to european governments . muted response the european commission has responded so far in neutral tones to the decision by gm to hold on to opel and its other european unit vauxhall . european union competition spokesman jonathan todd said merely that the commission , the eu 's executive body , " takes note " of the decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government was closely involved in bringing about the magna deal gm said it would keep its european operations because of an improvement in the economic environment . it 's also understood that gm was concerned that its position as a global company would be damaged if opel and vauxhall were competing with it in europe . european governments are now awaiting a possible request by gm for aid to help it restructure opel .
the magna-sberbank consortium had been set to receive a massive state aid package from germany to help along its restructuring plans . the german state support had been the subject of an eu investigation into whether the funds were linked to the maintenance of jobs in germany ahead of other european countries which host opel plants , a move which would have violated eu competition rules . juergen ruettgers , the state premier of north rhine-westphalia , where opel 's bochum plant is located , demanded that gm keep all its opel factories in germany running .
he told broadcaster zdf on wednesday that this should be a condition of any german state help . he also demanded that there be no operational redundancies in germany , and that any job cuts should be " socially responsible " .
ruettgers promised there would be no financial aid from north rhine-westphalia if the bochum plant were closed down .
" no-one can expect us to pay for the closure of the bochum factory , " he said . 3,000 opel workers are expected to appear at a demonstration on the bochum factory grounds on thursday afternoon .

the announcement follows a decision by gm not to sell off the carmaker to canadian car-parts maker magna . general motors vice president john smith said wednesday that around 10,000 jobs would be slashed at the company 's european unit opel , which employs some 55,000 europeans in germany , spain , belgium , poland and the uk .
smith did not specify where the cuts would be made . the announcement comes less than a day after gm announced its decision not to sell off opel to a consortium led by canadian car-parts maker magna and russian state bank sberbank . the job cuts would be undertaken with the view to reduce costs at opel by around 30 percent , smith said , adding that the plan did not differ substantially from proposals for opel tabled by magna and sberbank . gm said it wanted to finalize its restructuring plans for opel as soon as possible for presentation to european governments . muted response the european commission has responded so far in neutral tones to the decision by gm to hold on to opel and its other european unit vauxhall . european union competition spokesman jonathan todd said merely that the commission , the eu 's executive body , " takes note " of the decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government was closely involved in bringing about the magna deal gm said it would keep its european operations because of an improvement in the economic environment . it 's also understood that gm was concerned that its position as a global company would be damaged if opel and vauxhall were competing with it in europe . european governments are now awaiting a possible request by gm for aid to help it restructure opel .
the magna-sberbank consortium had been set to receive a massive state aid package from germany to help along its restructuring plans . the german state support had been the subject of an eu investigation into whether the funds were linked to the maintenance of jobs in germany ahead of other european countries which host opel plants , a move which would have violated eu competition rules . juergen ruettgers , the state premier of north rhine-westphalia , where opel 's bochum plant is located , demanded that gm keep all its opel factories in germany running .
he told broadcaster zdf on wednesday that this should be a condition of any german state help . he also demanded that there be no operational redundancies in germany , and that any job cuts should be " socially responsible " .

children are very susceptible to the disease and die at a rate of one every 30 seconds . scientists from throughout the world are meeting in nairobi to consider new research and treatments that may help eradicate malaria .
the disease poses a serious health threat in africa , but a promising new treatment is on the horizon . the treatment is a vaccine called rtss and has been tested for 20 years by scientists in africa .
experts hope that its effectiveness will be confirmed within three years , following the evaluation of field trials with infected children . the best results to date kenyan pediatrician walter otieno confirmed the significance of scientists ' recent research into treating malaria . " it is the first time that a vaccine against malaria has made it to the third and final testing phase , " he said .
" if it succeeds here , then the vaccine is ready for the market .
we are confident that in three to five years we will have an effective treatment that can be combined with other vaccinations to treat kids . " to date , the vaccine has shown promising results .
in the second testing phase , more than half of the children who received the vaccination no longer suffered severely from the mosquito-borne disease .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 05.11.2009 top athlete escaped the gdr using his aquatic talents großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cold water was the biggest challenge in escaping not everyone in the former east germany waited until the wall came down to go west .
axel mitbauer , a member of the gdr national swim team , was the only top athlete to actually use his sport to flee east germany . axel mitbauer 's escape from the german democratic republic 20 years before the fall of the wall was one of the most spectacular ways people chose to flee then east germany . as a member of the gdr national swim team and a master in the 400-meter freestyle , he used his athletic talent to cut through the iron curtain .
on the night of august 17 , 1969 , the then 19-year-old mitbauer swam from the boltenhagen resort area on the baltic sea to luebeck 's bay area . " water is my element , " mitbauer said , reminiscing about his career .
" it 's been my companion , as it were , for the past 51 years , and i still love it . " petroleum jelly to keep out the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 600 athletes escaped the gdr but 40 years ago , crossing the border presented a challenge .
the baltic sea was an area many used in their attempts to flee east germany , and guards were always on the alert as a result .
mitbauer studied the guards ' habits for a week and learned that they turned off the search lights shortly once an hour to allow them to cool .
on august 17 , around 9 p.m. , he grabbed his chance and dove into the water .
as the lights were turned back on , he went under water again and swam 25 kilometers -lrb- 15.5 miles -rrb- . " i had one minute to cross both the first and second sandbanks , " he recalled .
" but the biggest problem was the very cold water .
swimming in it for four to six hours is quite difficult .
nowadays , people can use neoprene suits , but back then , the only thing we could do was smear vaseline all over our bodies . " the baltic sea was just 18 degrees celsius -lrb- 64 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- the night he fled .
he used 30 tubes of petroleum jelly to protect himself against the cold . unhappy with life mitbauer said he was happy as an athlete in the gdr system , but he was n't pleased with life in the country .
when he traveled abroad for competitions , he also saw a huge discrepancy between reality and east german propaganda .
he said he felt his home country was a lawless state and realized early on that he wanted to leave - and that he could use his aquatic talents to do it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a divided east and west berlin " i basically used the east german system that promoted sports in the way it did to ultimately escape it and pursue my own goals , " he said . according to records kept by the former east german secret police , or stasi , more than 600 athletes escaped to the west by 1989 , the year the wall came down .
soccer player falko goetz , cyclist juergen kissner and coach joerg berger were some of them .
the stasi called referred to them as sports traitors . mitbauer 's frequent conversations with west german athletes during foreign competitions also aroused the suspicion of east german state security officials and he was even arrested before he fled .
they kept him in custody for seven weeks - in the stasi prison hohenschoenhausen in berlin .
he went through the gamut : solitary confinement , light deprivation , torture . planning his escape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parts of the wall have been turned into the open-air east side gallery but mitbauer divulged nothing and immediately began training for his escape in water holes at old coal-mining plants once he was released from prison .
yet even after fleeing to the west , mitbauer was still scared of the stasi . " of course i was scared , " he said .
" some people were killed after all .
others were drugged and dragged back to east germany .
someone even loosened the lug nuts on the wheels of my car once .
in the beginning , right after fleeing , i used to push a big cabinet in front of my apartment door . " still , once in the west , mitbauer quickly learned how to market himself .
he received 10,000 german marks back then from stern magazine for his personal story .
he certainly needed the money - considering that he started a new life nearly naked after his escape .

" i had wanted to spend the night on it , warm up from the sun the next morning and then swim on .
but a german ship ended up picking me up around 7 a.m. " it was a west german ship that took him to travemuende .
he was then taken to a reception camp in giessen , where he received identification documents .
stern journalists met him there and took him to hamburg , where he told them his story of escape . coaching fame mitbauer later studied sports education in cologne and worked as a coach in italy and switzerland .
he continues to live in switzerland and also coaches up-and-coming swim talents in karlsruhe , germany .
he 's coached swimming great jacques mayol , a frenchman , whose legendary two-man competition with italian enzo mairoca later appeared in the film " the big blue . " even today he said he understands why people in eastern and western germany do n't quite understand each other , even though the wall fell 20 years ago . " that gap will not be bridged until the next generation is at the fore - a generation that has grown up familiar only with a united germany , " he said .

under that pact , germans pay an income-dependent amount of their earnings towards improving infrastructure in the east .
klaus heiner roehl , a regional policy analyst at the cologne-based institute , said this is partly a matter of statistics and the ironic fact that the global economic crisis has hit germany 's western states harder than its eastern states .
" of course the economic crisis has affected eastern germany too , but to a smaller extent than western germany , " he told deutsche welle .
" this is because the big export companies are located in the western part of the country and this year , the convergence will be even faster than in the last year because the western german economy will shrink about 5 percent while with the eastern german economy , the negative growth is about 3 percent .

reiner eckert , director of the forum of contemporary history in leipzig , told deutsche welle that the peaceful revolution of the late ' 80s had achieved its ideals of democracy , freedom and unity in a reunited germany , but that problems remained between the two halves .
" the cities have adapted well and have developed their infrastructure , but there are still deficits , and in some ways , some of the pride in the peaceful revolution has evaporated , " he said .
" basically this has to do with the fact that amongst germans living in the eastern states , there is a feeling that they have not yet ‘ arrived ' and are still perceived as second-class citizens . "
east catching up although there are stark differences between development in cities and rural areas in the eastern states , roehl said that statistics for the east as a whole indicate that per capita gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- could reach 80 percent of those in the west of the country by 2020 .
this means that by then , some of the wealthiest eastern states could have overtaken some of their poorest western counterparts , another indicator that the time of the solidarity pact may have passed .
" the solidarity pact will continue to 2019 but from this -lrb- year -rrb- onwards … the amount of money is reduced year per year , " said roehl .
" and it is quite right to do it that way and we think it is also right that the solidarity pact will end in 2019 . "
roehl added that the iw institute 's findings could lead to increased resentment amongst many germans in the western part of the country at having to pay the solidarity tax .
" there is always some resentment on the side of the paying state , and also some resentment in the east that the solidarity pact will end , " he said .

roehl added that the iw institute 's findings could lead to increased resentment amongst many germans in the western part of the country at having to pay the solidarity tax .
" there is always some resentment on the side of the paying state , and also some resentment in the east that the solidarity pact will end , " he said .

under that pact , germans pay an income-dependent amount of their earnings towards improving infrastructure in the east .
klaus heiner roehl , a regional policy analyst at the cologne-based institute , said this is partly a matter of statistics and the ironic fact that the global economic crisis has hit germany 's western states harder than its eastern states .
" of course the economic crisis has affected eastern germany too , but to a smaller extent than western germany , " he told deutsche welle .
" this is because the big export companies are located in the western part of the country and this year , the convergence will be even faster than in the last year because the western german economy will shrink about 5 percent while with the eastern german economy , the negative growth is about 3 percent .

axel mitbauer , a member of the gdr national swim team , was the only top athlete to actually use his sport to flee east germany . axel mitbauer 's escape from the german democratic republic 20 years before the fall of the wall was one of the most spectacular ways people chose to flee then east germany . as a member of the gdr national swim team and a master in the 400-meter freestyle , he used his athletic talent to cut through the iron curtain .
on the night of august 17 , 1969 , the then 19-year-old mitbauer swam from the boltenhagen resort area on the baltic sea to luebeck 's bay area . " water is my element , " mitbauer said , reminiscing about his career .
" it 's been my companion , as it were , for the past 51 years , and i still love it . " petroleum jelly to keep out the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 600 athletes escaped the gdr but 40 years ago , crossing the border presented a challenge .
the baltic sea was an area many used in their attempts to flee east germany , and guards were always on the alert as a result .
mitbauer studied the guards ' habits for a week and learned that they turned off the search lights shortly once an hour to allow them to cool .
on august 17 , around 9 p.m. , he grabbed his chance and dove into the water .
as the lights were turned back on , he went under water again and swam 25 kilometers -lrb- 15.5 miles -rrb- . " i had one minute to cross both the first and second sandbanks , " he recalled .
" but the biggest problem was the very cold water .
swimming in it for four to six hours is quite difficult .
nowadays , people can use neoprene suits , but back then , the only thing we could do was smear vaseline all over our bodies . " the baltic sea was just 18 degrees celsius -lrb- 64 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- the night he fled .
he used 30 tubes of petroleum jelly to protect himself against the cold . unhappy with life mitbauer said he was happy as an athlete in the gdr system , but he was n't pleased with life in the country .
when he traveled abroad for competitions , he also saw a huge discrepancy between reality and east german propaganda .
he said he felt his home country was a lawless state and realized early on that he wanted to leave - and that he could use his aquatic talents to do it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a divided east and west berlin " i basically used the east german system that promoted sports in the way it did to ultimately escape it and pursue my own goals , " he said . according to records kept by the former east german secret police , or stasi , more than 600 athletes escaped to the west by 1989 , the year the wall came down .
soccer player falko goetz , cyclist juergen kissner and coach joerg berger were some of them .
the stasi called referred to them as sports traitors . mitbauer 's frequent conversations with west german athletes during foreign competitions also aroused the suspicion of east german state security officials and he was even arrested before he fled .
they kept him in custody for seven weeks - in the stasi prison hohenschoenhausen in berlin .
he went through the gamut : solitary confinement , light deprivation , torture . planning his escape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parts of the wall have been turned into the open-air east side gallery but mitbauer divulged nothing and immediately began training for his escape in water holes at old coal-mining plants once he was released from prison .
yet even after fleeing to the west , mitbauer was still scared of the stasi . " of course i was scared , " he said .
" some people were killed after all .
others were drugged and dragged back to east germany .
someone even loosened the lug nuts on the wheels of my car once .
in the beginning , right after fleeing , i used to push a big cabinet in front of my apartment door . " still , once in the west , mitbauer quickly learned how to market himself .
he received 10,000 german marks back then from stern magazine for his personal story .
he certainly needed the money - considering that he started a new life nearly naked after his escape .
the only thing in his possession when he arrived on shore at travemuende were his swim trunks , his flippers , a ring sewed into one of them , and a medal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swimmer axel mitbauer -lrb- l -rrb- , as a coach later in life " i left at 9 p.m. at night and arrived at a buoy at around 1 o 'clock in the morning , " he recalled .
" i had wanted to spend the night on it , warm up from the sun the next morning and then swim on .
but a german ship ended up picking me up around 7 a.m. " it was a west german ship that took him to travemuende .
he was then taken to a reception camp in giessen , where he received identification documents .
stern journalists met him there and took him to hamburg , where he told them his story of escape . coaching fame mitbauer later studied sports education in cologne and worked as a coach in italy and switzerland .
he continues to live in switzerland and also coaches up-and-coming swim talents in karlsruhe , germany .
he 's coached swimming great jacques mayol , a frenchman , whose legendary two-man competition with italian enzo mairoca later appeared in the film " the big blue . " even today he said he understands why people in eastern and western germany do n't quite understand each other , even though the wall fell 20 years ago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de investment -pipe- 05.11.2009 iraqis on mission to attract german investors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq has no shortage of projects in need of foreign investment british companies should invest more boldly in iraq , trade officials in baghdad say , adding that competitors - germany among them - are making their moves faster . there 's no doubt that there is much to rebuild in iraq .
gun battles , suicide bombings , and outdated or heavily damaged infrastructure have taken their toll on reconstruction efforts .
although iraq receives millions of euros in development aid , putting the country together again also requires foreign private investment .
the iraq investment and business forum , a two-day conference for german and iraqi investors , began on thursday in berlin .
sponsored by germany 's foreign office and the arab-german chamber of commerce and industry , among others , it comes on the heels of a similar conference in washington held last month , and in the midst of the 10-day baghdad international fair taking place from november 1-10 in iraq 's capital .
last november , iraqi finance minister bayan jabr estimated that iraq would need $ 400 billion -lrb- 270 billion euros -rrb- to rebuild , a figure that would be beyond the country 's reach without foreign investment .
the 2010 budget approved in october was just $ 67 billion .
forum organizers were expecting about 200 german entrepreneurs and 100 of their iraqi counterparts .
newly installed german economics minister rainer bruederle was also expected to attend .
abdulaziz al-mikhlafi , the general secretary of the arab-german chamber of commerce and industry , told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper that iraq was ripe for investment in sectors ranging from airports and highways to universities and the water supply .
" we will present a detailed picture of about 500 projects that iraq can only undertake with foreign support , " al-mikhlafi said .
" getting in on the ground floor " germany 's economic connection to iraq is growing .
german exports to iraq in the first half of this year were up by 96.2 percent compared to january to june 2008 , the organizers told afp .
machinery and vehicles account for most of the nearly 300 million euros -lrb- $ 446 million -rrb- in exports .
" the germans should make their move , " al-mikhlafi said .
" many others are already there - the french , koreans , chinese , japanese . "
the same advice was offered to the uk when it hosted the invest iraq 2009 conference in may . iraq 's deputy prime minister barham salih called on uk firms to recognize the potential his country holds for investors , telling them there was a " unique opportunity to get in on the ground floor of the new iraq . "
the british government sent several ministers to speak at the event as well , as if to demonstrate how seriously it takes the matter , and how badly it wants to encourage trading with iraq .
but have uk firms heeded the call ?
british trade with iraq is certainly on the increase : uk exports of services to the country were worth 273 million pounds -lrb- around 300 million euros -rrb- in 2007 , and 433 million pounds -lrb- around 480 million euros -rrb- in 2008 .
and uk exports of goods to iraq were up 6 percent in 2009 between january and july , compared to the same period last year .
but many say it 's still not enough .
according to mostafa bazergan of the iraqi british business and investment council , british companies are being left behind by international rivals when it comes to investing in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and gas are still predominant parts of the economy , but other areas also need investment " personally i criticize the british companies .
german companies , australian , italians - they are there , before the british companies .
i wonder when they will realize this is a mistake and they should correct it , " bazergan said .
“ brits are moving in , little by little ” but michael thomas , director general of the london-based middle east association , says british companies are moving into iraq .
a short while ago he arrived back from iraq on the largest uk trade mission ever to visit the country .
he traveled with british business leaders and was granted audiences with several iraqi government ministers keen to talk about opportunities for increased trade .
thomas insists british companies are already on the ground , investing .
“ oil and gas is moving ahead quite nicely , " thomas said .
" bp -lsb- british petroleum -rsb- have got a big deal down in the south with the chinese .
shell are also there .
penspen , a big pipeline company , are there .
we 've got a huge number of british companies there at the moment - little by little the brits are moving in . "
but thomas admits the brits might be moving in more slowly than competitors when it comes to investing in iraq , preferring to spend time building business relationships .
" it takes a bit longer , we do n't rush in madly , but once we 're there , we 're there for the long haul , " thomas said most of the british companies already in iraq are oil and gas firms - that sector is already proving very lucrative for uk business .
the hope is now that other british industries will move in - although security issues remain an overriding and often prohibitive concern . beyond gas and oil the uk government is now keen to encourage investment in iraq , having played a large role in the 2003 invasion of the country .
not only to help with its rebuilding and economic growth , but also because of the potential for money to be made for british firms .
investment is growing , and there have been notable successes already . thomas and bazergan agree that the opportunities for business investment in iraq are wide and plentiful , in industries including telecommunications , industry , agriculture , housing , water , waste water , and electricity .
thomas insists the list of services that british companies could be supplying to iraq is " absolutely endless . "

the move is in response to a boycott of the trial by karadzic . the judges at the un war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia ordered a court-appointed counsel to represent karadzic in the event he continued to boycott the hearings .
the genocide trial began on october 26 but the accused did not appear , claiming he had not been given enough time to prepare his defense .
karadzic had been warned on four occasions that his continued boycott would result in the appointment of a counsel to represent him .
" the accused has indeed substantially and persistently obstructed the proper and expeditious conduct of his trial by refusing to attend the proceedings , " said the written decision imposing the legal counsel .
" the accused 's conduct has effectively brought the trial to a halt , which is evidently his purpose . "
the icc judges said karadzic would still be able to represent himself following the appointment of the legal counsel , but that if he continued his boycott of the proceedings when the trial resumes on march 1 , 2010 , then the legal counsel would step in .
karadzic currently has a legal team consisting of 20 mainly volunteer legal advisors , but would forfeit that privilege if he continues his boycott .
the un court has charged karadzic with 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his role in the 1992-1995 war in bosnia .

gun battles , suicide bombings , and outdated or heavily damaged infrastructure have taken their toll on reconstruction efforts .
although iraq receives millions of euros in development aid , putting the country together again also requires foreign private investment .
the iraq investment and business forum , a two-day conference for german and iraqi investors , began on thursday in berlin .
sponsored by germany 's foreign office and the arab-german chamber of commerce and industry , among others , it comes on the heels of a similar conference in washington held last month , and in the midst of the 10-day baghdad international fair taking place from november 1-10 in iraq 's capital .
last november , iraqi finance minister bayan jabr estimated that iraq would need $ 400 billion -lrb- 270 billion euros -rrb- to rebuild , a figure that would be beyond the country 's reach without foreign investment .
the 2010 budget approved in october was just $ 67 billion .
forum organizers were expecting about 200 german entrepreneurs and 100 of their iraqi counterparts .
newly installed german economics minister rainer bruederle was also expected to attend .
abdulaziz al-mikhlafi , the general secretary of the arab-german chamber of commerce and industry , told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper that iraq was ripe for investment in sectors ranging from airports and highways to universities and the water supply .
" we will present a detailed picture of about 500 projects that iraq can only undertake with foreign support , " al-mikhlafi said .
" getting in on the ground floor " germany 's economic connection to iraq is growing .
german exports to iraq in the first half of this year were up by 96.2 percent compared to january to june 2008 , the organizers told afp .
machinery and vehicles account for most of the nearly 300 million euros -lrb- $ 446 million -rrb- in exports .
" the germans should make their move , " al-mikhlafi said .
" many others are already there - the french , koreans , chinese , japanese . "
the same advice was offered to the uk when it hosted the invest iraq 2009 conference in may . iraq 's deputy prime minister barham salih called on uk firms to recognize the potential his country holds for investors , telling them there was a " unique opportunity to get in on the ground floor of the new iraq . "
the british government sent several ministers to speak at the event as well , as if to demonstrate how seriously it takes the matter , and how badly it wants to encourage trading with iraq .
but have uk firms heeded the call ?
british trade with iraq is certainly on the increase : uk exports of services to the country were worth 273 million pounds -lrb- around 300 million euros -rrb- in 2007 , and 433 million pounds -lrb- around 480 million euros -rrb- in 2008 .
and uk exports of goods to iraq were up 6 percent in 2009 between january and july , compared to the same period last year .
but many say it 's still not enough .
according to mostafa bazergan of the iraqi british business and investment council , british companies are being left behind by international rivals when it comes to investing in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and gas are still predominant parts of the economy , but other areas also need investment " personally i criticize the british companies .
german companies , australian , italians - they are there , before the british companies .
i wonder when they will realize this is a mistake and they should correct it , " bazergan said .
“ brits are moving in , little by little ” but michael thomas , director general of the london-based middle east association , says british companies are moving into iraq .
a short while ago he arrived back from iraq on the largest uk trade mission ever to visit the country .
he traveled with british business leaders and was granted audiences with several iraqi government ministers keen to talk about opportunities for increased trade .
thomas insists british companies are already on the ground , investing .
“ oil and gas is moving ahead quite nicely , " thomas said .
" bp -lsb- british petroleum -rsb- have got a big deal down in the south with the chinese .
shell are also there .
penspen , a big pipeline company , are there .
we 've got a huge number of british companies there at the moment - little by little the brits are moving in . "
but thomas admits the brits might be moving in more slowly than competitors when it comes to investing in iraq , preferring to spend time building business relationships .
" it takes a bit longer , we do n't rush in madly , but once we 're there , we 're there for the long haul , " thomas said most of the british companies already in iraq are oil and gas firms - that sector is already proving very lucrative for uk business .
the hope is now that other british industries will move in - although security issues remain an overriding and often prohibitive concern . beyond gas and oil the uk government is now keen to encourage investment in iraq , having played a large role in the 2003 invasion of the country .
not only to help with its rebuilding and economic growth , but also because of the potential for money to be made for british firms .
investment is growing , and there have been notable successes already . thomas and bazergan agree that the opportunities for business investment in iraq are wide and plentiful , in industries including telecommunications , industry , agriculture , housing , water , waste water , and electricity .
thomas insists the list of services that british companies could be supplying to iraq is " absolutely endless . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de investment -pipe- 05.11.2009 iraqis on mission to attract german investors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq has no shortage of projects in need of foreign investment british companies should invest more boldly in iraq , trade officials in baghdad say , adding that competitors - germany among them - are making their moves faster . there 's no doubt that there is much to rebuild in iraq .
gun battles , suicide bombings , and outdated or heavily damaged infrastructure have taken their toll on reconstruction efforts .
although iraq receives millions of euros in development aid , putting the country together again also requires foreign private investment .
the iraq investment and business forum , a two-day conference for german and iraqi investors , began on thursday in berlin .
sponsored by germany 's foreign office and the arab-german chamber of commerce and industry , among others , it comes on the heels of a similar conference in washington held last month , and in the midst of the 10-day baghdad international fair taking place from november 1-10 in iraq 's capital .
last november , iraqi finance minister bayan jabr estimated that iraq would need $ 400 billion -lrb- 270 billion euros -rrb- to rebuild , a figure that would be beyond the country 's reach without foreign investment .
the 2010 budget approved in october was just $ 67 billion .
forum organizers were expecting about 200 german entrepreneurs and 100 of their iraqi counterparts .
newly installed german economics minister rainer bruederle was also expected to attend .
abdulaziz al-mikhlafi , the general secretary of the arab-german chamber of commerce and industry , told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper that iraq was ripe for investment in sectors ranging from airports and highways to universities and the water supply .
" we will present a detailed picture of about 500 projects that iraq can only undertake with foreign support , " al-mikhlafi said .
" getting in on the ground floor " germany 's economic connection to iraq is growing .
german exports to iraq in the first half of this year were up by 96.2 percent compared to january to june 2008 , the organizers told afp .
machinery and vehicles account for most of the nearly 300 million euros -lrb- $ 446 million -rrb- in exports .
" the germans should make their move , " al-mikhlafi said .
" many others are already there - the french , koreans , chinese , japanese . "
the same advice was offered to the uk when it hosted the invest iraq 2009 conference in may . iraq 's deputy prime minister barham salih called on uk firms to recognize the potential his country holds for investors , telling them there was a " unique opportunity to get in on the ground floor of the new iraq . "
the british government sent several ministers to speak at the event as well , as if to demonstrate how seriously it takes the matter , and how badly it wants to encourage trading with iraq .
but have uk firms heeded the call ?
british trade with iraq is certainly on the increase : uk exports of services to the country were worth 273 million pounds -lrb- around 300 million euros -rrb- in 2007 , and 433 million pounds -lrb- around 480 million euros -rrb- in 2008 .
and uk exports of goods to iraq were up 6 percent in 2009 between january and july , compared to the same period last year .
but many say it 's still not enough .
according to mostafa bazergan of the iraqi british business and investment council , british companies are being left behind by international rivals when it comes to investing in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and gas are still predominant parts of the economy , but other areas also need investment " personally i criticize the british companies .
german companies , australian , italians - they are there , before the british companies .
i wonder when they will realize this is a mistake and they should correct it , " bazergan said .
“ brits are moving in , little by little ” but michael thomas , director general of the london-based middle east association , says british companies are moving into iraq .
a short while ago he arrived back from iraq on the largest uk trade mission ever to visit the country .
he traveled with british business leaders and was granted audiences with several iraqi government ministers keen to talk about opportunities for increased trade .
thomas insists british companies are already on the ground , investing .
“ oil and gas is moving ahead quite nicely , " thomas said .
" bp -lsb- british petroleum -rsb- have got a big deal down in the south with the chinese .
shell are also there .
penspen , a big pipeline company , are there .
we 've got a huge number of british companies there at the moment - little by little the brits are moving in . "
but thomas admits the brits might be moving in more slowly than competitors when it comes to investing in iraq , preferring to spend time building business relationships .
" it takes a bit longer , we do n't rush in madly , but once we 're there , we 're there for the long haul , " thomas said most of the british companies already in iraq are oil and gas firms - that sector is already proving very lucrative for uk business .
the hope is now that other british industries will move in - although security issues remain an overriding and often prohibitive concern . beyond gas and oil the uk government is now keen to encourage investment in iraq , having played a large role in the 2003 invasion of the country .

thomas insists the list of services that british companies could be supplying to iraq is " absolutely endless . "

about $ 3 million , when the sport is basketball , the subject is sneakers , and the name is jordan . marcus jordan clearly wants to walk in his father 's shoes .
but doing so has turned out to be harder than he thought - in fact , it 's turned into a diss of million-dollar proportions .
on wednesday , the university of central florida and german sporting-goods company adidas learned the hard way that blood is sometimes thicker than even a massive wad of money , when the son of legendary chicago bulls guard michael jordan stepped into a pair of nikes instead of adidas basketball shoes , as planned .
now , the fight over what shoes marcus jordan can wear when he plays basketball for ucf means the school may have lost a $ 3-million-dollar sponsorship deal with adidas .
marcus wore a pair of white air jordans - the nike shoe made famous by his father - during an exhibition game between ucf and st. leo on wednesday night , the orlando sentinel reported .
but ucf is in the final year of a five-year contract with adidas that requires coaches and athletes to use the company 's apparel and equipment , which is distinctively marked with three black stripes .
deal or no deal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas shoes bear the company 's three-stripe logo regional adidas representatives say they had made a deal with the university to allow marcus jordan to wear the plain white nikes , but adidas higher-ups later begged to differ .
now , they say they will pull their funding .
adidas was seemingly unmoved by the fact that marcus wore black ankle cuffs distintively marked with the adidas logo , on top of his nikes .
in correspondence published by the associated press , a spokeswoman for adidas said the school has " chosen not to deliver on their contractual commitment to adidas , " and that , in turn , the company will not continue its relationship with the school .
the news has not been officially given to ucf yet , however .
while the school said it was " disappointed " by the possible loss of funding , ucf spokesman joe hornstein said they would respond further " once we receive official notice .

about $ 3 million , when the sport is basketball , the subject is sneakers , and the name is jordan . marcus jordan clearly wants to walk in his father 's shoes .
but doing so has turned out to be harder than he thought - in fact , it 's turned into a diss of million-dollar proportions .
on wednesday , the university of central florida and german sporting-goods company adidas learned the hard way that blood is sometimes thicker than even a massive wad of money , when the son of legendary chicago bulls guard michael jordan stepped into a pair of nikes instead of adidas basketball shoes , as planned .
now , the fight over what shoes marcus jordan can wear when he plays basketball for ucf means the school may have lost a $ 3-million-dollar sponsorship deal with adidas .
marcus wore a pair of white air jordans - the nike shoe made famous by his father - during an exhibition game between ucf and st. leo on wednesday night , the orlando sentinel reported .

in correspondence published by the associated press , a spokeswoman for adidas said the school has " chosen not to deliver on their contractual commitment to adidas , " and that , in turn , the company will not continue its relationship with the school .
the news has not been officially given to ucf yet , however .
while the school said it was " disappointed " by the possible loss of funding , ucf spokesman joe hornstein said they would respond further " once we receive official notice .

axel mitbauer , a member of the gdr national swim team , was the only top athlete to actually use his sport to flee east germany . axel mitbauer 's escape from the german democratic republic 20 years before the fall of the wall was one of the most spectacular ways people chose to flee then east germany . as a member of the gdr national swim team and a master in the 400-meter freestyle , he used his athletic talent to cut through the iron curtain .
on the night of august 17 , 1969 , the then 19-year-old mitbauer swam from the boltenhagen resort area on the baltic sea to luebeck 's bay area . " water is my element , " mitbauer said , reminiscing about his career .
" it 's been my companion , as it were , for the past 51 years , and i still love it . " petroleum jelly to keep out the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 600 athletes escaped the gdr but 40 years ago , crossing the border presented a challenge .
the baltic sea was an area many used in their attempts to flee east germany , and guards were always on the alert as a result .
mitbauer studied the guards ' habits for a week and learned that they turned off the search lights shortly once an hour to allow them to cool .
on august 17 , around 9 p.m. , he grabbed his chance and dove into the water .
as the lights were turned back on , he went under water again and swam 25 kilometers -lrb- 15.5 miles -rrb- . " i had one minute to cross both the first and second sandbanks , " he recalled .
" but the biggest problem was the very cold water .
swimming in it for four to six hours is quite difficult .
nowadays , people can use neoprene suits , but back then , the only thing we could do was smear vaseline all over our bodies . " the baltic sea was just 18 degrees celsius -lrb- 64 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- the night he fled .
he used 30 tubes of petroleum jelly to protect himself against the cold . unhappy with life mitbauer said he was happy as an athlete in the gdr system , but he was n't pleased with life in the country .
when he traveled abroad for competitions , he also saw a huge discrepancy between reality and east german propaganda .
he said he felt his home country was a lawless state and realized early on that he wanted to leave - and that he could use his aquatic talents to do it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a divided east and west berlin " i basically used the east german system that promoted sports in the way it did to ultimately escape it and pursue my own goals , " he said . according to records kept by the former east german secret police , or stasi , more than 600 athletes escaped to the west by 1989 , the year the wall came down .
soccer player falko goetz , cyclist juergen kissner and coach joerg berger were some of them .
the stasi called referred to them as sports traitors . mitbauer 's frequent conversations with west german athletes during foreign competitions also aroused the suspicion of east german state security officials and he was even arrested before he fled .
they kept him in custody for seven weeks - in the stasi prison hohenschoenhausen in berlin .
he went through the gamut : solitary confinement , light deprivation , torture . planning his escape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parts of the wall have been turned into the open-air east side gallery but mitbauer divulged nothing and immediately began training for his escape in water holes at old coal-mining plants once he was released from prison .
yet even after fleeing to the west , mitbauer was still scared of the stasi . " of course i was scared , " he said .
" some people were killed after all .
others were drugged and dragged back to east germany .
someone even loosened the lug nuts on the wheels of my car once .
in the beginning , right after fleeing , i used to push a big cabinet in front of my apartment door . " still , once in the west , mitbauer quickly learned how to market himself .
he received 10,000 german marks back then from stern magazine for his personal story .
he certainly needed the money - considering that he started a new life nearly naked after his escape .
the only thing in his possession when he arrived on shore at travemuende were his swim trunks , his flippers , a ring sewed into one of them , and a medal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swimmer axel mitbauer -lrb- l -rrb- , as a coach later in life " i left at 9 p.m. at night and arrived at a buoy at around 1 o 'clock in the morning , " he recalled .

but a german ship ended up picking me up around 7 a.m. " it was a west german ship that took him to travemuende .

the fate of german carmaker opel is germany 's biggest concern . the german foreign minister used his visit to washington to demand that us auto giant general motors take measures to protect german jobs at its troubled european subsidiary opel .
following a meeting with hillary clinton , foreign minister westerwelle said he was satisfied that the us government was not involved in general motors ' sudden decision this week to keep its european subsidiary opel .
clinton had stressed that gm alone chose to abandon a deal to sell opel to canadian-austrian parts-maker magna , westerwelle said after the meeting .
clinton had " strongly underlined the fact that the decision taken by general motors was a decision taken without any political influence , " westerwelle said .
" it 's very good news to receive . "
the meeting between the two foreign ministers came two days after gm dramatically reneged on its plans to sell opel , instead opting to restructure the company itself .
the german government had clearly favored the magna bid above others .
to sweeten the deal with magna and russian backers sberbank , the german government offered a 1.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 2.2 billion -rrb- bridging loan to gm to keep opel afloat until negotiations could be finalized .
westerwelle said thursday he had made clear that the loan " must be paid back , " adding that clinton had shown " understanding for our position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton thanked germany for its afghan troop deployment germany 's afghan role clinton did not address gm 's plans for opel at a press conference after the meeting , instead shifting the focus to germany 's military deployment in afghanistan .
she expressed her " great appreciation " for the german presence in the country , and called on the government of afghan president hamid karzai to do its best to combat the rampant corruption that tainted recent national elections held in the country .
westerwelle also called on karzai to address the " mismanagement " that saw thousands of fraudulent ballots cast during the elections that led to his re-election .
us relationship in talks at the us congress earlier thursday , westerwelle emphasized the significance of germany 's relationship with the us , referring to washington as berlin 's " strongest and most important partner beyond europe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has called on russia to also reduce its weapons stockpile he also touched on calls by us president barack obama for a world free of nuclear weapons , saying he wanted the initiative to be " accompanied not only by rhetoric but also by actions . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 05.11.2009 gm 's decision to keep opel could create problems for merkel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new confidence in global strategies as german foreign minister guido westerwelle prepared for talks in the us expected to address gm 's surprise u-turn on the sale of opel , the government in berlin was still smarting on thursday from the shock . general motors ' decision to back out of selling its german-based opel unit has sparked a mix of fury and surprise among german politicians , with reaction reaching from condemnation of gm 's behavior as " entirely unacceptable , " to " shock and annoyance " at detroit 's move .
the announcement was certainly embarrassing for german chancellor angela merkel .
it came just hours after she gave a historic speech before a joint session of the us congress in washington .
the newly re-elected chancellor had invested a lot of political capital backing a deal for gm to sell its troubled european subsidiary to a consortium led by canada 's magna and its russian banking partner sberbank .
apart from being embarrassing , gm 's reversal has created a complicated situation for the chancellor and several german state premiers , said gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn and merkel biographer .
it is almost as if gm had mugged leading german politicians , he told deutsche welle .
and now , no one knows what will happen next .
gm needs cash to restructure opel while gm has already declared it will repay a 1.5 billion euro bridge loan the german government had granted in may to keep gm 's european operations alive during negotiations to find an investor , berlin has been non-committal about whether to offer gm fresh government aid to save thousands of jobs at german opel plants .
the us auto giant faces the question of how to come up with the three-billions euros it estimates it needs to restructure its european operations .
but langguth pointed out that the german federal government is deeply in debt , and needs to try and balance its budget .
“ at the moment , merkel does not have a lot of room for maneuvering , ” lagguth said .
german political leaders may be angry , bonn political scientist langguth said , but that was not necessarily true for german taxpayers who had been wondering why state help was needed for the rüsselsheim-based automaker and were not happy with the government 's policy on opel in the first place .
“ the taxpayers do n't like to pay the insolvencies of the big companies , while the state would normally do nothing for smaller and medium-sized companies when they are insolvent , ” langguth said .
merkel 's previous coalition government with the social democrats had made billions of euros in public funds available to prop up companies hit by the crisis . ”
angry opel workers protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of opel workers vent their anger in protests gm vice president john smith , meanwhile , said there was very little difference between the offers put forward by magna and what gm had in mind for opel .
gm announced it planned to cut about 10,000 jobs , almost a fifth of the workers employed by gm in europe .
meanwhile on thursday , thousands of opel employees in germany walked off their jobs to join mass rallyes in protest of gm 's decision . there are four opel plants in germany , but the future of the plant in bochum in north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- is likely to be of major concern for chancellor merkel .
the prospect of job losses at the plant in germany 's most populous state could cost her christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- party votes in state elections in nrw in may 2010 .
should the cdu lose power in the state , merkel 's government would no longer have a centre-right majority in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , and that would in turn allow opposition parties to block legislation .

the announcement was certainly embarrassing for german chancellor angela merkel .
it came just hours after she gave a historic speech before a joint session of the us congress in washington .
the newly re-elected chancellor had invested a lot of political capital backing a deal for gm to sell its troubled european subsidiary to a consortium led by canada 's magna and its russian banking partner sberbank .
apart from being embarrassing , gm 's reversal has created a complicated situation for the chancellor and several german state premiers , said gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn and merkel biographer .
it is almost as if gm had mugged leading german politicians , he told deutsche welle .
and now , no one knows what will happen next .
gm needs cash to restructure opel while gm has already declared it will repay a 1.5 billion euro bridge loan the german government had granted in may to keep gm 's european operations alive during negotiations to find an investor , berlin has been non-committal about whether to offer gm fresh government aid to save thousands of jobs at german opel plants .
the us auto giant faces the question of how to come up with the three-billions euros it estimates it needs to restructure its european operations .
but langguth pointed out that the german federal government is deeply in debt , and needs to try and balance its budget .
“ at the moment , merkel does not have a lot of room for maneuvering , ” lagguth said .
german political leaders may be angry , bonn political scientist langguth said , but that was not necessarily true for german taxpayers who had been wondering why state help was needed for the rüsselsheim-based automaker and were not happy with the government 's policy on opel in the first place .
“ the taxpayers do n't like to pay the insolvencies of the big companies , while the state would normally do nothing for smaller and medium-sized companies when they are insolvent , ” langguth said .
merkel 's previous coalition government with the social democrats had made billions of euros in public funds available to prop up companies hit by the crisis . ”
angry opel workers protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of opel workers vent their anger in protests gm vice president john smith , meanwhile , said there was very little difference between the offers put forward by magna and what gm had in mind for opel .
gm announced it planned to cut about 10,000 jobs , almost a fifth of the workers employed by gm in europe .
meanwhile on thursday , thousands of opel employees in germany walked off their jobs to join mass rallyes in protest of gm 's decision . there are four opel plants in germany , but the future of the plant in bochum in north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- is likely to be of major concern for chancellor merkel .
the prospect of job losses at the plant in germany 's most populous state could cost her christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- party votes in state elections in nrw in may 2010 .
should the cdu lose power in the state , merkel 's government would no longer have a centre-right majority in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , and that would in turn allow opposition parties to block legislation .

gm needs cash to restructure opel while gm has already declared it will repay a 1.5 billion euro bridge loan the german government had granted in may to keep gm 's european operations alive during negotiations to find an investor , berlin has been non-committal about whether to offer gm fresh government aid to save thousands of jobs at german opel plants .
the us auto giant faces the question of how to come up with the three-billions euros it estimates it needs to restructure its european operations .
but langguth pointed out that the german federal government is deeply in debt , and needs to try and balance its budget .
“ at the moment , merkel does not have a lot of room for maneuvering , ” lagguth said .
german political leaders may be angry , bonn political scientist langguth said , but that was not necessarily true for german taxpayers who had been wondering why state help was needed for the rüsselsheim-based automaker and were not happy with the government 's policy on opel in the first place .
“ the taxpayers do n't like to pay the insolvencies of the big companies , while the state would normally do nothing for smaller and medium-sized companies when they are insolvent , ” langguth said .
merkel 's previous coalition government with the social democrats had made billions of euros in public funds available to prop up companies hit by the crisis . ”
angry opel workers protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of opel workers vent their anger in protests gm vice president john smith , meanwhile , said there was very little difference between the offers put forward by magna and what gm had in mind for opel .
gm announced it planned to cut about 10,000 jobs , almost a fifth of the workers employed by gm in europe .
meanwhile on thursday , thousands of opel employees in germany walked off their jobs to join mass rallyes in protest of gm 's decision . there are four opel plants in germany , but the future of the plant in bochum in north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- is likely to be of major concern for chancellor merkel .
the prospect of job losses at the plant in germany 's most populous state could cost her christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- party votes in state elections in nrw in may 2010 .
should the cdu lose power in the state , merkel 's government would no longer have a centre-right majority in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , and that would in turn allow opposition parties to block legislation .

the fate of german carmaker opel is germany 's biggest concern . the german foreign minister used his visit to washington to demand that us auto giant general motors take measures to protect german jobs at its troubled european subsidiary opel .
following a meeting with hillary clinton , foreign minister westerwelle said he was satisfied that the us government was not involved in general motors ' sudden decision this week to keep its european subsidiary opel .

clinton had stressed that gm alone chose to abandon a deal to sell opel to canadian-austrian parts-maker magna , westerwelle said after the meeting .
clinton had " strongly underlined the fact that the decision taken by general motors was a decision taken without any political influence , " westerwelle said .
" it 's very good news to receive . "
the meeting between the two foreign ministers came two days after gm dramatically reneged on its plans to sell opel , instead opting to restructure the company itself .
the german government had clearly favored the magna bid above others .
to sweeten the deal with magna and russian backers sberbank , the german government offered a 1.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 2.2 billion -rrb- bridging loan to gm to keep opel afloat until negotiations could be finalized .
westerwelle said thursday he had made clear that the loan " must be paid back , " adding that clinton had shown " understanding for our position .

she expressed her " great appreciation " for the german presence in the country , and called on the government of afghan president hamid karzai to do its best to combat the rampant corruption that tainted recent national elections held in the country .
westerwelle also called on karzai to address the " mismanagement " that saw thousands of fraudulent ballots cast during the elections that led to his re-election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 05.11.2009 eastern germany catching up to west " faster than thought " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern german cities like dresden are catching up to western cities a recent study suggests that the economies of germany ’ s eastern states , once under the gdr 's communist regime , may be catching up to those of their western counterparts faster than previously thought . according to the iw german economic research institute , standards of living in the east have soared so much that the german solidarity pact may not be needed after its scheduled expiry date in 2019 .
under that pact , germans pay an income-dependent amount of their earnings towards improving infrastructure in the east .
klaus heiner roehl , a regional policy analyst at the cologne-based institute , said this is partly a matter of statistics and the ironic fact that the global economic crisis has hit germany 's western states harder than its eastern states .
" of course the economic crisis has affected eastern germany too , but to a smaller extent than western germany , " he told deutsche welle .
" this is because the big export companies are located in the western part of the country and this year , the convergence will be even faster than in the last year because the western german economy will shrink about 5 percent while with the eastern german economy , the negative growth is about 3 percent . "
the institute 's study shows that the eastern states lose half a percent of their population to western states each year , a fact that is often overlooked .
despite this however , annual growth in the eastern states is half a percent higher than growth in the western states .
east-west divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germans flooded into the west after the fall of the berlin wall these findings contradict the more populist belief that , even after 19 years of reunification , eastern germany is floundering not only economically but also psychologically .
reiner eckert , director of the forum of contemporary history in leipzig , told deutsche welle that the peaceful revolution of the late ' 80s had achieved its ideals of democracy , freedom and unity in a reunited germany , but that problems remained between the two halves .
" the cities have adapted well and have developed their infrastructure , but there are still deficits , and in some ways , some of the pride in the peaceful revolution has evaporated , " he said .
" basically this has to do with the fact that amongst germans living in the eastern states , there is a feeling that they have not yet ‘ arrived ' and are still perceived as second-class citizens . "
east catching up although there are stark differences between development in cities and rural areas in the eastern states , roehl said that statistics for the east as a whole indicate that per capita gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- could reach 80 percent of those in the west of the country by 2020 .
this means that by then , some of the wealthiest eastern states could have overtaken some of their poorest western counterparts , another indicator that the time of the solidarity pact may have passed .
" the solidarity pact will continue to 2019 but from this -lrb- year -rrb- onwards … the amount of money is reduced year per year , " said roehl .
" and it is quite right to do it that way and we think it is also right that the solidarity pact will end in 2019 . "
roehl added that the iw institute 's findings could lead to increased resentment amongst many germans in the western part of the country at having to pay the solidarity tax .
" there is always some resentment on the side of the paying state , and also some resentment in the east that the solidarity pact will end , " he said .

gun battles , suicide bombings , and outdated or heavily damaged infrastructure have taken their toll on reconstruction efforts .
although iraq receives millions of euros in development aid , putting the country together again also requires foreign private investment .
the iraq investment and business forum , a two-day conference for german and iraqi investors , began on thursday in berlin .
sponsored by germany 's foreign office and the arab-german chamber of commerce and industry , among others , it comes on the heels of a similar conference in washington held last month , and in the midst of the 10-day baghdad international fair taking place from november 1-10 in iraq 's capital .
last november , iraqi finance minister bayan jabr estimated that iraq would need $ 400 billion -lrb- 270 billion euros -rrb- to rebuild , a figure that would be beyond the country 's reach without foreign investment .
the 2010 budget approved in october was just $ 67 billion .
forum organizers were expecting about 200 german entrepreneurs and 100 of their iraqi counterparts .
newly installed german economics minister rainer bruederle was also expected to attend .
abdulaziz al-mikhlafi , the general secretary of the arab-german chamber of commerce and industry , told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper that iraq was ripe for investment in sectors ranging from airports and highways to universities and the water supply .
" we will present a detailed picture of about 500 projects that iraq can only undertake with foreign support , " al-mikhlafi said .
" getting in on the ground floor " germany 's economic connection to iraq is growing .
german exports to iraq in the first half of this year were up by 96.2 percent compared to january to june 2008 , the organizers told afp .
machinery and vehicles account for most of the nearly 300 million euros -lrb- $ 446 million -rrb- in exports .
" the germans should make their move , " al-mikhlafi said .
" many others are already there - the french , koreans , chinese , japanese . "
the same advice was offered to the uk when it hosted the invest iraq 2009 conference in may . iraq 's deputy prime minister barham salih called on uk firms to recognize the potential his country holds for investors , telling them there was a " unique opportunity to get in on the ground floor of the new iraq . "
the british government sent several ministers to speak at the event as well , as if to demonstrate how seriously it takes the matter , and how badly it wants to encourage trading with iraq .
but have uk firms heeded the call ?
british trade with iraq is certainly on the increase : uk exports of services to the country were worth 273 million pounds -lrb- around 300 million euros -rrb- in 2007 , and 433 million pounds -lrb- around 480 million euros -rrb- in 2008 .
and uk exports of goods to iraq were up 6 percent in 2009 between january and july , compared to the same period last year .
but many say it 's still not enough .
according to mostafa bazergan of the iraqi british business and investment council , british companies are being left behind by international rivals when it comes to investing in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and gas are still predominant parts of the economy , but other areas also need investment " personally i criticize the british companies .
german companies , australian , italians - they are there , before the british companies .
i wonder when they will realize this is a mistake and they should correct it , " bazergan said .
“ brits are moving in , little by little ” but michael thomas , director general of the london-based middle east association , says british companies are moving into iraq .
a short while ago he arrived back from iraq on the largest uk trade mission ever to visit the country .
he traveled with british business leaders and was granted audiences with several iraqi government ministers keen to talk about opportunities for increased trade .
thomas insists british companies are already on the ground , investing .
“ oil and gas is moving ahead quite nicely , " thomas said .
" bp -lsb- british petroleum -rsb- have got a big deal down in the south with the chinese .
shell are also there .
penspen , a big pipeline company , are there .
we 've got a huge number of british companies there at the moment - little by little the brits are moving in . "
but thomas admits the brits might be moving in more slowly than competitors when it comes to investing in iraq , preferring to spend time building business relationships .
" it takes a bit longer , we do n't rush in madly , but once we 're there , we 're there for the long haul , " thomas said most of the british companies already in iraq are oil and gas firms - that sector is already proving very lucrative for uk business .
the hope is now that other british industries will move in - although security issues remain an overriding and often prohibitive concern . beyond gas and oil the uk government is now keen to encourage investment in iraq , having played a large role in the 2003 invasion of the country .
not only to help with its rebuilding and economic growth , but also because of the potential for money to be made for british firms .
investment is growing , and there have been notable successes already . thomas and bazergan agree that the opportunities for business investment in iraq are wide and plentiful , in industries including telecommunications , industry , agriculture , housing , water , waste water , and electricity .
thomas insists the list of services that british companies could be supplying to iraq is " absolutely endless . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de investment -pipe- 05.11.2009 iraqis on mission to attract german investors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq has no shortage of projects in need of foreign investment british companies should invest more boldly in iraq , trade officials in baghdad say , adding that competitors - germany among them - are making their moves faster . there 's no doubt that there is much to rebuild in iraq .
gun battles , suicide bombings , and outdated or heavily damaged infrastructure have taken their toll on reconstruction efforts .
although iraq receives millions of euros in development aid , putting the country together again also requires foreign private investment .
the iraq investment and business forum , a two-day conference for german and iraqi investors , began on thursday in berlin .
sponsored by germany 's foreign office and the arab-german chamber of commerce and industry , among others , it comes on the heels of a similar conference in washington held last month , and in the midst of the 10-day baghdad international fair taking place from november 1-10 in iraq 's capital .
last november , iraqi finance minister bayan jabr estimated that iraq would need $ 400 billion -lrb- 270 billion euros -rrb- to rebuild , a figure that would be beyond the country 's reach without foreign investment .
the 2010 budget approved in october was just $ 67 billion .
forum organizers were expecting about 200 german entrepreneurs and 100 of their iraqi counterparts .
newly installed german economics minister rainer bruederle was also expected to attend .
abdulaziz al-mikhlafi , the general secretary of the arab-german chamber of commerce and industry , told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper that iraq was ripe for investment in sectors ranging from airports and highways to universities and the water supply .
" we will present a detailed picture of about 500 projects that iraq can only undertake with foreign support , " al-mikhlafi said .
" getting in on the ground floor " germany 's economic connection to iraq is growing .
german exports to iraq in the first half of this year were up by 96.2 percent compared to january to june 2008 , the organizers told afp .
machinery and vehicles account for most of the nearly 300 million euros -lrb- $ 446 million -rrb- in exports .
" the germans should make their move , " al-mikhlafi said .
" many others are already there - the french , koreans , chinese , japanese . "
the same advice was offered to the uk when it hosted the invest iraq 2009 conference in may . iraq 's deputy prime minister barham salih called on uk firms to recognize the potential his country holds for investors , telling them there was a " unique opportunity to get in on the ground floor of the new iraq . "
the british government sent several ministers to speak at the event as well , as if to demonstrate how seriously it takes the matter , and how badly it wants to encourage trading with iraq .
but have uk firms heeded the call ?
british trade with iraq is certainly on the increase : uk exports of services to the country were worth 273 million pounds -lrb- around 300 million euros -rrb- in 2007 , and 433 million pounds -lrb- around 480 million euros -rrb- in 2008 .
and uk exports of goods to iraq were up 6 percent in 2009 between january and july , compared to the same period last year .
but many say it 's still not enough .
according to mostafa bazergan of the iraqi british business and investment council , british companies are being left behind by international rivals when it comes to investing in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and gas are still predominant parts of the economy , but other areas also need investment " personally i criticize the british companies .
german companies , australian , italians - they are there , before the british companies .
i wonder when they will realize this is a mistake and they should correct it , " bazergan said .
“ brits are moving in , little by little ” but michael thomas , director general of the london-based middle east association , says british companies are moving into iraq .
a short while ago he arrived back from iraq on the largest uk trade mission ever to visit the country .
he traveled with british business leaders and was granted audiences with several iraqi government ministers keen to talk about opportunities for increased trade .
thomas insists british companies are already on the ground , investing .
“ oil and gas is moving ahead quite nicely , " thomas said .
" bp -lsb- british petroleum -rsb- have got a big deal down in the south with the chinese .
shell are also there .
penspen , a big pipeline company , are there .
we 've got a huge number of british companies there at the moment - little by little the brits are moving in . "
but thomas admits the brits might be moving in more slowly than competitors when it comes to investing in iraq , preferring to spend time building business relationships .
" it takes a bit longer , we do n't rush in madly , but once we 're there , we 're there for the long haul , " thomas said most of the british companies already in iraq are oil and gas firms - that sector is already proving very lucrative for uk business .
the hope is now that other british industries will move in - although security issues remain an overriding and often prohibitive concern . beyond gas and oil the uk government is now keen to encourage investment in iraq , having played a large role in the 2003 invasion of the country .
not only to help with its rebuilding and economic growth , but also because of the potential for money to be made for british firms .
investment is growing , and there have been notable successes already . thomas and bazergan agree that the opportunities for business investment in iraq are wide and plentiful , in industries including telecommunications , industry , agriculture , housing , water , waste water , and electricity .
thomas insists the list of services that british companies could be supplying to iraq is " absolutely endless . "

the move is in response to a boycott of the trial by karadzic . the judges at the un war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia ordered a court-appointed counsel to represent karadzic in the event he continued to boycott the hearings .
the genocide trial began on october 26 but the accused did not appear , claiming he had not been given enough time to prepare his defense .
karadzic had been warned on four occasions that his continued boycott would result in the appointment of a counsel to represent him .
" the accused has indeed substantially and persistently obstructed the proper and expeditious conduct of his trial by refusing to attend the proceedings , " said the written decision imposing the legal counsel .
" the accused 's conduct has effectively brought the trial to a halt , which is evidently his purpose . "
the icc judges said karadzic would still be able to represent himself following the appointment of the legal counsel , but that if he continued his boycott of the proceedings when the trial resumes on march 1 , 2010 , then the legal counsel would step in .
karadzic currently has a legal team consisting of 20 mainly volunteer legal advisors , but would forfeit that privilege if he continues his boycott .
the un court has charged karadzic with 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his role in the 1992-1995 war in bosnia .

about $ 3 million , when the sport is basketball , the subject is sneakers , and the name is jordan . marcus jordan clearly wants to walk in his father 's shoes .
but doing so has turned out to be harder than he thought - in fact , it 's turned into a diss of million-dollar proportions .
on wednesday , the university of central florida and german sporting-goods company adidas learned the hard way that blood is sometimes thicker than even a massive wad of money , when the son of legendary chicago bulls guard michael jordan stepped into a pair of nikes instead of adidas basketball shoes , as planned .
now , the fight over what shoes marcus jordan can wear when he plays basketball for ucf means the school may have lost a $ 3-million-dollar sponsorship deal with adidas .
marcus wore a pair of white air jordans - the nike shoe made famous by his father - during an exhibition game between ucf and st. leo on wednesday night , the orlando sentinel reported .
but ucf is in the final year of a five-year contract with adidas that requires coaches and athletes to use the company 's apparel and equipment , which is distinctively marked with three black stripes .
deal or no deal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas shoes bear the company 's three-stripe logo regional adidas representatives say they had made a deal with the university to allow marcus jordan to wear the plain white nikes , but adidas higher-ups later begged to differ .
now , they say they will pull their funding .
adidas was seemingly unmoved by the fact that marcus wore black ankle cuffs distintively marked with the adidas logo , on top of his nikes .
in correspondence published by the associated press , a spokeswoman for adidas said the school has " chosen not to deliver on their contractual commitment to adidas , " and that , in turn , the company will not continue its relationship with the school .
the news has not been officially given to ucf yet , however .
while the school said it was " disappointed " by the possible loss of funding , ucf spokesman joe hornstein said they would respond further " once we receive official notice . " meanwhile , the sting of the loss may have been offset by the win in the exhibition game , where ucf beat st. leo , 84 to 65. jen / ap / afp / reuters editor : deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de investment -pipe- 05.11.2009 iraqis on mission to attract german investors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq has no shortage of projects in need of foreign investment british companies should invest more boldly in iraq , trade officials in baghdad say , adding that competitors - germany among them - are making their moves faster . there 's no doubt that there is much to rebuild in iraq .
gun battles , suicide bombings , and outdated or heavily damaged infrastructure have taken their toll on reconstruction efforts .
although iraq receives millions of euros in development aid , putting the country together again also requires foreign private investment .
the iraq investment and business forum , a two-day conference for german and iraqi investors , began on thursday in berlin .
sponsored by germany 's foreign office and the arab-german chamber of commerce and industry , among others , it comes on the heels of a similar conference in washington held last month , and in the midst of the 10-day baghdad international fair taking place from november 1-10 in iraq 's capital .
last november , iraqi finance minister bayan jabr estimated that iraq would need $ 400 billion -lrb- 270 billion euros -rrb- to rebuild , a figure that would be beyond the country 's reach without foreign investment .
the 2010 budget approved in october was just $ 67 billion .
forum organizers were expecting about 200 german entrepreneurs and 100 of their iraqi counterparts .
newly installed german economics minister rainer bruederle was also expected to attend .
abdulaziz al-mikhlafi , the general secretary of the arab-german chamber of commerce and industry , told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper that iraq was ripe for investment in sectors ranging from airports and highways to universities and the water supply .
" we will present a detailed picture of about 500 projects that iraq can only undertake with foreign support , " al-mikhlafi said .
" getting in on the ground floor " germany 's economic connection to iraq is growing .
german exports to iraq in the first half of this year were up by 96.2 percent compared to january to june 2008 , the organizers told afp .
machinery and vehicles account for most of the nearly 300 million euros -lrb- $ 446 million -rrb- in exports .
" the germans should make their move , " al-mikhlafi said .
" many others are already there - the french , koreans , chinese , japanese . "
the same advice was offered to the uk when it hosted the invest iraq 2009 conference in may . iraq 's deputy prime minister barham salih called on uk firms to recognize the potential his country holds for investors , telling them there was a " unique opportunity to get in on the ground floor of the new iraq . "
the british government sent several ministers to speak at the event as well , as if to demonstrate how seriously it takes the matter , and how badly it wants to encourage trading with iraq .
but have uk firms heeded the call ?
british trade with iraq is certainly on the increase : uk exports of services to the country were worth 273 million pounds -lrb- around 300 million euros -rrb- in 2007 , and 433 million pounds -lrb- around 480 million euros -rrb- in 2008 .
and uk exports of goods to iraq were up 6 percent in 2009 between january and july , compared to the same period last year .
but many say it 's still not enough .
according to mostafa bazergan of the iraqi british business and investment council , british companies are being left behind by international rivals when it comes to investing in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and gas are still predominant parts of the economy , but other areas also need investment " personally i criticize the british companies .
german companies , australian , italians - they are there , before the british companies .
i wonder when they will realize this is a mistake and they should correct it , " bazergan said .
“ brits are moving in , little by little ” but michael thomas , director general of the london-based middle east association , says british companies are moving into iraq .
a short while ago he arrived back from iraq on the largest uk trade mission ever to visit the country .
he traveled with british business leaders and was granted audiences with several iraqi government ministers keen to talk about opportunities for increased trade .
thomas insists british companies are already on the ground , investing .
“ oil and gas is moving ahead quite nicely , " thomas said .
" bp -lsb- british petroleum -rsb- have got a big deal down in the south with the chinese .
shell are also there .
penspen , a big pipeline company , are there .
we 've got a huge number of british companies there at the moment - little by little the brits are moving in . "
but thomas admits the brits might be moving in more slowly than competitors when it comes to investing in iraq , preferring to spend time building business relationships .
" it takes a bit longer , we do n't rush in madly , but once we 're there , we 're there for the long haul , " thomas said most of the british companies already in iraq are oil and gas firms - that sector is already proving very lucrative for uk business .
the hope is now that other british industries will move in - although security issues remain an overriding and often prohibitive concern . beyond gas and oil the uk government is now keen to encourage investment in iraq , having played a large role in the 2003 invasion of the country .
not only to help with its rebuilding and economic growth , but also because of the potential for money to be made for british firms .
investment is growing , and there have been notable successes already . thomas and bazergan agree that the opportunities for business investment in iraq are wide and plentiful , in industries including telecommunications , industry , agriculture , housing , water , waste water , and electricity .
thomas insists the list of services that british companies could be supplying to iraq is " absolutely endless . "

under that pact , germans pay an income-dependent amount of their earnings towards improving infrastructure in the east .
klaus heiner roehl , a regional policy analyst at the cologne-based institute , said this is partly a matter of statistics and the ironic fact that the global economic crisis has hit germany 's western states harder than its eastern states .
" of course the economic crisis has affected eastern germany too , but to a smaller extent than western germany , " he told deutsche welle .
" this is because the big export companies are located in the western part of the country and this year , the convergence will be even faster than in the last year because the western german economy will shrink about 5 percent while with the eastern german economy , the negative growth is about 3 percent . "
the institute 's study shows that the eastern states lose half a percent of their population to western states each year , a fact that is often overlooked .
despite this however , annual growth in the eastern states is half a percent higher than growth in the western states .
east-west divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germans flooded into the west after the fall of the berlin wall these findings contradict the more populist belief that , even after 19 years of reunification , eastern germany is floundering not only economically but also psychologically .
reiner eckert , director of the forum of contemporary history in leipzig , told deutsche welle that the peaceful revolution of the late ' 80s had achieved its ideals of democracy , freedom and unity in a reunited germany , but that problems remained between the two halves .
" the cities have adapted well and have developed their infrastructure , but there are still deficits , and in some ways , some of the pride in the peaceful revolution has evaporated , " he said .
" basically this has to do with the fact that amongst germans living in the eastern states , there is a feeling that they have not yet ‘ arrived ' and are still perceived as second-class citizens . "
east catching up although there are stark differences between development in cities and rural areas in the eastern states , roehl said that statistics for the east as a whole indicate that per capita gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- could reach 80 percent of those in the west of the country by 2020 .
this means that by then , some of the wealthiest eastern states could have overtaken some of their poorest western counterparts , another indicator that the time of the solidarity pact may have passed .
" the solidarity pact will continue to 2019 but from this -lrb- year -rrb- onwards … the amount of money is reduced year per year , " said roehl .
" and it is quite right to do it that way and we think it is also right that the solidarity pact will end in 2019 . "
roehl added that the iw institute 's findings could lead to increased resentment amongst many germans in the western part of the country at having to pay the solidarity tax .
" there is always some resentment on the side of the paying state , and also some resentment in the east that the solidarity pact will end , " he said .

" of course the economic crisis has affected eastern germany too , but to a smaller extent than western germany , " he told deutsche welle .
" this is because the big export companies are located in the western part of the country and this year , the convergence will be even faster than in the last year because the western german economy will shrink about 5 percent while with the eastern german economy , the negative growth is about 3 percent . "
the institute 's study shows that the eastern states lose half a percent of their population to western states each year , a fact that is often overlooked .
despite this however , annual growth in the eastern states is half a percent higher than growth in the western states .
east-west divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germans flooded into the west after the fall of the berlin wall these findings contradict the more populist belief that , even after 19 years of reunification , eastern germany is floundering not only economically but also psychologically .
reiner eckert , director of the forum of contemporary history in leipzig , told deutsche welle that the peaceful revolution of the late ' 80s had achieved its ideals of democracy , freedom and unity in a reunited germany , but that problems remained between the two halves .
" the cities have adapted well and have developed their infrastructure , but there are still deficits , and in some ways , some of the pride in the peaceful revolution has evaporated , " he said .
" basically this has to do with the fact that amongst germans living in the eastern states , there is a feeling that they have not yet ‘ arrived ' and are still perceived as second-class citizens . "
east catching up although there are stark differences between development in cities and rural areas in the eastern states , roehl said that statistics for the east as a whole indicate that per capita gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- could reach 80 percent of those in the west of the country by 2020 .
this means that by then , some of the wealthiest eastern states could have overtaken some of their poorest western counterparts , another indicator that the time of the solidarity pact may have passed .
" the solidarity pact will continue to 2019 but from this -lrb- year -rrb- onwards … the amount of money is reduced year per year , " said roehl .
" and it is quite right to do it that way and we think it is also right that the solidarity pact will end in 2019 . "
roehl added that the iw institute 's findings could lead to increased resentment amongst many germans in the western part of the country at having to pay the solidarity tax .
" there is always some resentment on the side of the paying state , and also some resentment in the east that the solidarity pact will end , " he said .

about $ 3 million , when the sport is basketball , the subject is sneakers , and the name is jordan . marcus jordan clearly wants to walk in his father 's shoes .
but doing so has turned out to be harder than he thought - in fact , it 's turned into a diss of million-dollar proportions .
on wednesday , the university of central florida and german sporting-goods company adidas learned the hard way that blood is sometimes thicker than even a massive wad of money , when the son of legendary chicago bulls guard michael jordan stepped into a pair of nikes instead of adidas basketball shoes , as planned .
now , the fight over what shoes marcus jordan can wear when he plays basketball for ucf means the school may have lost a $ 3-million-dollar sponsorship deal with adidas .
marcus wore a pair of white air jordans - the nike shoe made famous by his father - during an exhibition game between ucf and st. leo on wednesday night , the orlando sentinel reported .
but ucf is in the final year of a five-year contract with adidas that requires coaches and athletes to use the company 's apparel and equipment , which is distinctively marked with three black stripes .

adidas was seemingly unmoved by the fact that marcus wore black ankle cuffs distintively marked with the adidas logo , on top of his nikes .
in correspondence published by the associated press , a spokeswoman for adidas said the school has " chosen not to deliver on their contractual commitment to adidas , " and that , in turn , the company will not continue its relationship with the school .
the news has not been officially given to ucf yet , however .
while the school said it was " disappointed " by the possible loss of funding , ucf spokesman joe hornstein said they would respond further " once we receive official notice .

gun battles , suicide bombings , and outdated or heavily damaged infrastructure have taken their toll on reconstruction efforts .
although iraq receives millions of euros in development aid , putting the country together again also requires foreign private investment .
the iraq investment and business forum , a two-day conference for german and iraqi investors , began on thursday in berlin .
sponsored by germany 's foreign office and the arab-german chamber of commerce and industry , among others , it comes on the heels of a similar conference in washington held last month , and in the midst of the 10-day baghdad international fair taking place from november 1-10 in iraq 's capital .
last november , iraqi finance minister bayan jabr estimated that iraq would need $ 400 billion -lrb- 270 billion euros -rrb- to rebuild , a figure that would be beyond the country 's reach without foreign investment .
the 2010 budget approved in october was just $ 67 billion .
forum organizers were expecting about 200 german entrepreneurs and 100 of their iraqi counterparts .
newly installed german economics minister rainer bruederle was also expected to attend .
abdulaziz al-mikhlafi , the general secretary of the arab-german chamber of commerce and industry , told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper that iraq was ripe for investment in sectors ranging from airports and highways to universities and the water supply .
" we will present a detailed picture of about 500 projects that iraq can only undertake with foreign support , " al-mikhlafi said .
" getting in on the ground floor " germany 's economic connection to iraq is growing .
german exports to iraq in the first half of this year were up by 96.2 percent compared to january to june 2008 , the organizers told afp .
machinery and vehicles account for most of the nearly 300 million euros -lrb- $ 446 million -rrb- in exports .
" the germans should make their move , " al-mikhlafi said .
" many others are already there - the french , koreans , chinese , japanese . "
the same advice was offered to the uk when it hosted the invest iraq 2009 conference in may . iraq 's deputy prime minister barham salih called on uk firms to recognize the potential his country holds for investors , telling them there was a " unique opportunity to get in on the ground floor of the new iraq . "
the british government sent several ministers to speak at the event as well , as if to demonstrate how seriously it takes the matter , and how badly it wants to encourage trading with iraq .
but have uk firms heeded the call ?
british trade with iraq is certainly on the increase : uk exports of services to the country were worth 273 million pounds -lrb- around 300 million euros -rrb- in 2007 , and 433 million pounds -lrb- around 480 million euros -rrb- in 2008 .
and uk exports of goods to iraq were up 6 percent in 2009 between january and july , compared to the same period last year .
but many say it 's still not enough .
according to mostafa bazergan of the iraqi british business and investment council , british companies are being left behind by international rivals when it comes to investing in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and gas are still predominant parts of the economy , but other areas also need investment " personally i criticize the british companies .
german companies , australian , italians - they are there , before the british companies .
i wonder when they will realize this is a mistake and they should correct it , " bazergan said .
“ brits are moving in , little by little ” but michael thomas , director general of the london-based middle east association , says british companies are moving into iraq .
a short while ago he arrived back from iraq on the largest uk trade mission ever to visit the country .
he traveled with british business leaders and was granted audiences with several iraqi government ministers keen to talk about opportunities for increased trade .
thomas insists british companies are already on the ground , investing .
“ oil and gas is moving ahead quite nicely , " thomas said .
" bp -lsb- british petroleum -rsb- have got a big deal down in the south with the chinese .
shell are also there .
penspen , a big pipeline company , are there .
we 've got a huge number of british companies there at the moment - little by little the brits are moving in . "
but thomas admits the brits might be moving in more slowly than competitors when it comes to investing in iraq , preferring to spend time building business relationships .
" it takes a bit longer , we do n't rush in madly , but once we 're there , we 're there for the long haul , " thomas said most of the british companies already in iraq are oil and gas firms - that sector is already proving very lucrative for uk business .
the hope is now that other british industries will move in - although security issues remain an overriding and often prohibitive concern . beyond gas and oil the uk government is now keen to encourage investment in iraq , having played a large role in the 2003 invasion of the country .
not only to help with its rebuilding and economic growth , but also because of the potential for money to be made for british firms .
investment is growing , and there have been notable successes already . thomas and bazergan agree that the opportunities for business investment in iraq are wide and plentiful , in industries including telecommunications , industry , agriculture , housing , water , waste water , and electricity .
thomas insists the list of services that british companies could be supplying to iraq is " absolutely endless . "

about $ 3 million , when the sport is basketball , the subject is sneakers , and the name is jordan . marcus jordan clearly wants to walk in his father 's shoes .
but doing so has turned out to be harder than he thought - in fact , it 's turned into a diss of million-dollar proportions .
on wednesday , the university of central florida and german sporting-goods company adidas learned the hard way that blood is sometimes thicker than even a massive wad of money , when the son of legendary chicago bulls guard michael jordan stepped into a pair of nikes instead of adidas basketball shoes , as planned .
now , the fight over what shoes marcus jordan can wear when he plays basketball for ucf means the school may have lost a $ 3-million-dollar sponsorship deal with adidas .
marcus wore a pair of white air jordans - the nike shoe made famous by his father - during an exhibition game between ucf and st. leo on wednesday night , the orlando sentinel reported .
but ucf is in the final year of a five-year contract with adidas that requires coaches and athletes to use the company 's apparel and equipment , which is distinctively marked with three black stripes .
deal or no deal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas shoes bear the company 's three-stripe logo regional adidas representatives say they had made a deal with the university to allow marcus jordan to wear the plain white nikes , but adidas higher-ups later begged to differ .
now , they say they will pull their funding .
adidas was seemingly unmoved by the fact that marcus wore black ankle cuffs distintively marked with the adidas logo , on top of his nikes .
in correspondence published by the associated press , a spokeswoman for adidas said the school has " chosen not to deliver on their contractual commitment to adidas , " and that , in turn , the company will not continue its relationship with the school .
the news has not been officially given to ucf yet , however .
while the school said it was " disappointed " by the possible loss of funding , ucf spokesman joe hornstein said they would respond further " once we receive official notice . " meanwhile , the sting of the loss may have been offset by the win in the exhibition game , where ucf beat st. leo , 84 to 65. jen / ap / afp / reuters editor : deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

under that pact , germans pay an income-dependent amount of their earnings towards improving infrastructure in the east .
klaus heiner roehl , a regional policy analyst at the cologne-based institute , said this is partly a matter of statistics and the ironic fact that the global economic crisis has hit germany 's western states harder than its eastern states .
" of course the economic crisis has affected eastern germany too , but to a smaller extent than western germany , " he told deutsche welle .
" this is because the big export companies are located in the western part of the country and this year , the convergence will be even faster than in the last year because the western german economy will shrink about 5 percent while with the eastern german economy , the negative growth is about 3 percent . "
the institute 's study shows that the eastern states lose half a percent of their population to western states each year , a fact that is often overlooked .
despite this however , annual growth in the eastern states is half a percent higher than growth in the western states .
east-west divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germans flooded into the west after the fall of the berlin wall these findings contradict the more populist belief that , even after 19 years of reunification , eastern germany is floundering not only economically but also psychologically .
reiner eckert , director of the forum of contemporary history in leipzig , told deutsche welle that the peaceful revolution of the late ' 80s had achieved its ideals of democracy , freedom and unity in a reunited germany , but that problems remained between the two halves .
" the cities have adapted well and have developed their infrastructure , but there are still deficits , and in some ways , some of the pride in the peaceful revolution has evaporated , " he said .
" basically this has to do with the fact that amongst germans living in the eastern states , there is a feeling that they have not yet ‘ arrived ' and are still perceived as second-class citizens . "
east catching up although there are stark differences between development in cities and rural areas in the eastern states , roehl said that statistics for the east as a whole indicate that per capita gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- could reach 80 percent of those in the west of the country by 2020 .
this means that by then , some of the wealthiest eastern states could have overtaken some of their poorest western counterparts , another indicator that the time of the solidarity pact may have passed .
" the solidarity pact will continue to 2019 but from this -lrb- year -rrb- onwards … the amount of money is reduced year per year , " said roehl .
" and it is quite right to do it that way and we think it is also right that the solidarity pact will end in 2019 . "
roehl added that the iw institute 's findings could lead to increased resentment amongst many germans in the western part of the country at having to pay the solidarity tax .
" there is always some resentment on the side of the paying state , and also some resentment in the east that the solidarity pact will end , " he said .

the fate of german carmaker opel is germany 's biggest concern . the german foreign minister used his visit to washington to demand that us auto giant general motors take measures to protect german jobs at its troubled european subsidiary opel .
following a meeting with hillary clinton , foreign minister westerwelle said he was satisfied that the us government was not involved in general motors ' sudden decision this week to keep its european subsidiary opel .
clinton had stressed that gm alone chose to abandon a deal to sell opel to canadian-austrian parts-maker magna , westerwelle said after the meeting .
clinton had " strongly underlined the fact that the decision taken by general motors was a decision taken without any political influence , " westerwelle said .
" it 's very good news to receive . "
the meeting between the two foreign ministers came two days after gm dramatically reneged on its plans to sell opel , instead opting to restructure the company itself .
the german government had clearly favored the magna bid above others .
to sweeten the deal with magna and russian backers sberbank , the german government offered a 1.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 2.2 billion -rrb- bridging loan to gm to keep opel afloat until negotiations could be finalized .
westerwelle said thursday he had made clear that the loan " must be paid back , " adding that clinton had shown " understanding for our position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton thanked germany for its afghan troop deployment germany 's afghan role clinton did not address gm 's plans for opel at a press conference after the meeting , instead shifting the focus to germany 's military deployment in afghanistan .
she expressed her " great appreciation " for the german presence in the country , and called on the government of afghan president hamid karzai to do its best to combat the rampant corruption that tainted recent national elections held in the country .
westerwelle also called on karzai to address the " mismanagement " that saw thousands of fraudulent ballots cast during the elections that led to his re-election .
us relationship in talks at the us congress earlier thursday , westerwelle emphasized the significance of germany 's relationship with the us , referring to washington as berlin 's " strongest and most important partner beyond europe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has called on russia to also reduce its weapons stockpile he also touched on calls by us president barack obama for a world free of nuclear weapons , saying he wanted the initiative to be " accompanied not only by rhetoric but also by actions . "
he predicted that the next eighteen months show decide whether the coming decade would be one of " disarmament or armament " .
clinton , meanwhile , announced thursday she would be attending ceremonies in berlin next week to mark the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall. dfm / afp / ap editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both countries moved quickly to recall their respective ambassadors with thailand announcing a review of bilateral ties . thai prime minister abhisit vejjajiva said thursday the recall of thailand ’ s ambassador to cambodia was in retaliation over the appointment of former leader thaksin shinawatra as an advisor to cambodian leader , hun sen. the move by thailand was quickly followed by cambodia which later announced it was recalling its ambassador to thailand .
the appointment of thaksin follows a recent increase in tensions between cambodia and thailand over the former fugitive leader during a recent summit of south east asian leaders when prime minister hun sen praised thaksin .
thaksin , ousted from power in a 2006 coup , was found guilty last year by a thai court on charges of corruption and conflict of interest in a land deal involving his wife .
he fled thailand before the two year jail sentence was handed down .
kraisak choonhavan , a member of abhisit ’ s governing democrat party , says bilateral ties have been severely damaged by hun sen ’ s decision .
" as i see it , unless hun sen does a big reversal of his policy appointing thaksin , this is going to take us towards very serious problems in our relations .
it was totally unpredictable that hun sen would go to this extent , i must say . "
further escalation possible kraisak said there was a danger of the dispute escalating further , possibly with vital border crossings between the neighbouring countries being shut down .
in recent years , thailand and cambodia have faced strained bilateral relations over disputed land surrounding an 11th century khmer temple .
brief border clashes have led to casualties on both sides .
thaksin is known to have long standing close ties with hun sen in both business and politics .
but senior cambodian opposition parliamentarian son chhay says he does not expect thaksin to make a major contribution to the cambodian economy .
" it will be better if thaksin stays away from cambodia .
we do not understand the decision of our prime minister here in appointing mr. thaksin .
in cambodia we have so many advisors already .
thaksin was perhaps a successful businessman in thailand but his kind of knowledge is not suitable for cambodia where we have so many problems with corruption already . "
a campaign by thaksin 's supporters ?
obervers in thailand say the cambodian appointment appears to be part of a plan by thaksin 's supporters to undermine the abhisit government in a bid to return their former leader to power .
human rights watch ’ s representative sunai pasuk calls it a " two-pronged strategy " .
according to him , thaksin 's supporters are trying " to discredit the government through the media , in parliament , on the street .
the other theatre of thaksin ’ s political operations is outside thailand using malaysia , cambodia as well as dubai to show that the government is not respected . "
analysts say thaksin ’ s supporters are trying to weaken the government before the thai economy starts to fully recover from the recent reecession , and to force abhisit to call fresh elections in 2010 .

both countries moved quickly to recall their respective ambassadors with thailand announcing a review of bilateral ties . thai prime minister abhisit vejjajiva said thursday the recall of thailand ’ s ambassador to cambodia was in retaliation over the appointment of former leader thaksin shinawatra as an advisor to cambodian leader , hun sen. the move by thailand was quickly followed by cambodia which later announced it was recalling its ambassador to thailand .
the appointment of thaksin follows a recent increase in tensions between cambodia and thailand over the former fugitive leader during a recent summit of south east asian leaders when prime minister hun sen praised thaksin .
thaksin , ousted from power in a 2006 coup , was found guilty last year by a thai court on charges of corruption and conflict of interest in a land deal involving his wife .
he fled thailand before the two year jail sentence was handed down .
kraisak choonhavan , a member of abhisit ’ s governing democrat party , says bilateral ties have been severely damaged by hun sen ’ s decision .
" as i see it , unless hun sen does a big reversal of his policy appointing thaksin , this is going to take us towards very serious problems in our relations .
it was totally unpredictable that hun sen would go to this extent , i must say . "
further escalation possible kraisak said there was a danger of the dispute escalating further , possibly with vital border crossings between the neighbouring countries being shut down .
in recent years , thailand and cambodia have faced strained bilateral relations over disputed land surrounding an 11th century khmer temple .
brief border clashes have led to casualties on both sides .

sharmistha , a private tutor in kolkata , agrees : " it is impossible for the teachers to give all the required knowledge that they want to impart in the school ; so the students simply require some special care in order to know all that they need to know . "
fierce competition besides teaching deficits in the government and even private schools , it is mainly the tough competition for popular careers like those of a doctor , an engineer or a civil servant which makes parents and students go for coaching centres .

in order to secure an additional income , teachers have also been known to teach only part of the curriculum in class and then request the students to come for private tuition for the rest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 05.11.2009 cambodia , thailand recall ambassadors in row over thaksin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime ministers hun sen , left , and abhisit vejjajiva at a meeting earlier this year political tensions between thailand and cambodia have escalated after cambodian prime minister hun sen appointed former thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra as an advisor .
both countries moved quickly to recall their respective ambassadors with thailand announcing a review of bilateral ties . thai prime minister abhisit vejjajiva said thursday the recall of thailand ’ s ambassador to cambodia was in retaliation over the appointment of former leader thaksin shinawatra as an advisor to cambodian leader , hun sen. the move by thailand was quickly followed by cambodia which later announced it was recalling its ambassador to thailand .
the appointment of thaksin follows a recent increase in tensions between cambodia and thailand over the former fugitive leader during a recent summit of south east asian leaders when prime minister hun sen praised thaksin .
thaksin , ousted from power in a 2006 coup , was found guilty last year by a thai court on charges of corruption and conflict of interest in a land deal involving his wife .
he fled thailand before the two year jail sentence was handed down .
kraisak choonhavan , a member of abhisit ’ s governing democrat party , says bilateral ties have been severely damaged by hun sen ’ s decision .
" as i see it , unless hun sen does a big reversal of his policy appointing thaksin , this is going to take us towards very serious problems in our relations .
it was totally unpredictable that hun sen would go to this extent , i must say . "
further escalation possible kraisak said there was a danger of the dispute escalating further , possibly with vital border crossings between the neighbouring countries being shut down .
in recent years , thailand and cambodia have faced strained bilateral relations over disputed land surrounding an 11th century khmer temple .
brief border clashes have led to casualties on both sides .
thaksin is known to have long standing close ties with hun sen in both business and politics .
but senior cambodian opposition parliamentarian son chhay says he does not expect thaksin to make a major contribution to the cambodian economy .
" it will be better if thaksin stays away from cambodia .
we do not understand the decision of our prime minister here in appointing mr. thaksin .
in cambodia we have so many advisors already .
thaksin was perhaps a successful businessman in thailand but his kind of knowledge is not suitable for cambodia where we have so many problems with corruption already . "
a campaign by thaksin 's supporters ?
obervers in thailand say the cambodian appointment appears to be part of a plan by thaksin 's supporters to undermine the abhisit government in a bid to return their former leader to power .
human rights watch ’ s representative sunai pasuk calls it a " two-pronged strategy " .
according to him , thaksin 's supporters are trying " to discredit the government through the media , in parliament , on the street .
the other theatre of thaksin ’ s political operations is outside thailand using malaysia , cambodia as well as dubai to show that the government is not respected . "
analysts say thaksin ’ s supporters are trying to weaken the government before the thai economy starts to fully recover from the recent reecession , and to force abhisit to call fresh elections in 2010 .

kraisak choonhavan , a member of abhisit ’ s governing democrat party , says bilateral ties have been severely damaged by hun sen ’ s decision .
" as i see it , unless hun sen does a big reversal of his policy appointing thaksin , this is going to take us towards very serious problems in our relations .
it was totally unpredictable that hun sen would go to this extent , i must say . "
further escalation possible kraisak said there was a danger of the dispute escalating further , possibly with vital border crossings between the neighbouring countries being shut down .
in recent years , thailand and cambodia have faced strained bilateral relations over disputed land surrounding an 11th century khmer temple .
brief border clashes have led to casualties on both sides .
thaksin is known to have long standing close ties with hun sen in both business and politics .
but senior cambodian opposition parliamentarian son chhay says he does not expect thaksin to make a major contribution to the cambodian economy .
" it will be better if thaksin stays away from cambodia .
we do not understand the decision of our prime minister here in appointing mr. thaksin .
in cambodia we have so many advisors already .
thaksin was perhaps a successful businessman in thailand but his kind of knowledge is not suitable for cambodia where we have so many problems with corruption already . "
a campaign by thaksin 's supporters ?
obervers in thailand say the cambodian appointment appears to be part of a plan by thaksin 's supporters to undermine the abhisit government in a bid to return their former leader to power .
human rights watch ’ s representative sunai pasuk calls it a " two-pronged strategy " .
according to him , thaksin 's supporters are trying " to discredit the government through the media , in parliament , on the street .
the other theatre of thaksin ’ s political operations is outside thailand using malaysia , cambodia as well as dubai to show that the government is not respected . "
analysts say thaksin ’ s supporters are trying to weaken the government before the thai economy starts to fully recover from the recent reecession , and to force abhisit to call fresh elections in 2010 .

both countries moved quickly to recall their respective ambassadors with thailand announcing a review of bilateral ties . thai prime minister abhisit vejjajiva said thursday the recall of thailand ’ s ambassador to cambodia was in retaliation over the appointment of former leader thaksin shinawatra as an advisor to cambodian leader , hun sen. the move by thailand was quickly followed by cambodia which later announced it was recalling its ambassador to thailand .
the appointment of thaksin follows a recent increase in tensions between cambodia and thailand over the former fugitive leader during a recent summit of south east asian leaders when prime minister hun sen praised thaksin .

more and more coaching centres are mushrooming all over the country .
the practice is now so widespread that not going to a private tuition class is seen as an abnormality . marks , marks and more marks !
what was your score in mathematics , english and the sciences ?
these questions from parents , teachers , and later on from employers are driving millions of indian students into private tuition classes after school .
shiladitya bhaduri , a class ten student studying in an elite private school in kolkata also attends tuition classes instead of playing with his friends . " for a bright future , private tuitions are needed because schools are not always guiding us in the right way " , he explains .
sharmistha , a private tutor in kolkata , agrees : " it is impossible for the teachers to give all the required knowledge that they want to impart in the school ; so the students simply require some special care in order to know all that they need to know . "
fierce competition besides teaching deficits in the government and even private schools , it is mainly the tough competition for popular careers like those of a doctor , an engineer or a civil servant which makes parents and students go for coaching centres .
utpal moitra wants his son to be a government officer , a dream that many indian parents have for their children .
" i want him to be a civil servant but i don ’ t really know whether he will be able to do it or not , " says moitra .
" if i get some good institution which can give him the coaching to get him into a good position , i don ’ t mind sending him to a coaching centre . "

some students spend years in the hostels of these tutorial homes hoping to gain entry to their dream profession .
" quantity education " saswati goswami , who teaches at the indian institute of mass communication in new delhi , believes that a fundamental problem with the indian education system is behind the tuition craze : " it is not quality education but more about quantity education " , she says .
" how many marks you score decides your future prospects .
in order to make sure that knowledge becomes more important in education than marks , you 'd have to introduce a system where your knowledge is tested .
so you don ’ t just have to memorise something , you have to internalise something .
you have to read the book and the teacher has to guide you through the whole course , which is not done . "
coaching centres are a lucrative business as they hardly pay any taxes .
some indian states have even put a ban on full time teachers running private tuition classes , as this might impact their performance in school .
in order to secure an additional income , teachers have also been known to teach only part of the curriculum in class and then request the students to come for private tuition for the rest .
so far , government orders have not proven effective in stopping such practices ; and as long as fierce competition and the craze for better marks continue to put pressure on both parents and children , the tuition boom is likely to continue .

he fled thailand before the two year jail sentence was handed down .
kraisak choonhavan , a member of abhisit ’ s governing democrat party , says bilateral ties have been severely damaged by hun sen ’ s decision .
" as i see it , unless hun sen does a big reversal of his policy appointing thaksin , this is going to take us towards very serious problems in our relations .
it was totally unpredictable that hun sen would go to this extent , i must say . "
further escalation possible kraisak said there was a danger of the dispute escalating further , possibly with vital border crossings between the neighbouring countries being shut down .
in recent years , thailand and cambodia have faced strained bilateral relations over disputed land surrounding an 11th century khmer temple .
brief border clashes have led to casualties on both sides .
thaksin is known to have long standing close ties with hun sen in both business and politics .
but senior cambodian opposition parliamentarian son chhay says he does not expect thaksin to make a major contribution to the cambodian economy .
" it will be better if thaksin stays away from cambodia .
we do not understand the decision of our prime minister here in appointing mr. thaksin .
in cambodia we have so many advisors already .
thaksin was perhaps a successful businessman in thailand but his kind of knowledge is not suitable for cambodia where we have so many problems with corruption already . "
a campaign by thaksin 's supporters ?
obervers in thailand say the cambodian appointment appears to be part of a plan by thaksin 's supporters to undermine the abhisit government in a bid to return their former leader to power .
human rights watch ’ s representative sunai pasuk calls it a " two-pronged strategy " .
according to him , thaksin 's supporters are trying " to discredit the government through the media , in parliament , on the street .
the other theatre of thaksin ’ s political operations is outside thailand using malaysia , cambodia as well as dubai to show that the government is not respected . "
analysts say thaksin ’ s supporters are trying to weaken the government before the thai economy starts to fully recover from the recent reecession , and to force abhisit to call fresh elections in 2010 .

fierce competition besides teaching deficits in the government and even private schools , it is mainly the tough competition for popular careers like those of a doctor , an engineer or a civil servant which makes parents and students go for coaching centres .

coaching centres are a lucrative business as they hardly pay any taxes .
some indian states have even put a ban on full time teachers running private tuition classes , as this might impact their performance in school .
in order to secure an additional income , teachers have also been known to teach only part of the curriculum in class and then request the students to come for private tuition for the rest .
so far , government orders have not proven effective in stopping such practices ; and as long as fierce competition and the craze for better marks continue to put pressure on both parents and children , the tuition boom is likely to continue .

the announcement follows a decision by gm not to sell off the carmaker to canadian car-parts maker magna . general motors vice president john smith said wednesday that around 10,000 jobs would be slashed at the company 's european unit opel , which employs some 55,000 europeans in germany , spain , belgium , poland and the uk .
smith did not specify where the cuts would be made . the announcement comes less than a day after gm announced its decision not to sell off opel to a consortium led by canadian car-parts maker magna and russian state bank sberbank . the job cuts would be undertaken with the view to reduce costs at opel by around 30 percent , smith said , adding that the plan did not differ substantially from proposals for opel tabled by magna and sberbank . gm said it wanted to finalize its restructuring plans for opel as soon as possible for presentation to european governments . muted response the european commission has responded so far in neutral tones to the decision by gm to hold on to opel and its other european unit vauxhall . european union competition spokesman jonathan todd said merely that the commission , the eu 's executive body , " takes note " of the decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government was closely involved in bringing about the magna deal gm said it would keep its european operations because of an improvement in the economic environment . it 's also understood that gm was concerned that its position as a global company would be damaged if opel and vauxhall were competing with it in europe . european governments are now awaiting a possible request by gm for aid to help it restructure opel .
the magna-sberbank consortium had been set to receive a massive state aid package from germany to help along its restructuring plans . the german state support had been the subject of an eu investigation into whether the funds were linked to the maintenance of jobs in germany ahead of other european countries which host opel plants , a move which would have violated eu competition rules . juergen ruettgers , the state premier of north rhine-westphalia , where opel 's bochum plant is located , demanded that gm keep all its opel factories in germany running .
he told broadcaster zdf on wednesday that this should be a condition of any german state help . he also demanded that there be no operational redundancies in germany , and that any job cuts should be " socially responsible " .
ruettgers promised there would be no financial aid from north rhine-westphalia if the bochum plant were closed down .
" no-one can expect us to pay for the closure of the bochum factory , " he said . 3,000 opel workers are expected to appear at a demonstration on the bochum factory grounds on thursday afternoon .
the rally is being organized by industrial trade union ig metall , and production is expected to stop for its duration . ruettgers will speak at the demonstration , as will local social democrat party head hannelore kraft , and trade union leaders rainer einenkel and oliver burkhard . " germany 's decision " todd said the same rules would apply if gm applied to european governments for funding now it has decided not to sell opel .
the german government had confirmed to the eu that the money would have been available to any of the potential buyers , todd said , adding that it was not for the eu to tell germany what to do with its money now . " that is a matter for the german government , " he said .
" the commission can not suggest or oblige member states to give state aid ; we can however and do verify the conditions of any state aid that is given . " the commission insisted it is ready to facilitate discussions between gm and its european partners if needed . but now gm has backed away from a deal at the very last minute , it may be significantly harder to establish trust between the parties . author : nina-maria potts / mll / dfm editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de india -pipe- 05.11.2009 european union 's relations to india growing in intensity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts foresee a continued warming of relations between the european union and india the eu and india will focus on pushing their free trade pact during their 10th annual summit in new delhi on friday .
but other significant issues are also on the agenda , though the two sides do n't always see eye-to-eye . a major sticking point at the eu-india summit is the planned free trade agreement -lrb- fta -rrb- between the two sides .
daniele smadja , head of the european commission 's delegation to india , said on wednesday that the talks needed a boost .
" the fta negotiations are very complex , " smadja said .
" we have to jump into the cold water of give and take . "
the time had come to exchange concessions , she said .
but clemens spiess , a lecturer at the south asia institute at the university of heidelberg , said he did not expect a final agreement to be reached .
" there are still a lot of hurdles , " spiess told deutsche welle .
these include intellectual property rights disputes and tariff disagreements .
he said he did not expect fta talks to conclude successfully until 2010 or 2011 .
security has become a common challenge in the past , the eu 's relations to india have focused primarily on trade and economic issues .
this comes as no surprise , as the eu is india 's largest trading partner .
graham watson , chairman of the european parliament delegation for relations with india , said trade has more than doubled between the two partners over the past five years .
according to parliament figures , bilateral trade is expected to exceed 70.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 104.5 billion -rrb- by 2010 and 160.6 billion euros by 2015 .
" clearly it 's mainly in the trade area that we want to talk , but we also recognize on both sides that we have a common challenge in promoting peace and comprehensive security , " watson told deutsche welle .
a security dialogue has been in place since 2006 .
the eu not only recognized india 's role as a force of stability in a volatile region , but also as one of the few democracies in the region , he said .
" democracy gives india a huge advantage over china in the medium and long-term , " watson said .
" it makes it far easier for the eu to deal with india , not least because once a decision is taken it represents a consensus of opinion and therefore to be stuck to . "
this perception was n't always the case , though , said rajendra k jain , professor and former chairman of the center for european studies at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many westerners were also taken hostage in mumbai , such as at the taj hotel " the eu never viewed india as an important security partner halfway around the world because their issues and priorities were very different , " jain said in an interview with deutsche welle .
but this changed after the terrorist attacks in mumbai last november .
the eu recognized that india was a significant player in anti-terrorism collaboration .
however , jain said the structure of the eu did not allow for too much optimism in what could be possibly achieved in this area .
" the eu is a very strange political creature , " jain said .
" we should not have too high expectations of what is going to be possible in the realm of security cooperation because insofar as intelligence is concerned , it is a very sensitive issue and not the competence of the european union .
that is clearly with the member states . "
security in particular played a more central role in india 's relations to the united states , spiess said .
" a problem is the interaction between one country , india , on the one side and the 27-member state community , " spiess said .
" we all know there is no such thing as a consistent eu foreign policy , and security policy is now the domain of us-indo relations , which overshadows india 's interactions with the eu in terms of security relations . "
india wo n't succumb to climate pressure with the un conference in copenhagen just a few weeks away , climate change will also be a point of debate in new delhi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is also significantly affecting india " the western countries are pressuring india to join the fight against climate change more thoroughly , " spiess said .
" but india under no circumstances will accept any sort of legally binding reductions on its future greenhouse gas emissions trajectory . "
new delhi is resisting any binding emission cuts and demanding finance and technology from wealthy countries to help reduce emissions .
but there are other areas in which the two sides cooperate closely , such as energy , technology transfer , science and academic cooperation .
at this week 's summit , a cooperation agreement between the european atomic energy community euratom and india will be signed in the field of fusion energy research .
representatives will also launch a call for proposals for research in the field of solar energy , the european commission said .
" there 's plenty there for our leaders to get their teeth into , " watson said .
" the question is : where can we best find areas where we can make progress together and where there 's a real added value in cooperation . "
an equal partnership ?
for the eu , experts agreed , india is certainly an international partner to be taken seriously .
this was evident from the strategic partnership agreement in 2004 and the joint action plan in 2005 , revised in 2008 , which aims to deepen dialogue and cooperation .
" the eu does n't identify too many countries in the world with which they will enter into strategic partnerships , " said spiess .
" from the perspective of the eu , it 's crystal clear that india is identified as a stabilizing factor in the region and as a growing global player .
that 's why it 's a partner to count on . "
but it would go too far to say india was an equal partner , said christian wagner from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" for the eu , india is a developing country , " wagner told deutsche welle .
" the lion 's share of eu resources allocated to india in the next years deal with development goals . "
eu support is earmarked for helping india achieve the un millennium development goals , he said .
with respect to sentiments from new delhi , jain said there has been a shift in perception - despite the strong emphasis on trade and economic issues in the relationship .
" i think there has been a perceptible change in recent years and growing recognition among indian policymakers about the importance of the european union in world affairs , " jain said .

children are very susceptible to the disease and die at a rate of one every 30 seconds . scientists from throughout the world are meeting in nairobi to consider new research and treatments that may help eradicate malaria .
the disease poses a serious health threat in africa , but a promising new treatment is on the horizon . the treatment is a vaccine called rtss and has been tested for 20 years by scientists in africa .
experts hope that its effectiveness will be confirmed within three years , following the evaluation of field trials with infected children . the best results to date kenyan pediatrician walter otieno confirmed the significance of scientists ' recent research into treating malaria . " it is the first time that a vaccine against malaria has made it to the third and final testing phase , " he said .
" if it succeeds here , then the vaccine is ready for the market .
we are confident that in three to five years we will have an effective treatment that can be combined with other vaccinations to treat kids . " to date , the vaccine has shown promising results .
in the second testing phase , more than half of the children who received the vaccination no longer suffered severely from the mosquito-borne disease .

despite having only three points from their four champions league group games , and still without a win , stuttgart can now progress to the knockout stages of the competition without having to rely on other results .
their next game is away to glasgow rangers at ibrox .
if they win that , stuttgart 's final game at home against unirea on december 9 could well be the decider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jesus navas scored to give the hosts a first-half lead a goal at last stuttgart had not scored in their last three matches , and showed why when a great counter-attacking chance after two minutes was scuppered by a terrible pass from captain thomas hitzlsperger .
in response , jesus navas put the home team in front from their first opening in the 14th minute , which allowed seville to settle into cruise control for the remainder of the game .
seville played with the assurance that even a draw would ensure qualification and the knowledge they had never conceded to a german side in their home stadium .
but in the end stuttgart found reserves of determination that had gone missing in their season so far , and conjured an equalizer in the 79th minute with a deflected long range effort from zdravko kuzmanovic .
it was only their third goal in seven matches .
the germans then nearly got a winner in the closing minutes of the game , but seville held on for the point they needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus babbel has had little to celebrate recently getting loud " now we have it in our own hands , " said stuttgart manager markus babbel , under pressure to turn the club 's fortunes around , " the first half was a catastrophe , and inexplicable for me .
i had to get a bit loud in the interval .
after that we were braver and showed what we could do .
now we will do everything in our power to reach the last 16 . " they were aided by an inconclusive result in the other group game , in which glasgow rangers and romanian team unirea urziceni also drew 1-1 .
stuttgart are third in the group with three points , one ahead of rangers , and two behind unirea. bk / dpa / sid / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the announcement follows a decision by gm not to sell off the carmaker to canadian car-parts maker magna . general motors vice president john smith said wednesday that around 10,000 jobs would be slashed at the company 's european unit opel , which employs some 55,000 europeans in germany , spain , belgium , poland and the uk .
smith did not specify where the cuts would be made . the announcement comes less than a day after gm announced its decision not to sell off opel to a consortium led by canadian car-parts maker magna and russian state bank sberbank . the job cuts would be undertaken with the view to reduce costs at opel by around 30 percent , smith said , adding that the plan did not differ substantially from proposals for opel tabled by magna and sberbank . gm said it wanted to finalize its restructuring plans for opel as soon as possible for presentation to european governments . muted response the european commission has responded so far in neutral tones to the decision by gm to hold on to opel and its other european unit vauxhall . european union competition spokesman jonathan todd said merely that the commission , the eu 's executive body , " takes note " of the decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government was closely involved in bringing about the magna deal gm said it would keep its european operations because of an improvement in the economic environment . it 's also understood that gm was concerned that its position as a global company would be damaged if opel and vauxhall were competing with it in europe . european governments are now awaiting a possible request by gm for aid to help it restructure opel .
the magna-sberbank consortium had been set to receive a massive state aid package from germany to help along its restructuring plans . the german state support had been the subject of an eu investigation into whether the funds were linked to the maintenance of jobs in germany ahead of other european countries which host opel plants , a move which would have violated eu competition rules . juergen ruettgers , the state premier of north rhine-westphalia , where opel 's bochum plant is located , demanded that gm keep all its opel factories in germany running .
he told broadcaster zdf on wednesday that this should be a condition of any german state help . he also demanded that there be no operational redundancies in germany , and that any job cuts should be " socially responsible " .
ruettgers promised there would be no financial aid from north rhine-westphalia if the bochum plant were closed down .
" no-one can expect us to pay for the closure of the bochum factory , " he said . 3,000 opel workers are expected to appear at a demonstration on the bochum factory grounds on thursday afternoon .
the rally is being organized by industrial trade union ig metall , and production is expected to stop for its duration . ruettgers will speak at the demonstration , as will local social democrat party head hannelore kraft , and trade union leaders rainer einenkel and oliver burkhard . " germany 's decision " todd said the same rules would apply if gm applied to european governments for funding now it has decided not to sell opel .
the german government had confirmed to the eu that the money would have been available to any of the potential buyers , todd said , adding that it was not for the eu to tell germany what to do with its money now . " that is a matter for the german government , " he said .
" the commission can not suggest or oblige member states to give state aid ; we can however and do verify the conditions of any state aid that is given . " the commission insisted it is ready to facilitate discussions between gm and its european partners if needed . but now gm has backed away from a deal at the very last minute , it may be significantly harder to establish trust between the parties . author : nina-maria potts / mll / dfm editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite having only three points from their four champions league group games , and still without a win , stuttgart can now progress to the knockout stages of the competition without having to rely on other results .
their next game is away to glasgow rangers at ibrox .
if they win that , stuttgart 's final game at home against unirea on december 9 could well be the decider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jesus navas scored to give the hosts a first-half lead a goal at last stuttgart had not scored in their last three matches , and showed why when a great counter-attacking chance after two minutes was scuppered by a terrible pass from captain thomas hitzlsperger .
in response , jesus navas put the home team in front from their first opening in the 14th minute , which allowed seville to settle into cruise control for the remainder of the game .
seville played with the assurance that even a draw would ensure qualification and the knowledge they had never conceded to a german side in their home stadium .
but in the end stuttgart found reserves of determination that had gone missing in their season so far , and conjured an equalizer in the 79th minute with a deflected long range effort from zdravko kuzmanovic .
it was only their third goal in seven matches .
the germans then nearly got a winner in the closing minutes of the game , but seville held on for the point they needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus babbel has had little to celebrate recently getting loud " now we have it in our own hands , " said stuttgart manager markus babbel , under pressure to turn the club 's fortunes around , " the first half was a catastrophe , and inexplicable for me .
i had to get a bit loud in the interval .
after that we were braver and showed what we could do .
now we will do everything in our power to reach the last 16 . " they were aided by an inconclusive result in the other group game , in which glasgow rangers and romanian team unirea urziceni also drew 1-1 .
stuttgart are third in the group with three points , one ahead of rangers , and two behind unirea. bk / dpa / sid / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 05.11.2009 general motors plans huge job cuts at european unit opel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm has not said where the job cuts would be made us auto giant general motors says its planned restructuring of opel would involve massive job cuts .
the announcement follows a decision by gm not to sell off the carmaker to canadian car-parts maker magna . general motors vice president john smith said wednesday that around 10,000 jobs would be slashed at the company 's european unit opel , which employs some 55,000 europeans in germany , spain , belgium , poland and the uk .

children are very susceptible to the disease and die at a rate of one every 30 seconds . scientists from throughout the world are meeting in nairobi to consider new research and treatments that may help eradicate malaria .
the disease poses a serious health threat in africa , but a promising new treatment is on the horizon . the treatment is a vaccine called rtss and has been tested for 20 years by scientists in africa .
experts hope that its effectiveness will be confirmed within three years , following the evaluation of field trials with infected children . the best results to date kenyan pediatrician walter otieno confirmed the significance of scientists ' recent research into treating malaria . " it is the first time that a vaccine against malaria has made it to the third and final testing phase , " he said .
" if it succeeds here , then the vaccine is ready for the market .
we are confident that in three to five years we will have an effective treatment that can be combined with other vaccinations to treat kids . " to date , the vaccine has shown promising results .
in the second testing phase , more than half of the children who received the vaccination no longer suffered severely from the mosquito-borne disease .
rtss has produced better results than any previous malaria treatment but still does not offer complete protection .
otieno advises parents to take precautionary measures against malaria , like using mosquito netting around kids ' beds . children especially at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malaria is a big health concern for african children children suffering from a severe case of malaria may experience blood loss , brain damage and eventually comas .

" people are bitten nearly every day by mosquitoes bearing the disease .
seven out of 10 children are brought to our hospital because of malaria . " mothers with their babies often fill the waiting rooms of the medical research center in kombewa , kenya .
they hope their children can take part in rtss trials . " we keep having problems with malaria in our family , " said patricia mrunde , a mother of six , was recently among those seeking a vaccination for her daughter .
" a few weeks ago , my oldest son experienced a high fever as part of an outbreak .
when an outbreak is especially bad , his whole body jerks and cramps uncontrollably . " the mothers whose children take part in the trial swill not know whether their children will receive placebo injections or injections containing the anti-malaria vaccine . nevertheless , mrunde said she is still optimistic .

the announcement follows a decision by gm not to sell off the carmaker to canadian car-parts maker magna . general motors vice president john smith said wednesday that around 10,000 jobs would be slashed at the company 's european unit opel , which employs some 55,000 europeans in germany , spain , belgium , poland and the uk .
smith did not specify where the cuts would be made . the announcement comes less than a day after gm announced its decision not to sell off opel to a consortium led by canadian car-parts maker magna and russian state bank sberbank . the job cuts would be undertaken with the view to reduce costs at opel by around 30 percent , smith said , adding that the plan did not differ substantially from proposals for opel tabled by magna and sberbank . gm said it wanted to finalize its restructuring plans for opel as soon as possible for presentation to european governments . muted response the european commission has responded so far in neutral tones to the decision by gm to hold on to opel and its other european unit vauxhall . european union competition spokesman jonathan todd said merely that the commission , the eu 's executive body , " takes note " of the decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government was closely involved in bringing about the magna deal gm said it would keep its european operations because of an improvement in the economic environment . it 's also understood that gm was concerned that its position as a global company would be damaged if opel and vauxhall were competing with it in europe . european governments are now awaiting a possible request by gm for aid to help it restructure opel .
the magna-sberbank consortium had been set to receive a massive state aid package from germany to help along its restructuring plans . the german state support had been the subject of an eu investigation into whether the funds were linked to the maintenance of jobs in germany ahead of other european countries which host opel plants , a move which would have violated eu competition rules . juergen ruettgers , the state premier of north rhine-westphalia , where opel 's bochum plant is located , demanded that gm keep all its opel factories in germany running .
he told broadcaster zdf on wednesday that this should be a condition of any german state help . he also demanded that there be no operational redundancies in germany , and that any job cuts should be " socially responsible " .
ruettgers promised there would be no financial aid from north rhine-westphalia if the bochum plant were closed down .
" no-one can expect us to pay for the closure of the bochum factory , " he said . 3,000 opel workers are expected to appear at a demonstration on the bochum factory grounds on thursday afternoon .
the rally is being organized by industrial trade union ig metall , and production is expected to stop for its duration . ruettgers will speak at the demonstration , as will local social democrat party head hannelore kraft , and trade union leaders rainer einenkel and oliver burkhard . " germany 's decision " todd said the same rules would apply if gm applied to european governments for funding now it has decided not to sell opel .
the german government had confirmed to the eu that the money would have been available to any of the potential buyers , todd said , adding that it was not for the eu to tell germany what to do with its money now . " that is a matter for the german government , " he said .
" the commission can not suggest or oblige member states to give state aid ; we can however and do verify the conditions of any state aid that is given . " the commission insisted it is ready to facilitate discussions between gm and its european partners if needed . but now gm has backed away from a deal at the very last minute , it may be significantly harder to establish trust between the parties . author : nina-maria potts / mll / dfm editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but other significant issues are also on the agenda , though the two sides do n't always see eye-to-eye . a major sticking point at the eu-india summit is the planned free trade agreement -lrb- fta -rrb- between the two sides .
daniele smadja , head of the european commission 's delegation to india , said on wednesday that the talks needed a boost .
" the fta negotiations are very complex , " smadja said .
" we have to jump into the cold water of give and take . "
the time had come to exchange concessions , she said .
but clemens spiess , a lecturer at the south asia institute at the university of heidelberg , said he did not expect a final agreement to be reached .
" there are still a lot of hurdles , " spiess told deutsche welle .
these include intellectual property rights disputes and tariff disagreements .
he said he did not expect fta talks to conclude successfully until 2010 or 2011 .
security has become a common challenge in the past , the eu 's relations to india have focused primarily on trade and economic issues .
this comes as no surprise , as the eu is india 's largest trading partner .
graham watson , chairman of the european parliament delegation for relations with india , said trade has more than doubled between the two partners over the past five years .
according to parliament figures , bilateral trade is expected to exceed 70.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 104.5 billion -rrb- by 2010 and 160.6 billion euros by 2015 .
" clearly it 's mainly in the trade area that we want to talk , but we also recognize on both sides that we have a common challenge in promoting peace and comprehensive security , " watson told deutsche welle .
a security dialogue has been in place since 2006 .
the eu not only recognized india 's role as a force of stability in a volatile region , but also as one of the few democracies in the region , he said .
" democracy gives india a huge advantage over china in the medium and long-term , " watson said .
" it makes it far easier for the eu to deal with india , not least because once a decision is taken it represents a consensus of opinion and therefore to be stuck to . "
this perception was n't always the case , though , said rajendra k jain , professor and former chairman of the center for european studies at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many westerners were also taken hostage in mumbai , such as at the taj hotel " the eu never viewed india as an important security partner halfway around the world because their issues and priorities were very different , " jain said in an interview with deutsche welle .
but this changed after the terrorist attacks in mumbai last november .
the eu recognized that india was a significant player in anti-terrorism collaboration .
however , jain said the structure of the eu did not allow for too much optimism in what could be possibly achieved in this area .
" the eu is a very strange political creature , " jain said .
" we should not have too high expectations of what is going to be possible in the realm of security cooperation because insofar as intelligence is concerned , it is a very sensitive issue and not the competence of the european union .
that is clearly with the member states . "
security in particular played a more central role in india 's relations to the united states , spiess said .
" a problem is the interaction between one country , india , on the one side and the 27-member state community , " spiess said .
" we all know there is no such thing as a consistent eu foreign policy , and security policy is now the domain of us-indo relations , which overshadows india 's interactions with the eu in terms of security relations . "
india wo n't succumb to climate pressure with the un conference in copenhagen just a few weeks away , climate change will also be a point of debate in new delhi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is also significantly affecting india " the western countries are pressuring india to join the fight against climate change more thoroughly , " spiess said .
" but india under no circumstances will accept any sort of legally binding reductions on its future greenhouse gas emissions trajectory . "
new delhi is resisting any binding emission cuts and demanding finance and technology from wealthy countries to help reduce emissions .
but there are other areas in which the two sides cooperate closely , such as energy , technology transfer , science and academic cooperation .
at this week 's summit , a cooperation agreement between the european atomic energy community euratom and india will be signed in the field of fusion energy research .
representatives will also launch a call for proposals for research in the field of solar energy , the european commission said .
" there 's plenty there for our leaders to get their teeth into , " watson said .
" the question is : where can we best find areas where we can make progress together and where there 's a real added value in cooperation . "
an equal partnership ?
for the eu , experts agreed , india is certainly an international partner to be taken seriously .
this was evident from the strategic partnership agreement in 2004 and the joint action plan in 2005 , revised in 2008 , which aims to deepen dialogue and cooperation .
" the eu does n't identify too many countries in the world with which they will enter into strategic partnerships , " said spiess .
" from the perspective of the eu , it 's crystal clear that india is identified as a stabilizing factor in the region and as a growing global player .
that 's why it 's a partner to count on . "
but it would go too far to say india was an equal partner , said christian wagner from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" for the eu , india is a developing country , " wagner told deutsche welle .
" the lion 's share of eu resources allocated to india in the next years deal with development goals . "
eu support is earmarked for helping india achieve the un millennium development goals , he said .
with respect to sentiments from new delhi , jain said there has been a shift in perception - despite the strong emphasis on trade and economic issues in the relationship .
" i think there has been a perceptible change in recent years and growing recognition among indian policymakers about the importance of the european union in world affairs , " jain said .

new delhi is resisting any binding emission cuts and demanding finance and technology from wealthy countries to help reduce emissions .
but there are other areas in which the two sides cooperate closely , such as energy , technology transfer , science and academic cooperation .
at this week 's summit , a cooperation agreement between the european atomic energy community euratom and india will be signed in the field of fusion energy research .
representatives will also launch a call for proposals for research in the field of solar energy , the european commission said .
" there 's plenty there for our leaders to get their teeth into , " watson said .
" the question is : where can we best find areas where we can make progress together and where there 's a real added value in cooperation . "
an equal partnership ?
for the eu , experts agreed , india is certainly an international partner to be taken seriously .
this was evident from the strategic partnership agreement in 2004 and the joint action plan in 2005 , revised in 2008 , which aims to deepen dialogue and cooperation .
" the eu does n't identify too many countries in the world with which they will enter into strategic partnerships , " said spiess .
" from the perspective of the eu , it 's crystal clear that india is identified as a stabilizing factor in the region and as a growing global player .
that 's why it 's a partner to count on . "
but it would go too far to say india was an equal partner , said christian wagner from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" for the eu , india is a developing country , " wagner told deutsche welle .
" the lion 's share of eu resources allocated to india in the next years deal with development goals . "
eu support is earmarked for helping india achieve the un millennium development goals , he said .
with respect to sentiments from new delhi , jain said there has been a shift in perception - despite the strong emphasis on trade and economic issues in the relationship .
" i think there has been a perceptible change in recent years and growing recognition among indian policymakers about the importance of the european union in world affairs , " jain said .

but other significant issues are also on the agenda , though the two sides do n't always see eye-to-eye . a major sticking point at the eu-india summit is the planned free trade agreement -lrb- fta -rrb- between the two sides .
daniele smadja , head of the european commission 's delegation to india , said on wednesday that the talks needed a boost .
" the fta negotiations are very complex , " smadja said .
" we have to jump into the cold water of give and take . "
the time had come to exchange concessions , she said .
but clemens spiess , a lecturer at the south asia institute at the university of heidelberg , said he did not expect a final agreement to be reached .
" there are still a lot of hurdles , " spiess told deutsche welle .
these include intellectual property rights disputes and tariff disagreements .
he said he did not expect fta talks to conclude successfully until 2010 or 2011 .
security has become a common challenge in the past , the eu 's relations to india have focused primarily on trade and economic issues .
this comes as no surprise , as the eu is india 's largest trading partner .
graham watson , chairman of the european parliament delegation for relations with india , said trade has more than doubled between the two partners over the past five years .
according to parliament figures , bilateral trade is expected to exceed 70.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 104.5 billion -rrb- by 2010 and 160.6 billion euros by 2015 .
" clearly it 's mainly in the trade area that we want to talk , but we also recognize on both sides that we have a common challenge in promoting peace and comprehensive security , " watson told deutsche welle .
a security dialogue has been in place since 2006 .
the eu not only recognized india 's role as a force of stability in a volatile region , but also as one of the few democracies in the region , he said .
" democracy gives india a huge advantage over china in the medium and long-term , " watson said .
" it makes it far easier for the eu to deal with india , not least because once a decision is taken it represents a consensus of opinion and therefore to be stuck to . "
this perception was n't always the case , though , said rajendra k jain , professor and former chairman of the center for european studies at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many westerners were also taken hostage in mumbai , such as at the taj hotel " the eu never viewed india as an important security partner halfway around the world because their issues and priorities were very different , " jain said in an interview with deutsche welle .
but this changed after the terrorist attacks in mumbai last november .
the eu recognized that india was a significant player in anti-terrorism collaboration .
however , jain said the structure of the eu did not allow for too much optimism in what could be possibly achieved in this area .
" the eu is a very strange political creature , " jain said .
" we should not have too high expectations of what is going to be possible in the realm of security cooperation because insofar as intelligence is concerned , it is a very sensitive issue and not the competence of the european union .
that is clearly with the member states . "
security in particular played a more central role in india 's relations to the united states , spiess said .
" a problem is the interaction between one country , india , on the one side and the 27-member state community , " spiess said .
" we all know there is no such thing as a consistent eu foreign policy , and security policy is now the domain of us-indo relations , which overshadows india 's interactions with the eu in terms of security relations . "
india wo n't succumb to climate pressure with the un conference in copenhagen just a few weeks away , climate change will also be a point of debate in new delhi .

the announcement follows a decision by gm not to sell off the carmaker to canadian car-parts maker magna . general motors vice president john smith said wednesday that around 10,000 jobs would be slashed at the company 's european unit opel , which employs some 55,000 europeans in germany , spain , belgium , poland and the uk .
smith did not specify where the cuts would be made . the announcement comes less than a day after gm announced its decision not to sell off opel to a consortium led by canadian car-parts maker magna and russian state bank sberbank . the job cuts would be undertaken with the view to reduce costs at opel by around 30 percent , smith said , adding that the plan did not differ substantially from proposals for opel tabled by magna and sberbank . gm said it wanted to finalize its restructuring plans for opel as soon as possible for presentation to european governments . muted response the european commission has responded so far in neutral tones to the decision by gm to hold on to opel and its other european unit vauxhall . european union competition spokesman jonathan todd said merely that the commission , the eu 's executive body , " takes note " of the decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government was closely involved in bringing about the magna deal gm said it would keep its european operations because of an improvement in the economic environment . it 's also understood that gm was concerned that its position as a global company would be damaged if opel and vauxhall were competing with it in europe . european governments are now awaiting a possible request by gm for aid to help it restructure opel .
the magna-sberbank consortium had been set to receive a massive state aid package from germany to help along its restructuring plans . the german state support had been the subject of an eu investigation into whether the funds were linked to the maintenance of jobs in germany ahead of other european countries which host opel plants , a move which would have violated eu competition rules . juergen ruettgers , the state premier of north rhine-westphalia , where opel 's bochum plant is located , demanded that gm keep all its opel factories in germany running .
he told broadcaster zdf on wednesday that this should be a condition of any german state help . he also demanded that there be no operational redundancies in germany , and that any job cuts should be " socially responsible " .
ruettgers promised there would be no financial aid from north rhine-westphalia if the bochum plant were closed down .
" no-one can expect us to pay for the closure of the bochum factory , " he said . 3,000 opel workers are expected to appear at a demonstration on the bochum factory grounds on thursday afternoon .
the rally is being organized by industrial trade union ig metall , and production is expected to stop for its duration . ruettgers will speak at the demonstration , as will local social democrat party head hannelore kraft , and trade union leaders rainer einenkel and oliver burkhard . " germany 's decision " todd said the same rules would apply if gm applied to european governments for funding now it has decided not to sell opel .
the german government had confirmed to the eu that the money would have been available to any of the potential buyers , todd said , adding that it was not for the eu to tell germany what to do with its money now . " that is a matter for the german government , " he said .
" the commission can not suggest or oblige member states to give state aid ; we can however and do verify the conditions of any state aid that is given . " the commission insisted it is ready to facilitate discussions between gm and its european partners if needed . but now gm has backed away from a deal at the very last minute , it may be significantly harder to establish trust between the parties . author : nina-maria potts / mll / dfm editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 05.11.2009 eastern germany catching up to west " faster than thought " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern german cities like dresden are catching up to western cities a recent study suggests that the economies of germany ’ s eastern states , once under the gdr 's communist regime , may be catching up to those of their western counterparts faster than previously thought . according to the iw german economic research institute , standards of living in the east have soared so much that the german solidarity pact may not be needed after its scheduled expiry date in 2019 .
under that pact , germans pay an income-dependent amount of their earnings towards improving infrastructure in the east .
klaus heiner roehl , a regional policy analyst at the cologne-based institute , said this is partly a matter of statistics and the ironic fact that the global economic crisis has hit germany 's western states harder than its eastern states .
" of course the economic crisis has affected eastern germany too , but to a smaller extent than western germany , " he told deutsche welle .
" this is because the big export companies are located in the western part of the country and this year , the convergence will be even faster than in the last year because the western german economy will shrink about 5 percent while with the eastern german economy , the negative growth is about 3 percent . "
the institute 's study shows that the eastern states lose half a percent of their population to western states each year , a fact that is often overlooked .
despite this however , annual growth in the eastern states is half a percent higher than growth in the western states .
east-west divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germans flooded into the west after the fall of the berlin wall these findings contradict the more populist belief that , even after 19 years of reunification , eastern germany is floundering not only economically but also psychologically .
reiner eckert , director of the forum of contemporary history in leipzig , told deutsche welle that the peaceful revolution of the late ' 80s had achieved its ideals of democracy , freedom and unity in a reunited germany , but that problems remained between the two halves .
" the cities have adapted well and have developed their infrastructure , but there are still deficits , and in some ways , some of the pride in the peaceful revolution has evaporated , " he said .
" basically this has to do with the fact that amongst germans living in the eastern states , there is a feeling that they have not yet ‘ arrived ' and are still perceived as second-class citizens . "
east catching up although there are stark differences between development in cities and rural areas in the eastern states , roehl said that statistics for the east as a whole indicate that per capita gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- could reach 80 percent of those in the west of the country by 2020 .
this means that by then , some of the wealthiest eastern states could have overtaken some of their poorest western counterparts , another indicator that the time of the solidarity pact may have passed .
" the solidarity pact will continue to 2019 but from this -lrb- year -rrb- onwards … the amount of money is reduced year per year , " said roehl .
" and it is quite right to do it that way and we think it is also right that the solidarity pact will end in 2019 . "
roehl added that the iw institute 's findings could lead to increased resentment amongst many germans in the western part of the country at having to pay the solidarity tax .
" there is always some resentment on the side of the paying state , and also some resentment in the east that the solidarity pact will end , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 05.11.2009 gm 's decision to keep opel could create problems for merkel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new confidence in global strategies as german foreign minister guido westerwelle prepared for talks in the us expected to address gm 's surprise u-turn on the sale of opel , the government in berlin was still smarting on thursday from the shock . general motors ' decision to back out of selling its german-based opel unit has sparked a mix of fury and surprise among german politicians , with reaction reaching from condemnation of gm 's behavior as " entirely unacceptable , " to " shock and annoyance " at detroit 's move .
the announcement was certainly embarrassing for german chancellor angela merkel .
it came just hours after she gave a historic speech before a joint session of the us congress in washington .
the newly re-elected chancellor had invested a lot of political capital backing a deal for gm to sell its troubled european subsidiary to a consortium led by canada 's magna and its russian banking partner sberbank .
apart from being embarrassing , gm 's reversal has created a complicated situation for the chancellor and several german state premiers , said gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn and merkel biographer .
it is almost as if gm had mugged leading german politicians , he told deutsche welle .
and now , no one knows what will happen next .
gm needs cash to restructure opel while gm has already declared it will repay a 1.5 billion euro bridge loan the german government had granted in may to keep gm 's european operations alive during negotiations to find an investor , berlin has been non-committal about whether to offer gm fresh government aid to save thousands of jobs at german opel plants .
the us auto giant faces the question of how to come up with the three-billions euros it estimates it needs to restructure its european operations .
but langguth pointed out that the german federal government is deeply in debt , and needs to try and balance its budget .
“ at the moment , merkel does not have a lot of room for maneuvering , ” lagguth said .
german political leaders may be angry , bonn political scientist langguth said , but that was not necessarily true for german taxpayers who had been wondering why state help was needed for the rüsselsheim-based automaker and were not happy with the government 's policy on opel in the first place .
“ the taxpayers do n't like to pay the insolvencies of the big companies , while the state would normally do nothing for smaller and medium-sized companies when they are insolvent , ” langguth said .
merkel 's previous coalition government with the social democrats had made billions of euros in public funds available to prop up companies hit by the crisis . ”
angry opel workers protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of opel workers vent their anger in protests gm vice president john smith , meanwhile , said there was very little difference between the offers put forward by magna and what gm had in mind for opel .
gm announced it planned to cut about 10,000 jobs , almost a fifth of the workers employed by gm in europe .
meanwhile on thursday , thousands of opel employees in germany walked off their jobs to join mass rallyes in protest of gm 's decision . there are four opel plants in germany , but the future of the plant in bochum in north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- is likely to be of major concern for chancellor merkel .
the prospect of job losses at the plant in germany 's most populous state could cost her christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- party votes in state elections in nrw in may 2010 .
should the cdu lose power in the state , merkel 's government would no longer have a centre-right majority in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , and that would in turn allow opposition parties to block legislation .

axel mitbauer , a member of the gdr national swim team , was the only top athlete to actually use his sport to flee east germany . axel mitbauer 's escape from the german democratic republic 20 years before the fall of the wall was one of the most spectacular ways people chose to flee then east germany . as a member of the gdr national swim team and a master in the 400-meter freestyle , he used his athletic talent to cut through the iron curtain .
on the night of august 17 , 1969 , the then 19-year-old mitbauer swam from the boltenhagen resort area on the baltic sea to luebeck 's bay area . " water is my element , " mitbauer said , reminiscing about his career .
" it 's been my companion , as it were , for the past 51 years , and i still love it . " petroleum jelly to keep out the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 600 athletes escaped the gdr but 40 years ago , crossing the border presented a challenge .
the baltic sea was an area many used in their attempts to flee east germany , and guards were always on the alert as a result .
mitbauer studied the guards ' habits for a week and learned that they turned off the search lights shortly once an hour to allow them to cool .
on august 17 , around 9 p.m. , he grabbed his chance and dove into the water .
as the lights were turned back on , he went under water again and swam 25 kilometers -lrb- 15.5 miles -rrb- . " i had one minute to cross both the first and second sandbanks , " he recalled .
" but the biggest problem was the very cold water .
swimming in it for four to six hours is quite difficult .
nowadays , people can use neoprene suits , but back then , the only thing we could do was smear vaseline all over our bodies . " the baltic sea was just 18 degrees celsius -lrb- 64 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- the night he fled .
he used 30 tubes of petroleum jelly to protect himself against the cold . unhappy with life mitbauer said he was happy as an athlete in the gdr system , but he was n't pleased with life in the country .
when he traveled abroad for competitions , he also saw a huge discrepancy between reality and east german propaganda .
he said he felt his home country was a lawless state and realized early on that he wanted to leave - and that he could use his aquatic talents to do it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a divided east and west berlin " i basically used the east german system that promoted sports in the way it did to ultimately escape it and pursue my own goals , " he said . according to records kept by the former east german secret police , or stasi , more than 600 athletes escaped to the west by 1989 , the year the wall came down .
soccer player falko goetz , cyclist juergen kissner and coach joerg berger were some of them .
the stasi called referred to them as sports traitors . mitbauer 's frequent conversations with west german athletes during foreign competitions also aroused the suspicion of east german state security officials and he was even arrested before he fled .
they kept him in custody for seven weeks - in the stasi prison hohenschoenhausen in berlin .
he went through the gamut : solitary confinement , light deprivation , torture . planning his escape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parts of the wall have been turned into the open-air east side gallery but mitbauer divulged nothing and immediately began training for his escape in water holes at old coal-mining plants once he was released from prison .
yet even after fleeing to the west , mitbauer was still scared of the stasi . " of course i was scared , " he said .
" some people were killed after all .
others were drugged and dragged back to east germany .
someone even loosened the lug nuts on the wheels of my car once .
in the beginning , right after fleeing , i used to push a big cabinet in front of my apartment door . " still , once in the west , mitbauer quickly learned how to market himself .
he received 10,000 german marks back then from stern magazine for his personal story .
he certainly needed the money - considering that he started a new life nearly naked after his escape .
the only thing in his possession when he arrived on shore at travemuende were his swim trunks , his flippers , a ring sewed into one of them , and a medal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swimmer axel mitbauer -lrb- l -rrb- , as a coach later in life " i left at 9 p.m. at night and arrived at a buoy at around 1 o 'clock in the morning , " he recalled .
" i had wanted to spend the night on it , warm up from the sun the next morning and then swim on .
but a german ship ended up picking me up around 7 a.m. " it was a west german ship that took him to travemuende .
he was then taken to a reception camp in giessen , where he received identification documents .
stern journalists met him there and took him to hamburg , where he told them his story of escape . coaching fame mitbauer later studied sports education in cologne and worked as a coach in italy and switzerland .
he continues to live in switzerland and also coaches up-and-coming swim talents in karlsruhe , germany .
he 's coached swimming great jacques mayol , a frenchman , whose legendary two-man competition with italian enzo mairoca later appeared in the film " the big blue . " even today he said he understands why people in eastern and western germany do n't quite understand each other , even though the wall fell 20 years ago . " that gap will not be bridged until the next generation is at the fore - a generation that has grown up familiar only with a united germany , " he said .
" only then will the two sides have grown together into a unified whole . " author : marcus neu boelz -lrb- als -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

axel mitbauer , a member of the gdr national swim team , was the only top athlete to actually use his sport to flee east germany . axel mitbauer 's escape from the german democratic republic 20 years before the fall of the wall was one of the most spectacular ways people chose to flee then east germany . as a member of the gdr national swim team and a master in the 400-meter freestyle , he used his athletic talent to cut through the iron curtain .
on the night of august 17 , 1969 , the then 19-year-old mitbauer swam from the boltenhagen resort area on the baltic sea to luebeck 's bay area . " water is my element , " mitbauer said , reminiscing about his career .
" it 's been my companion , as it were , for the past 51 years , and i still love it . " petroleum jelly to keep out the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 600 athletes escaped the gdr but 40 years ago , crossing the border presented a challenge .
the baltic sea was an area many used in their attempts to flee east germany , and guards were always on the alert as a result .
mitbauer studied the guards ' habits for a week and learned that they turned off the search lights shortly once an hour to allow them to cool .
on august 17 , around 9 p.m. , he grabbed his chance and dove into the water .
as the lights were turned back on , he went under water again and swam 25 kilometers -lrb- 15.5 miles -rrb- . " i had one minute to cross both the first and second sandbanks , " he recalled .
" but the biggest problem was the very cold water .
swimming in it for four to six hours is quite difficult .
nowadays , people can use neoprene suits , but back then , the only thing we could do was smear vaseline all over our bodies . " the baltic sea was just 18 degrees celsius -lrb- 64 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- the night he fled .
he used 30 tubes of petroleum jelly to protect himself against the cold . unhappy with life mitbauer said he was happy as an athlete in the gdr system , but he was n't pleased with life in the country .
when he traveled abroad for competitions , he also saw a huge discrepancy between reality and east german propaganda .
he said he felt his home country was a lawless state and realized early on that he wanted to leave - and that he could use his aquatic talents to do it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a divided east and west berlin " i basically used the east german system that promoted sports in the way it did to ultimately escape it and pursue my own goals , " he said . according to records kept by the former east german secret police , or stasi , more than 600 athletes escaped to the west by 1989 , the year the wall came down .

the stasi called referred to them as sports traitors . mitbauer 's frequent conversations with west german athletes during foreign competitions also aroused the suspicion of east german state security officials and he was even arrested before he fled .
they kept him in custody for seven weeks - in the stasi prison hohenschoenhausen in berlin .
he went through the gamut : solitary confinement , light deprivation , torture . planning his escape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parts of the wall have been turned into the open-air east side gallery but mitbauer divulged nothing and immediately began training for his escape in water holes at old coal-mining plants once he was released from prison .
yet even after fleeing to the west , mitbauer was still scared of the stasi . " of course i was scared , " he said .
" some people were killed after all .
others were drugged and dragged back to east germany .
someone even loosened the lug nuts on the wheels of my car once .
in the beginning , right after fleeing , i used to push a big cabinet in front of my apartment door . " still , once in the west , mitbauer quickly learned how to market himself .
he received 10,000 german marks back then from stern magazine for his personal story .
he certainly needed the money - considering that he started a new life nearly naked after his escape .

but a german ship ended up picking me up around 7 a.m. " it was a west german ship that took him to travemuende .

they kept him in custody for seven weeks - in the stasi prison hohenschoenhausen in berlin .
he went through the gamut : solitary confinement , light deprivation , torture . planning his escape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parts of the wall have been turned into the open-air east side gallery but mitbauer divulged nothing and immediately began training for his escape in water holes at old coal-mining plants once he was released from prison .
yet even after fleeing to the west , mitbauer was still scared of the stasi . " of course i was scared , " he said .
" some people were killed after all .
others were drugged and dragged back to east germany .
someone even loosened the lug nuts on the wheels of my car once .
in the beginning , right after fleeing , i used to push a big cabinet in front of my apartment door . " still , once in the west , mitbauer quickly learned how to market himself .
he received 10,000 german marks back then from stern magazine for his personal story .
he certainly needed the money - considering that he started a new life nearly naked after his escape .
the only thing in his possession when he arrived on shore at travemuende were his swim trunks , his flippers , a ring sewed into one of them , and a medal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swimmer axel mitbauer -lrb- l -rrb- , as a coach later in life " i left at 9 p.m. at night and arrived at a buoy at around 1 o 'clock in the morning , " he recalled .
" i had wanted to spend the night on it , warm up from the sun the next morning and then swim on .
but a german ship ended up picking me up around 7 a.m. " it was a west german ship that took him to travemuende .
he was then taken to a reception camp in giessen , where he received identification documents .
stern journalists met him there and took him to hamburg , where he told them his story of escape . coaching fame mitbauer later studied sports education in cologne and worked as a coach in italy and switzerland .
he continues to live in switzerland and also coaches up-and-coming swim talents in karlsruhe , germany .
he 's coached swimming great jacques mayol , a frenchman , whose legendary two-man competition with italian enzo mairoca later appeared in the film " the big blue . " even today he said he understands why people in eastern and western germany do n't quite understand each other , even though the wall fell 20 years ago . " that gap will not be bridged until the next generation is at the fore - a generation that has grown up familiar only with a united germany , " he said .

the announcement follows a decision by gm not to sell off the carmaker to canadian car-parts maker magna . general motors vice president john smith said wednesday that around 10,000 jobs would be slashed at the company 's european unit opel , which employs some 55,000 europeans in germany , spain , belgium , poland and the uk .
smith did not specify where the cuts would be made . the announcement comes less than a day after gm announced its decision not to sell off opel to a consortium led by canadian car-parts maker magna and russian state bank sberbank . the job cuts would be undertaken with the view to reduce costs at opel by around 30 percent , smith said , adding that the plan did not differ substantially from proposals for opel tabled by magna and sberbank . gm said it wanted to finalize its restructuring plans for opel as soon as possible for presentation to european governments . muted response the european commission has responded so far in neutral tones to the decision by gm to hold on to opel and its other european unit vauxhall . european union competition spokesman jonathan todd said merely that the commission , the eu 's executive body , " takes note " of the decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government was closely involved in bringing about the magna deal gm said it would keep its european operations because of an improvement in the economic environment . it 's also understood that gm was concerned that its position as a global company would be damaged if opel and vauxhall were competing with it in europe . european governments are now awaiting a possible request by gm for aid to help it restructure opel .
the magna-sberbank consortium had been set to receive a massive state aid package from germany to help along its restructuring plans . the german state support had been the subject of an eu investigation into whether the funds were linked to the maintenance of jobs in germany ahead of other european countries which host opel plants , a move which would have violated eu competition rules . juergen ruettgers , the state premier of north rhine-westphalia , where opel 's bochum plant is located , demanded that gm keep all its opel factories in germany running .
he told broadcaster zdf on wednesday that this should be a condition of any german state help . he also demanded that there be no operational redundancies in germany , and that any job cuts should be " socially responsible " .
ruettgers promised there would be no financial aid from north rhine-westphalia if the bochum plant were closed down .
" no-one can expect us to pay for the closure of the bochum factory , " he said . 3,000 opel workers are expected to appear at a demonstration on the bochum factory grounds on thursday afternoon .
the rally is being organized by industrial trade union ig metall , and production is expected to stop for its duration . ruettgers will speak at the demonstration , as will local social democrat party head hannelore kraft , and trade union leaders rainer einenkel and oliver burkhard . " germany 's decision " todd said the same rules would apply if gm applied to european governments for funding now it has decided not to sell opel .
the german government had confirmed to the eu that the money would have been available to any of the potential buyers , todd said , adding that it was not for the eu to tell germany what to do with its money now . " that is a matter for the german government , " he said .
" the commission can not suggest or oblige member states to give state aid ; we can however and do verify the conditions of any state aid that is given . " the commission insisted it is ready to facilitate discussions between gm and its european partners if needed . but now gm has backed away from a deal at the very last minute , it may be significantly harder to establish trust between the parties . author : nina-maria potts / mll / dfm editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

under that pact , germans pay an income-dependent amount of their earnings towards improving infrastructure in the east .
klaus heiner roehl , a regional policy analyst at the cologne-based institute , said this is partly a matter of statistics and the ironic fact that the global economic crisis has hit germany 's western states harder than its eastern states .
" of course the economic crisis has affected eastern germany too , but to a smaller extent than western germany , " he told deutsche welle .
" this is because the big export companies are located in the western part of the country and this year , the convergence will be even faster than in the last year because the western german economy will shrink about 5 percent while with the eastern german economy , the negative growth is about 3 percent . "
the institute 's study shows that the eastern states lose half a percent of their population to western states each year , a fact that is often overlooked .
despite this however , annual growth in the eastern states is half a percent higher than growth in the western states .
east-west divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germans flooded into the west after the fall of the berlin wall these findings contradict the more populist belief that , even after 19 years of reunification , eastern germany is floundering not only economically but also psychologically .
reiner eckert , director of the forum of contemporary history in leipzig , told deutsche welle that the peaceful revolution of the late ' 80s had achieved its ideals of democracy , freedom and unity in a reunited germany , but that problems remained between the two halves .
" the cities have adapted well and have developed their infrastructure , but there are still deficits , and in some ways , some of the pride in the peaceful revolution has evaporated , " he said .
" basically this has to do with the fact that amongst germans living in the eastern states , there is a feeling that they have not yet ‘ arrived ' and are still perceived as second-class citizens . "
east catching up although there are stark differences between development in cities and rural areas in the eastern states , roehl said that statistics for the east as a whole indicate that per capita gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- could reach 80 percent of those in the west of the country by 2020 .
this means that by then , some of the wealthiest eastern states could have overtaken some of their poorest western counterparts , another indicator that the time of the solidarity pact may have passed .
" the solidarity pact will continue to 2019 but from this -lrb- year -rrb- onwards … the amount of money is reduced year per year , " said roehl .
" and it is quite right to do it that way and we think it is also right that the solidarity pact will end in 2019 . "
roehl added that the iw institute 's findings could lead to increased resentment amongst many germans in the western part of the country at having to pay the solidarity tax .
" there is always some resentment on the side of the paying state , and also some resentment in the east that the solidarity pact will end , " he said .

under that pact , germans pay an income-dependent amount of their earnings towards improving infrastructure in the east .
klaus heiner roehl , a regional policy analyst at the cologne-based institute , said this is partly a matter of statistics and the ironic fact that the global economic crisis has hit germany 's western states harder than its eastern states .
" of course the economic crisis has affected eastern germany too , but to a smaller extent than western germany , " he told deutsche welle .
" this is because the big export companies are located in the western part of the country and this year , the convergence will be even faster than in the last year because the western german economy will shrink about 5 percent while with the eastern german economy , the negative growth is about 3 percent . "
the institute 's study shows that the eastern states lose half a percent of their population to western states each year , a fact that is often overlooked .
despite this however , annual growth in the eastern states is half a percent higher than growth in the western states .
east-west divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germans flooded into the west after the fall of the berlin wall these findings contradict the more populist belief that , even after 19 years of reunification , eastern germany is floundering not only economically but also psychologically .
reiner eckert , director of the forum of contemporary history in leipzig , told deutsche welle that the peaceful revolution of the late ' 80s had achieved its ideals of democracy , freedom and unity in a reunited germany , but that problems remained between the two halves .
" the cities have adapted well and have developed their infrastructure , but there are still deficits , and in some ways , some of the pride in the peaceful revolution has evaporated , " he said .
" basically this has to do with the fact that amongst germans living in the eastern states , there is a feeling that they have not yet ‘ arrived ' and are still perceived as second-class citizens . "
east catching up although there are stark differences between development in cities and rural areas in the eastern states , roehl said that statistics for the east as a whole indicate that per capita gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- could reach 80 percent of those in the west of the country by 2020 .
this means that by then , some of the wealthiest eastern states could have overtaken some of their poorest western counterparts , another indicator that the time of the solidarity pact may have passed .
" the solidarity pact will continue to 2019 but from this -lrb- year -rrb- onwards … the amount of money is reduced year per year , " said roehl .
" and it is quite right to do it that way and we think it is also right that the solidarity pact will end in 2019 . "
roehl added that the iw institute 's findings could lead to increased resentment amongst many germans in the western part of the country at having to pay the solidarity tax .
" there is always some resentment on the side of the paying state , and also some resentment in the east that the solidarity pact will end , " he said .

the announcement was certainly embarrassing for german chancellor angela merkel .
it came just hours after she gave a historic speech before a joint session of the us congress in washington .
the newly re-elected chancellor had invested a lot of political capital backing a deal for gm to sell its troubled european subsidiary to a consortium led by canada 's magna and its russian banking partner sberbank .
apart from being embarrassing , gm 's reversal has created a complicated situation for the chancellor and several german state premiers , said gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn and merkel biographer .
it is almost as if gm had mugged leading german politicians , he told deutsche welle .
and now , no one knows what will happen next .
gm needs cash to restructure opel while gm has already declared it will repay a 1.5 billion euro bridge loan the german government had granted in may to keep gm 's european operations alive during negotiations to find an investor , berlin has been non-committal about whether to offer gm fresh government aid to save thousands of jobs at german opel plants .
the us auto giant faces the question of how to come up with the three-billions euros it estimates it needs to restructure its european operations .
but langguth pointed out that the german federal government is deeply in debt , and needs to try and balance its budget .
“ at the moment , merkel does not have a lot of room for maneuvering , ” lagguth said .
german political leaders may be angry , bonn political scientist langguth said , but that was not necessarily true for german taxpayers who had been wondering why state help was needed for the rüsselsheim-based automaker and were not happy with the government 's policy on opel in the first place .
“ the taxpayers do n't like to pay the insolvencies of the big companies , while the state would normally do nothing for smaller and medium-sized companies when they are insolvent , ” langguth said .
merkel 's previous coalition government with the social democrats had made billions of euros in public funds available to prop up companies hit by the crisis . ”
angry opel workers protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of opel workers vent their anger in protests gm vice president john smith , meanwhile , said there was very little difference between the offers put forward by magna and what gm had in mind for opel .
gm announced it planned to cut about 10,000 jobs , almost a fifth of the workers employed by gm in europe .
meanwhile on thursday , thousands of opel employees in germany walked off their jobs to join mass rallyes in protest of gm 's decision . there are four opel plants in germany , but the future of the plant in bochum in north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- is likely to be of major concern for chancellor merkel .
the prospect of job losses at the plant in germany 's most populous state could cost her christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- party votes in state elections in nrw in may 2010 .
should the cdu lose power in the state , merkel 's government would no longer have a centre-right majority in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , and that would in turn allow opposition parties to block legislation .

the announcement was certainly embarrassing for german chancellor angela merkel .
it came just hours after she gave a historic speech before a joint session of the us congress in washington .
the newly re-elected chancellor had invested a lot of political capital backing a deal for gm to sell its troubled european subsidiary to a consortium led by canada 's magna and its russian banking partner sberbank .
apart from being embarrassing , gm 's reversal has created a complicated situation for the chancellor and several german state premiers , said gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn and merkel biographer .
it is almost as if gm had mugged leading german politicians , he told deutsche welle .
and now , no one knows what will happen next .
gm needs cash to restructure opel while gm has already declared it will repay a 1.5 billion euro bridge loan the german government had granted in may to keep gm 's european operations alive during negotiations to find an investor , berlin has been non-committal about whether to offer gm fresh government aid to save thousands of jobs at german opel plants .
the us auto giant faces the question of how to come up with the three-billions euros it estimates it needs to restructure its european operations .
but langguth pointed out that the german federal government is deeply in debt , and needs to try and balance its budget .
“ at the moment , merkel does not have a lot of room for maneuvering , ” lagguth said .
german political leaders may be angry , bonn political scientist langguth said , but that was not necessarily true for german taxpayers who had been wondering why state help was needed for the rüsselsheim-based automaker and were not happy with the government 's policy on opel in the first place .
“ the taxpayers do n't like to pay the insolvencies of the big companies , while the state would normally do nothing for smaller and medium-sized companies when they are insolvent , ” langguth said .
merkel 's previous coalition government with the social democrats had made billions of euros in public funds available to prop up companies hit by the crisis . ”
angry opel workers protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of opel workers vent their anger in protests gm vice president john smith , meanwhile , said there was very little difference between the offers put forward by magna and what gm had in mind for opel .
gm announced it planned to cut about 10,000 jobs , almost a fifth of the workers employed by gm in europe .
meanwhile on thursday , thousands of opel employees in germany walked off their jobs to join mass rallyes in protest of gm 's decision . there are four opel plants in germany , but the future of the plant in bochum in north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- is likely to be of major concern for chancellor merkel .
the prospect of job losses at the plant in germany 's most populous state could cost her christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- party votes in state elections in nrw in may 2010 .
should the cdu lose power in the state , merkel 's government would no longer have a centre-right majority in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , and that would in turn allow opposition parties to block legislation .

the move is in response to a boycott of the trial by karadzic . the judges at the un war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia ordered a court-appointed counsel to represent karadzic in the event he continued to boycott the hearings .
the genocide trial began on october 26 but the accused did not appear , claiming he had not been given enough time to prepare his defense .
karadzic had been warned on four occasions that his continued boycott would result in the appointment of a counsel to represent him .
" the accused has indeed substantially and persistently obstructed the proper and expeditious conduct of his trial by refusing to attend the proceedings , " said the written decision imposing the legal counsel .
" the accused 's conduct has effectively brought the trial to a halt , which is evidently his purpose . "
the icc judges said karadzic would still be able to represent himself following the appointment of the legal counsel , but that if he continued his boycott of the proceedings when the trial resumes on march 1 , 2010 , then the legal counsel would step in .
karadzic currently has a legal team consisting of 20 mainly volunteer legal advisors , but would forfeit that privilege if he continues his boycott .
the un court has charged karadzic with 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his role in the 1992-1995 war in bosnia .
the conflict killed an estimated 100,000 people and displaced 2.2 million others. dfm / afp / ap / reuters editor : deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some readers think so as the first round of state visits begins for the new coalition government , our readers speculate as to why some nations are being visited before others and where germany 's best efforts should be made . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
westerwelle in poland i think that chancellor merkel and her vice chancellor did the right thing by sending the vice chancellor and foreign minister to poland .
they sent a strong message to eastern europe that germany is very serious about good relations in eastern europe . - stuart john pearson , australia i strongly support westerwelle 's initiatives and believe that germany should strengthen its relationships with its eastern neighbors , including russia , which can only serve to strengthen its position in the world as well as its trade with emerging countries .
ultimately , this should serve to strengthen all of the european union by strengthening their economies and improving the quality of life .
germany should utilize a diversified strategy by strengthening and expanding its relations .
it has successfully strengthened its relationships with other nations including the usa , china , japan , south korea and india and should continue on its course . - rolf boll , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by visiting poland first , westerwelle broke with tradition as foreign minister setting aside what effect the foreign minister 's visit to warsaw will have on german-french relations , the visit to poland was clearly a studied move , which shows the development of a kind of inner ostpolitik .
it is a recognition that the federal republic 's security is , to an extent , dependent on the stability of , and co-operation with , its eastern neighbours in the eu .
this appeared to be a " broad spectrum " move , aimed as much at russia as at warsaw .
the growth of bilateral ties with germany , and multilateral relationships with the wider eu is to be welcomed , and the symbolism of herr westerwelle 's visit was not lost on polish public opinion . - arthur zielinski , poland merkel 's visit to washington let 's hope that there will never be another war in europe .
obama will let you down , guaranteed , with his lack of support .
obama is a small time player with no real understanding of the world and the dangers facing the us and europe .
with him in the white house you will never have the same support germany had 50 years ago . - hans pfadt , us mrs. merkel is inspirational and gives me confidence that the problems of the civilized world can be overcome .
political leaders must concede that charisma is critical and she has it , which in turn makes those who are governed feel well led and confident .
through this we can sleep better at night .
can we outsource our political leadership ; fire the inexperienced junior communist obama and then hire her to be our president here in the usa ?
arnold schwarzenegger would make a great running mate ! - vincent , us i have been impressed and moved by mrs. merkel 's inauguration announcement , especially when she concluded : " god , please help me . "
may god bless your chancellor with holy wisdom so that she can think out right policies in education and justice . - thuy huynh , vietnam it is of utmost interest that congress is told to be extremely careful in relation to russia .
the old stalinist ways are returning to public life in russia and diplomatic envoys must be warned not to trust russian politics .
mrs. merkel is an expert on russia from her days in east germany . - lorenz michael hesse , south africa " tear down today 's walls " angela merkel is a great credit to germany and brings strong values to one of our greatest allies .
it was an honor to have her speak before our us congress .
may germany continue to reap the rewards of her great intellect . - mark lockwood , us i think it is significant that ms. merkel was asked to speak to the us congress .
i think that most americans have a positive opinion of germany and germans as a whole .
her speech before the congress will not have much effect - good or bad - on how americans feel .
unfortunately , most americans are fed up with anything and everything that comes from washington dc and this congress . - a. barnes , us i think that dr. merkel will bring both the us and germany closer together .
i was watching the live broadcast and i was captivated by her speech .

westerwelle in poland i think that chancellor merkel and her vice chancellor did the right thing by sending the vice chancellor and foreign minister to poland .
they sent a strong message to eastern europe that germany is very serious about good relations in eastern europe . - stuart john pearson , australia i strongly support westerwelle 's initiatives and believe that germany should strengthen its relationships with its eastern neighbors , including russia , which can only serve to strengthen its position in the world as well as its trade with emerging countries .
ultimately , this should serve to strengthen all of the european union by strengthening their economies and improving the quality of life .
germany should utilize a diversified strategy by strengthening and expanding its relations .

it is a recognition that the federal republic 's security is , to an extent , dependent on the stability of , and co-operation with , its eastern neighbours in the eu .
this appeared to be a " broad spectrum " move , aimed as much at russia as at warsaw .
the growth of bilateral ties with germany , and multilateral relationships with the wider eu is to be welcomed , and the symbolism of herr westerwelle 's visit was not lost on polish public opinion . - arthur zielinski , poland merkel 's visit to washington let 's hope that there will never be another war in europe .
obama will let you down , guaranteed , with his lack of support .
obama is a small time player with no real understanding of the world and the dangers facing the us and europe .

political leaders must concede that charisma is critical and she has it , which in turn makes those who are governed feel well led and confident .
through this we can sleep better at night .

some readers think so as the first round of state visits begins for the new coalition government , our readers speculate as to why some nations are being visited before others and where germany 's best efforts should be made . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
westerwelle in poland i think that chancellor merkel and her vice chancellor did the right thing by sending the vice chancellor and foreign minister to poland .
they sent a strong message to eastern europe that germany is very serious about good relations in eastern europe . - stuart john pearson , australia i strongly support westerwelle 's initiatives and believe that germany should strengthen its relationships with its eastern neighbors , including russia , which can only serve to strengthen its position in the world as well as its trade with emerging countries .
ultimately , this should serve to strengthen all of the european union by strengthening their economies and improving the quality of life .
germany should utilize a diversified strategy by strengthening and expanding its relations .
it has successfully strengthened its relationships with other nations including the usa , china , japan , south korea and india and should continue on its course . - rolf boll , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by visiting poland first , westerwelle broke with tradition as foreign minister setting aside what effect the foreign minister 's visit to warsaw will have on german-french relations , the visit to poland was clearly a studied move , which shows the development of a kind of inner ostpolitik .
it is a recognition that the federal republic 's security is , to an extent , dependent on the stability of , and co-operation with , its eastern neighbours in the eu .
this appeared to be a " broad spectrum " move , aimed as much at russia as at warsaw .
the growth of bilateral ties with germany , and multilateral relationships with the wider eu is to be welcomed , and the symbolism of herr westerwelle 's visit was not lost on polish public opinion . - arthur zielinski , poland merkel 's visit to washington let 's hope that there will never be another war in europe .
obama will let you down , guaranteed , with his lack of support .
obama is a small time player with no real understanding of the world and the dangers facing the us and europe .
with him in the white house you will never have the same support germany had 50 years ago . - hans pfadt , us mrs. merkel is inspirational and gives me confidence that the problems of the civilized world can be overcome .
political leaders must concede that charisma is critical and she has it , which in turn makes those who are governed feel well led and confident .
through this we can sleep better at night .
can we outsource our political leadership ; fire the inexperienced junior communist obama and then hire her to be our president here in the usa ?
arnold schwarzenegger would make a great running mate ! - vincent , us i have been impressed and moved by mrs. merkel 's inauguration announcement , especially when she concluded : " god , please help me . "
may god bless your chancellor with holy wisdom so that she can think out right policies in education and justice . - thuy huynh , vietnam it is of utmost interest that congress is told to be extremely careful in relation to russia .
the old stalinist ways are returning to public life in russia and diplomatic envoys must be warned not to trust russian politics .
mrs. merkel is an expert on russia from her days in east germany . - lorenz michael hesse , south africa " tear down today 's walls " angela merkel is a great credit to germany and brings strong values to one of our greatest allies .
it was an honor to have her speak before our us congress .
may germany continue to reap the rewards of her great intellect . - mark lockwood , us i think it is significant that ms. merkel was asked to speak to the us congress .
i think that most americans have a positive opinion of germany and germans as a whole .
her speech before the congress will not have much effect - good or bad - on how americans feel .
unfortunately , most americans are fed up with anything and everything that comes from washington dc and this congress . - a. barnes , us i think that dr. merkel will bring both the us and germany closer together .
i was watching the live broadcast and i was captivated by her speech .
her speech on climate change especially captivated me , and i do believe will encourage the us to adopt a climate agreement .
this will in turn bring both countries closer together .
dr. merkel 's ending was also very encouraging and i especially liked the analogy she used between the freedom bell in berlin and the liberty bell in philadelphia . - ayron elijah sim , singapore europe is already very friendly toward us global policy and any more would not seem to be proper for an institution which hopefully formulates its own independant global policies , aside from the us policy of global dominance . - g. gosau , canada compiled by stuart tiffen editor : deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de poland gets special attention from top german diplomat guido westerwelle made his first trip as german foreign minister to poland on saturday .
this first visit to eastern rather than western europe sets a new tone for the government 's foreign policy .
-lrb- 31.10.2009 -rrb- honor , yes , but tough questions also await merkel in washington angela merkel will be the first german head of government since konrad adenauer to speak before the us congress .
it 's a great honor for the chancellor , but equally great are the expectations of the obama administration .
-lrb- 01.11.2009 -rrb- merkel urges us , europe to ' tear down today 's walls ' angela merkel accepted a rare invitation and addressed the us congress to mark the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de india -pipe- 05.11.2009 european union 's relations to india growing in intensity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts foresee a continued warming of relations between the european union and india the eu and india will focus on pushing their free trade pact during their 10th annual summit in new delhi on friday .
but other significant issues are also on the agenda , though the two sides do n't always see eye-to-eye . a major sticking point at the eu-india summit is the planned free trade agreement -lrb- fta -rrb- between the two sides .
daniele smadja , head of the european commission 's delegation to india , said on wednesday that the talks needed a boost .
" the fta negotiations are very complex , " smadja said .
" we have to jump into the cold water of give and take . "
the time had come to exchange concessions , she said .
but clemens spiess , a lecturer at the south asia institute at the university of heidelberg , said he did not expect a final agreement to be reached .
" there are still a lot of hurdles , " spiess told deutsche welle .
these include intellectual property rights disputes and tariff disagreements .
he said he did not expect fta talks to conclude successfully until 2010 or 2011 .
security has become a common challenge in the past , the eu 's relations to india have focused primarily on trade and economic issues .
this comes as no surprise , as the eu is india 's largest trading partner .
graham watson , chairman of the european parliament delegation for relations with india , said trade has more than doubled between the two partners over the past five years .
according to parliament figures , bilateral trade is expected to exceed 70.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 104.5 billion -rrb- by 2010 and 160.6 billion euros by 2015 .
" clearly it 's mainly in the trade area that we want to talk , but we also recognize on both sides that we have a common challenge in promoting peace and comprehensive security , " watson told deutsche welle .
a security dialogue has been in place since 2006 .
the eu not only recognized india 's role as a force of stability in a volatile region , but also as one of the few democracies in the region , he said .
" democracy gives india a huge advantage over china in the medium and long-term , " watson said .
" it makes it far easier for the eu to deal with india , not least because once a decision is taken it represents a consensus of opinion and therefore to be stuck to . "
this perception was n't always the case , though , said rajendra k jain , professor and former chairman of the center for european studies at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many westerners were also taken hostage in mumbai , such as at the taj hotel " the eu never viewed india as an important security partner halfway around the world because their issues and priorities were very different , " jain said in an interview with deutsche welle .
but this changed after the terrorist attacks in mumbai last november .
the eu recognized that india was a significant player in anti-terrorism collaboration .
however , jain said the structure of the eu did not allow for too much optimism in what could be possibly achieved in this area .
" the eu is a very strange political creature , " jain said .
" we should not have too high expectations of what is going to be possible in the realm of security cooperation because insofar as intelligence is concerned , it is a very sensitive issue and not the competence of the european union .
that is clearly with the member states . "
security in particular played a more central role in india 's relations to the united states , spiess said .
" a problem is the interaction between one country , india , on the one side and the 27-member state community , " spiess said .
" we all know there is no such thing as a consistent eu foreign policy , and security policy is now the domain of us-indo relations , which overshadows india 's interactions with the eu in terms of security relations . "
india wo n't succumb to climate pressure with the un conference in copenhagen just a few weeks away , climate change will also be a point of debate in new delhi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is also significantly affecting india " the western countries are pressuring india to join the fight against climate change more thoroughly , " spiess said .
" but india under no circumstances will accept any sort of legally binding reductions on its future greenhouse gas emissions trajectory . "
new delhi is resisting any binding emission cuts and demanding finance and technology from wealthy countries to help reduce emissions .
but there are other areas in which the two sides cooperate closely , such as energy , technology transfer , science and academic cooperation .
at this week 's summit , a cooperation agreement between the european atomic energy community euratom and india will be signed in the field of fusion energy research .
representatives will also launch a call for proposals for research in the field of solar energy , the european commission said .
" there 's plenty there for our leaders to get their teeth into , " watson said .
" the question is : where can we best find areas where we can make progress together and where there 's a real added value in cooperation . "
an equal partnership ?
for the eu , experts agreed , india is certainly an international partner to be taken seriously .
this was evident from the strategic partnership agreement in 2004 and the joint action plan in 2005 , revised in 2008 , which aims to deepen dialogue and cooperation .
" the eu does n't identify too many countries in the world with which they will enter into strategic partnerships , " said spiess .
" from the perspective of the eu , it 's crystal clear that india is identified as a stabilizing factor in the region and as a growing global player .
that 's why it 's a partner to count on . "
but it would go too far to say india was an equal partner , said christian wagner from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" for the eu , india is a developing country , " wagner told deutsche welle .
" the lion 's share of eu resources allocated to india in the next years deal with development goals . "
eu support is earmarked for helping india achieve the un millennium development goals , he said .
with respect to sentiments from new delhi , jain said there has been a shift in perception - despite the strong emphasis on trade and economic issues in the relationship .
" i think there has been a perceptible change in recent years and growing recognition among indian policymakers about the importance of the european union in world affairs , " jain said .

but other significant issues are also on the agenda , though the two sides do n't always see eye-to-eye . a major sticking point at the eu-india summit is the planned free trade agreement -lrb- fta -rrb- between the two sides .
daniele smadja , head of the european commission 's delegation to india , said on wednesday that the talks needed a boost .
" the fta negotiations are very complex , " smadja said .
" we have to jump into the cold water of give and take . "
the time had come to exchange concessions , she said .
but clemens spiess , a lecturer at the south asia institute at the university of heidelberg , said he did not expect a final agreement to be reached .
" there are still a lot of hurdles , " spiess told deutsche welle .
these include intellectual property rights disputes and tariff disagreements .
he said he did not expect fta talks to conclude successfully until 2010 or 2011 .
security has become a common challenge in the past , the eu 's relations to india have focused primarily on trade and economic issues .
this comes as no surprise , as the eu is india 's largest trading partner .
graham watson , chairman of the european parliament delegation for relations with india , said trade has more than doubled between the two partners over the past five years .
according to parliament figures , bilateral trade is expected to exceed 70.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 104.5 billion -rrb- by 2010 and 160.6 billion euros by 2015 .
" clearly it 's mainly in the trade area that we want to talk , but we also recognize on both sides that we have a common challenge in promoting peace and comprehensive security , " watson told deutsche welle .
a security dialogue has been in place since 2006 .
the eu not only recognized india 's role as a force of stability in a volatile region , but also as one of the few democracies in the region , he said .
" democracy gives india a huge advantage over china in the medium and long-term , " watson said .
" it makes it far easier for the eu to deal with india , not least because once a decision is taken it represents a consensus of opinion and therefore to be stuck to . "
this perception was n't always the case , though , said rajendra k jain , professor and former chairman of the center for european studies at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many westerners were also taken hostage in mumbai , such as at the taj hotel " the eu never viewed india as an important security partner halfway around the world because their issues and priorities were very different , " jain said in an interview with deutsche welle .
but this changed after the terrorist attacks in mumbai last november .
the eu recognized that india was a significant player in anti-terrorism collaboration .
however , jain said the structure of the eu did not allow for too much optimism in what could be possibly achieved in this area .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de india -pipe- 05.11.2009 european union 's relations to india growing in intensity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts foresee a continued warming of relations between the european union and india the eu and india will focus on pushing their free trade pact during their 10th annual summit in new delhi on friday .
but other significant issues are also on the agenda , though the two sides do n't always see eye-to-eye . a major sticking point at the eu-india summit is the planned free trade agreement -lrb- fta -rrb- between the two sides .
daniele smadja , head of the european commission 's delegation to india , said on wednesday that the talks needed a boost .
" the fta negotiations are very complex , " smadja said .
" we have to jump into the cold water of give and take . "
the time had come to exchange concessions , she said .
but clemens spiess , a lecturer at the south asia institute at the university of heidelberg , said he did not expect a final agreement to be reached .
" there are still a lot of hurdles , " spiess told deutsche welle .
these include intellectual property rights disputes and tariff disagreements .
he said he did not expect fta talks to conclude successfully until 2010 or 2011 .
security has become a common challenge in the past , the eu 's relations to india have focused primarily on trade and economic issues .
this comes as no surprise , as the eu is india 's largest trading partner .
graham watson , chairman of the european parliament delegation for relations with india , said trade has more than doubled between the two partners over the past five years .
according to parliament figures , bilateral trade is expected to exceed 70.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 104.5 billion -rrb- by 2010 and 160.6 billion euros by 2015 .
" clearly it 's mainly in the trade area that we want to talk , but we also recognize on both sides that we have a common challenge in promoting peace and comprehensive security , " watson told deutsche welle .
a security dialogue has been in place since 2006 .
the eu not only recognized india 's role as a force of stability in a volatile region , but also as one of the few democracies in the region , he said .
" democracy gives india a huge advantage over china in the medium and long-term , " watson said .
" it makes it far easier for the eu to deal with india , not least because once a decision is taken it represents a consensus of opinion and therefore to be stuck to . "
this perception was n't always the case , though , said rajendra k jain , professor and former chairman of the center for european studies at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many westerners were also taken hostage in mumbai , such as at the taj hotel " the eu never viewed india as an important security partner halfway around the world because their issues and priorities were very different , " jain said in an interview with deutsche welle .
but this changed after the terrorist attacks in mumbai last november .
the eu recognized that india was a significant player in anti-terrorism collaboration .
however , jain said the structure of the eu did not allow for too much optimism in what could be possibly achieved in this area .
" the eu is a very strange political creature , " jain said .
" we should not have too high expectations of what is going to be possible in the realm of security cooperation because insofar as intelligence is concerned , it is a very sensitive issue and not the competence of the european union .
that is clearly with the member states . "
security in particular played a more central role in india 's relations to the united states , spiess said .
" a problem is the interaction between one country , india , on the one side and the 27-member state community , " spiess said .
" we all know there is no such thing as a consistent eu foreign policy , and security policy is now the domain of us-indo relations , which overshadows india 's interactions with the eu in terms of security relations . "
india wo n't succumb to climate pressure with the un conference in copenhagen just a few weeks away , climate change will also be a point of debate in new delhi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is also significantly affecting india " the western countries are pressuring india to join the fight against climate change more thoroughly , " spiess said .
" but india under no circumstances will accept any sort of legally binding reductions on its future greenhouse gas emissions trajectory . "
new delhi is resisting any binding emission cuts and demanding finance and technology from wealthy countries to help reduce emissions .
but there are other areas in which the two sides cooperate closely , such as energy , technology transfer , science and academic cooperation .
at this week 's summit , a cooperation agreement between the european atomic energy community euratom and india will be signed in the field of fusion energy research .
representatives will also launch a call for proposals for research in the field of solar energy , the european commission said .
" there 's plenty there for our leaders to get their teeth into , " watson said .
" the question is : where can we best find areas where we can make progress together and where there 's a real added value in cooperation . "
an equal partnership ?
for the eu , experts agreed , india is certainly an international partner to be taken seriously .
this was evident from the strategic partnership agreement in 2004 and the joint action plan in 2005 , revised in 2008 , which aims to deepen dialogue and cooperation .
" the eu does n't identify too many countries in the world with which they will enter into strategic partnerships , " said spiess .
" from the perspective of the eu , it 's crystal clear that india is identified as a stabilizing factor in the region and as a growing global player .
that 's why it 's a partner to count on . "
but it would go too far to say india was an equal partner , said christian wagner from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" for the eu , india is a developing country , " wagner told deutsche welle .
" the lion 's share of eu resources allocated to india in the next years deal with development goals . "
eu support is earmarked for helping india achieve the un millennium development goals , he said .
with respect to sentiments from new delhi , jain said there has been a shift in perception - despite the strong emphasis on trade and economic issues in the relationship .
" i think there has been a perceptible change in recent years and growing recognition among indian policymakers about the importance of the european union in world affairs , " jain said .

despite having only three points from their four champions league group games , and still without a win , stuttgart can now progress to the knockout stages of the competition without having to rely on other results .
their next game is away to glasgow rangers at ibrox .
if they win that , stuttgart 's final game at home against unirea on december 9 could well be the decider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jesus navas scored to give the hosts a first-half lead a goal at last stuttgart had not scored in their last three matches , and showed why when a great counter-attacking chance after two minutes was scuppered by a terrible pass from captain thomas hitzlsperger .
in response , jesus navas put the home team in front from their first opening in the 14th minute , which allowed seville to settle into cruise control for the remainder of the game .
seville played with the assurance that even a draw would ensure qualification and the knowledge they had never conceded to a german side in their home stadium .
but in the end stuttgart found reserves of determination that had gone missing in their season so far , and conjured an equalizer in the 79th minute with a deflected long range effort from zdravko kuzmanovic .
it was only their third goal in seven matches .
the germans then nearly got a winner in the closing minutes of the game , but seville held on for the point they needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus babbel has had little to celebrate recently getting loud " now we have it in our own hands , " said stuttgart manager markus babbel , under pressure to turn the club 's fortunes around , " the first half was a catastrophe , and inexplicable for me .
i had to get a bit loud in the interval .
after that we were braver and showed what we could do .
now we will do everything in our power to reach the last 16 . " they were aided by an inconclusive result in the other group game , in which glasgow rangers and romanian team unirea urziceni also drew 1-1 .
stuttgart are third in the group with three points , one ahead of rangers , and two behind unirea. bk / dpa / sid / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de india -pipe- 05.11.2009 european union 's relations to india growing in intensity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts foresee a continued warming of relations between the european union and india the eu and india will focus on pushing their free trade pact during their 10th annual summit in new delhi on friday .
but other significant issues are also on the agenda , though the two sides do n't always see eye-to-eye . a major sticking point at the eu-india summit is the planned free trade agreement -lrb- fta -rrb- between the two sides .
daniele smadja , head of the european commission 's delegation to india , said on wednesday that the talks needed a boost .
" the fta negotiations are very complex , " smadja said .
" we have to jump into the cold water of give and take . "
the time had come to exchange concessions , she said .
but clemens spiess , a lecturer at the south asia institute at the university of heidelberg , said he did not expect a final agreement to be reached .
" there are still a lot of hurdles , " spiess told deutsche welle .
these include intellectual property rights disputes and tariff disagreements .
he said he did not expect fta talks to conclude successfully until 2010 or 2011 .
security has become a common challenge in the past , the eu 's relations to india have focused primarily on trade and economic issues .
this comes as no surprise , as the eu is india 's largest trading partner .
graham watson , chairman of the european parliament delegation for relations with india , said trade has more than doubled between the two partners over the past five years .
according to parliament figures , bilateral trade is expected to exceed 70.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 104.5 billion -rrb- by 2010 and 160.6 billion euros by 2015 .
" clearly it 's mainly in the trade area that we want to talk , but we also recognize on both sides that we have a common challenge in promoting peace and comprehensive security , " watson told deutsche welle .
a security dialogue has been in place since 2006 .
the eu not only recognized india 's role as a force of stability in a volatile region , but also as one of the few democracies in the region , he said .
" democracy gives india a huge advantage over china in the medium and long-term , " watson said .
" it makes it far easier for the eu to deal with india , not least because once a decision is taken it represents a consensus of opinion and therefore to be stuck to . "
this perception was n't always the case , though , said rajendra k jain , professor and former chairman of the center for european studies at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many westerners were also taken hostage in mumbai , such as at the taj hotel " the eu never viewed india as an important security partner halfway around the world because their issues and priorities were very different , " jain said in an interview with deutsche welle .
but this changed after the terrorist attacks in mumbai last november .
the eu recognized that india was a significant player in anti-terrorism collaboration .
however , jain said the structure of the eu did not allow for too much optimism in what could be possibly achieved in this area .
" the eu is a very strange political creature , " jain said .
" we should not have too high expectations of what is going to be possible in the realm of security cooperation because insofar as intelligence is concerned , it is a very sensitive issue and not the competence of the european union .
that is clearly with the member states . "
security in particular played a more central role in india 's relations to the united states , spiess said .
" a problem is the interaction between one country , india , on the one side and the 27-member state community , " spiess said .
" we all know there is no such thing as a consistent eu foreign policy , and security policy is now the domain of us-indo relations , which overshadows india 's interactions with the eu in terms of security relations . "
india wo n't succumb to climate pressure with the un conference in copenhagen just a few weeks away , climate change will also be a point of debate in new delhi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is also significantly affecting india " the western countries are pressuring india to join the fight against climate change more thoroughly , " spiess said .
" but india under no circumstances will accept any sort of legally binding reductions on its future greenhouse gas emissions trajectory . "
new delhi is resisting any binding emission cuts and demanding finance and technology from wealthy countries to help reduce emissions .
but there are other areas in which the two sides cooperate closely , such as energy , technology transfer , science and academic cooperation .
at this week 's summit , a cooperation agreement between the european atomic energy community euratom and india will be signed in the field of fusion energy research .
representatives will also launch a call for proposals for research in the field of solar energy , the european commission said .
" there 's plenty there for our leaders to get their teeth into , " watson said .
" the question is : where can we best find areas where we can make progress together and where there 's a real added value in cooperation . "
an equal partnership ?
for the eu , experts agreed , india is certainly an international partner to be taken seriously .
this was evident from the strategic partnership agreement in 2004 and the joint action plan in 2005 , revised in 2008 , which aims to deepen dialogue and cooperation .
" the eu does n't identify too many countries in the world with which they will enter into strategic partnerships , " said spiess .
" from the perspective of the eu , it 's crystal clear that india is identified as a stabilizing factor in the region and as a growing global player .
that 's why it 's a partner to count on . "
but it would go too far to say india was an equal partner , said christian wagner from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" for the eu , india is a developing country , " wagner told deutsche welle .
" the lion 's share of eu resources allocated to india in the next years deal with development goals . "
eu support is earmarked for helping india achieve the un millennium development goals , he said .
with respect to sentiments from new delhi , jain said there has been a shift in perception - despite the strong emphasis on trade and economic issues in the relationship .
" i think there has been a perceptible change in recent years and growing recognition among indian policymakers about the importance of the european union in world affairs , " jain said .

gun battles , suicide bombings , and outdated or heavily damaged infrastructure have taken their toll on reconstruction efforts .
although iraq receives millions of euros in development aid , putting the country together again also requires foreign private investment .
the iraq investment and business forum , a two-day conference for german and iraqi investors , began on thursday in berlin .
sponsored by germany 's foreign office and the arab-german chamber of commerce and industry , among others , it comes on the heels of a similar conference in washington held last month , and in the midst of the 10-day baghdad international fair taking place from november 1-10 in iraq 's capital .
last november , iraqi finance minister bayan jabr estimated that iraq would need $ 400 billion -lrb- 270 billion euros -rrb- to rebuild , a figure that would be beyond the country 's reach without foreign investment .
the 2010 budget approved in october was just $ 67 billion .
forum organizers were expecting about 200 german entrepreneurs and 100 of their iraqi counterparts .
newly installed german economics minister rainer bruederle was also expected to attend .
abdulaziz al-mikhlafi , the general secretary of the arab-german chamber of commerce and industry , told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper that iraq was ripe for investment in sectors ranging from airports and highways to universities and the water supply .
" we will present a detailed picture of about 500 projects that iraq can only undertake with foreign support , " al-mikhlafi said .
" getting in on the ground floor " germany 's economic connection to iraq is growing .
german exports to iraq in the first half of this year were up by 96.2 percent compared to january to june 2008 , the organizers told afp .
machinery and vehicles account for most of the nearly 300 million euros -lrb- $ 446 million -rrb- in exports .
" the germans should make their move , " al-mikhlafi said .
" many others are already there - the french , koreans , chinese , japanese . "
the same advice was offered to the uk when it hosted the invest iraq 2009 conference in may . iraq 's deputy prime minister barham salih called on uk firms to recognize the potential his country holds for investors , telling them there was a " unique opportunity to get in on the ground floor of the new iraq . "
the british government sent several ministers to speak at the event as well , as if to demonstrate how seriously it takes the matter , and how badly it wants to encourage trading with iraq .
but have uk firms heeded the call ?
british trade with iraq is certainly on the increase : uk exports of services to the country were worth 273 million pounds -lrb- around 300 million euros -rrb- in 2007 , and 433 million pounds -lrb- around 480 million euros -rrb- in 2008 .
and uk exports of goods to iraq were up 6 percent in 2009 between january and july , compared to the same period last year .
but many say it 's still not enough .
according to mostafa bazergan of the iraqi british business and investment council , british companies are being left behind by international rivals when it comes to investing in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and gas are still predominant parts of the economy , but other areas also need investment " personally i criticize the british companies .

gun battles , suicide bombings , and outdated or heavily damaged infrastructure have taken their toll on reconstruction efforts .
although iraq receives millions of euros in development aid , putting the country together again also requires foreign private investment .
the iraq investment and business forum , a two-day conference for german and iraqi investors , began on thursday in berlin .
sponsored by germany 's foreign office and the arab-german chamber of commerce and industry , among others , it comes on the heels of a similar conference in washington held last month , and in the midst of the 10-day baghdad international fair taking place from november 1-10 in iraq 's capital .
last november , iraqi finance minister bayan jabr estimated that iraq would need $ 400 billion -lrb- 270 billion euros -rrb- to rebuild , a figure that would be beyond the country 's reach without foreign investment .
the 2010 budget approved in october was just $ 67 billion .
forum organizers were expecting about 200 german entrepreneurs and 100 of their iraqi counterparts .
newly installed german economics minister rainer bruederle was also expected to attend .
abdulaziz al-mikhlafi , the general secretary of the arab-german chamber of commerce and industry , told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper that iraq was ripe for investment in sectors ranging from airports and highways to universities and the water supply .
" we will present a detailed picture of about 500 projects that iraq can only undertake with foreign support , " al-mikhlafi said .
" getting in on the ground floor " germany 's economic connection to iraq is growing .
german exports to iraq in the first half of this year were up by 96.2 percent compared to january to june 2008 , the organizers told afp .
machinery and vehicles account for most of the nearly 300 million euros -lrb- $ 446 million -rrb- in exports .
" the germans should make their move , " al-mikhlafi said .
" many others are already there - the french , koreans , chinese , japanese . "
the same advice was offered to the uk when it hosted the invest iraq 2009 conference in may . iraq 's deputy prime minister barham salih called on uk firms to recognize the potential his country holds for investors , telling them there was a " unique opportunity to get in on the ground floor of the new iraq . "
the british government sent several ministers to speak at the event as well , as if to demonstrate how seriously it takes the matter , and how badly it wants to encourage trading with iraq .
but have uk firms heeded the call ?
british trade with iraq is certainly on the increase : uk exports of services to the country were worth 273 million pounds -lrb- around 300 million euros -rrb- in 2007 , and 433 million pounds -lrb- around 480 million euros -rrb- in 2008 .
and uk exports of goods to iraq were up 6 percent in 2009 between january and july , compared to the same period last year .
but many say it 's still not enough .
according to mostafa bazergan of the iraqi british business and investment council , british companies are being left behind by international rivals when it comes to investing in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and gas are still predominant parts of the economy , but other areas also need investment " personally i criticize the british companies .
german companies , australian , italians - they are there , before the british companies .

the move is in response to a boycott of the trial by karadzic . the judges at the un war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia ordered a court-appointed counsel to represent karadzic in the event he continued to boycott the hearings .
the genocide trial began on october 26 but the accused did not appear , claiming he had not been given enough time to prepare his defense .
karadzic had been warned on four occasions that his continued boycott would result in the appointment of a counsel to represent him .
" the accused has indeed substantially and persistently obstructed the proper and expeditious conduct of his trial by refusing to attend the proceedings , " said the written decision imposing the legal counsel .
" the accused 's conduct has effectively brought the trial to a halt , which is evidently his purpose . "
the icc judges said karadzic would still be able to represent himself following the appointment of the legal counsel , but that if he continued his boycott of the proceedings when the trial resumes on march 1 , 2010 , then the legal counsel would step in .
karadzic currently has a legal team consisting of 20 mainly volunteer legal advisors , but would forfeit that privilege if he continues his boycott .
the un court has charged karadzic with 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his role in the 1992-1995 war in bosnia .
the conflict killed an estimated 100,000 people and displaced 2.2 million others. dfm / afp / ap / reuters editor : deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the fate of german carmaker opel is germany 's biggest concern . the german foreign minister used his visit to washington to demand that us auto giant general motors take measures to protect german jobs at its troubled european subsidiary opel .
following a meeting with hillary clinton , foreign minister westerwelle said he was satisfied that the us government was not involved in general motors ' sudden decision this week to keep its european subsidiary opel .
clinton had stressed that gm alone chose to abandon a deal to sell opel to canadian-austrian parts-maker magna , westerwelle said after the meeting .
clinton had " strongly underlined the fact that the decision taken by general motors was a decision taken without any political influence , " westerwelle said .
" it 's very good news to receive . "
the meeting between the two foreign ministers came two days after gm dramatically reneged on its plans to sell opel , instead opting to restructure the company itself .
the german government had clearly favored the magna bid above others .
to sweeten the deal with magna and russian backers sberbank , the german government offered a 1.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 2.2 billion -rrb- bridging loan to gm to keep opel afloat until negotiations could be finalized .
westerwelle said thursday he had made clear that the loan " must be paid back , " adding that clinton had shown " understanding for our position .

she expressed her " great appreciation " for the german presence in the country , and called on the government of afghan president hamid karzai to do its best to combat the rampant corruption that tainted recent national elections held in the country .
westerwelle also called on karzai to address the " mismanagement " that saw thousands of fraudulent ballots cast during the elections that led to his re-election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 05.11.2009 gm 's decision to keep opel could create problems for merkel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new confidence in global strategies as german foreign minister guido westerwelle prepared for talks in the us expected to address gm 's surprise u-turn on the sale of opel , the government in berlin was still smarting on thursday from the shock . general motors ' decision to back out of selling its german-based opel unit has sparked a mix of fury and surprise among german politicians , with reaction reaching from condemnation of gm 's behavior as " entirely unacceptable , " to " shock and annoyance " at detroit 's move .
the announcement was certainly embarrassing for german chancellor angela merkel .
it came just hours after she gave a historic speech before a joint session of the us congress in washington .
the newly re-elected chancellor had invested a lot of political capital backing a deal for gm to sell its troubled european subsidiary to a consortium led by canada 's magna and its russian banking partner sberbank .
apart from being embarrassing , gm 's reversal has created a complicated situation for the chancellor and several german state premiers , said gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn and merkel biographer .
it is almost as if gm had mugged leading german politicians , he told deutsche welle .
and now , no one knows what will happen next .
gm needs cash to restructure opel while gm has already declared it will repay a 1.5 billion euro bridge loan the german government had granted in may to keep gm 's european operations alive during negotiations to find an investor , berlin has been non-committal about whether to offer gm fresh government aid to save thousands of jobs at german opel plants .
the us auto giant faces the question of how to come up with the three-billions euros it estimates it needs to restructure its european operations .
but langguth pointed out that the german federal government is deeply in debt , and needs to try and balance its budget .
“ at the moment , merkel does not have a lot of room for maneuvering , ” lagguth said .
german political leaders may be angry , bonn political scientist langguth said , but that was not necessarily true for german taxpayers who had been wondering why state help was needed for the rüsselsheim-based automaker and were not happy with the government 's policy on opel in the first place .
“ the taxpayers do n't like to pay the insolvencies of the big companies , while the state would normally do nothing for smaller and medium-sized companies when they are insolvent , ” langguth said .
merkel 's previous coalition government with the social democrats had made billions of euros in public funds available to prop up companies hit by the crisis . ”
angry opel workers protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of opel workers vent their anger in protests gm vice president john smith , meanwhile , said there was very little difference between the offers put forward by magna and what gm had in mind for opel .
gm announced it planned to cut about 10,000 jobs , almost a fifth of the workers employed by gm in europe .
meanwhile on thursday , thousands of opel employees in germany walked off their jobs to join mass rallyes in protest of gm 's decision . there are four opel plants in germany , but the future of the plant in bochum in north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- is likely to be of major concern for chancellor merkel .
the prospect of job losses at the plant in germany 's most populous state could cost her christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- party votes in state elections in nrw in may 2010 .
should the cdu lose power in the state , merkel 's government would no longer have a centre-right majority in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , and that would in turn allow opposition parties to block legislation .

the fate of german carmaker opel is germany 's biggest concern . the german foreign minister used his visit to washington to demand that us auto giant general motors take measures to protect german jobs at its troubled european subsidiary opel .
following a meeting with hillary clinton , foreign minister westerwelle said he was satisfied that the us government was not involved in general motors ' sudden decision this week to keep its european subsidiary opel .
clinton had stressed that gm alone chose to abandon a deal to sell opel to canadian-austrian parts-maker magna , westerwelle said after the meeting .
clinton had " strongly underlined the fact that the decision taken by general motors was a decision taken without any political influence , " westerwelle said .
" it 's very good news to receive . "
the meeting between the two foreign ministers came two days after gm dramatically reneged on its plans to sell opel , instead opting to restructure the company itself .
the german government had clearly favored the magna bid above others .

despite having only three points from their four champions league group games , and still without a win , stuttgart can now progress to the knockout stages of the competition without having to rely on other results .
their next game is away to glasgow rangers at ibrox .
if they win that , stuttgart 's final game at home against unirea on december 9 could well be the decider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jesus navas scored to give the hosts a first-half lead a goal at last stuttgart had not scored in their last three matches , and showed why when a great counter-attacking chance after two minutes was scuppered by a terrible pass from captain thomas hitzlsperger .
in response , jesus navas put the home team in front from their first opening in the 14th minute , which allowed seville to settle into cruise control for the remainder of the game .
seville played with the assurance that even a draw would ensure qualification and the knowledge they had never conceded to a german side in their home stadium .
but in the end stuttgart found reserves of determination that had gone missing in their season so far , and conjured an equalizer in the 79th minute with a deflected long range effort from zdravko kuzmanovic .

about $ 3 million , when the sport is basketball , the subject is sneakers , and the name is jordan . marcus jordan clearly wants to walk in his father 's shoes .
but doing so has turned out to be harder than he thought - in fact , it 's turned into a diss of million-dollar proportions .
on wednesday , the university of central florida and german sporting-goods company adidas learned the hard way that blood is sometimes thicker than even a massive wad of money , when the son of legendary chicago bulls guard michael jordan stepped into a pair of nikes instead of adidas basketball shoes , as planned .
now , the fight over what shoes marcus jordan can wear when he plays basketball for ucf means the school may have lost a $ 3-million-dollar sponsorship deal with adidas .
marcus wore a pair of white air jordans - the nike shoe made famous by his father - during an exhibition game between ucf and st. leo on wednesday night , the orlando sentinel reported .
but ucf is in the final year of a five-year contract with adidas that requires coaches and athletes to use the company 's apparel and equipment , which is distinctively marked with three black stripes .
deal or no deal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas shoes bear the company 's three-stripe logo regional adidas representatives say they had made a deal with the university to allow marcus jordan to wear the plain white nikes , but adidas higher-ups later begged to differ .
now , they say they will pull their funding .
adidas was seemingly unmoved by the fact that marcus wore black ankle cuffs distintively marked with the adidas logo , on top of his nikes .
in correspondence published by the associated press , a spokeswoman for adidas said the school has " chosen not to deliver on their contractual commitment to adidas , " and that , in turn , the company will not continue its relationship with the school .
the news has not been officially given to ucf yet , however .
while the school said it was " disappointed " by the possible loss of funding , ucf spokesman joe hornstein said they would respond further " once we receive official notice . " meanwhile , the sting of the loss may have been offset by the win in the exhibition game , where ucf beat st. leo , 84 to 65. jen / ap / afp / reuters editor : deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dan mcnorton , a un spokesman , said the relocations would involve mostly workers without " essential " responsibilities .
" the only people who will remain are regarded as essential staff , " he said , adding that this would be to ensure the safety of all other un staff in afghanistan .
direct link to taliban attack the move comes eight days after an attack on a guesthouse in kabul used by the un , in which five of its workers were killed .
the taliban claimed responsibility for that attack , which saw taliban members storm into the bekhtar house with machine guns after a bomb went off outside .
two afghan security officers were also killed in the gunfire , along with three of the attackers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the october attack was the most severe on a un building in afghanistan un secretary general ban ki-moon held talks with security advisors in kabul earlier this week to asses the situation after the attack , which was the most severe in the organization 's fifty year history in afghanistan .
at present , the un has 5,600 staff in afghanistan , including 1,100 international workers .
speaking in the afghan capital on monday , ban said the un was not daunted by acts of violence and that it would remain in the war-torn country .
" there has been speculation that the united nations will evacuate afghanistan .
we will not be deterred , can not be deterred and must not be deterred and the work of the united nations will continue , " said ban .
in a statement , the un said the relocations were a temporary measure " while additional security was being put in place . "
details of the relocations , including which workers would be affected and how many , have yet to be released .
military disappointed a top nato general reacted with dismay , saying the alliance 's efforts had to go hand-in-hand with civilian work .
" i am not very satisfied , " german general egon ramms told journalists at the innich command bunker on the dutch-german border . " by withdrawing personnel from afghanistan the un will not be able to reach the progress and success we need .

despite having only three points from their four champions league group games , and still without a win , stuttgart can now progress to the knockout stages of the competition without having to rely on other results .
their next game is away to glasgow rangers at ibrox .
if they win that , stuttgart 's final game at home against unirea on december 9 could well be the decider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jesus navas scored to give the hosts a first-half lead a goal at last stuttgart had not scored in their last three matches , and showed why when a great counter-attacking chance after two minutes was scuppered by a terrible pass from captain thomas hitzlsperger .
in response , jesus navas put the home team in front from their first opening in the 14th minute , which allowed seville to settle into cruise control for the remainder of the game .
seville played with the assurance that even a draw would ensure qualification and the knowledge they had never conceded to a german side in their home stadium .
but in the end stuttgart found reserves of determination that had gone missing in their season so far , and conjured an equalizer in the 79th minute with a deflected long range effort from zdravko kuzmanovic .
it was only their third goal in seven matches .
the germans then nearly got a winner in the closing minutes of the game , but seville held on for the point they needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus babbel has had little to celebrate recently getting loud " now we have it in our own hands , " said stuttgart manager markus babbel , under pressure to turn the club 's fortunes around , " the first half was a catastrophe , and inexplicable for me .
i had to get a bit loud in the interval .
after that we were braver and showed what we could do .
now we will do everything in our power to reach the last 16 . " they were aided by an inconclusive result in the other group game , in which glasgow rangers and romanian team unirea urziceni also drew 1-1 .
stuttgart are third in the group with three points , one ahead of rangers , and two behind unirea. bk / dpa / sid / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

children are very susceptible to the disease and die at a rate of one every 30 seconds . scientists from throughout the world are meeting in nairobi to consider new research and treatments that may help eradicate malaria .
the disease poses a serious health threat in africa , but a promising new treatment is on the horizon . the treatment is a vaccine called rtss and has been tested for 20 years by scientists in africa .
experts hope that its effectiveness will be confirmed within three years , following the evaluation of field trials with infected children . the best results to date kenyan pediatrician walter otieno confirmed the significance of scientists ' recent research into treating malaria . " it is the first time that a vaccine against malaria has made it to the third and final testing phase , " he said .
" if it succeeds here , then the vaccine is ready for the market .
we are confident that in three to five years we will have an effective treatment that can be combined with other vaccinations to treat kids . " to date , the vaccine has shown promising results .
in the second testing phase , more than half of the children who received the vaccination no longer suffered severely from the mosquito-borne disease .
rtss has produced better results than any previous malaria treatment but still does not offer complete protection .
otieno advises parents to take precautionary measures against malaria , like using mosquito netting around kids ' beds . children especially at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malaria is a big health concern for african children children suffering from a severe case of malaria may experience blood loss , brain damage and eventually comas .

more than 90 percent of the deaths caused by malaria occur in africa . " the situation with malaria here is really catastrophic , " explained otieno .
" people are bitten nearly every day by mosquitoes bearing the disease .
seven out of 10 children are brought to our hospital because of malaria . " mothers with their babies often fill the waiting rooms of the medical research center in kombewa , kenya .
they hope their children can take part in rtss trials . " we keep having problems with malaria in our family , " said patricia mrunde , a mother of six , was recently among those seeking a vaccination for her daughter .
" a few weeks ago , my oldest son experienced a high fever as part of an outbreak .
when an outbreak is especially bad , his whole body jerks and cramps uncontrollably . " the mothers whose children take part in the trial swill not know whether their children will receive placebo injections or injections containing the anti-malaria vaccine . nevertheless , mrunde said she is still optimistic . " my daughter already had stomach pain and diarrhea after her first injection , " she said .
" she was treated here for both problems , and now she feels good again . " marc engelhardt -lrb- gw -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de investment -pipe- 05.11.2009 iraqis on mission to attract german investors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq has no shortage of projects in need of foreign investment british companies should invest more boldly in iraq , trade officials in baghdad say , adding that competitors - germany among them - are making their moves faster . there 's no doubt that there is much to rebuild in iraq .
gun battles , suicide bombings , and outdated or heavily damaged infrastructure have taken their toll on reconstruction efforts .
although iraq receives millions of euros in development aid , putting the country together again also requires foreign private investment .
the iraq investment and business forum , a two-day conference for german and iraqi investors , began on thursday in berlin .
sponsored by germany 's foreign office and the arab-german chamber of commerce and industry , among others , it comes on the heels of a similar conference in washington held last month , and in the midst of the 10-day baghdad international fair taking place from november 1-10 in iraq 's capital .
last november , iraqi finance minister bayan jabr estimated that iraq would need $ 400 billion -lrb- 270 billion euros -rrb- to rebuild , a figure that would be beyond the country 's reach without foreign investment .
the 2010 budget approved in october was just $ 67 billion .
forum organizers were expecting about 200 german entrepreneurs and 100 of their iraqi counterparts .
newly installed german economics minister rainer bruederle was also expected to attend .
abdulaziz al-mikhlafi , the general secretary of the arab-german chamber of commerce and industry , told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper that iraq was ripe for investment in sectors ranging from airports and highways to universities and the water supply .
" we will present a detailed picture of about 500 projects that iraq can only undertake with foreign support , " al-mikhlafi said .
" getting in on the ground floor " germany 's economic connection to iraq is growing .
german exports to iraq in the first half of this year were up by 96.2 percent compared to january to june 2008 , the organizers told afp .
machinery and vehicles account for most of the nearly 300 million euros -lrb- $ 446 million -rrb- in exports .
" the germans should make their move , " al-mikhlafi said .
" many others are already there - the french , koreans , chinese , japanese . "
the same advice was offered to the uk when it hosted the invest iraq 2009 conference in may . iraq 's deputy prime minister barham salih called on uk firms to recognize the potential his country holds for investors , telling them there was a " unique opportunity to get in on the ground floor of the new iraq . "
the british government sent several ministers to speak at the event as well , as if to demonstrate how seriously it takes the matter , and how badly it wants to encourage trading with iraq .
but have uk firms heeded the call ?
british trade with iraq is certainly on the increase : uk exports of services to the country were worth 273 million pounds -lrb- around 300 million euros -rrb- in 2007 , and 433 million pounds -lrb- around 480 million euros -rrb- in 2008 .
and uk exports of goods to iraq were up 6 percent in 2009 between january and july , compared to the same period last year .
but many say it 's still not enough .
according to mostafa bazergan of the iraqi british business and investment council , british companies are being left behind by international rivals when it comes to investing in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and gas are still predominant parts of the economy , but other areas also need investment " personally i criticize the british companies .
german companies , australian , italians - they are there , before the british companies .
i wonder when they will realize this is a mistake and they should correct it , " bazergan said .
“ brits are moving in , little by little ” but michael thomas , director general of the london-based middle east association , says british companies are moving into iraq .
a short while ago he arrived back from iraq on the largest uk trade mission ever to visit the country .
he traveled with british business leaders and was granted audiences with several iraqi government ministers keen to talk about opportunities for increased trade .
thomas insists british companies are already on the ground , investing .
“ oil and gas is moving ahead quite nicely , " thomas said .
" bp -lsb- british petroleum -rsb- have got a big deal down in the south with the chinese .
shell are also there .
penspen , a big pipeline company , are there .
we 've got a huge number of british companies there at the moment - little by little the brits are moving in . "
but thomas admits the brits might be moving in more slowly than competitors when it comes to investing in iraq , preferring to spend time building business relationships .
" it takes a bit longer , we do n't rush in madly , but once we 're there , we 're there for the long haul , " thomas said most of the british companies already in iraq are oil and gas firms - that sector is already proving very lucrative for uk business .
the hope is now that other british industries will move in - although security issues remain an overriding and often prohibitive concern . beyond gas and oil the uk government is now keen to encourage investment in iraq , having played a large role in the 2003 invasion of the country .
not only to help with its rebuilding and economic growth , but also because of the potential for money to be made for british firms .
investment is growing , and there have been notable successes already . thomas and bazergan agree that the opportunities for business investment in iraq are wide and plentiful , in industries including telecommunications , industry , agriculture , housing , water , waste water , and electricity .
thomas insists the list of services that british companies could be supplying to iraq is " absolutely endless . "

marcus wore a pair of white air jordans - the nike shoe made famous by his father - during an exhibition game between ucf and st. leo on wednesday night , the orlando sentinel reported .

smith did not specify where the cuts would be made . the announcement comes less than a day after gm announced its decision not to sell off opel to a consortium led by canadian car-parts maker magna and russian state bank sberbank . the job cuts would be undertaken with the view to reduce costs at opel by around 30 percent , smith said , adding that the plan did not differ substantially from proposals for opel tabled by magna and sberbank . gm said it wanted to finalize its restructuring plans for opel as soon as possible for presentation to european governments . muted response the european commission has responded so far in neutral tones to the decision by gm to hold on to opel and its other european unit vauxhall . european union competition spokesman jonathan todd said merely that the commission , the eu 's executive body , " takes note " of the decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government was closely involved in bringing about the magna deal gm said it would keep its european operations because of an improvement in the economic environment . it 's also understood that gm was concerned that its position as a global company would be damaged if opel and vauxhall were competing with it in europe . european governments are now awaiting a possible request by gm for aid to help it restructure opel .
the magna-sberbank consortium had been set to receive a massive state aid package from germany to help along its restructuring plans . the german state support had been the subject of an eu investigation into whether the funds were linked to the maintenance of jobs in germany ahead of other european countries which host opel plants , a move which would have violated eu competition rules . juergen ruettgers , the state premier of north rhine-westphalia , where opel 's bochum plant is located , demanded that gm keep all its opel factories in germany running .
he told broadcaster zdf on wednesday that this should be a condition of any german state help . he also demanded that there be no operational redundancies in germany , and that any job cuts should be " socially responsible " .
ruettgers promised there would be no financial aid from north rhine-westphalia if the bochum plant were closed down .
" no-one can expect us to pay for the closure of the bochum factory , " he said . 3,000 opel workers are expected to appear at a demonstration on the bochum factory grounds on thursday afternoon .
the rally is being organized by industrial trade union ig metall , and production is expected to stop for its duration . ruettgers will speak at the demonstration , as will local social democrat party head hannelore kraft , and trade union leaders rainer einenkel and oliver burkhard . " germany 's decision " todd said the same rules would apply if gm applied to european governments for funding now it has decided not to sell opel .
the german government had confirmed to the eu that the money would have been available to any of the potential buyers , todd said , adding that it was not for the eu to tell germany what to do with its money now . " that is a matter for the german government , " he said .
" the commission can not suggest or oblige member states to give state aid ; we can however and do verify the conditions of any state aid that is given . " the commission insisted it is ready to facilitate discussions between gm and its european partners if needed . but now gm has backed away from a deal at the very last minute , it may be significantly harder to establish trust between the parties . author : nina-maria potts / mll / dfm editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de east germany -pipe- 05.11.2009 a leipzig museum depicts the power and the banality of stasi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this device was used to steam letters open in leipzig 's stasi museum , visitors learn about that city 's role in bringing down the wall .
protestors did more than just chant " we are the people ! " – they actually deposed the ministry for state security . along with dresden , magdeburg and berlin , leipzig was a starting point for the now famous monday prayers and protests against the former east german government .
for weeks , demonstrators in leipzig placed burning candles in front of the headquarters of the ministry for state security .
then on december 4 , 1989 , the demonstrators managed to occupy the building .
their actions effectively ended the surveillance and informing upon suspect citizens that were the central tasks of the agency , referred to as the stasi .
it was the beginning of a long process of recovery .
eavesdropped and spied on here in the museum , it smells like linoleum floors and old files .
this is no coincidence , since today 's stasi museum occupies the same rooms formerly used by the ministry for state security .
now the museum belongs to the leipzig citizens ' association .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even brick walls were no challenge for the stasi 's bugging devices twelve rooms are devoted to the museum 's permanent exhibit , called " stasi – power and banality . "
the museum recreates the history of the stasi and of the communist german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- .
with the stasi 's help , the gdr extinguished its citizens ' rights to privacy and freedom of opinion .
the museum 's 40,000 exhibit pieces provide insight into all aspects of the stasi .
their methods were manipulative and dehumanizing .

protestors did more than just chant " we are the people ! " – they actually deposed the ministry for state security . along with dresden , magdeburg and berlin , leipzig was a starting point for the now famous monday prayers and protests against the former east german government .
for weeks , demonstrators in leipzig placed burning candles in front of the headquarters of the ministry for state security .
then on december 4 , 1989 , the demonstrators managed to occupy the building .
their actions effectively ended the surveillance and informing upon suspect citizens that were the central tasks of the agency , referred to as the stasi .
it was the beginning of a long process of recovery .
eavesdropped and spied on here in the museum , it smells like linoleum floors and old files .
this is no coincidence , since today 's stasi museum occupies the same rooms formerly used by the ministry for state security .
now the museum belongs to the leipzig citizens ' association .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even brick walls were no challenge for the stasi 's bugging devices twelve rooms are devoted to the museum 's permanent exhibit , called " stasi – power and banality . "
the museum recreates the history of the stasi and of the communist german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- .
with the stasi 's help , the gdr extinguished its citizens ' rights to privacy and freedom of opinion .
the museum 's 40,000 exhibit pieces provide insight into all aspects of the stasi .
their methods were manipulative and dehumanizing .
visitors are shown wiretaps and tapes used to eavesdrop on citizens , stasi uniforms , surveillance cameras and the disguises used by the complicit citizens who worked as unofficial informers .
photos and original documents from the stasi headquarters tell the rest of the story .
original building the museum is one of only a handful of buildings being used that once belonged to the stasi .
its location underscores the repression and psychological damage inflicted by the security ministry over several decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a portrait of gdr leader erich honecker on the wall of a stasi office an original cell from an interrogation unit demonstrates the disturbing conditions faced by those the stasi imprisoned .
another part of the exhibit concerns the death penalty in the gdr and memorializes those who were sentenced to death by the regime .
the gdr 's former execution chamber in leipzig sheds further light on these deaths and is occasionally open to visitors .
a memorial and a warning the leipzig citizens ' association operates the museum , which is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
there is no entrance fee .
guided tours are led at 3 p.m.
those interested in a tour should meet at the museum 's main entrance at dittrichring 24 .
group tours in other languages including english , french , hungarian and spanish are available for registered parties .

" gm had the gall to make the decision that was best for the company , " the paper writes . " after months of hemming and hawing , the americans are only partly to blame , " the paper says .
" the gm decision was only made possible after the european commission forced germany in october to offer any opel suitor the same financial conditions as magna .
for the german government , the whole rescue maneuver was a complete waste of effort . " like austria , spain is also a country that stands to lose jobs in the wake of an opel restructuring .
madrid 's el pais thinks that general motors " must provide a convincing explanation for its radical change of mind . " but , the paper notes , " the german government and opel 's works council also owe us a justification why they are so hostile toward gm .
the us company understands the auto business and has the experience - something that can not necessarily be said for magna and -lsb- its russian partner -rsb- sberbank . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general motors has decided not to sell opel russia also stands to lose important opel technology for its car industry following gm 's decision , but the moscow daily komsomolskaya pravda greeted the move with a shot of sarcasm . " oopps !
they did n't give us opel , " the paper writes .
" the situation recalls the old russian fairy tale of the grandfather and his cow .
in faraway germany , opel was a millstone for gm , but as soon as the new investor figured out how it could make the company profitable , gm thought maybe it could use this cow itself . " under the headline " detroit ex machina " , britain 's financial times argues that gm 's change of heart is good for the european car industry .
" general motors , a dinosaur only a year ago , has emerged phoenix-like from the ashes of bankruptcy , " the paper writes .
" continued gm ownership has benefits , " the paper says , because its " recent domestic transformation gives credibility to its plans for shrinking opel / vauxhall .
moreover , conditions on its bankruptcy financing prohibit it from subsidizing loss-making operations overseas . "
" gm is not bluffing , " the paper notes , " it must turn opel around . " the dutch daily de volkskrant provides a sober assessment of the circumstances , pointing out that " it was clear from the beginning that gm really did n't want to get rid of opel . "
" after all , " the paper says , " german leaders are not blind to the realities : opel factories will be closed one way or the other , regardless of whether magna or gm are the majority owners . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german newspapers reacted with dismay to the news not surprisingly , the news has also been very sobering for german newspapers .
the berlin-based tagesspiegel did n't mince words , calling it " an unprecedented effrontery , a disaster , a blow to us-german relations . " the paper fumed that it was " worse than the worst times under george bush junior and gerhard schroeder .
and so inexplicable that it triggers three feelings : pity , sorrow and rage . " the stuttgarter nachrichten comments with a hint of resignation .
opel , it writes , " will certainly have to shrink .
it will be painful and many jobs will be lost .
but , our policymakers could not have prevented it , no matter how many billions in taxpayer 's money are spent . " cologne 's rundschau daily calls it " an embarrassing lesson " for germany 's leaders .
the paper said it hopes that the state will avoid becoming bogged down with struggling companies in the future .
" if gm knocks on the door in berlin asking for state aid , the answer can only be a clear and resounding no " , it says emphatically .
" if general motors needs opel so urgently for its own strategic restructuring , as it claims , then its european subsidiary ought to be worth the billions needed to get it back on its feet , " the paper concludes . gb / dpa / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de general motors plans huge job cuts at european unit opel us auto giant general motors says its planned restructuring of opel would involve massive job cuts .

the fate of german carmaker opel is germany 's biggest concern . the german foreign minister used his visit to washington to demand that us auto giant general motors take measures to protect german jobs at its troubled european subsidiary opel .
following a meeting with hillary clinton , foreign minister westerwelle said he was satisfied that the us government was not involved in general motors ' sudden decision this week to keep its european subsidiary opel .
clinton had stressed that gm alone chose to abandon a deal to sell opel to canadian-austrian parts-maker magna , westerwelle said after the meeting .
clinton had " strongly underlined the fact that the decision taken by general motors was a decision taken without any political influence , " westerwelle said .
" it 's very good news to receive . "
the meeting between the two foreign ministers came two days after gm dramatically reneged on its plans to sell opel , instead opting to restructure the company itself .
the german government had clearly favored the magna bid above others .
to sweeten the deal with magna and russian backers sberbank , the german government offered a 1.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 2.2 billion -rrb- bridging loan to gm to keep opel afloat until negotiations could be finalized .
westerwelle said thursday he had made clear that the loan " must be paid back , " adding that clinton had shown " understanding for our position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton thanked germany for its afghan troop deployment germany 's afghan role clinton did not address gm 's plans for opel at a press conference after the meeting , instead shifting the focus to germany 's military deployment in afghanistan .
she expressed her " great appreciation " for the german presence in the country , and called on the government of afghan president hamid karzai to do its best to combat the rampant corruption that tainted recent national elections held in the country .
westerwelle also called on karzai to address the " mismanagement " that saw thousands of fraudulent ballots cast during the elections that led to his re-election .

" gm had the gall to make the decision that was best for the company , " the paper writes . " after months of hemming and hawing , the americans are only partly to blame , " the paper says .
" the gm decision was only made possible after the european commission forced germany in october to offer any opel suitor the same financial conditions as magna .
for the german government , the whole rescue maneuver was a complete waste of effort . " like austria , spain is also a country that stands to lose jobs in the wake of an opel restructuring .
madrid 's el pais thinks that general motors " must provide a convincing explanation for its radical change of mind . " but , the paper notes , " the german government and opel 's works council also owe us a justification why they are so hostile toward gm .
the us company understands the auto business and has the experience - something that can not necessarily be said for magna and -lsb- its russian partner -rsb- sberbank . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general motors has decided not to sell opel russia also stands to lose important opel technology for its car industry following gm 's decision , but the moscow daily komsomolskaya pravda greeted the move with a shot of sarcasm . " oopps !
they did n't give us opel , " the paper writes .
" the situation recalls the old russian fairy tale of the grandfather and his cow .
in faraway germany , opel was a millstone for gm , but as soon as the new investor figured out how it could make the company profitable , gm thought maybe it could use this cow itself . " under the headline " detroit ex machina " , britain 's financial times argues that gm 's change of heart is good for the european car industry .
" general motors , a dinosaur only a year ago , has emerged phoenix-like from the ashes of bankruptcy , " the paper writes .
" continued gm ownership has benefits , " the paper says , because its " recent domestic transformation gives credibility to its plans for shrinking opel / vauxhall .
moreover , conditions on its bankruptcy financing prohibit it from subsidizing loss-making operations overseas . "
" gm is not bluffing , " the paper notes , " it must turn opel around . " the dutch daily de volkskrant provides a sober assessment of the circumstances , pointing out that " it was clear from the beginning that gm really did n't want to get rid of opel . "
" after all , " the paper says , " german leaders are not blind to the realities : opel factories will be closed one way or the other , regardless of whether magna or gm are the majority owners . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german newspapers reacted with dismay to the news not surprisingly , the news has also been very sobering for german newspapers .
the berlin-based tagesspiegel did n't mince words , calling it " an unprecedented effrontery , a disaster , a blow to us-german relations . " the paper fumed that it was " worse than the worst times under george bush junior and gerhard schroeder .
and so inexplicable that it triggers three feelings : pity , sorrow and rage . " the stuttgarter nachrichten comments with a hint of resignation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 05.11.2009 european press review : good for opel but bad for the german government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of anxiety about opel the news that general motors would not sell off its european unit , opel , was greeted in european newspapers mostly with sympathy for the us carmaker 's business decision , but also with criticism of the german government . austria 's die presse from vienna noted that the response from germany 's political leaders ranged from " huffy to hopping mad " , but what actually happened , the paper asks ?
" gm had the gall to make the decision that was best for the company , " the paper writes . " after months of hemming and hawing , the americans are only partly to blame , " the paper says .
" the gm decision was only made possible after the european commission forced germany in october to offer any opel suitor the same financial conditions as magna .
for the german government , the whole rescue maneuver was a complete waste of effort . " like austria , spain is also a country that stands to lose jobs in the wake of an opel restructuring .
madrid 's el pais thinks that general motors " must provide a convincing explanation for its radical change of mind . " but , the paper notes , " the german government and opel 's works council also owe us a justification why they are so hostile toward gm .
the us company understands the auto business and has the experience - something that can not necessarily be said for magna and -lsb- its russian partner -rsb- sberbank . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general motors has decided not to sell opel russia also stands to lose important opel technology for its car industry following gm 's decision , but the moscow daily komsomolskaya pravda greeted the move with a shot of sarcasm . " oopps !
they did n't give us opel , " the paper writes .
" the situation recalls the old russian fairy tale of the grandfather and his cow .
in faraway germany , opel was a millstone for gm , but as soon as the new investor figured out how it could make the company profitable , gm thought maybe it could use this cow itself . " under the headline " detroit ex machina " , britain 's financial times argues that gm 's change of heart is good for the european car industry .
" general motors , a dinosaur only a year ago , has emerged phoenix-like from the ashes of bankruptcy , " the paper writes .
" continued gm ownership has benefits , " the paper says , because its " recent domestic transformation gives credibility to its plans for shrinking opel / vauxhall .
moreover , conditions on its bankruptcy financing prohibit it from subsidizing loss-making operations overseas . "
" gm is not bluffing , " the paper notes , " it must turn opel around . " the dutch daily de volkskrant provides a sober assessment of the circumstances , pointing out that " it was clear from the beginning that gm really did n't want to get rid of opel . "
" after all , " the paper says , " german leaders are not blind to the realities : opel factories will be closed one way or the other , regardless of whether magna or gm are the majority owners . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german newspapers reacted with dismay to the news not surprisingly , the news has also been very sobering for german newspapers .
the berlin-based tagesspiegel did n't mince words , calling it " an unprecedented effrontery , a disaster , a blow to us-german relations . " the paper fumed that it was " worse than the worst times under george bush junior and gerhard schroeder .
and so inexplicable that it triggers three feelings : pity , sorrow and rage . " the stuttgarter nachrichten comments with a hint of resignation .
opel , it writes , " will certainly have to shrink .
it will be painful and many jobs will be lost .
but , our policymakers could not have prevented it , no matter how many billions in taxpayer 's money are spent . " cologne 's rundschau daily calls it " an embarrassing lesson " for germany 's leaders .

about $ 3 million , when the sport is basketball , the subject is sneakers , and the name is jordan . marcus jordan clearly wants to walk in his father 's shoes .
but doing so has turned out to be harder than he thought - in fact , it 's turned into a diss of million-dollar proportions .
on wednesday , the university of central florida and german sporting-goods company adidas learned the hard way that blood is sometimes thicker than even a massive wad of money , when the son of legendary chicago bulls guard michael jordan stepped into a pair of nikes instead of adidas basketball shoes , as planned .
now , the fight over what shoes marcus jordan can wear when he plays basketball for ucf means the school may have lost a $ 3-million-dollar sponsorship deal with adidas .
marcus wore a pair of white air jordans - the nike shoe made famous by his father - during an exhibition game between ucf and st. leo on wednesday night , the orlando sentinel reported .
but ucf is in the final year of a five-year contract with adidas that requires coaches and athletes to use the company 's apparel and equipment , which is distinctively marked with three black stripes .
deal or no deal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas shoes bear the company 's three-stripe logo regional adidas representatives say they had made a deal with the university to allow marcus jordan to wear the plain white nikes , but adidas higher-ups later begged to differ .
now , they say they will pull their funding .
adidas was seemingly unmoved by the fact that marcus wore black ankle cuffs distintively marked with the adidas logo , on top of his nikes .
in correspondence published by the associated press , a spokeswoman for adidas said the school has " chosen not to deliver on their contractual commitment to adidas , " and that , in turn , the company will not continue its relationship with the school .
the news has not been officially given to ucf yet , however .
while the school said it was " disappointed " by the possible loss of funding , ucf spokesman joe hornstein said they would respond further " once we receive official notice . " meanwhile , the sting of the loss may have been offset by the win in the exhibition game , where ucf beat st. leo , 84 to 65. jen / ap / afp / reuters editor : deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

banning means a seizure of assets and a threat of prosecution if the members meet again. dfm / dpa / reuters editor : deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the fate of german carmaker opel is germany 's biggest concern . the german foreign minister used his visit to washington to demand that us auto giant general motors take measures to protect german jobs at its troubled european subsidiary opel .
following a meeting with hillary clinton , foreign minister westerwelle said he was satisfied that the us government was not involved in general motors ' sudden decision this week to keep its european subsidiary opel .
clinton had stressed that gm alone chose to abandon a deal to sell opel to canadian-austrian parts-maker magna , westerwelle said after the meeting .
clinton had " strongly underlined the fact that the decision taken by general motors was a decision taken without any political influence , " westerwelle said .
" it 's very good news to receive . "
the meeting between the two foreign ministers came two days after gm dramatically reneged on its plans to sell opel , instead opting to restructure the company itself .
the german government had clearly favored the magna bid above others .
to sweeten the deal with magna and russian backers sberbank , the german government offered a 1.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 2.2 billion -rrb- bridging loan to gm to keep opel afloat until negotiations could be finalized .
westerwelle said thursday he had made clear that the loan " must be paid back , " adding that clinton had shown " understanding for our position .

westerwelle also called on karzai to address the " mismanagement " that saw thousands of fraudulent ballots cast during the elections that led to his re-election .

but doing so has turned out to be harder than he thought - in fact , it 's turned into a diss of million-dollar proportions .

now , the fight over what shoes marcus jordan can wear when he plays basketball for ucf means the school may have lost a $ 3-million-dollar sponsorship deal with adidas .
marcus wore a pair of white air jordans - the nike shoe made famous by his father - during an exhibition game between ucf and st. leo on wednesday night , the orlando sentinel reported .

dan mcnorton , a un spokesman , said the relocations would involve mostly workers without " essential " responsibilities .
" the only people who will remain are regarded as essential staff , " he said , adding that this would be to ensure the safety of all other un staff in afghanistan .
direct link to taliban attack the move comes eight days after an attack on a guesthouse in kabul used by the un , in which five of its workers were killed .
the taliban claimed responsibility for that attack , which saw taliban members storm into the bekhtar house with machine guns after a bomb went off outside .
two afghan security officers were also killed in the gunfire , along with three of the attackers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the october attack was the most severe on a un building in afghanistan un secretary general ban ki-moon held talks with security advisors in kabul earlier this week to asses the situation after the attack , which was the most severe in the organization 's fifty year history in afghanistan .
at present , the un has 5,600 staff in afghanistan , including 1,100 international workers .
speaking in the afghan capital on monday , ban said the un was not daunted by acts of violence and that it would remain in the war-torn country .
" there has been speculation that the united nations will evacuate afghanistan .
we will not be deterred , can not be deterred and must not be deterred and the work of the united nations will continue , " said ban .
in a statement , the un said the relocations were a temporary measure " while additional security was being put in place . "
details of the relocations , including which workers would be affected and how many , have yet to be released .

reconstruction and security rely on each other , " he said . the head of the un mission in afghanistan , norwegian diplomat kai eide , denied it amounted to a withdrawal from afghanistan .
" we are not pulling out and will not pull out , " he told reporters . a coalition representing 100 non-governmental organisations based in afghanistan commented that ngos employ few foreigners and are not planning to follow the un 's lead in removing them .

axel mitbauer , a member of the gdr national swim team , was the only top athlete to actually use his sport to flee east germany . axel mitbauer 's escape from the german democratic republic 20 years before the fall of the wall was one of the most spectacular ways people chose to flee then east germany . as a member of the gdr national swim team and a master in the 400-meter freestyle , he used his athletic talent to cut through the iron curtain .
on the night of august 17 , 1969 , the then 19-year-old mitbauer swam from the boltenhagen resort area on the baltic sea to luebeck 's bay area . " water is my element , " mitbauer said , reminiscing about his career .
" it 's been my companion , as it were , for the past 51 years , and i still love it . " petroleum jelly to keep out the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 600 athletes escaped the gdr but 40 years ago , crossing the border presented a challenge .
the baltic sea was an area many used in their attempts to flee east germany , and guards were always on the alert as a result .
mitbauer studied the guards ' habits for a week and learned that they turned off the search lights shortly once an hour to allow them to cool .
on august 17 , around 9 p.m. , he grabbed his chance and dove into the water .
as the lights were turned back on , he went under water again and swam 25 kilometers -lrb- 15.5 miles -rrb- . " i had one minute to cross both the first and second sandbanks , " he recalled .
" but the biggest problem was the very cold water .
swimming in it for four to six hours is quite difficult .
nowadays , people can use neoprene suits , but back then , the only thing we could do was smear vaseline all over our bodies . " the baltic sea was just 18 degrees celsius -lrb- 64 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- the night he fled .
he used 30 tubes of petroleum jelly to protect himself against the cold . unhappy with life mitbauer said he was happy as an athlete in the gdr system , but he was n't pleased with life in the country .
when he traveled abroad for competitions , he also saw a huge discrepancy between reality and east german propaganda .
he said he felt his home country was a lawless state and realized early on that he wanted to leave - and that he could use his aquatic talents to do it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a divided east and west berlin " i basically used the east german system that promoted sports in the way it did to ultimately escape it and pursue my own goals , " he said . according to records kept by the former east german secret police , or stasi , more than 600 athletes escaped to the west by 1989 , the year the wall came down .
soccer player falko goetz , cyclist juergen kissner and coach joerg berger were some of them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 05.11.2009 gm 's decision to keep opel could create problems for merkel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new confidence in global strategies as german foreign minister guido westerwelle prepared for talks in the us expected to address gm 's surprise u-turn on the sale of opel , the government in berlin was still smarting on thursday from the shock . general motors ' decision to back out of selling its german-based opel unit has sparked a mix of fury and surprise among german politicians , with reaction reaching from condemnation of gm 's behavior as " entirely unacceptable , " to " shock and annoyance " at detroit 's move .
the announcement was certainly embarrassing for german chancellor angela merkel .
it came just hours after she gave a historic speech before a joint session of the us congress in washington .
the newly re-elected chancellor had invested a lot of political capital backing a deal for gm to sell its troubled european subsidiary to a consortium led by canada 's magna and its russian banking partner sberbank .
apart from being embarrassing , gm 's reversal has created a complicated situation for the chancellor and several german state premiers , said gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn and merkel biographer .
it is almost as if gm had mugged leading german politicians , he told deutsche welle .
and now , no one knows what will happen next .
gm needs cash to restructure opel while gm has already declared it will repay a 1.5 billion euro bridge loan the german government had granted in may to keep gm 's european operations alive during negotiations to find an investor , berlin has been non-committal about whether to offer gm fresh government aid to save thousands of jobs at german opel plants .
the us auto giant faces the question of how to come up with the three-billions euros it estimates it needs to restructure its european operations .
but langguth pointed out that the german federal government is deeply in debt , and needs to try and balance its budget .
“ at the moment , merkel does not have a lot of room for maneuvering , ” lagguth said .
german political leaders may be angry , bonn political scientist langguth said , but that was not necessarily true for german taxpayers who had been wondering why state help was needed for the rüsselsheim-based automaker and were not happy with the government 's policy on opel in the first place .
“ the taxpayers do n't like to pay the insolvencies of the big companies , while the state would normally do nothing for smaller and medium-sized companies when they are insolvent , ” langguth said .
merkel 's previous coalition government with the social democrats had made billions of euros in public funds available to prop up companies hit by the crisis . ”
angry opel workers protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of opel workers vent their anger in protests gm vice president john smith , meanwhile , said there was very little difference between the offers put forward by magna and what gm had in mind for opel .
gm announced it planned to cut about 10,000 jobs , almost a fifth of the workers employed by gm in europe .
meanwhile on thursday , thousands of opel employees in germany walked off their jobs to join mass rallyes in protest of gm 's decision . there are four opel plants in germany , but the future of the plant in bochum in north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- is likely to be of major concern for chancellor merkel .
the prospect of job losses at the plant in germany 's most populous state could cost her christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- party votes in state elections in nrw in may 2010 .
should the cdu lose power in the state , merkel 's government would no longer have a centre-right majority in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , and that would in turn allow opposition parties to block legislation .

about $ 3 million , when the sport is basketball , the subject is sneakers , and the name is jordan . marcus jordan clearly wants to walk in his father 's shoes .
but doing so has turned out to be harder than he thought - in fact , it 's turned into a diss of million-dollar proportions .
on wednesday , the university of central florida and german sporting-goods company adidas learned the hard way that blood is sometimes thicker than even a massive wad of money , when the son of legendary chicago bulls guard michael jordan stepped into a pair of nikes instead of adidas basketball shoes , as planned .
now , the fight over what shoes marcus jordan can wear when he plays basketball for ucf means the school may have lost a $ 3-million-dollar sponsorship deal with adidas .
marcus wore a pair of white air jordans - the nike shoe made famous by his father - during an exhibition game between ucf and st. leo on wednesday night , the orlando sentinel reported .
but ucf is in the final year of a five-year contract with adidas that requires coaches and athletes to use the company 's apparel and equipment , which is distinctively marked with three black stripes .

adidas was seemingly unmoved by the fact that marcus wore black ankle cuffs distintively marked with the adidas logo , on top of his nikes .
in correspondence published by the associated press , a spokeswoman for adidas said the school has " chosen not to deliver on their contractual commitment to adidas , " and that , in turn , the company will not continue its relationship with the school .
the news has not been officially given to ucf yet , however .
while the school said it was " disappointed " by the possible loss of funding , ucf spokesman joe hornstein said they would respond further " once we receive official notice .

gun battles , suicide bombings , and outdated or heavily damaged infrastructure have taken their toll on reconstruction efforts .
although iraq receives millions of euros in development aid , putting the country together again also requires foreign private investment .
the iraq investment and business forum , a two-day conference for german and iraqi investors , began on thursday in berlin .
sponsored by germany 's foreign office and the arab-german chamber of commerce and industry , among others , it comes on the heels of a similar conference in washington held last month , and in the midst of the 10-day baghdad international fair taking place from november 1-10 in iraq 's capital .
last november , iraqi finance minister bayan jabr estimated that iraq would need $ 400 billion -lrb- 270 billion euros -rrb- to rebuild , a figure that would be beyond the country 's reach without foreign investment .
the 2010 budget approved in october was just $ 67 billion .
forum organizers were expecting about 200 german entrepreneurs and 100 of their iraqi counterparts .
newly installed german economics minister rainer bruederle was also expected to attend .
abdulaziz al-mikhlafi , the general secretary of the arab-german chamber of commerce and industry , told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper that iraq was ripe for investment in sectors ranging from airports and highways to universities and the water supply .
" we will present a detailed picture of about 500 projects that iraq can only undertake with foreign support , " al-mikhlafi said .
" getting in on the ground floor " germany 's economic connection to iraq is growing .
german exports to iraq in the first half of this year were up by 96.2 percent compared to january to june 2008 , the organizers told afp .
machinery and vehicles account for most of the nearly 300 million euros -lrb- $ 446 million -rrb- in exports .
" the germans should make their move , " al-mikhlafi said .
" many others are already there - the french , koreans , chinese , japanese . "
the same advice was offered to the uk when it hosted the invest iraq 2009 conference in may . iraq 's deputy prime minister barham salih called on uk firms to recognize the potential his country holds for investors , telling them there was a " unique opportunity to get in on the ground floor of the new iraq . "
the british government sent several ministers to speak at the event as well , as if to demonstrate how seriously it takes the matter , and how badly it wants to encourage trading with iraq .
but have uk firms heeded the call ?
british trade with iraq is certainly on the increase : uk exports of services to the country were worth 273 million pounds -lrb- around 300 million euros -rrb- in 2007 , and 433 million pounds -lrb- around 480 million euros -rrb- in 2008 .
and uk exports of goods to iraq were up 6 percent in 2009 between january and july , compared to the same period last year .
but many say it 's still not enough .
according to mostafa bazergan of the iraqi british business and investment council , british companies are being left behind by international rivals when it comes to investing in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and gas are still predominant parts of the economy , but other areas also need investment " personally i criticize the british companies .
german companies , australian , italians - they are there , before the british companies .
i wonder when they will realize this is a mistake and they should correct it , " bazergan said .
“ brits are moving in , little by little ” but michael thomas , director general of the london-based middle east association , says british companies are moving into iraq .
a short while ago he arrived back from iraq on the largest uk trade mission ever to visit the country .
he traveled with british business leaders and was granted audiences with several iraqi government ministers keen to talk about opportunities for increased trade .
thomas insists british companies are already on the ground , investing .
“ oil and gas is moving ahead quite nicely , " thomas said .
" bp -lsb- british petroleum -rsb- have got a big deal down in the south with the chinese .
shell are also there .
penspen , a big pipeline company , are there .
we 've got a huge number of british companies there at the moment - little by little the brits are moving in . "
but thomas admits the brits might be moving in more slowly than competitors when it comes to investing in iraq , preferring to spend time building business relationships .
" it takes a bit longer , we do n't rush in madly , but once we 're there , we 're there for the long haul , " thomas said most of the british companies already in iraq are oil and gas firms - that sector is already proving very lucrative for uk business .
the hope is now that other british industries will move in - although security issues remain an overriding and often prohibitive concern . beyond gas and oil the uk government is now keen to encourage investment in iraq , having played a large role in the 2003 invasion of the country .
not only to help with its rebuilding and economic growth , but also because of the potential for money to be made for british firms .
investment is growing , and there have been notable successes already . thomas and bazergan agree that the opportunities for business investment in iraq are wide and plentiful , in industries including telecommunications , industry , agriculture , housing , water , waste water , and electricity .
thomas insists the list of services that british companies could be supplying to iraq is " absolutely endless . "

the iraq investment and business forum , a two-day conference for german and iraqi investors , began on thursday in berlin .
sponsored by germany 's foreign office and the arab-german chamber of commerce and industry , among others , it comes on the heels of a similar conference in washington held last month , and in the midst of the 10-day baghdad international fair taking place from november 1-10 in iraq 's capital .
last november , iraqi finance minister bayan jabr estimated that iraq would need $ 400 billion -lrb- 270 billion euros -rrb- to rebuild , a figure that would be beyond the country 's reach without foreign investment .
the 2010 budget approved in october was just $ 67 billion .
forum organizers were expecting about 200 german entrepreneurs and 100 of their iraqi counterparts .
newly installed german economics minister rainer bruederle was also expected to attend .
abdulaziz al-mikhlafi , the general secretary of the arab-german chamber of commerce and industry , told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper that iraq was ripe for investment in sectors ranging from airports and highways to universities and the water supply .
" we will present a detailed picture of about 500 projects that iraq can only undertake with foreign support , " al-mikhlafi said .
" getting in on the ground floor " germany 's economic connection to iraq is growing .
german exports to iraq in the first half of this year were up by 96.2 percent compared to january to june 2008 , the organizers told afp .
machinery and vehicles account for most of the nearly 300 million euros -lrb- $ 446 million -rrb- in exports .
" the germans should make their move , " al-mikhlafi said .
" many others are already there - the french , koreans , chinese , japanese . "
the same advice was offered to the uk when it hosted the invest iraq 2009 conference in may . iraq 's deputy prime minister barham salih called on uk firms to recognize the potential his country holds for investors , telling them there was a " unique opportunity to get in on the ground floor of the new iraq . "
the british government sent several ministers to speak at the event as well , as if to demonstrate how seriously it takes the matter , and how badly it wants to encourage trading with iraq .
but have uk firms heeded the call ?
british trade with iraq is certainly on the increase : uk exports of services to the country were worth 273 million pounds -lrb- around 300 million euros -rrb- in 2007 , and 433 million pounds -lrb- around 480 million euros -rrb- in 2008 .
and uk exports of goods to iraq were up 6 percent in 2009 between january and july , compared to the same period last year .
but many say it 's still not enough .
according to mostafa bazergan of the iraqi british business and investment council , british companies are being left behind by international rivals when it comes to investing in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and gas are still predominant parts of the economy , but other areas also need investment " personally i criticize the british companies .
german companies , australian , italians - they are there , before the british companies .
i wonder when they will realize this is a mistake and they should correct it , " bazergan said .
“ brits are moving in , little by little ” but michael thomas , director general of the london-based middle east association , says british companies are moving into iraq .
a short while ago he arrived back from iraq on the largest uk trade mission ever to visit the country .
he traveled with british business leaders and was granted audiences with several iraqi government ministers keen to talk about opportunities for increased trade .
thomas insists british companies are already on the ground , investing .
“ oil and gas is moving ahead quite nicely , " thomas said .
" bp -lsb- british petroleum -rsb- have got a big deal down in the south with the chinese .
shell are also there .
penspen , a big pipeline company , are there .
we 've got a huge number of british companies there at the moment - little by little the brits are moving in . "
but thomas admits the brits might be moving in more slowly than competitors when it comes to investing in iraq , preferring to spend time building business relationships .
" it takes a bit longer , we do n't rush in madly , but once we 're there , we 're there for the long haul , " thomas said most of the british companies already in iraq are oil and gas firms - that sector is already proving very lucrative for uk business .
the hope is now that other british industries will move in - although security issues remain an overriding and often prohibitive concern . beyond gas and oil the uk government is now keen to encourage investment in iraq , having played a large role in the 2003 invasion of the country .
not only to help with its rebuilding and economic growth , but also because of the potential for money to be made for british firms .
investment is growing , and there have been notable successes already . thomas and bazergan agree that the opportunities for business investment in iraq are wide and plentiful , in industries including telecommunications , industry , agriculture , housing , water , waste water , and electricity .
thomas insists the list of services that british companies could be supplying to iraq is " absolutely endless . "

gun battles , suicide bombings , and outdated or heavily damaged infrastructure have taken their toll on reconstruction efforts .
although iraq receives millions of euros in development aid , putting the country together again also requires foreign private investment .
the iraq investment and business forum , a two-day conference for german and iraqi investors , began on thursday in berlin .
sponsored by germany 's foreign office and the arab-german chamber of commerce and industry , among others , it comes on the heels of a similar conference in washington held last month , and in the midst of the 10-day baghdad international fair taking place from november 1-10 in iraq 's capital .
last november , iraqi finance minister bayan jabr estimated that iraq would need $ 400 billion -lrb- 270 billion euros -rrb- to rebuild , a figure that would be beyond the country 's reach without foreign investment .
the 2010 budget approved in october was just $ 67 billion .
forum organizers were expecting about 200 german entrepreneurs and 100 of their iraqi counterparts .
newly installed german economics minister rainer bruederle was also expected to attend .
abdulaziz al-mikhlafi , the general secretary of the arab-german chamber of commerce and industry , told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper that iraq was ripe for investment in sectors ranging from airports and highways to universities and the water supply .
" we will present a detailed picture of about 500 projects that iraq can only undertake with foreign support , " al-mikhlafi said .
" getting in on the ground floor " germany 's economic connection to iraq is growing .
german exports to iraq in the first half of this year were up by 96.2 percent compared to january to june 2008 , the organizers told afp .
machinery and vehicles account for most of the nearly 300 million euros -lrb- $ 446 million -rrb- in exports .
" the germans should make their move , " al-mikhlafi said .
" many others are already there - the french , koreans , chinese , japanese . "
the same advice was offered to the uk when it hosted the invest iraq 2009 conference in may . iraq 's deputy prime minister barham salih called on uk firms to recognize the potential his country holds for investors , telling them there was a " unique opportunity to get in on the ground floor of the new iraq . "
the british government sent several ministers to speak at the event as well , as if to demonstrate how seriously it takes the matter , and how badly it wants to encourage trading with iraq .
but have uk firms heeded the call ?
british trade with iraq is certainly on the increase : uk exports of services to the country were worth 273 million pounds -lrb- around 300 million euros -rrb- in 2007 , and 433 million pounds -lrb- around 480 million euros -rrb- in 2008 .
and uk exports of goods to iraq were up 6 percent in 2009 between january and july , compared to the same period last year .
but many say it 's still not enough .
according to mostafa bazergan of the iraqi british business and investment council , british companies are being left behind by international rivals when it comes to investing in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and gas are still predominant parts of the economy , but other areas also need investment " personally i criticize the british companies .
german companies , australian , italians - they are there , before the british companies .
i wonder when they will realize this is a mistake and they should correct it , " bazergan said .
“ brits are moving in , little by little ” but michael thomas , director general of the london-based middle east association , says british companies are moving into iraq .
a short while ago he arrived back from iraq on the largest uk trade mission ever to visit the country .
he traveled with british business leaders and was granted audiences with several iraqi government ministers keen to talk about opportunities for increased trade .
thomas insists british companies are already on the ground , investing .
“ oil and gas is moving ahead quite nicely , " thomas said .
" bp -lsb- british petroleum -rsb- have got a big deal down in the south with the chinese .
shell are also there .
penspen , a big pipeline company , are there .
we 've got a huge number of british companies there at the moment - little by little the brits are moving in . "
but thomas admits the brits might be moving in more slowly than competitors when it comes to investing in iraq , preferring to spend time building business relationships .
" it takes a bit longer , we do n't rush in madly , but once we 're there , we 're there for the long haul , " thomas said most of the british companies already in iraq are oil and gas firms - that sector is already proving very lucrative for uk business .
the hope is now that other british industries will move in - although security issues remain an overriding and often prohibitive concern . beyond gas and oil the uk government is now keen to encourage investment in iraq , having played a large role in the 2003 invasion of the country .
not only to help with its rebuilding and economic growth , but also because of the potential for money to be made for british firms .
investment is growing , and there have been notable successes already . thomas and bazergan agree that the opportunities for business investment in iraq are wide and plentiful , in industries including telecommunications , industry , agriculture , housing , water , waste water , and electricity .
thomas insists the list of services that british companies could be supplying to iraq is " absolutely endless . "

some readers think so as the first round of state visits begins for the new coalition government , our readers speculate as to why some nations are being visited before others and where germany 's best efforts should be made . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
westerwelle in poland i think that chancellor merkel and her vice chancellor did the right thing by sending the vice chancellor and foreign minister to poland .
they sent a strong message to eastern europe that germany is very serious about good relations in eastern europe . - stuart john pearson , australia i strongly support westerwelle 's initiatives and believe that germany should strengthen its relationships with its eastern neighbors , including russia , which can only serve to strengthen its position in the world as well as its trade with emerging countries .
ultimately , this should serve to strengthen all of the european union by strengthening their economies and improving the quality of life .
germany should utilize a diversified strategy by strengthening and expanding its relations .
it has successfully strengthened its relationships with other nations including the usa , china , japan , south korea and india and should continue on its course . - rolf boll , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by visiting poland first , westerwelle broke with tradition as foreign minister setting aside what effect the foreign minister 's visit to warsaw will have on german-french relations , the visit to poland was clearly a studied move , which shows the development of a kind of inner ostpolitik .
it is a recognition that the federal republic 's security is , to an extent , dependent on the stability of , and co-operation with , its eastern neighbours in the eu .
this appeared to be a " broad spectrum " move , aimed as much at russia as at warsaw .
the growth of bilateral ties with germany , and multilateral relationships with the wider eu is to be welcomed , and the symbolism of herr westerwelle 's visit was not lost on polish public opinion . - arthur zielinski , poland merkel 's visit to washington let 's hope that there will never be another war in europe .
obama will let you down , guaranteed , with his lack of support .
obama is a small time player with no real understanding of the world and the dangers facing the us and europe .
with him in the white house you will never have the same support germany had 50 years ago . - hans pfadt , us mrs. merkel is inspirational and gives me confidence that the problems of the civilized world can be overcome .
political leaders must concede that charisma is critical and she has it , which in turn makes those who are governed feel well led and confident .
through this we can sleep better at night .
can we outsource our political leadership ; fire the inexperienced junior communist obama and then hire her to be our president here in the usa ?
arnold schwarzenegger would make a great running mate ! - vincent , us i have been impressed and moved by mrs. merkel 's inauguration announcement , especially when she concluded : " god , please help me . "
may god bless your chancellor with holy wisdom so that she can think out right policies in education and justice . - thuy huynh , vietnam it is of utmost interest that congress is told to be extremely careful in relation to russia .
the old stalinist ways are returning to public life in russia and diplomatic envoys must be warned not to trust russian politics .
mrs. merkel is an expert on russia from her days in east germany . - lorenz michael hesse , south africa " tear down today 's walls " angela merkel is a great credit to germany and brings strong values to one of our greatest allies .
it was an honor to have her speak before our us congress .
may germany continue to reap the rewards of her great intellect . - mark lockwood , us i think it is significant that ms. merkel was asked to speak to the us congress .
i think that most americans have a positive opinion of germany and germans as a whole .
her speech before the congress will not have much effect - good or bad - on how americans feel .
unfortunately , most americans are fed up with anything and everything that comes from washington dc and this congress . - a. barnes , us i think that dr. merkel will bring both the us and germany closer together .
i was watching the live broadcast and i was captivated by her speech .
her speech on climate change especially captivated me , and i do believe will encourage the us to adopt a climate agreement .
this will in turn bring both countries closer together .
dr. merkel 's ending was also very encouraging and i especially liked the analogy she used between the freedom bell in berlin and the liberty bell in philadelphia . - ayron elijah sim , singapore europe is already very friendly toward us global policy and any more would not seem to be proper for an institution which hopefully formulates its own independant global policies , aside from the us policy of global dominance . - g. gosau , canada compiled by stuart tiffen editor : deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de india -pipe- 05.11.2009 european union 's relations to india growing in intensity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts foresee a continued warming of relations between the european union and india the eu and india will focus on pushing their free trade pact during their 10th annual summit in new delhi on friday .
but other significant issues are also on the agenda , though the two sides do n't always see eye-to-eye . a major sticking point at the eu-india summit is the planned free trade agreement -lrb- fta -rrb- between the two sides .
daniele smadja , head of the european commission 's delegation to india , said on wednesday that the talks needed a boost .
" the fta negotiations are very complex , " smadja said .
" we have to jump into the cold water of give and take . "
the time had come to exchange concessions , she said .
but clemens spiess , a lecturer at the south asia institute at the university of heidelberg , said he did not expect a final agreement to be reached .
" there are still a lot of hurdles , " spiess told deutsche welle .
these include intellectual property rights disputes and tariff disagreements .
he said he did not expect fta talks to conclude successfully until 2010 or 2011 .
security has become a common challenge in the past , the eu 's relations to india have focused primarily on trade and economic issues .
this comes as no surprise , as the eu is india 's largest trading partner .
graham watson , chairman of the european parliament delegation for relations with india , said trade has more than doubled between the two partners over the past five years .
according to parliament figures , bilateral trade is expected to exceed 70.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 104.5 billion -rrb- by 2010 and 160.6 billion euros by 2015 .
" clearly it 's mainly in the trade area that we want to talk , but we also recognize on both sides that we have a common challenge in promoting peace and comprehensive security , " watson told deutsche welle .
a security dialogue has been in place since 2006 .
the eu not only recognized india 's role as a force of stability in a volatile region , but also as one of the few democracies in the region , he said .
" democracy gives india a huge advantage over china in the medium and long-term , " watson said .
" it makes it far easier for the eu to deal with india , not least because once a decision is taken it represents a consensus of opinion and therefore to be stuck to . "
this perception was n't always the case , though , said rajendra k jain , professor and former chairman of the center for european studies at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many westerners were also taken hostage in mumbai , such as at the taj hotel " the eu never viewed india as an important security partner halfway around the world because their issues and priorities were very different , " jain said in an interview with deutsche welle .
but this changed after the terrorist attacks in mumbai last november .
the eu recognized that india was a significant player in anti-terrorism collaboration .
however , jain said the structure of the eu did not allow for too much optimism in what could be possibly achieved in this area .
" the eu is a very strange political creature , " jain said .
" we should not have too high expectations of what is going to be possible in the realm of security cooperation because insofar as intelligence is concerned , it is a very sensitive issue and not the competence of the european union .
that is clearly with the member states . "
security in particular played a more central role in india 's relations to the united states , spiess said .
" a problem is the interaction between one country , india , on the one side and the 27-member state community , " spiess said .
" we all know there is no such thing as a consistent eu foreign policy , and security policy is now the domain of us-indo relations , which overshadows india 's interactions with the eu in terms of security relations . "
india wo n't succumb to climate pressure with the un conference in copenhagen just a few weeks away , climate change will also be a point of debate in new delhi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is also significantly affecting india " the western countries are pressuring india to join the fight against climate change more thoroughly , " spiess said .
" but india under no circumstances will accept any sort of legally binding reductions on its future greenhouse gas emissions trajectory . "
new delhi is resisting any binding emission cuts and demanding finance and technology from wealthy countries to help reduce emissions .
but there are other areas in which the two sides cooperate closely , such as energy , technology transfer , science and academic cooperation .
at this week 's summit , a cooperation agreement between the european atomic energy community euratom and india will be signed in the field of fusion energy research .
representatives will also launch a call for proposals for research in the field of solar energy , the european commission said .
" there 's plenty there for our leaders to get their teeth into , " watson said .
" the question is : where can we best find areas where we can make progress together and where there 's a real added value in cooperation . "
an equal partnership ?
for the eu , experts agreed , india is certainly an international partner to be taken seriously .
this was evident from the strategic partnership agreement in 2004 and the joint action plan in 2005 , revised in 2008 , which aims to deepen dialogue and cooperation .
" the eu does n't identify too many countries in the world with which they will enter into strategic partnerships , " said spiess .
" from the perspective of the eu , it 's crystal clear that india is identified as a stabilizing factor in the region and as a growing global player .
that 's why it 's a partner to count on . "
but it would go too far to say india was an equal partner , said christian wagner from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" for the eu , india is a developing country , " wagner told deutsche welle .
" the lion 's share of eu resources allocated to india in the next years deal with development goals . "
eu support is earmarked for helping india achieve the un millennium development goals , he said .
with respect to sentiments from new delhi , jain said there has been a shift in perception - despite the strong emphasis on trade and economic issues in the relationship .
" i think there has been a perceptible change in recent years and growing recognition among indian policymakers about the importance of the european union in world affairs , " jain said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 05.11.2009 general motors plans huge job cuts at european unit opel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm has not said where the job cuts would be made us auto giant general motors says its planned restructuring of opel would involve massive job cuts .
the announcement follows a decision by gm not to sell off the carmaker to canadian car-parts maker magna . general motors vice president john smith said wednesday that around 10,000 jobs would be slashed at the company 's european unit opel , which employs some 55,000 europeans in germany , spain , belgium , poland and the uk .
smith did not specify where the cuts would be made . the announcement comes less than a day after gm announced its decision not to sell off opel to a consortium led by canadian car-parts maker magna and russian state bank sberbank . the job cuts would be undertaken with the view to reduce costs at opel by around 30 percent , smith said , adding that the plan did not differ substantially from proposals for opel tabled by magna and sberbank . gm said it wanted to finalize its restructuring plans for opel as soon as possible for presentation to european governments . muted response the european commission has responded so far in neutral tones to the decision by gm to hold on to opel and its other european unit vauxhall . european union competition spokesman jonathan todd said merely that the commission , the eu 's executive body , " takes note " of the decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government was closely involved in bringing about the magna deal gm said it would keep its european operations because of an improvement in the economic environment . it 's also understood that gm was concerned that its position as a global company would be damaged if opel and vauxhall were competing with it in europe . european governments are now awaiting a possible request by gm for aid to help it restructure opel .
the magna-sberbank consortium had been set to receive a massive state aid package from germany to help along its restructuring plans . the german state support had been the subject of an eu investigation into whether the funds were linked to the maintenance of jobs in germany ahead of other european countries which host opel plants , a move which would have violated eu competition rules . juergen ruettgers , the state premier of north rhine-westphalia , where opel 's bochum plant is located , demanded that gm keep all its opel factories in germany running .
he told broadcaster zdf on wednesday that this should be a condition of any german state help . he also demanded that there be no operational redundancies in germany , and that any job cuts should be " socially responsible " .
ruettgers promised there would be no financial aid from north rhine-westphalia if the bochum plant were closed down .
" no-one can expect us to pay for the closure of the bochum factory , " he said . 3,000 opel workers are expected to appear at a demonstration on the bochum factory grounds on thursday afternoon .
the rally is being organized by industrial trade union ig metall , and production is expected to stop for its duration . ruettgers will speak at the demonstration , as will local social democrat party head hannelore kraft , and trade union leaders rainer einenkel and oliver burkhard . " germany 's decision " todd said the same rules would apply if gm applied to european governments for funding now it has decided not to sell opel .
the german government had confirmed to the eu that the money would have been available to any of the potential buyers , todd said , adding that it was not for the eu to tell germany what to do with its money now . " that is a matter for the german government , " he said .
" the commission can not suggest or oblige member states to give state aid ; we can however and do verify the conditions of any state aid that is given . " the commission insisted it is ready to facilitate discussions between gm and its european partners if needed . but now gm has backed away from a deal at the very last minute , it may be significantly harder to establish trust between the parties . author : nina-maria potts / mll / dfm editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite having only three points from their four champions league group games , and still without a win , stuttgart can now progress to the knockout stages of the competition without having to rely on other results .
their next game is away to glasgow rangers at ibrox .
if they win that , stuttgart 's final game at home against unirea on december 9 could well be the decider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jesus navas scored to give the hosts a first-half lead a goal at last stuttgart had not scored in their last three matches , and showed why when a great counter-attacking chance after two minutes was scuppered by a terrible pass from captain thomas hitzlsperger .
in response , jesus navas put the home team in front from their first opening in the 14th minute , which allowed seville to settle into cruise control for the remainder of the game .
seville played with the assurance that even a draw would ensure qualification and the knowledge they had never conceded to a german side in their home stadium .
but in the end stuttgart found reserves of determination that had gone missing in their season so far , and conjured an equalizer in the 79th minute with a deflected long range effort from zdravko kuzmanovic .
it was only their third goal in seven matches .
the germans then nearly got a winner in the closing minutes of the game , but seville held on for the point they needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus babbel has had little to celebrate recently getting loud " now we have it in our own hands , " said stuttgart manager markus babbel , under pressure to turn the club 's fortunes around , " the first half was a catastrophe , and inexplicable for me .
i had to get a bit loud in the interval .
after that we were braver and showed what we could do .
now we will do everything in our power to reach the last 16 . " they were aided by an inconclusive result in the other group game , in which glasgow rangers and romanian team unirea urziceni also drew 1-1 .
stuttgart are third in the group with three points , one ahead of rangers , and two behind unirea. bk / dpa / sid / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

about $ 3 million , when the sport is basketball , the subject is sneakers , and the name is jordan . marcus jordan clearly wants to walk in his father 's shoes .
but doing so has turned out to be harder than he thought - in fact , it 's turned into a diss of million-dollar proportions .
on wednesday , the university of central florida and german sporting-goods company adidas learned the hard way that blood is sometimes thicker than even a massive wad of money , when the son of legendary chicago bulls guard michael jordan stepped into a pair of nikes instead of adidas basketball shoes , as planned .
now , the fight over what shoes marcus jordan can wear when he plays basketball for ucf means the school may have lost a $ 3-million-dollar sponsorship deal with adidas .
marcus wore a pair of white air jordans - the nike shoe made famous by his father - during an exhibition game between ucf and st. leo on wednesday night , the orlando sentinel reported .
but ucf is in the final year of a five-year contract with adidas that requires coaches and athletes to use the company 's apparel and equipment , which is distinctively marked with three black stripes .
deal or no deal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas shoes bear the company 's three-stripe logo regional adidas representatives say they had made a deal with the university to allow marcus jordan to wear the plain white nikes , but adidas higher-ups later begged to differ .
now , they say they will pull their funding .
adidas was seemingly unmoved by the fact that marcus wore black ankle cuffs distintively marked with the adidas logo , on top of his nikes .
in correspondence published by the associated press , a spokeswoman for adidas said the school has " chosen not to deliver on their contractual commitment to adidas , " and that , in turn , the company will not continue its relationship with the school .
the news has not been officially given to ucf yet , however .
while the school said it was " disappointed " by the possible loss of funding , ucf spokesman joe hornstein said they would respond further " once we receive official notice . " meanwhile , the sting of the loss may have been offset by the win in the exhibition game , where ucf beat st. leo , 84 to 65. jen / ap / afp / reuters editor : deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
berlin police said they conducted raids on thursday morning on several premises used by the group , finding what they termed " objects of devotion " to national socialism .
city authorities said the group 's beliefs contradicted fundamental aspects of human rights , and were a rejection of the liberal democratic system in germany .
frontbann 24 was launched in 2008 and is believed to consist of around 30 members , most of whom were disaffected members of the far-right national democratic party . the organization , which discriminates against migrants to germany and people of jewish faith , was considered the fastest-growing neo-nazi grouping in the german capital .
" the prohibition of the group should be viewed against the backdrop of the conscious effort to fight right-wing extremism in germany , and is an important step for the protection of our free democratic constitutional structure , " said berlin interior minister ehrhart koerting .
banning means a seizure of assets and a threat of prosecution if the members meet again. dfm / dpa / reuters editor : deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

protestors did more than just chant " we are the people ! " – they actually deposed the ministry for state security . along with dresden , magdeburg and berlin , leipzig was a starting point for the now famous monday prayers and protests against the former east german government .
for weeks , demonstrators in leipzig placed burning candles in front of the headquarters of the ministry for state security .
then on december 4 , 1989 , the demonstrators managed to occupy the building .
their actions effectively ended the surveillance and informing upon suspect citizens that were the central tasks of the agency , referred to as the stasi .
it was the beginning of a long process of recovery .
eavesdropped and spied on here in the museum , it smells like linoleum floors and old files .
this is no coincidence , since today 's stasi museum occupies the same rooms formerly used by the ministry for state security .
now the museum belongs to the leipzig citizens ' association .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even brick walls were no challenge for the stasi 's bugging devices twelve rooms are devoted to the museum 's permanent exhibit , called " stasi – power and banality . "
the museum recreates the history of the stasi and of the communist german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- .
with the stasi 's help , the gdr extinguished its citizens ' rights to privacy and freedom of opinion .
the museum 's 40,000 exhibit pieces provide insight into all aspects of the stasi .
their methods were manipulative and dehumanizing .
visitors are shown wiretaps and tapes used to eavesdrop on citizens , stasi uniforms , surveillance cameras and the disguises used by the complicit citizens who worked as unofficial informers .
photos and original documents from the stasi headquarters tell the rest of the story .
original building the museum is one of only a handful of buildings being used that once belonged to the stasi .
its location underscores the repression and psychological damage inflicted by the security ministry over several decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a portrait of gdr leader erich honecker on the wall of a stasi office an original cell from an interrogation unit demonstrates the disturbing conditions faced by those the stasi imprisoned .
another part of the exhibit concerns the death penalty in the gdr and memorializes those who were sentenced to death by the regime .
the gdr 's former execution chamber in leipzig sheds further light on these deaths and is occasionally open to visitors .
a memorial and a warning the leipzig citizens ' association operates the museum , which is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
there is no entrance fee .
guided tours are led at 3 p.m.
those interested in a tour should meet at the museum 's main entrance at dittrichring 24 .
group tours in other languages including english , french , hungarian and spanish are available for registered parties .

" gm had the gall to make the decision that was best for the company , " the paper writes . " after months of hemming and hawing , the americans are only partly to blame , " the paper says .
" the gm decision was only made possible after the european commission forced germany in october to offer any opel suitor the same financial conditions as magna .
for the german government , the whole rescue maneuver was a complete waste of effort . " like austria , spain is also a country that stands to lose jobs in the wake of an opel restructuring .
madrid 's el pais thinks that general motors " must provide a convincing explanation for its radical change of mind . " but , the paper notes , " the german government and opel 's works council also owe us a justification why they are so hostile toward gm .
the us company understands the auto business and has the experience - something that can not necessarily be said for magna and -lsb- its russian partner -rsb- sberbank . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general motors has decided not to sell opel russia also stands to lose important opel technology for its car industry following gm 's decision , but the moscow daily komsomolskaya pravda greeted the move with a shot of sarcasm . " oopps !
they did n't give us opel , " the paper writes .
" the situation recalls the old russian fairy tale of the grandfather and his cow .
in faraway germany , opel was a millstone for gm , but as soon as the new investor figured out how it could make the company profitable , gm thought maybe it could use this cow itself . " under the headline " detroit ex machina " , britain 's financial times argues that gm 's change of heart is good for the european car industry .
" general motors , a dinosaur only a year ago , has emerged phoenix-like from the ashes of bankruptcy , " the paper writes .
" continued gm ownership has benefits , " the paper says , because its " recent domestic transformation gives credibility to its plans for shrinking opel / vauxhall .
moreover , conditions on its bankruptcy financing prohibit it from subsidizing loss-making operations overseas . "
" gm is not bluffing , " the paper notes , " it must turn opel around . " the dutch daily de volkskrant provides a sober assessment of the circumstances , pointing out that " it was clear from the beginning that gm really did n't want to get rid of opel . "
" after all , " the paper says , " german leaders are not blind to the realities : opel factories will be closed one way or the other , regardless of whether magna or gm are the majority owners . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german newspapers reacted with dismay to the news not surprisingly , the news has also been very sobering for german newspapers .
the berlin-based tagesspiegel did n't mince words , calling it " an unprecedented effrontery , a disaster , a blow to us-german relations . " the paper fumed that it was " worse than the worst times under george bush junior and gerhard schroeder .
and so inexplicable that it triggers three feelings : pity , sorrow and rage . " the stuttgarter nachrichten comments with a hint of resignation .
opel , it writes , " will certainly have to shrink .
it will be painful and many jobs will be lost .
but , our policymakers could not have prevented it , no matter how many billions in taxpayer 's money are spent . " cologne 's rundschau daily calls it " an embarrassing lesson " for germany 's leaders .
the paper said it hopes that the state will avoid becoming bogged down with struggling companies in the future .
" if gm knocks on the door in berlin asking for state aid , the answer can only be a clear and resounding no " , it says emphatically .
" if general motors needs opel so urgently for its own strategic restructuring , as it claims , then its european subsidiary ought to be worth the billions needed to get it back on its feet , " the paper concludes . gb / dpa / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at the end of september , stuttgart-based daimler employed around 260,000 people worldwide - nearly 1,000 fewer than a year earlier .
its german work force lost 5,200 jobs last year to reach its current level of 163,500 .
zetsche put daimler on a strict cost-saving regime last spring , cutting working hours , among other measures .
the moves saved the company 3.5 billion euros by september .
but given the continued collapse of the luxury car and truck market , daimler is still seeking to cut costs even further. jen / reuters / dpa editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the announcement comes a day after gm said it was cancelling its deal to sell opel to canadian car parts firm magna .
unions in germany said workers would begin walk-outs from thursday in protest at gm 's decision .
the german government , which had backed the sale of opel , demanded gm repayment of a 1.5bn euro -lrb- $ 2.2bn ; £ 1.3bn -rrb- loan .
union anger the 10,000 job cuts which gm now plans is broadly similar to the number magna proposed , though the company has yet to reveal where the axe will fall .
german trade unions now fear two of the four opel factories in the country could close under the gm plan , whereas under the magna agreement they had been given a guarantee that all four factories would have been kept going .
politicians and unions in germany had favoured a sale to magna as the best way to save german jobs , as it included a guarantee that no german factory would be closed .
meanwhile unite , the main union at vauxhall , which employs 5,500 people in the uk , said its task was to minimise the number of jobs lost , and to ensure they are voluntary .
tony woodley , unite 's general secretary , said it was " inevitable " there would be some job losses at vauxhall .
he added that it was right that gm should hold onto the two vauxhall plants in luton and ellesmere port " because this country is one of its strongest and most loyal customers " .
mr woodley said it was now " absolutely certain " that gm will need repayable loans " from four or five " european union nations .
opel employs a total of 54,000 workers across europe , with 25,000 based in germany .
uk relief gm 's announcement was made by its vice-president john smith , who did not indicate where the 10,000 cuts were likely to fall .
however , he said gm hoped to be able to present the details to european governments " very soon " , with agreement in place with governments and unions between january and march of next year . "
the german government had a very strong appetite for the magna proposal , so i can well imagine and well understand -lsb- its reaction -rsb- " gm vice-president john smith what next for gm in europe ?
magna 's plans for job cuts at opel and vauxhall totalled 10,500 , including 4,000 in germany .
at vauxhall , unite last month reached a deal with magna to limit any uk cuts to 600 , and all through voluntary redundancies .
unite will now have to seek a fresh agreement with gm .
business secretary lord mandelson said earlier on wednesday that he was keen for " very early discussions " with gm over how its plans affect the vauxhall workers .
' ugly face ' earlier gm 's decision to hold onto opel and vauxhall was welcomed in the uk , but sparked anger in germany .
mr woodley , himself a former vauxhall worker , said it was a " fantastic decision " , while unions in germany said workers would begin walk-outs from thursday in protest at gm 's decision .
mr smith said gm would repay the german loan in full " if we 're requested to do so " by germany , saying gm had already paid back some of the funds .
juergen ruettgers , premier of the german state of north rhine-westphalia , where there are fears that the opel plant in bochum could now face closure , called gm 's decision to hold onto opel as " the ugly face of turbo-capitalism " .
mr smith said he acknowledged that " the german government had a very strong appetite for the magna proposal , so i can well imagine and well understand " the german reaction .
" i am hopeful they will find merit in our plan , " he said .

peter mandelson : " there will be a future for the vauxhall plants in the uk " general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- has confirmed that it plans to cut 10,000 jobs across its european car unit opel , which includes the vauxhall brand in the uk .
the announcement comes a day after gm said it was cancelling its deal to sell opel to canadian car parts firm magna .
unions in germany said workers would begin walk-outs from thursday in protest at gm 's decision .
the german government , which had backed the sale of opel , demanded gm repayment of a 1.5bn euro -lrb- $ 2.2bn ; £ 1.3bn -rrb- loan .
union anger the 10,000 job cuts which gm now plans is broadly similar to the number magna proposed , though the company has yet to reveal where the axe will fall .
german trade unions now fear two of the four opel factories in the country could close under the gm plan , whereas under the magna agreement they had been given a guarantee that all four factories would have been kept going .
politicians and unions in germany had favoured a sale to magna as the best way to save german jobs , as it included a guarantee that no german factory would be closed .
meanwhile unite , the main union at vauxhall , which employs 5,500 people in the uk , said its task was to minimise the number of jobs lost , and to ensure they are voluntary .
tony woodley , unite 's general secretary , said it was " inevitable " there would be some job losses at vauxhall .
he added that it was right that gm should hold onto the two vauxhall plants in luton and ellesmere port " because this country is one of its strongest and most loyal customers " .
mr woodley said it was now " absolutely certain " that gm will need repayable loans " from four or five " european union nations .
opel employs a total of 54,000 workers across europe , with 25,000 based in germany .
uk relief gm 's announcement was made by its vice-president john smith , who did not indicate where the 10,000 cuts were likely to fall .
however , he said gm hoped to be able to present the details to european governments " very soon " , with agreement in place with governments and unions between january and march of next year .
the german government had a very strong appetite for the magna proposal , so i can well imagine and well understand -lsb- its reaction -rsb- gm vice-president john smith what next for gm in europe ?
magna 's plans for job cuts at opel and vauxhall totalled 10,500 , including 4,000 in germany .
at vauxhall , unite last month reached a deal with magna to limit any uk cuts to 600 , and all through voluntary redundancies .
unite will now have to seek a fresh agreement with gm .
business secretary lord mandelson said earlier on wednesday that he was keen for " very early discussions " with gm over how its plans affect the vauxhall workers .
' ugly face ' earlier gm 's decision to hold onto opel and vauxhall was welcomed in the uk , but sparked anger in germany .

peter mandelson : " there will be a future for the vauxhall plants in the uk " general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- has confirmed that it plans to cut 10,000 jobs across its european car unit opel , which includes the vauxhall brand in the uk .
the announcement comes a day after gm said it was cancelling its deal to sell opel to canadian car parts firm magna .
unions in germany said workers would begin walk-outs from thursday in protest at gm 's decision .
the german government , which had backed the sale of opel , demanded gm repayment of a 1.5bn euro -lrb- $ 2.2bn ; £ 1.3bn -rrb- loan .
union anger the 10,000 job cuts which gm now plans is broadly similar to the number magna proposed , though the company has yet to reveal where the axe will fall .
german trade unions now fear two of the four opel factories in the country could close under the gm plan , whereas under the magna agreement they had been given a guarantee that all four factories would have been kept going .
politicians and unions in germany had favoured a sale to magna as the best way to save german jobs , as it included a guarantee that no german factory would be closed .
meanwhile unite , the main union at vauxhall , which employs 5,500 people in the uk , said its task was to minimise the number of jobs lost , and to ensure they are voluntary .
tony woodley , unite 's general secretary , said it was " inevitable " there would be some job losses at vauxhall .
he added that it was right that gm should hold onto the two vauxhall plants in luton and ellesmere port " because this country is one of its strongest and most loyal customers " .
mr woodley said it was now " absolutely certain " that gm will need repayable loans " from four or five " european union nations .
opel employs a total of 54,000 workers across europe , with 25,000 based in germany .
uk relief gm 's announcement was made by its vice-president john smith , who did not indicate where the 10,000 cuts were likely to fall .
however , he said gm hoped to be able to present the details to european governments " very soon " , with agreement in place with governments and unions between january and march of next year .
the german government had a very strong appetite for the magna proposal , so i can well imagine and well understand -lsb- its reaction -rsb- gm vice-president john smith what next for gm in europe ?
magna 's plans for job cuts at opel and vauxhall totalled 10,500 , including 4,000 in germany .
at vauxhall , unite last month reached a deal with magna to limit any uk cuts to 600 , and all through voluntary redundancies .
unite will now have to seek a fresh agreement with gm .
business secretary lord mandelson said earlier on wednesday that he was keen for " very early discussions " with gm over how its plans affect the vauxhall workers .
' ugly face ' earlier gm 's decision to hold onto opel and vauxhall was welcomed in the uk , but sparked anger in germany .
mr woodley , himself a former vauxhall worker , said it was a " fantastic decision " , while unions in germany said workers would begin walk-outs from thursday in protest at gm 's decision .
mr smith said gm would repay the german loan in full " if we 're requested to do so " by germany , saying gm had already paid back some of the funds .

ellesmere port staff react to the gm u-turn juergen ruettgers , premier of the german state of north rhine-westphalia , where there are fears that the opel plant in bochum could now face closure , called gm 's decision to hold onto opel as " the ugly face of turbo-capitalism " .
mr smith said he acknowledged that " the german government had a very strong appetite for the magna proposal , so i can well imagine and well understand " the german reaction .
" i am hopeful they will find merit in our plan , " he said .

a society aimed at helping sufferers and raising awareness of hyperekplexia has chosen bonfire night to launch .
the night of 5 november is one of the biggest challenges for sufferers .
neurology doctor rhys thomas is hoping it will help lead to more people being correctly diagnosed and make coping easier for those with it .
car horns sounding or a phone ringing , let alone sudden loud bangs , can cause people with the condition to jump or fall to the ground .
" it can be very frustrating having a condition that other people have never heard of and no support out there for it , " said dr thomas .
" we want to get the information out of the scientific journals and into the wider world so people can access it . "
symptoms include muscle stiffening , stiff legs and apnoea .
but it is the reaction to sudden noise - which makes voluntary movement impossible - that can make bonfire night an ordeal .
dr thomas said there were many cases where patients were misdiagnosed with epilepsy or other conditions and therefore not properly treated .
he said symptoms were often most acute in sufferers in their early lives before sometimes - but not always - gradually levelling off .
through the launch of the hyperekplexia society dr thomas is hoping to hear from more people with symptoms .
genetic testing for the condition is carried out at the university on a research basis .
diagnosed the society is the idea of 35-year-old andrew latham of blackburn .
he did not know he had hyperekplexia until he was 21 .
" i was born prematurely and when people would tap on the incubator i would startle , " he said .
he said his body had suffered from being " quite rigid and stiff " throughout his life but had seen countless doctors before being diagnosed .
" if someone sets something off like a fire work , a car horn goes or even the phone i 'm literally jumping - i ca n't stop it .
5 november is my worst night , " he added .
but he said he was always positive about dealing with hyperekplexia and now found the condition fascinating .
" i think there are many more people out there with it .
the more people get to hear about it the better , " he added .

the night of 5 november is one of the biggest challenges for sufferers .

it comes as the maker of the prius hybrid revealed quarterly net profits of 21.8bn yen for the three months to october , against 139.8bn yen in 2008 .
in august , it revealed plans to close a production line in japan for a year .
and on wednesday it announced it was pulling out of formula 1 , citing " the current severe economic realities " .
cost cutting in may , toyota had reported its worst annual loss , of 436.94bn yen , in the year to 31 march .
the global economic downturn and strong yen , which make it expensive for exporters such as toyota , have hit the japanese carmaking sector in the past year .
however , toyota 's latest figures - showing a return to profit - are the latest in a series of recoveries seen at japanese carmakers , including honda and nissan , which have also reported healthier earnings .
" next year will basically see a focus on cost cutting , " said koichi ogawa , at daiwa sb investments in tokyo .
" they really have to go back into the black next year . "
the previously announced closure of production at a plant in aichi prefecture in japan - from the first quarter of 2010 to mid-2011 - will reduce output by 220,000 vehicles .

peter lanyon said his position was no longer tenable as his views and those of his dismissed colleague , jane hunt , were not being considered .
" the various bodies of the ministry of defence have been acting in a thoroughly dishonourable way , " he said .
the mod said there had been two people with the same expertise on the panel .
the uk currently has a fleet of 27 nuclear submarines .
eight disused vessels are being stored at devonport , in devon , ahead of being dismantled , while seven are at at rosyth , in fife .
dr hunt , a specialist in environmental sociology at lancaster university , was sacked from the advisory group of the submarine dismantling project .
she has now also resigned from its steering group .
' uncomfortable advice ' the group has to decide how to deal with the radioactive and non-radioactive hazardous wastes from the submarines in the short and long term .
in a resignation letter to the group , dr hunt wrote : " it seems my own advice is uncomfortable for the mod and therefore ignored and seen as trouble making rather than what it is : a genuine attempt to improve the governance of the project through fair and honest consultation and open and transparent decision-making .
" given that the mod is reneging on previous commitments taken in response to consultation , is failing to properly elicit and consider expert advice , and is adopting a ' decide , announce , defend ' approach , i do not feel i can continue as a member of the steering group , as my membership implicitly condones the actions for the mod . "
an mod spokesperson said a review of the group 's membership had shown duplication in the area of communications and community consultation .
" as an mod-funded body , it would be inappropriate to use taxpayers ' money to fund members whose expertise is duplicated elsewhere , " he said .
" the purpose of the advisory group is to give the mod the opportunity to listen to the views of people with a range of different perspectives including those who are critical of the mod 's approach .
" it can be clearly seen that the membership of the sdpag includes these different perspectives , and we have no intention of changing that . "

peter lanyon said his position was no longer tenable as his views and those of his dismissed colleague , jane hunt , were not being considered .
" the various bodies of the ministry of defence have been acting in a thoroughly dishonourable way , " he said .
the mod said there had been two people with the same expertise on the panel .
the uk currently has a fleet of 27 nuclear submarines .
eight disused vessels are being stored at devonport , in devon , ahead of being dismantled , while seven are at at rosyth , in fife .
dr hunt , a specialist in environmental sociology at lancaster university , was sacked from the advisory group of the submarine dismantling project .
she has now also resigned from its steering group .
' uncomfortable advice ' the group has to decide how to deal with the radioactive and non-radioactive hazardous wastes from the submarines in the short and long term .
in a resignation letter to the group , dr hunt wrote : " it seems my own advice is uncomfortable for the mod and therefore ignored and seen as trouble making rather than what it is : a genuine attempt to improve the governance of the project through fair and honest consultation and open and transparent decision-making .
" given that the mod is reneging on previous commitments taken in response to consultation , is failing to properly elicit and consider expert advice , and is adopting a ' decide , announce , defend ' approach , i do not feel i can continue as a member of the steering group , as my membership implicitly condones the actions for the mod . "
an mod spokesperson said a review of the group 's membership had shown duplication in the area of communications and community consultation .
" as an mod-funded body , it would be inappropriate to use taxpayers ' money to fund members whose expertise is duplicated elsewhere , " he said .
" the purpose of the advisory group is to give the mod the opportunity to listen to the views of people with a range of different perspectives including those who are critical of the mod 's approach .
" it can be clearly seen that the membership of the sdpag includes these different perspectives , and we have no intention of changing that . "

as you gather your logs and leaves , be careful where you pile them as you could give garden birds and other wildlife a nasty surprise .
the rspb is asking guy fawke 's night revellers to make sure their bonfires are n't sited too close trees , shrubs , or nest boxes .
as well as being a good tip for safety purposes , it will help minimise any disturbance to wildlife .
now the weather has changed , birds will be returning to gardens for food provided by plants and shrubs as well as the seed and leftovers we put out .
at night-time in particular they are likely to be roosting in trees and bushes and the rspb is also asking anyone planning a bonfire or fireworks display in their garden to avoid doing it too close to nest boxes .
roosting sites although the nesting period is over and young birds have all flown from nest boxes , many birds will be searching for suitable roosting sites for winter and could return to nest boxes for shelter from the cold .
rspb wildlife adviser ian hayward says : " thankfully , birds are n't known to suffer any physical ill-effects from fireworks and bonfire displays but of course they would be unsettling if they took place right next to where birds roost .
a hedgehog 's favourite place to hibernate is a cosy pile of leaves or logs rspb wildlife adviser ian hayward " we 'd ask everyone to consider wildlife when they decide where to build their bonfires and let off their fireworks , and if they know they have birds roosting , avoid that area .
" many birds will return to the same roosting site year on year , so if you 're unsure , there 's a good chance if you saw some last year they will be back ! "
as well as birds , hedgehogs will be hibernating for the winter too , and piles of logs and leaves are favourite spots .
carefully check for any prickly residents by gently removing the top layer of leaves and twigs as hedgehogs will usually be buried right at the bottom .
wildlife stack if you do find one , try to find an alternative bonfire site , or carefully move the hedgehog to another similar shelter .
ian says : " a hedgehog 's favourite place to hibernate is a cosy pile of leaves or logs so bear this in mind if you 're planning to burn a pile that you 've been creating for a while .
" and even if you 've only been adding to it for a few days in the run up to bonfire night , be aware that a hedgehog could have crept in for its slumber very recently . "
and we can continue helping wildlife after bonfire night .
the rspb suggests leaving any unused logs , twigs or leaves piled up in a corner of the garden as a wildlife stack for hedgehogs , insects , frogs and toads .
ian added , " log piles can act as shelter for all sorts of garden wildlife .
items that are hollow or have small holes and crevices to crawl into will be particularly welcome , so wood not burned on a bonfire will be ideal . "

a full service on freesat should be launched in 2010 , said a bbc spokesperson .
all freesat hd boxes will be able to receive it .
rahul chakkara , head of tv platforms at the bbc , announced the beta trial on the bbc internet blog .
he also said that a quarter of bbc iplayer viewing is now done through the tv via virgin media .
the bbc iplayer became available on virgin media in june 2008 .
mr chakkara said that 200 million programmes had been viewed on the catch-up service since then .
it is also available via the nintendo wii and sony playstation 3 games consoles , although wii users have experienced some problems with the service .
the bbc says a new version is being developed for that platform .
adapting the technology behind the bbc iplayer interface for television had been " a challenge " he added .
" this is a fast changing and evolving industry , " he wrote on the blog .
" many of our assumptions will be challenged with time .
we will keep coming back to the products and update them where appropriate . "

france 's minister for europe , pierre lellouche , said eu leaders would not help the tories re-negotiate treaties .
he was responding in the guardian to david cameron 's vow that " never again " would powers be transferred from the uk to brussels without a referendum .
he was outlining his new policy after ruling out a lisbon treaty referendum .
mr cameron said all future treaties would be put to a public vote .
he also promised a sovereignty bill if the tories win the next election to " lock in " the supremacy of uk laws .
and the tory leader vowed to repatriate powers on the charter of fundamental rights , employment and criminal law - which would need the agreement of all 27 eu nations . "
i do n't think you will find -lsb- mr lellouche 's comments are -rsb- representative of the reaction in paris or other european capitals " william hague , shadow foreign secretary cameron 's ' never again ' vow on eu following the announcement , eurosceptic mep daniel hannan said he had quit his post as conservative legal affairs spokesman in the european parliament , to concentrate on campaigning for a referendum on europe .
he wrote in his daily telegraph blog that he had returned to the backbenches to build a movement that would " push for referendums , citizens ' initiatives and the rest of the paraphernalia of direct democracy " .
and shortly afterwards the independent tory website conservativehome reported that conservative mep roger helmer had also resigned .
the website said mr helmer had stepped down from the frontbench in the european parliament in opposition to mr cameron 's new european policy .
the site reported mr helmer as saying : " what we have is an essentially cosmetic policy .
we are installing a largely ineffective burglar alarm when the family silver has already been stolen .
i can neither justify nor support our new eu policy . "
mr lellouche told the guardian the conservatives ' new plan was " pathetic " .
" it 's just very sad to see britain , so important in europe , just cutting itself out from the rest and disappearing from the radar map . "
" they have essentially castrated your uk influence in the european parliament , " he added .
have your say " another empty statement from david cameron .
he makes the promise for a referendum knowing full well there will never be another treaty . "
nigel , newport send us your comments shadow foreign secretary william hague insisted mr lellouche 's comments did not represent the true reaction to the party 's plans in europe .
" i do n't think you will find that 's representative of the reaction in paris or other european capitals , " he said .
fully ratified he told the bbc 's newsnight programme that his party had established good relations with french president nicolas sarkozy 's party .
he said they expected some countries to say that what they had proposed could never be negotiated , but that the tories would use " patience and persistence " to push for what they wanted over the lifetime of the next parliament .
when asked about the party 's abandonment of its original pledge to hold a referendum in the lisbon treaty , he said : " we have to deal with the world as it is not as we wish it to be . "
" the idea that ... everybody has the right to change everything , has nothing to do with the legal tradition of the european union " sylvie goulard , french mep / president of the french european movement sylvie goulard , a french mep and president of the french european movement , agreed with mr lellouche by saying she did not think the other member states would go along with the tory plan .
" the idea that everyone comes in when there is a change in government in one of the member states , everybody has the right to change everything , has nothing to do with the legal tradition of the european union .
" so we should refuse simply to do it . "
mr cameron unveiled the new set of policies on wednesday after conceding a referendum on the treaty was not possible .
the lisbon treaty has now been fully ratified by all 27 member states and will come into force on 1 december .
' doable and deliverable ' accused of backtracking on a " cast iron " pledge to hold a referendum if he became prime minister , mr cameron said he had not promised a vote " come what may " .
he said : " i recognise there are some who , now that we can not have a referendum on the lisbon treaty , want a referendum on something else ... anything else .
" but i just do n't think it 's right to concoct some new pretext for a referendum simply to have one for the sake of it . "
but a conservative government would amend the european communities act 1972 to prohibit the transfer of power to the eu without a referendum .
that would cover any future attempt to take britain into the european single currency , said mr cameron .
such a move , together with the repatriation of some powers , was " credible , doable and deliverable " and would prevent the " drift " towards a federal europe , he argued .

france 's minister for europe , pierre lellouche , said eu leaders would not help the tories re-negotiate treaties .
he was responding in the guardian to david cameron 's vow that " never again " would powers be transferred from the uk to brussels without a referendum .
he was outlining his new policy after ruling out a lisbon treaty referendum .
mr cameron said all future treaties would be put to a public vote .
he also promised a sovereignty bill if the tories win the next election to " lock in " the supremacy of uk laws .
and the tory leader vowed to repatriate powers on the charter of fundamental rights , employment and criminal law - which would need the agreement of all 27 eu nations .
i do n't think you will find -lsb- mr lellouche 's comments are -rsb- representative of the reaction in paris or other european capitals william hague , shadow foreign secretary cameron 's ' never again ' vow on eu following the announcement , eurosceptic mep daniel hannan said he had quit his post as conservative legal affairs spokesman in the european parliament , to concentrate on campaigning for a referendum on europe .
he wrote in his daily telegraph blog that he had returned to the backbenches to build a movement that would " push for referendums , citizens ' initiatives and the rest of the paraphernalia of direct democracy " .
and shortly afterwards the independent tory website conservativehome reported that conservative mep roger helmer had also resigned .
the website said mr helmer had stepped down from the frontbench in the european parliament in opposition to mr cameron 's new european policy .
the site reported mr helmer as saying : " what we have is an essentially cosmetic policy .
we are installing a largely ineffective burglar alarm when the family silver has already been stolen .
i can neither justify nor support our new eu policy . "
mr lellouche told the guardian the conservatives ' new plan was " pathetic " .
" it 's just very sad to see britain , so important in europe , just cutting itself out from the rest and disappearing from the radar map . "
" they have essentially castrated your uk influence in the european parliament , " he added .
have your say another empty statement from david cameron .
he makes the promise for a referendum knowing full well there will never be another treaty .
nigel , newport send us your comments shadow foreign secretary william hague insisted mr lellouche 's comments did not represent the true reaction to the party 's plans in europe .
" i do n't think you will find that 's representative of the reaction in paris or other european capitals , " he said .
fully ratified he told the bbc 's newsnight programme that his party had established good relations with french president nicolas sarkozy 's party .
he said they expected some countries to say that what they had proposed could never be negotiated , but that the tories would use " patience and persistence " to push for what they wanted over the lifetime of the next parliament .
when asked about the party 's abandonment of its original pledge to hold a referendum in the lisbon treaty , he said : " we have to deal with the world as it is not as we wish it to be . "
the idea that ... everybody has the right to change everything , has nothing to do with the legal tradition of the european union sylvie goulard , french mep / president of the french european movement sylvie goulard , a french mep and president of the french european movement , agreed with mr lellouche by saying she did not think the other member states would go along with the tory plan .
" the idea that everyone comes in when there is a change in government in one of the member states , everybody has the right to change everything , has nothing to do with the legal tradition of the european union .
" so we should refuse simply to do it . "
mr cameron unveiled the new set of policies on wednesday after conceding a referendum on the treaty was not possible .
the lisbon treaty has now been fully ratified by all 27 member states and will come into force on 1 december .
' doable and deliverable ' accused of backtracking on a " cast iron " pledge to hold a referendum if he became prime minister , mr cameron said he had not promised a vote " come what may " .
he said : " i recognise there are some who , now that we can not have a referendum on the lisbon treaty , want a referendum on something else ... anything else .
" but i just do n't think it 's right to concoct some new pretext for a referendum simply to have one for the sake of it . "
but a conservative government would amend the european communities act 1972 to prohibit the transfer of power to the eu without a referendum .
that would cover any future attempt to take britain into the european single currency , said mr cameron .
such a move , together with the repatriation of some powers , was " credible , doable and deliverable " and would prevent the " drift " towards a federal europe , he argued .
