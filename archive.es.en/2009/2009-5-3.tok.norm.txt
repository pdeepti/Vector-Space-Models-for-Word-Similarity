she tracks down everything from van goghs to james bond 's 1963 aston martin . when victorine stille gets a call from an art collector about a stolen work , the first thing she does is enter the crucial details - like artist , year and frame color - in the so-called art loss register . the central databank was founded in london in 1991 and branched have since been added in new york , amsterdam , paris and cologne - where stille works . " what often happens is that , after it 's stolen , a work circulates through the black market for about two to three years , " said the art detective .
" we have a theory that they turn up again after about 15 years . " long-lost paintings might resurface at art auctions or fairs .
but for the rightful owners , 15 years is too long to wait . cross-check at art fairs aiming to speed up the recovery process , stille , who studied art management in amsterdam , spends much of her work day researching on the internet , scanning art auctions ' web sites .
she also attends sundry exhibitions and art fairs . " we visit art dealers ' stands at fairs to protect them and their reputations , and also to protect the participants from buying stolen art , " said the professional sleuth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : james bond had to get a new car after his was stolen in 1997 while she 's there , she checks the works on display against the art loss register to see if any have been reported as stolen . art thieves apparently prefer paintings , but the register also contains antiques , watches and furniture . stolen art on four wheels " we even have a james bond old-timer in our databank , " said stille .
" it 's a 1963 aston martin and was stolen in 1997 during filming .
it was used in both goldfinger and thunderball . " she compared the car to " the scream " by norwegian artist edvard munch , which was stolen from an oslo museum in 2006 and recovered two years later : " those are items that can never be sold , " she said . unlike munch 's masterpiece , the aston martin is still at large - though stille said suspects the thief is more likely to be driving the car around rather than hiding it in a garage somewhere . though the art detective and her colleagues are unlikely to spot james bond 's pride and joy on the way to the supermarket , they do have to rely sometimes on coincidence . " it 's a combination of being active and passive , " said stille .
" sometimes people just call us up and say , hey we saw this or that , or we know about a piece .
but we also actively look through auction catalogues and auction houses . " art dealers , collectors or buyers are also welcome to check the stolen art databank before investing in a piece . so far , stille and her team have recovered 230 million euros -lrb- us $ 304 million -rrb- worth of art .

" he will ask that the europeans wait a bit until the government presents its new policy , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman yigal palmor told news agency afp . lieberman is also to meet with italian , french and czech representatives in the first official visit abroad by a member of the new right-wing israeli government . visible progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lieberman has triggered controversy over his virulently anti-arab stance the hardliner is seeking to block voices within the european union calling for a freeze in upgrading israel-eu ties unless progress is made in peace talks between the coalition government of prime minister benjamin netanyahu and the palestinians . italian foreign minister franco frattini told yediot ahronot that if israel wanted to continue enjoying rome 's support in europe , it had to take " suitable positions " and declare its support for a continuation of the peace process . frattini also called on the blunt-speaking lieberman to " lower the tone " of his declarations and to " work towards an atmosphere of cooperation . " lieberman will meet with his french counterpart bernard kouchner on tuesday , but a meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy has not been confirmed . " i am not saying that it 's a condition , but it would be favorable if avigdor lieberman in the very least adheres to the decisions taken by the international community , " claude gueant , sarkozy 's chief of staff , told french radio . he is scheduled to meet with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in berlin on thursday . controversial beginnings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu 's coalition is yet to endorse a two-state solution lieberman , head of a nationalist party in netanyahu 's coalition , caused a stir on his first day as foreign minister when he announced that israel was no longer bound by the so-called annapolis peace process , which formed the basis of israeli-palestinian peace talks in 2008 . netanyahu has so far refused to publicly endorse the idea of a two-state solution that would see the creation of a palestinian state . instead , lieberman said , israel was prepared to adhere only to the roadmap peace plan , a performance-based initiative from 2003 . israel recently warned the eu to tone down its criticism of netanyahu 's cabinet or risk losing a role in the middle east peace process . dfm / tt , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the iwh said the car scrapping incentive could burden the federal budget with 2,6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3,5 billion -rrb- . under the popular scheme , the government offers a 2,500-euro bonus to anyone who puts a car 9 years or older in the crusher and buys a new one . dirk niebel , secretary-general of the business-friendly free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , called the incentive " expensive junk . "
the berlin government , he told welt am sonntag , let itself be pushed into an expensive subsidy program by the automobile industry . but the finance ministry in berlin defended the project . " the idea was for somebody who needs a new car to buy it now and not wait till next year , " a spokesman said on sunday . germany earmarked 5 billion euros to fund the anti-recession program .

after spending several months in a german refugee camp , the media watchdog group , reporters without borders helped secure her an internship in deutsche welle 's urdu-speaking news department .
dw : pakistan is considered one of the most dangerous countries for journalists .
what is your own experience ?
meera jamal : i suppose that is pretty much true .
the danger which is faced by the journalist is on two folds ; one is from the secret services .
you see a lot of incidents of journalists being harassed , beaten up , or killed by them .
and the other is the islamic radical groups .
why did you leave pakistan ?
it was pretty much because of the islamic radical group .
i was writing on the issues of women 's rights and basic human rights , in which you have to , at times , criticise certain norms or rules followed by the islamic clerics or created by them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal 's writing focussed on women 's rights in pakistan and this did n't go well with the islamic radial groups .
for example , on international women 's day , i wrote about a prostitute - a 56 year old woman whose children never knew she was a prostitute .
i thought that she was a great example of how a woman can sacrifice herself in order to support her children .
that was really looked down upon .
the other example was my series of articles on women 's rights , for example the right of divorce , the right of separation , the right of child custody .
how were you threatened ?
initially it was phone calls , then it went on to be doubled by letters .
then , in august 2008 , i was stopped by four men on my way to work , which really scared me .
they threatened me , for my life .
it was really scary .
i felt so much in danger for myself and i felt like i was putting my family at risk .
i was totally shattered actually because of it .
you lived in karachi at the time , what do you think would have happened if you had stayed on in pakistan , despite the threats ?
i suppose these people are really unpredictable .
there are incidents where they can throw acid on you , or they can ambush you .
they can do anything .
being a woman , it 's the most difficult thing .
there 's a particular kind of asian mentality , where a woman represents the entire family 's moral standing in the society .
and if anything goes bad with the woman , the entire family would be defamed .
it 's pretty much difficult for you to combat that , and being a woman , it was horrible for me .
so they could have maybe killed you ?
yes , but killing is the easiest part .
your family and your defamation for your family , that 's the horrible part .
i think i would never want to have that happen to them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal describes herself as a " non-believer " do you think the fact that you were a woman reporting about women 's issues , was that the most enraging bit to the people who threatened you ?
or was it the issues you reported about ?
it was the issues , it was me being a woman and writing about such issues , instigating other woman and convincing them of my ideas .
it was partly because of my personal life as well , because i am a non-believer , which catches attention a lot .
" she 's a non-believer and she 's writing to defame islam " .
so these kinds of things triggered them off .
what triggered you in a situation that 's so difficult for journalists , to join the profession ?
actually , you feel very much satisfied when you are doing something that can improve society , or at least you feel that it can bring a change , even a little bit .
for instance , the write-ups i 've done are basically on social issues , human rights .
when you go and talk to the people and get feedback , that people are reading you and appreciate that woman .
there were instances when i got calls from people who wanted to help .
so when i get such responses , it makes you feel on top of the world .
that you are actually doing something , your pieces make a difference .
that 's what keeps you going .
it 's very intoxicating .
so it must have been very frustrating to come to germany as a refugee and at the beginning not to be able to work ?
it was more than frustration in the beginning , because you are totally isolated , you do n't have friends or family and it makes you feel like you are isolated from the rest of the world .
journalism becomes part of your digestive system , as you can say .
you read the news and it keeps you going , it runs in your blood .
so once you are taken out of that , you feel very much dehydrated for news .
so after spending some months in the refugee camp , you 've joined deutsche welle for a few months .
what do you think the future will be like ?
would you like to return to pakistan at some time or is that not an option at the moment ?
it is not the option at the moment , because i do n't want to put my family back at risk .
i do n't want to put myself back at risk .
so not at the moment .
but yes , i would love to go back .
no matter what lies in front of you , you have to try .
you ca n't give up .
if you give up , you die .
even if not physically , then at least mentally you accept defeat .
and that is not a thing i 've been trained to do by my parents .
they always told me to keep trying and give 100 percent .

after spending several months in a german refugee camp , the media watchdog group , reporters without borders helped secure her an internship in deutsche welle 's urdu-speaking news department .
dw : pakistan is considered one of the most dangerous countries for journalists .
what is your own experience ?
meera jamal : i suppose that is pretty much true .
the danger which is faced by the journalist is on two folds ; one is from the secret services .
you see a lot of incidents of journalists being harassed , beaten up , or killed by them .
and the other is the islamic radical groups .
why did you leave pakistan ?
it was pretty much because of the islamic radical group .
i was writing on the issues of women 's rights and basic human rights , in which you have to , at times , criticise certain norms or rules followed by the islamic clerics or created by them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal 's writing focussed on women 's rights in pakistan and this did n't go well with the islamic radial groups .
for example , on international women 's day , i wrote about a prostitute - a 56 year old woman whose children never knew she was a prostitute .
i thought that she was a great example of how a woman can sacrifice herself in order to support her children .
that was really looked down upon .
the other example was my series of articles on women 's rights , for example the right of divorce , the right of separation , the right of child custody .
how were you threatened ?
initially it was phone calls , then it went on to be doubled by letters .
then , in august 2008 , i was stopped by four men on my way to work , which really scared me .
they threatened me , for my life .
it was really scary .
i felt so much in danger for myself and i felt like i was putting my family at risk .
i was totally shattered actually because of it .
you lived in karachi at the time , what do you think would have happened if you had stayed on in pakistan , despite the threats ?
i suppose these people are really unpredictable .
there are incidents where they can throw acid on you , or they can ambush you .
they can do anything .
being a woman , it 's the most difficult thing .
there 's a particular kind of asian mentality , where a woman represents the entire family 's moral standing in the society .
and if anything goes bad with the woman , the entire family would be defamed .
it 's pretty much difficult for you to combat that , and being a woman , it was horrible for me .
so they could have maybe killed you ?
yes , but killing is the easiest part .
your family and your defamation for your family , that 's the horrible part .
i think i would never want to have that happen to them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal describes herself as a " non-believer " do you think the fact that you were a woman reporting about women 's issues , was that the most enraging bit to the people who threatened you ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal 's writing focussed on women 's rights in pakistan and this did n't go well with the islamic radial groups .
for example , on international women 's day , i wrote about a prostitute - a 56 year old woman whose children never knew she was a prostitute .
i thought that she was a great example of how a woman can sacrifice herself in order to support her children .
that was really looked down upon .
the other example was my series of articles on women 's rights , for example the right of divorce , the right of separation , the right of child custody .
how were you threatened ?
initially it was phone calls , then it went on to be doubled by letters .
then , in august 2008 , i was stopped by four men on my way to work , which really scared me .
they threatened me , for my life .
it was really scary .
i felt so much in danger for myself and i felt like i was putting my family at risk .
i was totally shattered actually because of it .
you lived in karachi at the time , what do you think would have happened if you had stayed on in pakistan , despite the threats ?
i suppose these people are really unpredictable .
there are incidents where they can throw acid on you , or they can ambush you .
they can do anything .
being a woman , it 's the most difficult thing .
there 's a particular kind of asian mentality , where a woman represents the entire family 's moral standing in the society .
and if anything goes bad with the woman , the entire family would be defamed .
it 's pretty much difficult for you to combat that , and being a woman , it was horrible for me .
so they could have maybe killed you ?
yes , but killing is the easiest part .
your family and your defamation for your family , that 's the horrible part .
i think i would never want to have that happen to them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal describes herself as a " non-believer " do you think the fact that you were a woman reporting about women 's issues , was that the most enraging bit to the people who threatened you ?
or was it the issues you reported about ?
it was the issues , it was me being a woman and writing about such issues , instigating other woman and convincing them of my ideas .
it was partly because of my personal life as well , because i am a non-believer , which catches attention a lot .
" she 's a non-believer and she 's writing to defame islam " .
so these kinds of things triggered them off .
what triggered you in a situation that 's so difficult for journalists , to join the profession ?
actually , you feel very much satisfied when you are doing something that can improve society , or at least you feel that it can bring a change , even a little bit .
for instance , the write-ups i 've done are basically on social issues , human rights .
when you go and talk to the people and get feedback , that people are reading you and appreciate that woman .
there were instances when i got calls from people who wanted to help .
so when i get such responses , it makes you feel on top of the world .
that you are actually doing something , your pieces make a difference .
that 's what keeps you going .
it 's very intoxicating .
so it must have been very frustrating to come to germany as a refugee and at the beginning not to be able to work ?
it was more than frustration in the beginning , because you are totally isolated , you do n't have friends or family and it makes you feel like you are isolated from the rest of the world .
journalism becomes part of your digestive system , as you can say .
you read the news and it keeps you going , it runs in your blood .
so once you are taken out of that , you feel very much dehydrated for news .
so after spending some months in the refugee camp , you 've joined deutsche welle for a few months .
what do you think the future will be like ?
would you like to return to pakistan at some time or is that not an option at the moment ?
it is not the option at the moment , because i do n't want to put my family back at risk .
i do n't want to put myself back at risk .
so not at the moment .
but yes , i would love to go back .
no matter what lies in front of you , you have to try .
you ca n't give up .
if you give up , you die .
even if not physically , then at least mentally you accept defeat .
and that is not a thing i 've been trained to do by my parents .
they always told me to keep trying and give 100 percent .

with just four matches to go , wolfsburg have 60 , three clear of champions bayern munich , who beat borussia moenchengladbach 2-1 .
hertha move up to third on 56 points , followed by vfb stuttgart and hamburg on 55 points .
although hertha started the brighter , it was hamburg who drew first blood when jansen steered ivica olic 's cross from the left into the far corner .
despite the early lead , martin jol 's side failed to take control and instead it was the visitors who continued to eke out the better chances in a flat-paced game .
marc stein tested frank rost in the hamburg goal with a shot from distance while rost also did well to turn away a cicero header on 32 minutes .
jansen registered hamburg 's first decent chance of the second period on 51 minutes with a header but jaroslav drobny saved well .
hertha equalized out of nothing on 66 minutes when kacar smashed the ball home from 28 metres out .
in a frantic finale , olic saw a shot saved by drobny , who also pulled off a fantastic reflex save from joris mathijsen to ensure a point for hertha .

the iwh said the car scrapping incentive could burden the federal budget with 2,6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3,5 billion -rrb- . under the popular scheme , the government offers a 2,500-euro bonus to anyone who puts a car 9 years or older in the crusher and buys a new one . dirk niebel , secretary-general of the business-friendly free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , called the incentive " expensive junk . "
the berlin government , he told welt am sonntag , let itself be pushed into an expensive subsidy program by the automobile industry . but the finance ministry in berlin defended the project . " the idea was for somebody who needs a new car to buy it now and not wait till next year , " a spokesman said on sunday . germany earmarked 5 billion euros to fund the anti-recession program .
similar car scrappage shemes have been introduced in several european countries , including france , italy and the united kingdom . db / tt , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

police say six bullets from a kalashnikov automatic rifle hit xhindi as he was parking his car at his home .
he died on his way to hospital .
xhindi 's socialist party said it is shocked by the murder .
senior socialist gramoz ruci said he was not excluding the possibility that the killing was politically motivated .
the attack comes less than two months before albania is due to hold parliamentary elections .
albania also became the latest country to apply for membership of the european union last tuesday , after joining nato several weeks ago .
a long way to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albania remains one of europe 's poorest countries the european commission had urged albania to put off its application to the eu until after the country 's general elections on june 28 .
all elections held in albania since the demise of communism in the early 1990s have been disputed and marred by incidents .
the european commission has said that elections in post-communist albania have never been certified as free or fair by international observers .
in a report released by the commission late last year , it said more progress was needed in albania on fighting organised crime and corruption , and that the state administration and the courts needed to be strengthened .
albania has been trying - parliament adopted a new electoral law last november aimed at preventing fraud - but there is a long way to go .
prime minister sali berisha said that the country 's formal application to the eu was of " historic significance " and marked albania 's return to the " family of european nations . "
" albania has proved today that it is a functioning democracy , " he said on tuesday .
berisha also said that 96 percent of albanians wanted to join the eu .
michael leigh , the european commission 's director general for enlargement , said that holding free and fair parliamentary elections in june remained a key condition . " it is now up to albania to demonstrate its capacity to move to the next stage of european integration , " leigh said . ca / ch , ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after spending several months in a german refugee camp , the media watchdog group , reporters without borders helped secure her an internship in deutsche welle 's urdu-speaking news department .
dw : pakistan is considered one of the most dangerous countries for journalists .
what is your own experience ?
meera jamal : i suppose that is pretty much true .
the danger which is faced by the journalist is on two folds ; one is from the secret services .
you see a lot of incidents of journalists being harassed , beaten up , or killed by them .
and the other is the islamic radical groups .
why did you leave pakistan ?
it was pretty much because of the islamic radical group .
i was writing on the issues of women 's rights and basic human rights , in which you have to , at times , criticise certain norms or rules followed by the islamic clerics or created by them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal 's writing focussed on women 's rights in pakistan and this did n't go well with the islamic radial groups .
for example , on international women 's day , i wrote about a prostitute - a 56 year old woman whose children never knew she was a prostitute .
i thought that she was a great example of how a woman can sacrifice herself in order to support her children .
that was really looked down upon .
the other example was my series of articles on women 's rights , for example the right of divorce , the right of separation , the right of child custody .
how were you threatened ?
initially it was phone calls , then it went on to be doubled by letters .
then , in august 2008 , i was stopped by four men on my way to work , which really scared me .
they threatened me , for my life .
it was really scary .
i felt so much in danger for myself and i felt like i was putting my family at risk .
i was totally shattered actually because of it .
you lived in karachi at the time , what do you think would have happened if you had stayed on in pakistan , despite the threats ?
i suppose these people are really unpredictable .
there are incidents where they can throw acid on you , or they can ambush you .
they can do anything .
being a woman , it 's the most difficult thing .
there 's a particular kind of asian mentality , where a woman represents the entire family 's moral standing in the society .
and if anything goes bad with the woman , the entire family would be defamed .
it 's pretty much difficult for you to combat that , and being a woman , it was horrible for me .
so they could have maybe killed you ?
yes , but killing is the easiest part .
your family and your defamation for your family , that 's the horrible part .
i think i would never want to have that happen to them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal describes herself as a " non-believer " do you think the fact that you were a woman reporting about women 's issues , was that the most enraging bit to the people who threatened you ?
or was it the issues you reported about ?
it was the issues , it was me being a woman and writing about such issues , instigating other woman and convincing them of my ideas .
it was partly because of my personal life as well , because i am a non-believer , which catches attention a lot .
" she 's a non-believer and she 's writing to defame islam " .
so these kinds of things triggered them off .
what triggered you in a situation that 's so difficult for journalists , to join the profession ?
actually , you feel very much satisfied when you are doing something that can improve society , or at least you feel that it can bring a change , even a little bit .
for instance , the write-ups i 've done are basically on social issues , human rights .
when you go and talk to the people and get feedback , that people are reading you and appreciate that woman .
there were instances when i got calls from people who wanted to help .
so when i get such responses , it makes you feel on top of the world .
that you are actually doing something , your pieces make a difference .
that 's what keeps you going .
it 's very intoxicating .
so it must have been very frustrating to come to germany as a refugee and at the beginning not to be able to work ?
it was more than frustration in the beginning , because you are totally isolated , you do n't have friends or family and it makes you feel like you are isolated from the rest of the world .
journalism becomes part of your digestive system , as you can say .
you read the news and it keeps you going , it runs in your blood .
so once you are taken out of that , you feel very much dehydrated for news .
so after spending some months in the refugee camp , you 've joined deutsche welle for a few months .
what do you think the future will be like ?
would you like to return to pakistan at some time or is that not an option at the moment ?
it is not the option at the moment , because i do n't want to put my family back at risk .
i do n't want to put myself back at risk .
so not at the moment .
but yes , i would love to go back .
no matter what lies in front of you , you have to try .
you ca n't give up .
if you give up , you die .
even if not physically , then at least mentally you accept defeat .
and that is not a thing i 've been trained to do by my parents .
they always told me to keep trying and give 100 percent .

it was more than frustration in the beginning , because you are totally isolated , you do n't have friends or family and it makes you feel like you are isolated from the rest of the world .
journalism becomes part of your digestive system , as you can say .
you read the news and it keeps you going , it runs in your blood .
so once you are taken out of that , you feel very much dehydrated for news .
so after spending some months in the refugee camp , you 've joined deutsche welle for a few months .
what do you think the future will be like ?
would you like to return to pakistan at some time or is that not an option at the moment ?
it is not the option at the moment , because i do n't want to put my family back at risk .
i do n't want to put myself back at risk .
so not at the moment .
but yes , i would love to go back .
no matter what lies in front of you , you have to try .
you ca n't give up .
if you give up , you die .
even if not physically , then at least mentally you accept defeat .
and that is not a thing i 've been trained to do by my parents .

after spending several months in a german refugee camp , the media watchdog group , reporters without borders helped secure her an internship in deutsche welle 's urdu-speaking news department .
dw : pakistan is considered one of the most dangerous countries for journalists .
what is your own experience ?
meera jamal : i suppose that is pretty much true .
the danger which is faced by the journalist is on two folds ; one is from the secret services .
you see a lot of incidents of journalists being harassed , beaten up , or killed by them .
and the other is the islamic radical groups .
why did you leave pakistan ?
it was pretty much because of the islamic radical group .
i was writing on the issues of women 's rights and basic human rights , in which you have to , at times , criticise certain norms or rules followed by the islamic clerics or created by them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal 's writing focussed on women 's rights in pakistan and this did n't go well with the islamic radial groups .
for example , on international women 's day , i wrote about a prostitute - a 56 year old woman whose children never knew she was a prostitute .
i thought that she was a great example of how a woman can sacrifice herself in order to support her children .
that was really looked down upon .
the other example was my series of articles on women 's rights , for example the right of divorce , the right of separation , the right of child custody .
how were you threatened ?
initially it was phone calls , then it went on to be doubled by letters .
then , in august 2008 , i was stopped by four men on my way to work , which really scared me .
they threatened me , for my life .
it was really scary .
i felt so much in danger for myself and i felt like i was putting my family at risk .
i was totally shattered actually because of it .
you lived in karachi at the time , what do you think would have happened if you had stayed on in pakistan , despite the threats ?
i suppose these people are really unpredictable .
there are incidents where they can throw acid on you , or they can ambush you .
they can do anything .
being a woman , it 's the most difficult thing .
there 's a particular kind of asian mentality , where a woman represents the entire family 's moral standing in the society .
and if anything goes bad with the woman , the entire family would be defamed .
it 's pretty much difficult for you to combat that , and being a woman , it was horrible for me .
so they could have maybe killed you ?
yes , but killing is the easiest part .
your family and your defamation for your family , that 's the horrible part .
i think i would never want to have that happen to them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal describes herself as a " non-believer " do you think the fact that you were a woman reporting about women 's issues , was that the most enraging bit to the people who threatened you ?
or was it the issues you reported about ?
it was the issues , it was me being a woman and writing about such issues , instigating other woman and convincing them of my ideas .
it was partly because of my personal life as well , because i am a non-believer , which catches attention a lot .
" she 's a non-believer and she 's writing to defame islam " .
so these kinds of things triggered them off .
what triggered you in a situation that 's so difficult for journalists , to join the profession ?
actually , you feel very much satisfied when you are doing something that can improve society , or at least you feel that it can bring a change , even a little bit .
for instance , the write-ups i 've done are basically on social issues , human rights .
when you go and talk to the people and get feedback , that people are reading you and appreciate that woman .
there were instances when i got calls from people who wanted to help .
so when i get such responses , it makes you feel on top of the world .
that you are actually doing something , your pieces make a difference .
that 's what keeps you going .
it 's very intoxicating .
so it must have been very frustrating to come to germany as a refugee and at the beginning not to be able to work ?
it was more than frustration in the beginning , because you are totally isolated , you do n't have friends or family and it makes you feel like you are isolated from the rest of the world .

then , in august 2008 , i was stopped by four men on my way to work , which really scared me .
they threatened me , for my life .
it was really scary .
i felt so much in danger for myself and i felt like i was putting my family at risk .
i was totally shattered actually because of it .
you lived in karachi at the time , what do you think would have happened if you had stayed on in pakistan , despite the threats ?
i suppose these people are really unpredictable .
there are incidents where they can throw acid on you , or they can ambush you .
they can do anything .
being a woman , it 's the most difficult thing .
there 's a particular kind of asian mentality , where a woman represents the entire family 's moral standing in the society .
and if anything goes bad with the woman , the entire family would be defamed .
it 's pretty much difficult for you to combat that , and being a woman , it was horrible for me .
so they could have maybe killed you ?
yes , but killing is the easiest part .
your family and your defamation for your family , that 's the horrible part .
i think i would never want to have that happen to them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal describes herself as a " non-believer " do you think the fact that you were a woman reporting about women 's issues , was that the most enraging bit to the people who threatened you ?
or was it the issues you reported about ?
it was the issues , it was me being a woman and writing about such issues , instigating other woman and convincing them of my ideas .
it was partly because of my personal life as well , because i am a non-believer , which catches attention a lot .
" she 's a non-believer and she 's writing to defame islam " .
so these kinds of things triggered them off .
what triggered you in a situation that 's so difficult for journalists , to join the profession ?
actually , you feel very much satisfied when you are doing something that can improve society , or at least you feel that it can bring a change , even a little bit .
for instance , the write-ups i 've done are basically on social issues , human rights .
when you go and talk to the people and get feedback , that people are reading you and appreciate that woman .
there were instances when i got calls from people who wanted to help .
so when i get such responses , it makes you feel on top of the world .
that you are actually doing something , your pieces make a difference .
that 's what keeps you going .
it 's very intoxicating .
so it must have been very frustrating to come to germany as a refugee and at the beginning not to be able to work ?
it was more than frustration in the beginning , because you are totally isolated , you do n't have friends or family and it makes you feel like you are isolated from the rest of the world .
journalism becomes part of your digestive system , as you can say .
you read the news and it keeps you going , it runs in your blood .
so once you are taken out of that , you feel very much dehydrated for news .
so after spending some months in the refugee camp , you 've joined deutsche welle for a few months .
what do you think the future will be like ?
would you like to return to pakistan at some time or is that not an option at the moment ?
it is not the option at the moment , because i do n't want to put my family back at risk .
i do n't want to put myself back at risk .
so not at the moment .
but yes , i would love to go back .
no matter what lies in front of you , you have to try .
you ca n't give up .
if you give up , you die .
even if not physically , then at least mentally you accept defeat .
and that is not a thing i 've been trained to do by my parents .
they always told me to keep trying and give 100 percent .

dw : pakistan is considered one of the most dangerous countries for journalists .
what is your own experience ?
meera jamal : i suppose that is pretty much true .
the danger which is faced by the journalist is on two folds ; one is from the secret services .
you see a lot of incidents of journalists being harassed , beaten up , or killed by them .
and the other is the islamic radical groups .
why did you leave pakistan ?
it was pretty much because of the islamic radical group .
i was writing on the issues of women 's rights and basic human rights , in which you have to , at times , criticise certain norms or rules followed by the islamic clerics or created by them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal 's writing focussed on women 's rights in pakistan and this did n't go well with the islamic radial groups .
for example , on international women 's day , i wrote about a prostitute - a 56 year old woman whose children never knew she was a prostitute .
i thought that she was a great example of how a woman can sacrifice herself in order to support her children .
that was really looked down upon .
the other example was my series of articles on women 's rights , for example the right of divorce , the right of separation , the right of child custody .
how were you threatened ?
initially it was phone calls , then it went on to be doubled by letters .
then , in august 2008 , i was stopped by four men on my way to work , which really scared me .

the iwh said the car scrapping incentive could burden the federal budget with 2,6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3,5 billion -rrb- . under the popular scheme , the government offers a 2,500-euro bonus to anyone who puts a car 9 years or older in the crusher and buys a new one . dirk niebel , secretary-general of the business-friendly free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , called the incentive " expensive junk . "
the berlin government , he told welt am sonntag , let itself be pushed into an expensive subsidy program by the automobile industry . but the finance ministry in berlin defended the project . " the idea was for somebody who needs a new car to buy it now and not wait till next year , " a spokesman said on sunday . germany earmarked 5 billion euros to fund the anti-recession program .
similar car scrappage shemes have been introduced in several european countries , including france , italy and the united kingdom . db / tt , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with just four matches to go , wolfsburg have 60 , three clear of champions bayern munich , who beat borussia moenchengladbach 2-1 .
hertha move up to third on 56 points , followed by vfb stuttgart and hamburg on 55 points .
although hertha started the brighter , it was hamburg who drew first blood when jansen steered ivica olic 's cross from the left into the far corner .
despite the early lead , martin jol 's side failed to take control and instead it was the visitors who continued to eke out the better chances in a flat-paced game .
marc stein tested frank rost in the hamburg goal with a shot from distance while rost also did well to turn away a cicero header on 32 minutes .
jansen registered hamburg 's first decent chance of the second period on 51 minutes with a header but jaroslav drobny saved well .
hertha equalized out of nothing on 66 minutes when kacar smashed the ball home from 28 metres out .
in a frantic finale , olic saw a shot saved by drobny , who also pulled off a fantastic reflex save from joris mathijsen to ensure a point for hertha .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's milivoje novakovic fires in the winner milivoje novakovic was the hero for cologne against bremen , tapping in the only goal of the game at the far post after 66 minutes .

in other matches played saturday , schalke 's hopes of qualifying for next season 's europa cup received a setback as they were beaten 2-1 at home by bayer leverkusen .

although hertha started the brighter , it was hamburg who drew first blood when jansen steered ivica olic 's cross from the left into the far corner .
despite the early lead , martin jol 's side failed to take control and instead it was the visitors who continued to eke out the better chances in a flat-paced game .
marc stein tested frank rost in the hamburg goal with a shot from distance while rost also did well to turn away a cicero header on 32 minutes .
jansen registered hamburg 's first decent chance of the second period on 51 minutes with a header but jaroslav drobny saved well .
hertha equalized out of nothing on 66 minutes when kacar smashed the ball home from 28 metres out .
in a frantic finale , olic saw a shot saved by drobny , who also pulled off a fantastic reflex save from joris mathijsen to ensure a point for hertha .

she tracks down everything from van goghs to james bond 's 1963 aston martin . when victorine stille gets a call from an art collector about a stolen work , the first thing she does is enter the crucial details - like artist , year and frame color - in the so-called art loss register . the central databank was founded in london in 1991 and branched have since been added in new york , amsterdam , paris and cologne - where stille works . " what often happens is that , after it 's stolen , a work circulates through the black market for about two to three years , " said the art detective .
" we have a theory that they turn up again after about 15 years . " long-lost paintings might resurface at art auctions or fairs .
but for the rightful owners , 15 years is too long to wait . cross-check at art fairs aiming to speed up the recovery process , stille , who studied art management in amsterdam , spends much of her work day researching on the internet , scanning art auctions ' web sites .
she also attends sundry exhibitions and art fairs . " we visit art dealers ' stands at fairs to protect them and their reputations , and also to protect the participants from buying stolen art , " said the professional sleuth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : james bond had to get a new car after his was stolen in 1997 while she 's there , she checks the works on display against the art loss register to see if any have been reported as stolen . art thieves apparently prefer paintings , but the register also contains antiques , watches and furniture . stolen art on four wheels " we even have a james bond old-timer in our databank , " said stille .
" it 's a 1963 aston martin and was stolen in 1997 during filming .
it was used in both goldfinger and thunderball . " she compared the car to " the scream " by norwegian artist edvard munch , which was stolen from an oslo museum in 2006 and recovered two years later : " those are items that can never be sold , " she said . unlike munch 's masterpiece , the aston martin is still at large - though stille said suspects the thief is more likely to be driving the car around rather than hiding it in a garage somewhere . though the art detective and her colleagues are unlikely to spot james bond 's pride and joy on the way to the supermarket , they do have to rely sometimes on coincidence . " it 's a combination of being active and passive , " said stille .
" sometimes people just call us up and say , hey we saw this or that , or we know about a piece .
but we also actively look through auction catalogues and auction houses . " art dealers , collectors or buyers are also welcome to check the stolen art databank before investing in a piece . so far , stille and her team have recovered 230 million euros -lrb- us $ 304 million -rrb- worth of art .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de civil rights -pipe- 03.05.2009 a trip to burma reveals a black hole of information großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside the pagodas , there 's more need than splendor one year ago , cyclone nargis devastated the southeast asian country of burma , but authorities have largely ignored the anniversary .
as dw reporter andreas illmer writes , burma has a long way to go to reach democracy . getting off the plane at rangoon -lrb- yangon -rrb- airport feels like stepping into a different world .
after making it past immigration control , i soon find myself in a taxi driving past a faded billboard reading " welcome to the golden land . "
the first impression is one of stark poverty .
coming from the buzzing metropolis that is thailand 's capital , bangkok , rangoon - although a city of 4 million - looks like little more than a sad provincial town , run-down and desolate .
in the early hours of morning only few people are around , trudging along the sidewalk or waiting for a bus .
there are some bicycles and a few cars - old and battered japanese models .
the country has been on a downward slope for most of the years since it gained independence from britain in 1948 .
after just over one decade of democracy , a military coup in 1962 brought a military junta to power , brutally steering the country on to the " burmese way to socialism " .
for the people , this was not good news .
today , the country ranks amongst the poorest in the world .
" our government is afraid of the students , very afraid . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's plenty of local food on offer , but prices are steep for my few days in burma -lrb- myanmar -rrb- , i have an english-speaking taxi driver provided by the airport 's tourist authorities .
he 's polite but very reserved and i avoid questions about the political situation - i do n't want to get myself into trouble , nor do i want to put him in an uncomfortable situation .
but then , one night , i catch a taxi on the road to get back to my hotel , and the driver seems curious to talk to me .
driving past a building that looks a bit like a university compound , i ask him about the country 's schools and higher education .
" there are few universities in the big towns , " he says in broken english .
he hesitates and then adds : " most universities are in the countryside , in small towns .
our government is very afraid of the students , very afraid .
there have been many demonstrations in the past . "
in 1988 , mounting discontent with the political leadership led to widespread protests across the country .
security forces killed thousands to stifle the popular uprising .
the last anti-government protests date back to only 2007 .
led by buddhist monks , the demonstrations were initially tolerated , but eventually the government launched yet another brutal crackdown .
aung san suu kyi ?
" popular , yes .
very popular . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi remains under house arrest " demonstrations ? "
i ask .
" demonstrations , " he confirms , turning his head to look at me sitting in the backseat .
i ask about aung san suu kyi , tell him that we hear a lot about her in the international media .
is she still popular amongst the people ?
" popular , yes .
very popular . "
his voice sounds excited , a suppressed tension as if he 's been burning to spell that out .
at the same time i am very aware that such a statement expressed to a foreigner could get him into serious trouble .
" she lives close to your hotel , " he says .
" on the other side of the lake .
but it 's not good to go there , you are not allowed to take a photograph of the house . "
aung san suu kyi is the head of the opposition national league for democracy .
in the country 's only free elections in 1990 she won a landslide victory .
but the ruling military junta dismissed the results and placed the politician under house arrest , where she 's been for most of the last 19 years .
in 1991 she was awarded the nobel peace prize .
forty dollars a month to live on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is not an uncommon sight in rural areas the next day the april heat is almost unbearable , it 's around 40 degrees celsius spiced with humidity and dust weighing down every single step in the afternoon sun .
street markets have a wide array of food on offer , there are even a few shops stacked with goods imported from the west or from the neighboring asian countries .
a look at the prices reveals that most of these things are far beyond reach for the normal population .
" oh , salaries are low in myanmar , very low , " my driver tells me when i ask about the average wage .
" a normal man will earn maybe 40 us dollars per month .
it 's difficult . "
he hints that there are many other things that you need money for besides food - corruption and the black market are thriving .
i see more of the country 's poverty on a trip through the countryside .
villages consist of little more than wooden huts , bicycles are probably the most common means of transportation , old cars and horse and ox carriages make their slow way along the sandy dirt roads .
the people look at foreigners with shy curiosity .
although there now is some degree of tourism , i do n't meet a single foreigner outside rangoon .
for many decades the country was utterly isolated , with practically no visitors allowed in . in the 1990s , travel restrictions were eased with the hope that foreigners would bring in money .
the country 's buddhist monasteries and pagodas are among the most beautiful and impressive in the world .
a black hole of information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will eu pressure bring a better future for the young generation ?
getting information about burma from the outside is fairly easy .
there was extensive coverage when , on may 2-3 , 2008 , the country were devastated by cyclone nargis , leaving 138,000 people dead or missing .
according to aid agencies , at least 250,000 people will require food handouts until the end of 2009 as a result .
in march 2009 the united nation 's special investigator tomas ojea quintana called on burma 's ruling junta to release more than 2,100 political prisoners .
but if you were inside the country at the time , it 's unlikely that you would have heard about any of this .
paris-based media watchdog reporters without borders calls the country a " black hole " .
myanmar is among the bottom 10 countries of the organization 's world press freedom ranking .
trying to check e-mails , i can access neither yahoo nor gmail .
at the hotel , however , there 's the new light of myanmar , an english language newspaper singing the praises of senior general than shwe , the chief of the military regime .
rangoon used to be the capital of the country until , in 2005 , the junta decided it needed a safer place - somewhere in the middle of nowhere .
naypyidaw was built from scratch some 300 kilometers north of rangoon and declared the capital in 2006 .
sanctions to keep up the pressure international pressure and tensions from within forced the government to announce general elections for 2010 .
but little progress has been made so far .
the eu has criticized that no steps have been taken to make the upcoming elections a credible , transparent and inclusive process based on international standards .
the eu 's political and economic sanctions against myanmar have been in place since 2006 and were strengthened after the 2007 crackdown .
they include a travel ban on burma officials , an arms embargo and a freezing of assets .
this year , on april 27 , the eu decided to extend those measures for another 12 months .
by doing so , the foreign ministers of the 27 nation bloc hope to keep up the pressure .
they have however made it clear that the eu is ready to ease sanctions - should there be genuine , democratic progress .

as dw reporter andreas illmer writes , burma has a long way to go to reach democracy . getting off the plane at rangoon -lrb- yangon -rrb- airport feels like stepping into a different world .
after making it past immigration control , i soon find myself in a taxi driving past a faded billboard reading " welcome to the golden land . "
the first impression is one of stark poverty .
coming from the buzzing metropolis that is thailand 's capital , bangkok , rangoon - although a city of 4 million - looks like little more than a sad provincial town , run-down and desolate .
in the early hours of morning only few people are around , trudging along the sidewalk or waiting for a bus .
there are some bicycles and a few cars - old and battered japanese models .
the country has been on a downward slope for most of the years since it gained independence from britain in 1948 .
after just over one decade of democracy , a military coup in 1962 brought a military junta to power , brutally steering the country on to the " burmese way to socialism " .
for the people , this was not good news .
today , the country ranks amongst the poorest in the world .
" our government is afraid of the students , very afraid . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's plenty of local food on offer , but prices are steep for my few days in burma -lrb- myanmar -rrb- , i have an english-speaking taxi driver provided by the airport 's tourist authorities .
he 's polite but very reserved and i avoid questions about the political situation - i do n't want to get myself into trouble , nor do i want to put him in an uncomfortable situation .
but then , one night , i catch a taxi on the road to get back to my hotel , and the driver seems curious to talk to me .
driving past a building that looks a bit like a university compound , i ask him about the country 's schools and higher education .
" there are few universities in the big towns , " he says in broken english .
he hesitates and then adds : " most universities are in the countryside , in small towns .
our government is very afraid of the students , very afraid .
there have been many demonstrations in the past . "
in 1988 , mounting discontent with the political leadership led to widespread protests across the country .
security forces killed thousands to stifle the popular uprising .
the last anti-government protests date back to only 2007 .
led by buddhist monks , the demonstrations were initially tolerated , but eventually the government launched yet another brutal crackdown .
aung san suu kyi ?
" popular , yes .
very popular . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi remains under house arrest " demonstrations ? "
i ask .
" demonstrations , " he confirms , turning his head to look at me sitting in the backseat .
i ask about aung san suu kyi , tell him that we hear a lot about her in the international media .
is she still popular amongst the people ?
" popular , yes .
very popular . "
his voice sounds excited , a suppressed tension as if he 's been burning to spell that out .
at the same time i am very aware that such a statement expressed to a foreigner could get him into serious trouble .
" she lives close to your hotel , " he says .
" on the other side of the lake .
but it 's not good to go there , you are not allowed to take a photograph of the house . "
aung san suu kyi is the head of the opposition national league for democracy .
in the country 's only free elections in 1990 she won a landslide victory .
but the ruling military junta dismissed the results and placed the politician under house arrest , where she 's been for most of the last 19 years .
in 1991 she was awarded the nobel peace prize .

street markets have a wide array of food on offer , there are even a few shops stacked with goods imported from the west or from the neighboring asian countries .
a look at the prices reveals that most of these things are far beyond reach for the normal population .
" oh , salaries are low in myanmar , very low , " my driver tells me when i ask about the average wage .
" a normal man will earn maybe 40 us dollars per month .
it 's difficult . "
he hints that there are many other things that you need money for besides food - corruption and the black market are thriving .
i see more of the country 's poverty on a trip through the countryside .
villages consist of little more than wooden huts , bicycles are probably the most common means of transportation , old cars and horse and ox carriages make their slow way along the sandy dirt roads .
the people look at foreigners with shy curiosity .
although there now is some degree of tourism , i do n't meet a single foreigner outside rangoon .
for many decades the country was utterly isolated , with practically no visitors allowed in . in the 1990s , travel restrictions were eased with the hope that foreigners would bring in money .
the country 's buddhist monasteries and pagodas are among the most beautiful and impressive in the world .
a black hole of information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will eu pressure bring a better future for the young generation ?
getting information about burma from the outside is fairly easy .
there was extensive coverage when , on may 2-3 , 2008 , the country were devastated by cyclone nargis , leaving 138,000 people dead or missing .
according to aid agencies , at least 250,000 people will require food handouts until the end of 2009 as a result .
in march 2009 the united nation 's special investigator tomas ojea quintana called on burma 's ruling junta to release more than 2,100 political prisoners .
but if you were inside the country at the time , it 's unlikely that you would have heard about any of this .
paris-based media watchdog reporters without borders calls the country a " black hole " .
myanmar is among the bottom 10 countries of the organization 's world press freedom ranking .
trying to check e-mails , i can access neither yahoo nor gmail .
at the hotel , however , there 's the new light of myanmar , an english language newspaper singing the praises of senior general than shwe , the chief of the military regime .
rangoon used to be the capital of the country until , in 2005 , the junta decided it needed a safer place - somewhere in the middle of nowhere .
naypyidaw was built from scratch some 300 kilometers north of rangoon and declared the capital in 2006 .
sanctions to keep up the pressure international pressure and tensions from within forced the government to announce general elections for 2010 .
but little progress has been made so far .
the eu has criticized that no steps have been taken to make the upcoming elections a credible , transparent and inclusive process based on international standards .
the eu 's political and economic sanctions against myanmar have been in place since 2006 and were strengthened after the 2007 crackdown .
they include a travel ban on burma officials , an arms embargo and a freezing of assets .
this year , on april 27 , the eu decided to extend those measures for another 12 months .
by doing so , the foreign ministers of the 27 nation bloc hope to keep up the pressure .
they have however made it clear that the eu is ready to ease sanctions - should there be genuine , democratic progress .

as dw reporter andreas illmer writes , burma has a long way to go to reach democracy . getting off the plane at rangoon -lrb- yangon -rrb- airport feels like stepping into a different world .
after making it past immigration control , i soon find myself in a taxi driving past a faded billboard reading " welcome to the golden land . "
the first impression is one of stark poverty .
coming from the buzzing metropolis that is thailand 's capital , bangkok , rangoon - although a city of 4 million - looks like little more than a sad provincial town , run-down and desolate .
in the early hours of morning only few people are around , trudging along the sidewalk or waiting for a bus .
there are some bicycles and a few cars - old and battered japanese models .
the country has been on a downward slope for most of the years since it gained independence from britain in 1948 .
after just over one decade of democracy , a military coup in 1962 brought a military junta to power , brutally steering the country on to the " burmese way to socialism " .
for the people , this was not good news .
today , the country ranks amongst the poorest in the world .
" our government is afraid of the students , very afraid . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's plenty of local food on offer , but prices are steep for my few days in burma -lrb- myanmar -rrb- , i have an english-speaking taxi driver provided by the airport 's tourist authorities .
he 's polite but very reserved and i avoid questions about the political situation - i do n't want to get myself into trouble , nor do i want to put him in an uncomfortable situation .
but then , one night , i catch a taxi on the road to get back to my hotel , and the driver seems curious to talk to me .
driving past a building that looks a bit like a university compound , i ask him about the country 's schools and higher education .
" there are few universities in the big towns , " he says in broken english .
he hesitates and then adds : " most universities are in the countryside , in small towns .
our government is very afraid of the students , very afraid .
there have been many demonstrations in the past . "
in 1988 , mounting discontent with the political leadership led to widespread protests across the country .
security forces killed thousands to stifle the popular uprising .
the last anti-government protests date back to only 2007 .
led by buddhist monks , the demonstrations were initially tolerated , but eventually the government launched yet another brutal crackdown .
aung san suu kyi ?
" popular , yes .
very popular . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi remains under house arrest " demonstrations ? "
i ask .
" demonstrations , " he confirms , turning his head to look at me sitting in the backseat .
i ask about aung san suu kyi , tell him that we hear a lot about her in the international media .
is she still popular amongst the people ?
" popular , yes .
very popular . "
his voice sounds excited , a suppressed tension as if he 's been burning to spell that out .
at the same time i am very aware that such a statement expressed to a foreigner could get him into serious trouble .
" she lives close to your hotel , " he says .
" on the other side of the lake .
but it 's not good to go there , you are not allowed to take a photograph of the house . "
aung san suu kyi is the head of the opposition national league for democracy .
in the country 's only free elections in 1990 she won a landslide victory .
but the ruling military junta dismissed the results and placed the politician under house arrest , where she 's been for most of the last 19 years .
in 1991 she was awarded the nobel peace prize .
forty dollars a month to live on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is not an uncommon sight in rural areas the next day the april heat is almost unbearable , it 's around 40 degrees celsius spiced with humidity and dust weighing down every single step in the afternoon sun .
street markets have a wide array of food on offer , there are even a few shops stacked with goods imported from the west or from the neighboring asian countries .
a look at the prices reveals that most of these things are far beyond reach for the normal population .
" oh , salaries are low in myanmar , very low , " my driver tells me when i ask about the average wage .
" a normal man will earn maybe 40 us dollars per month .
it 's difficult . "
he hints that there are many other things that you need money for besides food - corruption and the black market are thriving .
i see more of the country 's poverty on a trip through the countryside .
villages consist of little more than wooden huts , bicycles are probably the most common means of transportation , old cars and horse and ox carriages make their slow way along the sandy dirt roads .
the people look at foreigners with shy curiosity .
although there now is some degree of tourism , i do n't meet a single foreigner outside rangoon .
for many decades the country was utterly isolated , with practically no visitors allowed in . in the 1990s , travel restrictions were eased with the hope that foreigners would bring in money .
the country 's buddhist monasteries and pagodas are among the most beautiful and impressive in the world .
a black hole of information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will eu pressure bring a better future for the young generation ?
getting information about burma from the outside is fairly easy .
there was extensive coverage when , on may 2-3 , 2008 , the country were devastated by cyclone nargis , leaving 138,000 people dead or missing .
according to aid agencies , at least 250,000 people will require food handouts until the end of 2009 as a result .
in march 2009 the united nation 's special investigator tomas ojea quintana called on burma 's ruling junta to release more than 2,100 political prisoners .
but if you were inside the country at the time , it 's unlikely that you would have heard about any of this .
paris-based media watchdog reporters without borders calls the country a " black hole " .
myanmar is among the bottom 10 countries of the organization 's world press freedom ranking .
trying to check e-mails , i can access neither yahoo nor gmail .
at the hotel , however , there 's the new light of myanmar , an english language newspaper singing the praises of senior general than shwe , the chief of the military regime .
rangoon used to be the capital of the country until , in 2005 , the junta decided it needed a safer place - somewhere in the middle of nowhere .
naypyidaw was built from scratch some 300 kilometers north of rangoon and declared the capital in 2006 .
sanctions to keep up the pressure international pressure and tensions from within forced the government to announce general elections for 2010 .
but little progress has been made so far .
the eu has criticized that no steps have been taken to make the upcoming elections a credible , transparent and inclusive process based on international standards .
the eu 's political and economic sanctions against myanmar have been in place since 2006 and were strengthened after the 2007 crackdown .
they include a travel ban on burma officials , an arms embargo and a freezing of assets .
this year , on april 27 , the eu decided to extend those measures for another 12 months .
by doing so , the foreign ministers of the 27 nation bloc hope to keep up the pressure .
they have however made it clear that the eu is ready to ease sanctions - should there be genuine , democratic progress .

she tracks down everything from van goghs to james bond 's 1963 aston martin . when victorine stille gets a call from an art collector about a stolen work , the first thing she does is enter the crucial details - like artist , year and frame color - in the so-called art loss register . the central databank was founded in london in 1991 and branched have since been added in new york , amsterdam , paris and cologne - where stille works . " what often happens is that , after it 's stolen , a work circulates through the black market for about two to three years , " said the art detective .
" we have a theory that they turn up again after about 15 years . " long-lost paintings might resurface at art auctions or fairs .
but for the rightful owners , 15 years is too long to wait . cross-check at art fairs aiming to speed up the recovery process , stille , who studied art management in amsterdam , spends much of her work day researching on the internet , scanning art auctions ' web sites .
she also attends sundry exhibitions and art fairs . " we visit art dealers ' stands at fairs to protect them and their reputations , and also to protect the participants from buying stolen art , " said the professional sleuth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : james bond had to get a new car after his was stolen in 1997 while she 's there , she checks the works on display against the art loss register to see if any have been reported as stolen . art thieves apparently prefer paintings , but the register also contains antiques , watches and furniture . stolen art on four wheels " we even have a james bond old-timer in our databank , " said stille .
" it 's a 1963 aston martin and was stolen in 1997 during filming .
it was used in both goldfinger and thunderball . " she compared the car to " the scream " by norwegian artist edvard munch , which was stolen from an oslo museum in 2006 and recovered two years later : " those are items that can never be sold , " she said . unlike munch 's masterpiece , the aston martin is still at large - though stille said suspects the thief is more likely to be driving the car around rather than hiding it in a garage somewhere . though the art detective and her colleagues are unlikely to spot james bond 's pride and joy on the way to the supermarket , they do have to rely sometimes on coincidence . " it 's a combination of being active and passive , " said stille .
" sometimes people just call us up and say , hey we saw this or that , or we know about a piece .
but we also actively look through auction catalogues and auction houses . " art dealers , collectors or buyers are also welcome to check the stolen art databank before investing in a piece . so far , stille and her team have recovered 230 million euros -lrb- us $ 304 million -rrb- worth of art .
in germany , approximately 180 pieces are considered missing . author : murat kojuncu / kate bowen editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as dw reporter andreas illmer writes , burma has a long way to go to reach democracy . getting off the plane at rangoon -lrb- yangon -rrb- airport feels like stepping into a different world .
after making it past immigration control , i soon find myself in a taxi driving past a faded billboard reading " welcome to the golden land . "
the first impression is one of stark poverty .
coming from the buzzing metropolis that is thailand 's capital , bangkok , rangoon - although a city of 4 million - looks like little more than a sad provincial town , run-down and desolate .
in the early hours of morning only few people are around , trudging along the sidewalk or waiting for a bus .
there are some bicycles and a few cars - old and battered japanese models .
the country has been on a downward slope for most of the years since it gained independence from britain in 1948 .
after just over one decade of democracy , a military coup in 1962 brought a military junta to power , brutally steering the country on to the " burmese way to socialism " .
for the people , this was not good news .
today , the country ranks amongst the poorest in the world .
" our government is afraid of the students , very afraid . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's plenty of local food on offer , but prices are steep for my few days in burma -lrb- myanmar -rrb- , i have an english-speaking taxi driver provided by the airport 's tourist authorities .
he 's polite but very reserved and i avoid questions about the political situation - i do n't want to get myself into trouble , nor do i want to put him in an uncomfortable situation .
but then , one night , i catch a taxi on the road to get back to my hotel , and the driver seems curious to talk to me .
driving past a building that looks a bit like a university compound , i ask him about the country 's schools and higher education .
" there are few universities in the big towns , " he says in broken english .
he hesitates and then adds : " most universities are in the countryside , in small towns .
our government is very afraid of the students , very afraid .
there have been many demonstrations in the past . "
in 1988 , mounting discontent with the political leadership led to widespread protests across the country .
security forces killed thousands to stifle the popular uprising .
the last anti-government protests date back to only 2007 .
led by buddhist monks , the demonstrations were initially tolerated , but eventually the government launched yet another brutal crackdown .
aung san suu kyi ?
" popular , yes .
very popular . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi remains under house arrest " demonstrations ? "
i ask .
" demonstrations , " he confirms , turning his head to look at me sitting in the backseat .
i ask about aung san suu kyi , tell him that we hear a lot about her in the international media .
is she still popular amongst the people ?
" popular , yes .
very popular . "
his voice sounds excited , a suppressed tension as if he 's been burning to spell that out .
at the same time i am very aware that such a statement expressed to a foreigner could get him into serious trouble .
" she lives close to your hotel , " he says .
" on the other side of the lake .
but it 's not good to go there , you are not allowed to take a photograph of the house . "
aung san suu kyi is the head of the opposition national league for democracy .
in the country 's only free elections in 1990 she won a landslide victory .
but the ruling military junta dismissed the results and placed the politician under house arrest , where she 's been for most of the last 19 years .
in 1991 she was awarded the nobel peace prize .
forty dollars a month to live on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is not an uncommon sight in rural areas the next day the april heat is almost unbearable , it 's around 40 degrees celsius spiced with humidity and dust weighing down every single step in the afternoon sun .
street markets have a wide array of food on offer , there are even a few shops stacked with goods imported from the west or from the neighboring asian countries .
a look at the prices reveals that most of these things are far beyond reach for the normal population .
" oh , salaries are low in myanmar , very low , " my driver tells me when i ask about the average wage .
" a normal man will earn maybe 40 us dollars per month .
it 's difficult . "
he hints that there are many other things that you need money for besides food - corruption and the black market are thriving .
i see more of the country 's poverty on a trip through the countryside .
villages consist of little more than wooden huts , bicycles are probably the most common means of transportation , old cars and horse and ox carriages make their slow way along the sandy dirt roads .
the people look at foreigners with shy curiosity .
although there now is some degree of tourism , i do n't meet a single foreigner outside rangoon .
for many decades the country was utterly isolated , with practically no visitors allowed in . in the 1990s , travel restrictions were eased with the hope that foreigners would bring in money .
the country 's buddhist monasteries and pagodas are among the most beautiful and impressive in the world .
a black hole of information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will eu pressure bring a better future for the young generation ?
getting information about burma from the outside is fairly easy .
there was extensive coverage when , on may 2-3 , 2008 , the country were devastated by cyclone nargis , leaving 138,000 people dead or missing .
according to aid agencies , at least 250,000 people will require food handouts until the end of 2009 as a result .
in march 2009 the united nation 's special investigator tomas ojea quintana called on burma 's ruling junta to release more than 2,100 political prisoners .
but if you were inside the country at the time , it 's unlikely that you would have heard about any of this .
paris-based media watchdog reporters without borders calls the country a " black hole " .
myanmar is among the bottom 10 countries of the organization 's world press freedom ranking .
trying to check e-mails , i can access neither yahoo nor gmail .
at the hotel , however , there 's the new light of myanmar , an english language newspaper singing the praises of senior general than shwe , the chief of the military regime .
rangoon used to be the capital of the country until , in 2005 , the junta decided it needed a safer place - somewhere in the middle of nowhere .
naypyidaw was built from scratch some 300 kilometers north of rangoon and declared the capital in 2006 .
sanctions to keep up the pressure international pressure and tensions from within forced the government to announce general elections for 2010 .
but little progress has been made so far .
the eu has criticized that no steps have been taken to make the upcoming elections a credible , transparent and inclusive process based on international standards .
the eu 's political and economic sanctions against myanmar have been in place since 2006 and were strengthened after the 2007 crackdown .
they include a travel ban on burma officials , an arms embargo and a freezing of assets .
this year , on april 27 , the eu decided to extend those measures for another 12 months .
by doing so , the foreign ministers of the 27 nation bloc hope to keep up the pressure .
they have however made it clear that the eu is ready to ease sanctions - should there be genuine , democratic progress .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 03.05.2009 threatened pakistani journalist vows to keep writing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meera jamal says she wo n't give up her writing a deutsche welle intern , forced to leave her home in pakistan after receiving death threats , gives details of her ordeal . pakistani journalist , meera jamal , fled to germany last october following a spate of threats in response to her articles .
after spending several months in a german refugee camp , the media watchdog group , reporters without borders helped secure her an internship in deutsche welle 's urdu-speaking news department .
dw : pakistan is considered one of the most dangerous countries for journalists .
what is your own experience ?
meera jamal : i suppose that is pretty much true .
the danger which is faced by the journalist is on two folds ; one is from the secret services .
you see a lot of incidents of journalists being harassed , beaten up , or killed by them .
and the other is the islamic radical groups .
why did you leave pakistan ?
it was pretty much because of the islamic radical group .
i was writing on the issues of women 's rights and basic human rights , in which you have to , at times , criticise certain norms or rules followed by the islamic clerics or created by them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal 's writing focussed on women 's rights in pakistan and this did n't go well with the islamic radial groups .
for example , on international women 's day , i wrote about a prostitute - a 56 year old woman whose children never knew she was a prostitute .
i thought that she was a great example of how a woman can sacrifice herself in order to support her children .
that was really looked down upon .
the other example was my series of articles on women 's rights , for example the right of divorce , the right of separation , the right of child custody .
how were you threatened ?
initially it was phone calls , then it went on to be doubled by letters .
then , in august 2008 , i was stopped by four men on my way to work , which really scared me .
they threatened me , for my life .
it was really scary .
i felt so much in danger for myself and i felt like i was putting my family at risk .
i was totally shattered actually because of it .
you lived in karachi at the time , what do you think would have happened if you had stayed on in pakistan , despite the threats ?
i suppose these people are really unpredictable .
there are incidents where they can throw acid on you , or they can ambush you .
they can do anything .
being a woman , it 's the most difficult thing .
there 's a particular kind of asian mentality , where a woman represents the entire family 's moral standing in the society .
and if anything goes bad with the woman , the entire family would be defamed .
it 's pretty much difficult for you to combat that , and being a woman , it was horrible for me .
so they could have maybe killed you ?
yes , but killing is the easiest part .
your family and your defamation for your family , that 's the horrible part .
i think i would never want to have that happen to them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal describes herself as a " non-believer " do you think the fact that you were a woman reporting about women 's issues , was that the most enraging bit to the people who threatened you ?
or was it the issues you reported about ?
it was the issues , it was me being a woman and writing about such issues , instigating other woman and convincing them of my ideas .
it was partly because of my personal life as well , because i am a non-believer , which catches attention a lot .
" she 's a non-believer and she 's writing to defame islam " .
so these kinds of things triggered them off .
what triggered you in a situation that 's so difficult for journalists , to join the profession ?
actually , you feel very much satisfied when you are doing something that can improve society , or at least you feel that it can bring a change , even a little bit .
for instance , the write-ups i 've done are basically on social issues , human rights .
when you go and talk to the people and get feedback , that people are reading you and appreciate that woman .
there were instances when i got calls from people who wanted to help .
so when i get such responses , it makes you feel on top of the world .
that you are actually doing something , your pieces make a difference .
that 's what keeps you going .
it 's very intoxicating .
so it must have been very frustrating to come to germany as a refugee and at the beginning not to be able to work ?
it was more than frustration in the beginning , because you are totally isolated , you do n't have friends or family and it makes you feel like you are isolated from the rest of the world .
journalism becomes part of your digestive system , as you can say .
you read the news and it keeps you going , it runs in your blood .
so once you are taken out of that , you feel very much dehydrated for news .
so after spending some months in the refugee camp , you 've joined deutsche welle for a few months .
what do you think the future will be like ?
would you like to return to pakistan at some time or is that not an option at the moment ?
it is not the option at the moment , because i do n't want to put my family back at risk .
i do n't want to put myself back at risk .
so not at the moment .
but yes , i would love to go back .
no matter what lies in front of you , you have to try .
you ca n't give up .
if you give up , you die .
even if not physically , then at least mentally you accept defeat .
and that is not a thing i 've been trained to do by my parents .
they always told me to keep trying and give 100 percent .

after spending several months in a german refugee camp , the media watchdog group , reporters without borders helped secure her an internship in deutsche welle 's urdu-speaking news department .
dw : pakistan is considered one of the most dangerous countries for journalists .
what is your own experience ?
meera jamal : i suppose that is pretty much true .
the danger which is faced by the journalist is on two folds ; one is from the secret services .
you see a lot of incidents of journalists being harassed , beaten up , or killed by them .
and the other is the islamic radical groups .
why did you leave pakistan ?
it was pretty much because of the islamic radical group .
i was writing on the issues of women 's rights and basic human rights , in which you have to , at times , criticise certain norms or rules followed by the islamic clerics or created by them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal 's writing focussed on women 's rights in pakistan and this did n't go well with the islamic radial groups .
for example , on international women 's day , i wrote about a prostitute - a 56 year old woman whose children never knew she was a prostitute .
i thought that she was a great example of how a woman can sacrifice herself in order to support her children .
that was really looked down upon .
the other example was my series of articles on women 's rights , for example the right of divorce , the right of separation , the right of child custody .
how were you threatened ?
initially it was phone calls , then it went on to be doubled by letters .
then , in august 2008 , i was stopped by four men on my way to work , which really scared me .
they threatened me , for my life .
it was really scary .
i felt so much in danger for myself and i felt like i was putting my family at risk .
i was totally shattered actually because of it .
you lived in karachi at the time , what do you think would have happened if you had stayed on in pakistan , despite the threats ?
i suppose these people are really unpredictable .
there are incidents where they can throw acid on you , or they can ambush you .
they can do anything .
being a woman , it 's the most difficult thing .
there 's a particular kind of asian mentality , where a woman represents the entire family 's moral standing in the society .
and if anything goes bad with the woman , the entire family would be defamed .
it 's pretty much difficult for you to combat that , and being a woman , it was horrible for me .
so they could have maybe killed you ?
yes , but killing is the easiest part .
your family and your defamation for your family , that 's the horrible part .
i think i would never want to have that happen to them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal describes herself as a " non-believer " do you think the fact that you were a woman reporting about women 's issues , was that the most enraging bit to the people who threatened you ?
or was it the issues you reported about ?
it was the issues , it was me being a woman and writing about such issues , instigating other woman and convincing them of my ideas .
it was partly because of my personal life as well , because i am a non-believer , which catches attention a lot .
" she 's a non-believer and she 's writing to defame islam " .
so these kinds of things triggered them off .
what triggered you in a situation that 's so difficult for journalists , to join the profession ?
actually , you feel very much satisfied when you are doing something that can improve society , or at least you feel that it can bring a change , even a little bit .
for instance , the write-ups i 've done are basically on social issues , human rights .
when you go and talk to the people and get feedback , that people are reading you and appreciate that woman .
there were instances when i got calls from people who wanted to help .
so when i get such responses , it makes you feel on top of the world .
that you are actually doing something , your pieces make a difference .
that 's what keeps you going .
it 's very intoxicating .
so it must have been very frustrating to come to germany as a refugee and at the beginning not to be able to work ?
it was more than frustration in the beginning , because you are totally isolated , you do n't have friends or family and it makes you feel like you are isolated from the rest of the world .
journalism becomes part of your digestive system , as you can say .
you read the news and it keeps you going , it runs in your blood .
so once you are taken out of that , you feel very much dehydrated for news .
so after spending some months in the refugee camp , you 've joined deutsche welle for a few months .
what do you think the future will be like ?
would you like to return to pakistan at some time or is that not an option at the moment ?
it is not the option at the moment , because i do n't want to put my family back at risk .
i do n't want to put myself back at risk .
so not at the moment .
but yes , i would love to go back .
no matter what lies in front of you , you have to try .
you ca n't give up .
if you give up , you die .
even if not physically , then at least mentally you accept defeat .
and that is not a thing i 've been trained to do by my parents .
they always told me to keep trying and give 100 percent .

" germany has to make its own assessment , " foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner told reporters in berlin .
an interior ministry spokesman added that " every decision is concerned with the individual case . " government officials also said that washington had drawn up an initial list of candidates slated for release , however they declined to say how many names were on the list under an agreement with the us administration to keep that information confidential . the spokesman added that the ministry would make its decisions on a case-by-case basis in consultation with other eu countries and officials from germany 's 16 federal states . he said that the criteria were related to german foreign residency law and would consider whether a detainee posed a security threat to germany . uighur reports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are 241 prisoners left at the guantanamo bay detention center der spiegel news magazine reported on saturday that up to 10 so-called non-dangerous captives were being considered for release in europe . german daily newspaper bild reported that the request concerned 10 chinese ethnic uighurs , who are viewed by beijing as " chinese terrorists . "
munich , in the southern german state bavaria , is home to around 500 uighurs , the largest known community in exile . but bavaria 's interior minister joachim herrmann told bild his state would not offer its " candidacy to welcome these people . "
most of the 17 uighurs held at guantanamo have been cleared of being enemy combatants . officials say it will be critical for the german government to be assured that none of the released prisoners have ties to terrorist networks .
us officials will also have to explain why the prisoners can not be sent back to their home countries or settled in the us . around 50 detainees are unable to return to their homelands because of the danger that they will be tortured there . government divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd and cdu appear to be on a collision course over accepting guantanamo inmates us president barack obama fulfilled one of his campaign promises in the first days of his presidency by ordering the closure of the controversial detention center on the cuban coast . now he must decide what to do with the 241 remaining prisoners . us attorney general eric holder said in berlin last week that washington would soon like to release 30 prisoners . while other european nations , including france and portugal , have indicated they are willing to accept guantanamo prisoners , germany 's fractious left-right government is at odds over the issue . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat running for chancellor this year , said in an open letter to obama in january that germany would be willing to take in detainees if it helped him close guantanamo . but the conservative interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said obama could not expect germany to accept freed inmates . according to bild , schaeuble wants first to exhaust all possibilities of their being resettled within the united states . dfm / hf / nrt / tt / rm , ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

domestic transmissions have also occurred in the united states and mexico , according to hacker . " the virus has the potency to spread and it has the potential to change genetically and that 's why we remain concerned and watchful , " hacker said .

" he will ask that the europeans wait a bit until the government presents its new policy , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman yigal palmor told news agency afp . lieberman is also to meet with italian , french and czech representatives in the first official visit abroad by a member of the new right-wing israeli government . visible progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lieberman has triggered controversy over his virulently anti-arab stance the hardliner is seeking to block voices within the european union calling for a freeze in upgrading israel-eu ties unless progress is made in peace talks between the coalition government of prime minister benjamin netanyahu and the palestinians . italian foreign minister franco frattini told yediot ahronot that if israel wanted to continue enjoying rome 's support in europe , it had to take " suitable positions " and declare its support for a continuation of the peace process . frattini also called on the blunt-speaking lieberman to " lower the tone " of his declarations and to " work towards an atmosphere of cooperation . " lieberman will meet with his french counterpart bernard kouchner on tuesday , but a meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy has not been confirmed . " i am not saying that it 's a condition , but it would be favorable if avigdor lieberman in the very least adheres to the decisions taken by the international community , " claude gueant , sarkozy 's chief of staff , told french radio . he is scheduled to meet with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in berlin on thursday . controversial beginnings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu 's coalition is yet to endorse a two-state solution lieberman , head of a nationalist party in netanyahu 's coalition , caused a stir on his first day as foreign minister when he announced that israel was no longer bound by the so-called annapolis peace process , which formed the basis of israeli-palestinian peace talks in 2008 . netanyahu has so far refused to publicly endorse the idea of a two-state solution that would see the creation of a palestinian state . instead , lieberman said , israel was prepared to adhere only to the roadmap peace plan , a performance-based initiative from 2003 . israel recently warned the eu to tone down its criticism of netanyahu 's cabinet or risk losing a role in the middle east peace process . dfm / tt , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 03.05.2009 threatened pakistani journalist vows to keep writing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meera jamal says she wo n't give up her writing a deutsche welle intern , forced to leave her home in pakistan after receiving death threats , gives details of her ordeal . pakistani journalist , meera jamal , fled to germany last october following a spate of threats in response to her articles .
after spending several months in a german refugee camp , the media watchdog group , reporters without borders helped secure her an internship in deutsche welle 's urdu-speaking news department .
dw : pakistan is considered one of the most dangerous countries for journalists .
what is your own experience ?
meera jamal : i suppose that is pretty much true .
the danger which is faced by the journalist is on two folds ; one is from the secret services .
you see a lot of incidents of journalists being harassed , beaten up , or killed by them .
and the other is the islamic radical groups .
why did you leave pakistan ?
it was pretty much because of the islamic radical group .
i was writing on the issues of women 's rights and basic human rights , in which you have to , at times , criticise certain norms or rules followed by the islamic clerics or created by them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal 's writing focussed on women 's rights in pakistan and this did n't go well with the islamic radial groups .
for example , on international women 's day , i wrote about a prostitute - a 56 year old woman whose children never knew she was a prostitute .
i thought that she was a great example of how a woman can sacrifice herself in order to support her children .
that was really looked down upon .
the other example was my series of articles on women 's rights , for example the right of divorce , the right of separation , the right of child custody .
how were you threatened ?
initially it was phone calls , then it went on to be doubled by letters .
then , in august 2008 , i was stopped by four men on my way to work , which really scared me .
they threatened me , for my life .
it was really scary .
i felt so much in danger for myself and i felt like i was putting my family at risk .
i was totally shattered actually because of it .
you lived in karachi at the time , what do you think would have happened if you had stayed on in pakistan , despite the threats ?
i suppose these people are really unpredictable .
there are incidents where they can throw acid on you , or they can ambush you .
they can do anything .
being a woman , it 's the most difficult thing .
there 's a particular kind of asian mentality , where a woman represents the entire family 's moral standing in the society .
and if anything goes bad with the woman , the entire family would be defamed .
it 's pretty much difficult for you to combat that , and being a woman , it was horrible for me .
so they could have maybe killed you ?
yes , but killing is the easiest part .
your family and your defamation for your family , that 's the horrible part .
i think i would never want to have that happen to them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal describes herself as a " non-believer " do you think the fact that you were a woman reporting about women 's issues , was that the most enraging bit to the people who threatened you ?
or was it the issues you reported about ?
it was the issues , it was me being a woman and writing about such issues , instigating other woman and convincing them of my ideas .
it was partly because of my personal life as well , because i am a non-believer , which catches attention a lot .
" she 's a non-believer and she 's writing to defame islam " .
so these kinds of things triggered them off .
what triggered you in a situation that 's so difficult for journalists , to join the profession ?
actually , you feel very much satisfied when you are doing something that can improve society , or at least you feel that it can bring a change , even a little bit .
for instance , the write-ups i 've done are basically on social issues , human rights .
when you go and talk to the people and get feedback , that people are reading you and appreciate that woman .
there were instances when i got calls from people who wanted to help .
so when i get such responses , it makes you feel on top of the world .
that you are actually doing something , your pieces make a difference .
that 's what keeps you going .
it 's very intoxicating .
so it must have been very frustrating to come to germany as a refugee and at the beginning not to be able to work ?
it was more than frustration in the beginning , because you are totally isolated , you do n't have friends or family and it makes you feel like you are isolated from the rest of the world .
journalism becomes part of your digestive system , as you can say .
you read the news and it keeps you going , it runs in your blood .
so once you are taken out of that , you feel very much dehydrated for news .
so after spending some months in the refugee camp , you 've joined deutsche welle for a few months .
what do you think the future will be like ?
would you like to return to pakistan at some time or is that not an option at the moment ?
it is not the option at the moment , because i do n't want to put my family back at risk .
i do n't want to put myself back at risk .
so not at the moment .
but yes , i would love to go back .
no matter what lies in front of you , you have to try .
you ca n't give up .
if you give up , you die .
even if not physically , then at least mentally you accept defeat .
and that is not a thing i 've been trained to do by my parents .
they always told me to keep trying and give 100 percent .

with just four matches to go , wolfsburg have 60 , three clear of champions bayern munich , who beat borussia moenchengladbach 2-1 .
hertha move up to third on 56 points , followed by vfb stuttgart and hamburg on 55 points .
although hertha started the brighter , it was hamburg who drew first blood when jansen steered ivica olic 's cross from the left into the far corner .
despite the early lead , martin jol 's side failed to take control and instead it was the visitors who continued to eke out the better chances in a flat-paced game .
marc stein tested frank rost in the hamburg goal with a shot from distance while rost also did well to turn away a cicero header on 32 minutes .
jansen registered hamburg 's first decent chance of the second period on 51 minutes with a header but jaroslav drobny saved well .
hertha equalized out of nothing on 66 minutes when kacar smashed the ball home from 28 metres out .
in a frantic finale , olic saw a shot saved by drobny , who also pulled off a fantastic reflex save from joris mathijsen to ensure a point for hertha .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 03.05.2009 threatened pakistani journalist vows to keep writing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meera jamal says she wo n't give up her writing a deutsche welle intern , forced to leave her home in pakistan after receiving death threats , gives details of her ordeal . pakistani journalist , meera jamal , fled to germany last october following a spate of threats in response to her articles .
after spending several months in a german refugee camp , the media watchdog group , reporters without borders helped secure her an internship in deutsche welle 's urdu-speaking news department .
dw : pakistan is considered one of the most dangerous countries for journalists .
what is your own experience ?
meera jamal : i suppose that is pretty much true .
the danger which is faced by the journalist is on two folds ; one is from the secret services .
you see a lot of incidents of journalists being harassed , beaten up , or killed by them .
and the other is the islamic radical groups .
why did you leave pakistan ?
it was pretty much because of the islamic radical group .
i was writing on the issues of women 's rights and basic human rights , in which you have to , at times , criticise certain norms or rules followed by the islamic clerics or created by them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal 's writing focussed on women 's rights in pakistan and this did n't go well with the islamic radial groups .
for example , on international women 's day , i wrote about a prostitute - a 56 year old woman whose children never knew she was a prostitute .
i thought that she was a great example of how a woman can sacrifice herself in order to support her children .
that was really looked down upon .
the other example was my series of articles on women 's rights , for example the right of divorce , the right of separation , the right of child custody .
how were you threatened ?
initially it was phone calls , then it went on to be doubled by letters .
then , in august 2008 , i was stopped by four men on my way to work , which really scared me .
they threatened me , for my life .
it was really scary .
i felt so much in danger for myself and i felt like i was putting my family at risk .
i was totally shattered actually because of it .
you lived in karachi at the time , what do you think would have happened if you had stayed on in pakistan , despite the threats ?
i suppose these people are really unpredictable .
there are incidents where they can throw acid on you , or they can ambush you .
they can do anything .
being a woman , it 's the most difficult thing .
there 's a particular kind of asian mentality , where a woman represents the entire family 's moral standing in the society .
and if anything goes bad with the woman , the entire family would be defamed .
it 's pretty much difficult for you to combat that , and being a woman , it was horrible for me .
so they could have maybe killed you ?
yes , but killing is the easiest part .
your family and your defamation for your family , that 's the horrible part .
i think i would never want to have that happen to them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal describes herself as a " non-believer " do you think the fact that you were a woman reporting about women 's issues , was that the most enraging bit to the people who threatened you ?
or was it the issues you reported about ?
it was the issues , it was me being a woman and writing about such issues , instigating other woman and convincing them of my ideas .
it was partly because of my personal life as well , because i am a non-believer , which catches attention a lot .
" she 's a non-believer and she 's writing to defame islam " .
so these kinds of things triggered them off .
what triggered you in a situation that 's so difficult for journalists , to join the profession ?
actually , you feel very much satisfied when you are doing something that can improve society , or at least you feel that it can bring a change , even a little bit .
for instance , the write-ups i 've done are basically on social issues , human rights .
when you go and talk to the people and get feedback , that people are reading you and appreciate that woman .
there were instances when i got calls from people who wanted to help .
so when i get such responses , it makes you feel on top of the world .
that you are actually doing something , your pieces make a difference .
that 's what keeps you going .
it 's very intoxicating .
so it must have been very frustrating to come to germany as a refugee and at the beginning not to be able to work ?
it was more than frustration in the beginning , because you are totally isolated , you do n't have friends or family and it makes you feel like you are isolated from the rest of the world .
journalism becomes part of your digestive system , as you can say .
you read the news and it keeps you going , it runs in your blood .
so once you are taken out of that , you feel very much dehydrated for news .
so after spending some months in the refugee camp , you 've joined deutsche welle for a few months .
what do you think the future will be like ?
would you like to return to pakistan at some time or is that not an option at the moment ?
it is not the option at the moment , because i do n't want to put my family back at risk .
i do n't want to put myself back at risk .
so not at the moment .
but yes , i would love to go back .
no matter what lies in front of you , you have to try .
you ca n't give up .
if you give up , you die .
even if not physically , then at least mentally you accept defeat .
and that is not a thing i 've been trained to do by my parents .
they always told me to keep trying and give 100 percent .

" germany has to make its own assessment , " foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner told reporters in berlin .
an interior ministry spokesman added that " every decision is concerned with the individual case . " government officials also said that washington had drawn up an initial list of candidates slated for release , however they declined to say how many names were on the list under an agreement with the us administration to keep that information confidential . the spokesman added that the ministry would make its decisions on a case-by-case basis in consultation with other eu countries and officials from germany 's 16 federal states . he said that the criteria were related to german foreign residency law and would consider whether a detainee posed a security threat to germany . uighur reports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are 241 prisoners left at the guantanamo bay detention center der spiegel news magazine reported on saturday that up to 10 so-called non-dangerous captives were being considered for release in europe . german daily newspaper bild reported that the request concerned 10 chinese ethnic uighurs , who are viewed by beijing as " chinese terrorists . "
munich , in the southern german state bavaria , is home to around 500 uighurs , the largest known community in exile . but bavaria 's interior minister joachim herrmann told bild his state would not offer its " candidacy to welcome these people . "
most of the 17 uighurs held at guantanamo have been cleared of being enemy combatants . officials say it will be critical for the german government to be assured that none of the released prisoners have ties to terrorist networks .
us officials will also have to explain why the prisoners can not be sent back to their home countries or settled in the us . around 50 detainees are unable to return to their homelands because of the danger that they will be tortured there . government divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd and cdu appear to be on a collision course over accepting guantanamo inmates us president barack obama fulfilled one of his campaign promises in the first days of his presidency by ordering the closure of the controversial detention center on the cuban coast . now he must decide what to do with the 241 remaining prisoners . us attorney general eric holder said in berlin last week that washington would soon like to release 30 prisoners . while other european nations , including france and portugal , have indicated they are willing to accept guantanamo prisoners , germany 's fractious left-right government is at odds over the issue . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat running for chancellor this year , said in an open letter to obama in january that germany would be willing to take in detainees if it helped him close guantanamo . but the conservative interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said obama could not expect germany to accept freed inmates . according to bild , schaeuble wants first to exhaust all possibilities of their being resettled within the united states . dfm / hf / nrt / tt / rm , ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she tracks down everything from van goghs to james bond 's 1963 aston martin . when victorine stille gets a call from an art collector about a stolen work , the first thing she does is enter the crucial details - like artist , year and frame color - in the so-called art loss register . the central databank was founded in london in 1991 and branched have since been added in new york , amsterdam , paris and cologne - where stille works . " what often happens is that , after it 's stolen , a work circulates through the black market for about two to three years , " said the art detective .
" we have a theory that they turn up again after about 15 years . " long-lost paintings might resurface at art auctions or fairs .
but for the rightful owners , 15 years is too long to wait . cross-check at art fairs aiming to speed up the recovery process , stille , who studied art management in amsterdam , spends much of her work day researching on the internet , scanning art auctions ' web sites .
she also attends sundry exhibitions and art fairs . " we visit art dealers ' stands at fairs to protect them and their reputations , and also to protect the participants from buying stolen art , " said the professional sleuth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : james bond had to get a new car after his was stolen in 1997 while she 's there , she checks the works on display against the art loss register to see if any have been reported as stolen . art thieves apparently prefer paintings , but the register also contains antiques , watches and furniture . stolen art on four wheels " we even have a james bond old-timer in our databank , " said stille .
" it 's a 1963 aston martin and was stolen in 1997 during filming .
it was used in both goldfinger and thunderball . " she compared the car to " the scream " by norwegian artist edvard munch , which was stolen from an oslo museum in 2006 and recovered two years later : " those are items that can never be sold , " she said . unlike munch 's masterpiece , the aston martin is still at large - though stille said suspects the thief is more likely to be driving the car around rather than hiding it in a garage somewhere . though the art detective and her colleagues are unlikely to spot james bond 's pride and joy on the way to the supermarket , they do have to rely sometimes on coincidence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 03.05.2009 threatened pakistani journalist vows to keep writing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meera jamal says she wo n't give up her writing a deutsche welle intern , forced to leave her home in pakistan after receiving death threats , gives details of her ordeal . pakistani journalist , meera jamal , fled to germany last october following a spate of threats in response to her articles .
after spending several months in a german refugee camp , the media watchdog group , reporters without borders helped secure her an internship in deutsche welle 's urdu-speaking news department .
dw : pakistan is considered one of the most dangerous countries for journalists .
what is your own experience ?
meera jamal : i suppose that is pretty much true .
the danger which is faced by the journalist is on two folds ; one is from the secret services .
you see a lot of incidents of journalists being harassed , beaten up , or killed by them .
and the other is the islamic radical groups .
why did you leave pakistan ?
it was pretty much because of the islamic radical group .
i was writing on the issues of women 's rights and basic human rights , in which you have to , at times , criticise certain norms or rules followed by the islamic clerics or created by them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal 's writing focussed on women 's rights in pakistan and this did n't go well with the islamic radial groups .
for example , on international women 's day , i wrote about a prostitute - a 56 year old woman whose children never knew she was a prostitute .
i thought that she was a great example of how a woman can sacrifice herself in order to support her children .
that was really looked down upon .
the other example was my series of articles on women 's rights , for example the right of divorce , the right of separation , the right of child custody .
how were you threatened ?
initially it was phone calls , then it went on to be doubled by letters .
then , in august 2008 , i was stopped by four men on my way to work , which really scared me .
they threatened me , for my life .
it was really scary .
i felt so much in danger for myself and i felt like i was putting my family at risk .
i was totally shattered actually because of it .
you lived in karachi at the time , what do you think would have happened if you had stayed on in pakistan , despite the threats ?
i suppose these people are really unpredictable .
there are incidents where they can throw acid on you , or they can ambush you .
they can do anything .
being a woman , it 's the most difficult thing .
there 's a particular kind of asian mentality , where a woman represents the entire family 's moral standing in the society .
and if anything goes bad with the woman , the entire family would be defamed .
it 's pretty much difficult for you to combat that , and being a woman , it was horrible for me .
so they could have maybe killed you ?
yes , but killing is the easiest part .
your family and your defamation for your family , that 's the horrible part .
i think i would never want to have that happen to them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal describes herself as a " non-believer " do you think the fact that you were a woman reporting about women 's issues , was that the most enraging bit to the people who threatened you ?
or was it the issues you reported about ?
it was the issues , it was me being a woman and writing about such issues , instigating other woman and convincing them of my ideas .
it was partly because of my personal life as well , because i am a non-believer , which catches attention a lot .
" she 's a non-believer and she 's writing to defame islam " .
so these kinds of things triggered them off .
what triggered you in a situation that 's so difficult for journalists , to join the profession ?
actually , you feel very much satisfied when you are doing something that can improve society , or at least you feel that it can bring a change , even a little bit .
for instance , the write-ups i 've done are basically on social issues , human rights .
when you go and talk to the people and get feedback , that people are reading you and appreciate that woman .
there were instances when i got calls from people who wanted to help .
so when i get such responses , it makes you feel on top of the world .
that you are actually doing something , your pieces make a difference .
that 's what keeps you going .
it 's very intoxicating .
so it must have been very frustrating to come to germany as a refugee and at the beginning not to be able to work ?
it was more than frustration in the beginning , because you are totally isolated , you do n't have friends or family and it makes you feel like you are isolated from the rest of the world .
journalism becomes part of your digestive system , as you can say .
you read the news and it keeps you going , it runs in your blood .
so once you are taken out of that , you feel very much dehydrated for news .
so after spending some months in the refugee camp , you 've joined deutsche welle for a few months .
what do you think the future will be like ?
would you like to return to pakistan at some time or is that not an option at the moment ?
it is not the option at the moment , because i do n't want to put my family back at risk .
i do n't want to put myself back at risk .
so not at the moment .
but yes , i would love to go back .
no matter what lies in front of you , you have to try .
you ca n't give up .
if you give up , you die .
even if not physically , then at least mentally you accept defeat .
and that is not a thing i 've been trained to do by my parents .
they always told me to keep trying and give 100 percent .

" germany has to make its own assessment , " foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner told reporters in berlin .
an interior ministry spokesman added that " every decision is concerned with the individual case . " government officials also said that washington had drawn up an initial list of candidates slated for release , however they declined to say how many names were on the list under an agreement with the us administration to keep that information confidential . the spokesman added that the ministry would make its decisions on a case-by-case basis in consultation with other eu countries and officials from germany 's 16 federal states . he said that the criteria were related to german foreign residency law and would consider whether a detainee posed a security threat to germany . uighur reports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are 241 prisoners left at the guantanamo bay detention center der spiegel news magazine reported on saturday that up to 10 so-called non-dangerous captives were being considered for release in europe . german daily newspaper bild reported that the request concerned 10 chinese ethnic uighurs , who are viewed by beijing as " chinese terrorists . "
munich , in the southern german state bavaria , is home to around 500 uighurs , the largest known community in exile . but bavaria 's interior minister joachim herrmann told bild his state would not offer its " candidacy to welcome these people . "

the iwh said the car scrapping incentive could burden the federal budget with 2,6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3,5 billion -rrb- . under the popular scheme , the government offers a 2,500-euro bonus to anyone who puts a car 9 years or older in the crusher and buys a new one . dirk niebel , secretary-general of the business-friendly free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , called the incentive " expensive junk . "
the berlin government , he told welt am sonntag , let itself be pushed into an expensive subsidy program by the automobile industry . but the finance ministry in berlin defended the project . " the idea was for somebody who needs a new car to buy it now and not wait till next year , " a spokesman said on sunday . germany earmarked 5 billion euros to fund the anti-recession program .

jansen registered hamburg 's first decent chance of the second period on 51 minutes with a header but jaroslav drobny saved well .
hertha equalized out of nothing on 66 minutes when kacar smashed the ball home from 28 metres out .
in a frantic finale , olic saw a shot saved by drobny , who also pulled off a fantastic reflex save from joris mathijsen to ensure a point for hertha .

" this is the 16th year the united nations has commemorated world press freedom day on may 3 .
in a statement marking the day , un secretary general ban ki-moon said that a free press played an important roll in solving the world 's problems and gave a voice to minorities .
ban called on all governments to ensure that the rights of journalists are respected .
according to the paris-based reporters without borders 60 journalists were killed and 929 were physically attacked or threatened in 2008 .
roughly a hundred journalists are currently imprisoned and ban said china , cuba and eritrea account for half of those cases .
heavy-handed governments may infringe upon the rights of the press themselves or they may turn a blind eye to attacks against journalists .
ban said he was “ alarmed at the way journalists are increasingly being targeted around the world , and dismayed when such crimes are not thoroughly investigated and prosecuted . ”
ban added that it was unacceptable that fear often led to journalists censoring themselves .
" journalists must be able to do their job free of intimidation and harassment , " he said .

us-iranian reporter roxana saberi was sentenced to eight years in prison last month in tehran on charges of spying for the us government .
in a statement observing world press freedom day , us president barack obama said he was “ especially concerned about the citizens from our own country currently under detention abroad . ”
obama said he was using the occasion to “ sound the alarm about the growing number of journalists silenced by death or jail as they attempt to bring daily news to the public . ”
posthumous award for murdered sri lankan the un cultural agency unesco is to posthumously award sri lankan journalist lasantha wickrematunga its 2009 press freedom prize for his work as a newspaper editor .

after spending several months in a german refugee camp , the media watchdog group , reporters without borders helped secure her an internship in deutsche welle 's urdu-speaking news department .
dw : pakistan is considered one of the most dangerous countries for journalists .
what is your own experience ?
meera jamal : i suppose that is pretty much true .
the danger which is faced by the journalist is on two folds ; one is from the secret services .
you see a lot of incidents of journalists being harassed , beaten up , or killed by them .
and the other is the islamic radical groups .
why did you leave pakistan ?
it was pretty much because of the islamic radical group .
i was writing on the issues of women 's rights and basic human rights , in which you have to , at times , criticise certain norms or rules followed by the islamic clerics or created by them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal 's writing focussed on women 's rights in pakistan and this did n't go well with the islamic radial groups .
for example , on international women 's day , i wrote about a prostitute - a 56 year old woman whose children never knew she was a prostitute .
i thought that she was a great example of how a woman can sacrifice herself in order to support her children .
that was really looked down upon .
the other example was my series of articles on women 's rights , for example the right of divorce , the right of separation , the right of child custody .
how were you threatened ?
initially it was phone calls , then it went on to be doubled by letters .
then , in august 2008 , i was stopped by four men on my way to work , which really scared me .
they threatened me , for my life .
it was really scary .
i felt so much in danger for myself and i felt like i was putting my family at risk .
i was totally shattered actually because of it .
you lived in karachi at the time , what do you think would have happened if you had stayed on in pakistan , despite the threats ?
i suppose these people are really unpredictable .
there are incidents where they can throw acid on you , or they can ambush you .
they can do anything .
being a woman , it 's the most difficult thing .
there 's a particular kind of asian mentality , where a woman represents the entire family 's moral standing in the society .
and if anything goes bad with the woman , the entire family would be defamed .
it 's pretty much difficult for you to combat that , and being a woman , it was horrible for me .
so they could have maybe killed you ?
yes , but killing is the easiest part .
your family and your defamation for your family , that 's the horrible part .
i think i would never want to have that happen to them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal describes herself as a " non-believer " do you think the fact that you were a woman reporting about women 's issues , was that the most enraging bit to the people who threatened you ?
or was it the issues you reported about ?
it was the issues , it was me being a woman and writing about such issues , instigating other woman and convincing them of my ideas .
it was partly because of my personal life as well , because i am a non-believer , which catches attention a lot .
" she 's a non-believer and she 's writing to defame islam " .
so these kinds of things triggered them off .
what triggered you in a situation that 's so difficult for journalists , to join the profession ?
actually , you feel very much satisfied when you are doing something that can improve society , or at least you feel that it can bring a change , even a little bit .
for instance , the write-ups i 've done are basically on social issues , human rights .
when you go and talk to the people and get feedback , that people are reading you and appreciate that woman .
there were instances when i got calls from people who wanted to help .
so when i get such responses , it makes you feel on top of the world .
that you are actually doing something , your pieces make a difference .
that 's what keeps you going .
it 's very intoxicating .
so it must have been very frustrating to come to germany as a refugee and at the beginning not to be able to work ?
it was more than frustration in the beginning , because you are totally isolated , you do n't have friends or family and it makes you feel like you are isolated from the rest of the world .
journalism becomes part of your digestive system , as you can say .
you read the news and it keeps you going , it runs in your blood .
so once you are taken out of that , you feel very much dehydrated for news .
so after spending some months in the refugee camp , you 've joined deutsche welle for a few months .
what do you think the future will be like ?
would you like to return to pakistan at some time or is that not an option at the moment ?
it is not the option at the moment , because i do n't want to put my family back at risk .
i do n't want to put myself back at risk .
so not at the moment .
but yes , i would love to go back .
no matter what lies in front of you , you have to try .
you ca n't give up .
if you give up , you die .
even if not physically , then at least mentally you accept defeat .
and that is not a thing i 've been trained to do by my parents .
they always told me to keep trying and give 100 percent .

after spending several months in a german refugee camp , the media watchdog group , reporters without borders helped secure her an internship in deutsche welle 's urdu-speaking news department .
dw : pakistan is considered one of the most dangerous countries for journalists .
what is your own experience ?
meera jamal : i suppose that is pretty much true .
the danger which is faced by the journalist is on two folds ; one is from the secret services .
you see a lot of incidents of journalists being harassed , beaten up , or killed by them .
and the other is the islamic radical groups .
why did you leave pakistan ?
it was pretty much because of the islamic radical group .
i was writing on the issues of women 's rights and basic human rights , in which you have to , at times , criticise certain norms or rules followed by the islamic clerics or created by them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal 's writing focussed on women 's rights in pakistan and this did n't go well with the islamic radial groups .
for example , on international women 's day , i wrote about a prostitute - a 56 year old woman whose children never knew she was a prostitute .
i thought that she was a great example of how a woman can sacrifice herself in order to support her children .
that was really looked down upon .
the other example was my series of articles on women 's rights , for example the right of divorce , the right of separation , the right of child custody .
how were you threatened ?
initially it was phone calls , then it went on to be doubled by letters .
then , in august 2008 , i was stopped by four men on my way to work , which really scared me .
they threatened me , for my life .
it was really scary .
i felt so much in danger for myself and i felt like i was putting my family at risk .
i was totally shattered actually because of it .
you lived in karachi at the time , what do you think would have happened if you had stayed on in pakistan , despite the threats ?
i suppose these people are really unpredictable .
there are incidents where they can throw acid on you , or they can ambush you .
they can do anything .
being a woman , it 's the most difficult thing .
there 's a particular kind of asian mentality , where a woman represents the entire family 's moral standing in the society .
and if anything goes bad with the woman , the entire family would be defamed .
it 's pretty much difficult for you to combat that , and being a woman , it was horrible for me .
so they could have maybe killed you ?
yes , but killing is the easiest part .
your family and your defamation for your family , that 's the horrible part .
i think i would never want to have that happen to them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal describes herself as a " non-believer " do you think the fact that you were a woman reporting about women 's issues , was that the most enraging bit to the people who threatened you ?
or was it the issues you reported about ?
it was the issues , it was me being a woman and writing about such issues , instigating other woman and convincing them of my ideas .
it was partly because of my personal life as well , because i am a non-believer , which catches attention a lot .
" she 's a non-believer and she 's writing to defame islam " .
so these kinds of things triggered them off .
what triggered you in a situation that 's so difficult for journalists , to join the profession ?
actually , you feel very much satisfied when you are doing something that can improve society , or at least you feel that it can bring a change , even a little bit .
for instance , the write-ups i 've done are basically on social issues , human rights .
when you go and talk to the people and get feedback , that people are reading you and appreciate that woman .
there were instances when i got calls from people who wanted to help .
so when i get such responses , it makes you feel on top of the world .
that you are actually doing something , your pieces make a difference .
that 's what keeps you going .
it 's very intoxicating .
so it must have been very frustrating to come to germany as a refugee and at the beginning not to be able to work ?
it was more than frustration in the beginning , because you are totally isolated , you do n't have friends or family and it makes you feel like you are isolated from the rest of the world .
journalism becomes part of your digestive system , as you can say .
you read the news and it keeps you going , it runs in your blood .
so once you are taken out of that , you feel very much dehydrated for news .
so after spending some months in the refugee camp , you 've joined deutsche welle for a few months .
what do you think the future will be like ?
would you like to return to pakistan at some time or is that not an option at the moment ?
it is not the option at the moment , because i do n't want to put my family back at risk .
i do n't want to put myself back at risk .
so not at the moment .
but yes , i would love to go back .
no matter what lies in front of you , you have to try .
you ca n't give up .
if you give up , you die .
even if not physically , then at least mentally you accept defeat .
and that is not a thing i 've been trained to do by my parents .
they always told me to keep trying and give 100 percent .

after spending several months in a german refugee camp , the media watchdog group , reporters without borders helped secure her an internship in deutsche welle 's urdu-speaking news department .
dw : pakistan is considered one of the most dangerous countries for journalists .
what is your own experience ?
meera jamal : i suppose that is pretty much true .
the danger which is faced by the journalist is on two folds ; one is from the secret services .
you see a lot of incidents of journalists being harassed , beaten up , or killed by them .
and the other is the islamic radical groups .
why did you leave pakistan ?
it was pretty much because of the islamic radical group .
i was writing on the issues of women 's rights and basic human rights , in which you have to , at times , criticise certain norms or rules followed by the islamic clerics or created by them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal 's writing focussed on women 's rights in pakistan and this did n't go well with the islamic radial groups .
for example , on international women 's day , i wrote about a prostitute - a 56 year old woman whose children never knew she was a prostitute .
i thought that she was a great example of how a woman can sacrifice herself in order to support her children .
that was really looked down upon .
the other example was my series of articles on women 's rights , for example the right of divorce , the right of separation , the right of child custody .
how were you threatened ?
initially it was phone calls , then it went on to be doubled by letters .
then , in august 2008 , i was stopped by four men on my way to work , which really scared me .
they threatened me , for my life .
it was really scary .
i felt so much in danger for myself and i felt like i was putting my family at risk .
i was totally shattered actually because of it .
you lived in karachi at the time , what do you think would have happened if you had stayed on in pakistan , despite the threats ?
i suppose these people are really unpredictable .
there are incidents where they can throw acid on you , or they can ambush you .
they can do anything .
being a woman , it 's the most difficult thing .
there 's a particular kind of asian mentality , where a woman represents the entire family 's moral standing in the society .
and if anything goes bad with the woman , the entire family would be defamed .
it 's pretty much difficult for you to combat that , and being a woman , it was horrible for me .
so they could have maybe killed you ?
yes , but killing is the easiest part .
your family and your defamation for your family , that 's the horrible part .
i think i would never want to have that happen to them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal describes herself as a " non-believer " do you think the fact that you were a woman reporting about women 's issues , was that the most enraging bit to the people who threatened you ?
or was it the issues you reported about ?
it was the issues , it was me being a woman and writing about such issues , instigating other woman and convincing them of my ideas .
it was partly because of my personal life as well , because i am a non-believer , which catches attention a lot .
" she 's a non-believer and she 's writing to defame islam " .
so these kinds of things triggered them off .
what triggered you in a situation that 's so difficult for journalists , to join the profession ?
actually , you feel very much satisfied when you are doing something that can improve society , or at least you feel that it can bring a change , even a little bit .
for instance , the write-ups i 've done are basically on social issues , human rights .
when you go and talk to the people and get feedback , that people are reading you and appreciate that woman .
there were instances when i got calls from people who wanted to help .
so when i get such responses , it makes you feel on top of the world .
that you are actually doing something , your pieces make a difference .
that 's what keeps you going .
it 's very intoxicating .
so it must have been very frustrating to come to germany as a refugee and at the beginning not to be able to work ?
it was more than frustration in the beginning , because you are totally isolated , you do n't have friends or family and it makes you feel like you are isolated from the rest of the world .
journalism becomes part of your digestive system , as you can say .
you read the news and it keeps you going , it runs in your blood .
so once you are taken out of that , you feel very much dehydrated for news .
so after spending some months in the refugee camp , you 've joined deutsche welle for a few months .
what do you think the future will be like ?
would you like to return to pakistan at some time or is that not an option at the moment ?
it is not the option at the moment , because i do n't want to put my family back at risk .
i do n't want to put myself back at risk .
so not at the moment .
but yes , i would love to go back .
no matter what lies in front of you , you have to try .
you ca n't give up .
if you give up , you die .
even if not physically , then at least mentally you accept defeat .
and that is not a thing i 've been trained to do by my parents .
they always told me to keep trying and give 100 percent .

the head of germany ’ s police union -lrb- gdp -rrb- , konrad freiberg said the situation has proven this is a new breed of violence .
" it ’ s just a question of time until someone gets killed , " he said .
" the far-right people view the police as their new target of hatred .
they prey on the police and are trying to start violent riots . "
freiberg said he expects the risk for riot police is going to increase . the social democrats politician , ehrhard koerting , echoing the message , said , " the climate has gotten more rough " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rioters set fires in hamburg violence around the country elsewhere in germany , protests turned violent in the cities of hamburg , dortmund , mainz , verden and ulm . in hamburg , rioters and police battled for hours .

there were no injuries or arrests . more than 4,000 police officers were deployed in central athens to prevent violence , in an attempt to prevent greece saw its worst riots in decades in december which were fuelled by discontent with a slowing economy and high youth unemployment . unemployment is rising for the first time since 2004 in greece as the economy slows and , according to forecasts from the international monetary fund , may even contract in 2009 for the first time in 15 years . united rallies in france bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ' sans papiers ' demands changes in french law to permit the legalisation of undocumented workers in france - where massive rallies have already been held on numerous occasions this year - protests on may day were largely peaceful . unions estimate some 1.2 million took part in 300 marches nationwide , although police said the figure was only 465,000 . in what were the first united may day rallies since the end of world war two , the leaders of the country 's eight main unions linked arms to lead the demonstrators through paris . with france 's left-wing opposition , the union leaders jointly called for the day to be turned into a " historic " protest to demand that president sarkozy 's government arrange more help for workers and families hit by the slowdown . even staff in management positions joined the marches .

union leaders did not rule out a general strike if the unions were not invited to be involved in a dialogue over how to revive the economy . meanwhile , italian union leaders held their rally in the town of l 'aquila , in a show of solidarity after an earthquake there killed nearly 300 people in early april .

" he will ask that the europeans wait a bit until the government presents its new policy , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman yigal palmor told news agency afp . lieberman is also to meet with italian , french and czech representatives in the first official visit abroad by a member of the new right-wing israeli government . visible progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lieberman has triggered controversy over his virulently anti-arab stance the hardliner is seeking to block voices within the european union calling for a freeze in upgrading israel-eu ties unless progress is made in peace talks between the coalition government of prime minister benjamin netanyahu and the palestinians . italian foreign minister franco frattini told yediot ahronot that if israel wanted to continue enjoying rome 's support in europe , it had to take " suitable positions " and declare its support for a continuation of the peace process . frattini also called on the blunt-speaking lieberman to " lower the tone " of his declarations and to " work towards an atmosphere of cooperation . " lieberman will meet with his french counterpart bernard kouchner on tuesday , but a meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy has not been confirmed . " i am not saying that it 's a condition , but it would be favorable if avigdor lieberman in the very least adheres to the decisions taken by the international community , " claude gueant , sarkozy 's chief of staff , told french radio . he is scheduled to meet with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in berlin on thursday . controversial beginnings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu 's coalition is yet to endorse a two-state solution lieberman , head of a nationalist party in netanyahu 's coalition , caused a stir on his first day as foreign minister when he announced that israel was no longer bound by the so-called annapolis peace process , which formed the basis of israeli-palestinian peace talks in 2008 . netanyahu has so far refused to publicly endorse the idea of a two-state solution that would see the creation of a palestinian state . instead , lieberman said , israel was prepared to adhere only to the roadmap peace plan , a performance-based initiative from 2003 . israel recently warned the eu to tone down its criticism of netanyahu 's cabinet or risk losing a role in the middle east peace process . dfm / tt , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany has to make its own assessment , " foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner told reporters in berlin .
an interior ministry spokesman added that " every decision is concerned with the individual case . " government officials also said that washington had drawn up an initial list of candidates slated for release , however they declined to say how many names were on the list under an agreement with the us administration to keep that information confidential . the spokesman added that the ministry would make its decisions on a case-by-case basis in consultation with other eu countries and officials from germany 's 16 federal states . he said that the criteria were related to german foreign residency law and would consider whether a detainee posed a security threat to germany . uighur reports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are 241 prisoners left at the guantanamo bay detention center der spiegel news magazine reported on saturday that up to 10 so-called non-dangerous captives were being considered for release in europe . german daily newspaper bild reported that the request concerned 10 chinese ethnic uighurs , who are viewed by beijing as " chinese terrorists . "
munich , in the southern german state bavaria , is home to around 500 uighurs , the largest known community in exile . but bavaria 's interior minister joachim herrmann told bild his state would not offer its " candidacy to welcome these people . "
most of the 17 uighurs held at guantanamo have been cleared of being enemy combatants . officials say it will be critical for the german government to be assured that none of the released prisoners have ties to terrorist networks .
us officials will also have to explain why the prisoners can not be sent back to their home countries or settled in the us . around 50 detainees are unable to return to their homelands because of the danger that they will be tortured there . government divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd and cdu appear to be on a collision course over accepting guantanamo inmates us president barack obama fulfilled one of his campaign promises in the first days of his presidency by ordering the closure of the controversial detention center on the cuban coast . now he must decide what to do with the 241 remaining prisoners . us attorney general eric holder said in berlin last week that washington would soon like to release 30 prisoners . while other european nations , including france and portugal , have indicated they are willing to accept guantanamo prisoners , germany 's fractious left-right government is at odds over the issue . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat running for chancellor this year , said in an open letter to obama in january that germany would be willing to take in detainees if it helped him close guantanamo . but the conservative interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said obama could not expect germany to accept freed inmates . according to bild , schaeuble wants first to exhaust all possibilities of their being resettled within the united states . dfm / hf / nrt / tt / rm , ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after spending several months in a german refugee camp , the media watchdog group , reporters without borders helped secure her an internship in deutsche welle 's urdu-speaking news department .
dw : pakistan is considered one of the most dangerous countries for journalists .
what is your own experience ?
meera jamal : i suppose that is pretty much true .
the danger which is faced by the journalist is on two folds ; one is from the secret services .
you see a lot of incidents of journalists being harassed , beaten up , or killed by them .
and the other is the islamic radical groups .
why did you leave pakistan ?
it was pretty much because of the islamic radical group .
i was writing on the issues of women 's rights and basic human rights , in which you have to , at times , criticise certain norms or rules followed by the islamic clerics or created by them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal 's writing focussed on women 's rights in pakistan and this did n't go well with the islamic radial groups .
for example , on international women 's day , i wrote about a prostitute - a 56 year old woman whose children never knew she was a prostitute .
i thought that she was a great example of how a woman can sacrifice herself in order to support her children .
that was really looked down upon .
the other example was my series of articles on women 's rights , for example the right of divorce , the right of separation , the right of child custody .
how were you threatened ?
initially it was phone calls , then it went on to be doubled by letters .
then , in august 2008 , i was stopped by four men on my way to work , which really scared me .
they threatened me , for my life .
it was really scary .
i felt so much in danger for myself and i felt like i was putting my family at risk .
i was totally shattered actually because of it .
you lived in karachi at the time , what do you think would have happened if you had stayed on in pakistan , despite the threats ?
i suppose these people are really unpredictable .
there are incidents where they can throw acid on you , or they can ambush you .
they can do anything .
being a woman , it 's the most difficult thing .
there 's a particular kind of asian mentality , where a woman represents the entire family 's moral standing in the society .
and if anything goes bad with the woman , the entire family would be defamed .
it 's pretty much difficult for you to combat that , and being a woman , it was horrible for me .
so they could have maybe killed you ?
yes , but killing is the easiest part .
your family and your defamation for your family , that 's the horrible part .
i think i would never want to have that happen to them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal describes herself as a " non-believer " do you think the fact that you were a woman reporting about women 's issues , was that the most enraging bit to the people who threatened you ?
or was it the issues you reported about ?
it was the issues , it was me being a woman and writing about such issues , instigating other woman and convincing them of my ideas .
it was partly because of my personal life as well , because i am a non-believer , which catches attention a lot .
" she 's a non-believer and she 's writing to defame islam " .
so these kinds of things triggered them off .
what triggered you in a situation that 's so difficult for journalists , to join the profession ?
actually , you feel very much satisfied when you are doing something that can improve society , or at least you feel that it can bring a change , even a little bit .
for instance , the write-ups i 've done are basically on social issues , human rights .
when you go and talk to the people and get feedback , that people are reading you and appreciate that woman .
there were instances when i got calls from people who wanted to help .
so when i get such responses , it makes you feel on top of the world .
that you are actually doing something , your pieces make a difference .
that 's what keeps you going .
it 's very intoxicating .
so it must have been very frustrating to come to germany as a refugee and at the beginning not to be able to work ?
it was more than frustration in the beginning , because you are totally isolated , you do n't have friends or family and it makes you feel like you are isolated from the rest of the world .
journalism becomes part of your digestive system , as you can say .
you read the news and it keeps you going , it runs in your blood .
so once you are taken out of that , you feel very much dehydrated for news .
so after spending some months in the refugee camp , you 've joined deutsche welle for a few months .
what do you think the future will be like ?
would you like to return to pakistan at some time or is that not an option at the moment ?
it is not the option at the moment , because i do n't want to put my family back at risk .
i do n't want to put myself back at risk .
so not at the moment .
but yes , i would love to go back .
no matter what lies in front of you , you have to try .
you ca n't give up .
if you give up , you die .
even if not physically , then at least mentally you accept defeat .
and that is not a thing i 've been trained to do by my parents .
they always told me to keep trying and give 100 percent .

" germany has to make its own assessment , " foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner told reporters in berlin .
an interior ministry spokesman added that " every decision is concerned with the individual case . " government officials also said that washington had drawn up an initial list of candidates slated for release , however they declined to say how many names were on the list under an agreement with the us administration to keep that information confidential . the spokesman added that the ministry would make its decisions on a case-by-case basis in consultation with other eu countries and officials from germany 's 16 federal states . he said that the criteria were related to german foreign residency law and would consider whether a detainee posed a security threat to germany . uighur reports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are 241 prisoners left at the guantanamo bay detention center der spiegel news magazine reported on saturday that up to 10 so-called non-dangerous captives were being considered for release in europe . german daily newspaper bild reported that the request concerned 10 chinese ethnic uighurs , who are viewed by beijing as " chinese terrorists . "
munich , in the southern german state bavaria , is home to around 500 uighurs , the largest known community in exile . but bavaria 's interior minister joachim herrmann told bild his state would not offer its " candidacy to welcome these people . "
most of the 17 uighurs held at guantanamo have been cleared of being enemy combatants . officials say it will be critical for the german government to be assured that none of the released prisoners have ties to terrorist networks .
us officials will also have to explain why the prisoners can not be sent back to their home countries or settled in the us . around 50 detainees are unable to return to their homelands because of the danger that they will be tortured there . government divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd and cdu appear to be on a collision course over accepting guantanamo inmates us president barack obama fulfilled one of his campaign promises in the first days of his presidency by ordering the closure of the controversial detention center on the cuban coast . now he must decide what to do with the 241 remaining prisoners . us attorney general eric holder said in berlin last week that washington would soon like to release 30 prisoners . while other european nations , including france and portugal , have indicated they are willing to accept guantanamo prisoners , germany 's fractious left-right government is at odds over the issue . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat running for chancellor this year , said in an open letter to obama in january that germany would be willing to take in detainees if it helped him close guantanamo . but the conservative interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said obama could not expect germany to accept freed inmates . according to bild , schaeuble wants first to exhaust all possibilities of their being resettled within the united states . dfm / hf / nrt / tt / rm , ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she tracks down everything from van goghs to james bond 's 1963 aston martin . when victorine stille gets a call from an art collector about a stolen work , the first thing she does is enter the crucial details - like artist , year and frame color - in the so-called art loss register . the central databank was founded in london in 1991 and branched have since been added in new york , amsterdam , paris and cologne - where stille works . " what often happens is that , after it 's stolen , a work circulates through the black market for about two to three years , " said the art detective .
" we have a theory that they turn up again after about 15 years . " long-lost paintings might resurface at art auctions or fairs .
but for the rightful owners , 15 years is too long to wait . cross-check at art fairs aiming to speed up the recovery process , stille , who studied art management in amsterdam , spends much of her work day researching on the internet , scanning art auctions ' web sites .
she also attends sundry exhibitions and art fairs . " we visit art dealers ' stands at fairs to protect them and their reputations , and also to protect the participants from buying stolen art , " said the professional sleuth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : james bond had to get a new car after his was stolen in 1997 while she 's there , she checks the works on display against the art loss register to see if any have been reported as stolen . art thieves apparently prefer paintings , but the register also contains antiques , watches and furniture . stolen art on four wheels " we even have a james bond old-timer in our databank , " said stille .
" it 's a 1963 aston martin and was stolen in 1997 during filming .
it was used in both goldfinger and thunderball . " she compared the car to " the scream " by norwegian artist edvard munch , which was stolen from an oslo museum in 2006 and recovered two years later : " those are items that can never be sold , " she said . unlike munch 's masterpiece , the aston martin is still at large - though stille said suspects the thief is more likely to be driving the car around rather than hiding it in a garage somewhere . though the art detective and her colleagues are unlikely to spot james bond 's pride and joy on the way to the supermarket , they do have to rely sometimes on coincidence . " it 's a combination of being active and passive , " said stille .
" sometimes people just call us up and say , hey we saw this or that , or we know about a piece .
but we also actively look through auction catalogues and auction houses . " art dealers , collectors or buyers are also welcome to check the stolen art databank before investing in a piece . so far , stille and her team have recovered 230 million euros -lrb- us $ 304 million -rrb- worth of art .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de civil rights -pipe- 03.05.2009 a trip to burma reveals a black hole of information großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside the pagodas , there 's more need than splendor one year ago , cyclone nargis devastated the southeast asian country of burma , but authorities have largely ignored the anniversary .
as dw reporter andreas illmer writes , burma has a long way to go to reach democracy . getting off the plane at rangoon -lrb- yangon -rrb- airport feels like stepping into a different world .
after making it past immigration control , i soon find myself in a taxi driving past a faded billboard reading " welcome to the golden land . "
the first impression is one of stark poverty .
coming from the buzzing metropolis that is thailand 's capital , bangkok , rangoon - although a city of 4 million - looks like little more than a sad provincial town , run-down and desolate .
in the early hours of morning only few people are around , trudging along the sidewalk or waiting for a bus .
there are some bicycles and a few cars - old and battered japanese models .
the country has been on a downward slope for most of the years since it gained independence from britain in 1948 .
after just over one decade of democracy , a military coup in 1962 brought a military junta to power , brutally steering the country on to the " burmese way to socialism " .
for the people , this was not good news .
today , the country ranks amongst the poorest in the world .
" our government is afraid of the students , very afraid . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's plenty of local food on offer , but prices are steep for my few days in burma -lrb- myanmar -rrb- , i have an english-speaking taxi driver provided by the airport 's tourist authorities .
he 's polite but very reserved and i avoid questions about the political situation - i do n't want to get myself into trouble , nor do i want to put him in an uncomfortable situation .
but then , one night , i catch a taxi on the road to get back to my hotel , and the driver seems curious to talk to me .
driving past a building that looks a bit like a university compound , i ask him about the country 's schools and higher education .
" there are few universities in the big towns , " he says in broken english .
he hesitates and then adds : " most universities are in the countryside , in small towns .
our government is very afraid of the students , very afraid .
there have been many demonstrations in the past . "
in 1988 , mounting discontent with the political leadership led to widespread protests across the country .
security forces killed thousands to stifle the popular uprising .
the last anti-government protests date back to only 2007 .
led by buddhist monks , the demonstrations were initially tolerated , but eventually the government launched yet another brutal crackdown .
aung san suu kyi ?
" popular , yes .
very popular . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi remains under house arrest " demonstrations ? "
i ask .
" demonstrations , " he confirms , turning his head to look at me sitting in the backseat .
i ask about aung san suu kyi , tell him that we hear a lot about her in the international media .
is she still popular amongst the people ?
" popular , yes .
very popular . "
his voice sounds excited , a suppressed tension as if he 's been burning to spell that out .
at the same time i am very aware that such a statement expressed to a foreigner could get him into serious trouble .
" she lives close to your hotel , " he says .
" on the other side of the lake .
but it 's not good to go there , you are not allowed to take a photograph of the house . "
aung san suu kyi is the head of the opposition national league for democracy .
in the country 's only free elections in 1990 she won a landslide victory .
but the ruling military junta dismissed the results and placed the politician under house arrest , where she 's been for most of the last 19 years .
in 1991 she was awarded the nobel peace prize .
forty dollars a month to live on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is not an uncommon sight in rural areas the next day the april heat is almost unbearable , it 's around 40 degrees celsius spiced with humidity and dust weighing down every single step in the afternoon sun .
street markets have a wide array of food on offer , there are even a few shops stacked with goods imported from the west or from the neighboring asian countries .
a look at the prices reveals that most of these things are far beyond reach for the normal population .
" oh , salaries are low in myanmar , very low , " my driver tells me when i ask about the average wage .
" a normal man will earn maybe 40 us dollars per month .
it 's difficult . "
he hints that there are many other things that you need money for besides food - corruption and the black market are thriving .
i see more of the country 's poverty on a trip through the countryside .
villages consist of little more than wooden huts , bicycles are probably the most common means of transportation , old cars and horse and ox carriages make their slow way along the sandy dirt roads .
the people look at foreigners with shy curiosity .
although there now is some degree of tourism , i do n't meet a single foreigner outside rangoon .
for many decades the country was utterly isolated , with practically no visitors allowed in . in the 1990s , travel restrictions were eased with the hope that foreigners would bring in money .
the country 's buddhist monasteries and pagodas are among the most beautiful and impressive in the world .
a black hole of information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will eu pressure bring a better future for the young generation ?
getting information about burma from the outside is fairly easy .
there was extensive coverage when , on may 2-3 , 2008 , the country were devastated by cyclone nargis , leaving 138,000 people dead or missing .
according to aid agencies , at least 250,000 people will require food handouts until the end of 2009 as a result .
in march 2009 the united nation 's special investigator tomas ojea quintana called on burma 's ruling junta to release more than 2,100 political prisoners .
but if you were inside the country at the time , it 's unlikely that you would have heard about any of this .
paris-based media watchdog reporters without borders calls the country a " black hole " .
myanmar is among the bottom 10 countries of the organization 's world press freedom ranking .
trying to check e-mails , i can access neither yahoo nor gmail .
at the hotel , however , there 's the new light of myanmar , an english language newspaper singing the praises of senior general than shwe , the chief of the military regime .
rangoon used to be the capital of the country until , in 2005 , the junta decided it needed a safer place - somewhere in the middle of nowhere .
naypyidaw was built from scratch some 300 kilometers north of rangoon and declared the capital in 2006 .
sanctions to keep up the pressure international pressure and tensions from within forced the government to announce general elections for 2010 .
but little progress has been made so far .
the eu has criticized that no steps have been taken to make the upcoming elections a credible , transparent and inclusive process based on international standards .
the eu 's political and economic sanctions against myanmar have been in place since 2006 and were strengthened after the 2007 crackdown .
they include a travel ban on burma officials , an arms embargo and a freezing of assets .
this year , on april 27 , the eu decided to extend those measures for another 12 months .
by doing so , the foreign ministers of the 27 nation bloc hope to keep up the pressure .
they have however made it clear that the eu is ready to ease sanctions - should there be genuine , democratic progress .

" this is the 16th year the united nations has commemorated world press freedom day on may 3 .
in a statement marking the day , un secretary general ban ki-moon said that a free press played an important roll in solving the world 's problems and gave a voice to minorities .
ban called on all governments to ensure that the rights of journalists are respected .
according to the paris-based reporters without borders 60 journalists were killed and 929 were physically attacked or threatened in 2008 .
roughly a hundred journalists are currently imprisoned and ban said china , cuba and eritrea account for half of those cases .
heavy-handed governments may infringe upon the rights of the press themselves or they may turn a blind eye to attacks against journalists .
ban said he was “ alarmed at the way journalists are increasingly being targeted around the world , and dismayed when such crimes are not thoroughly investigated and prosecuted . ”
ban added that it was unacceptable that fear often led to journalists censoring themselves .
" journalists must be able to do their job free of intimidation and harassment , " he said .

us-iranian reporter roxana saberi was sentenced to eight years in prison last month in tehran on charges of spying for the us government .
in a statement observing world press freedom day , us president barack obama said he was “ especially concerned about the citizens from our own country currently under detention abroad . ”
obama said he was using the occasion to “ sound the alarm about the growing number of journalists silenced by death or jail as they attempt to bring daily news to the public . ”
posthumous award for murdered sri lankan the un cultural agency unesco is to posthumously award sri lankan journalist lasantha wickrematunga its 2009 press freedom prize for his work as a newspaper editor .

as dw reporter andreas illmer writes , burma has a long way to go to reach democracy . getting off the plane at rangoon -lrb- yangon -rrb- airport feels like stepping into a different world .
after making it past immigration control , i soon find myself in a taxi driving past a faded billboard reading " welcome to the golden land . "
the first impression is one of stark poverty .
coming from the buzzing metropolis that is thailand 's capital , bangkok , rangoon - although a city of 4 million - looks like little more than a sad provincial town , run-down and desolate .
in the early hours of morning only few people are around , trudging along the sidewalk or waiting for a bus .
there are some bicycles and a few cars - old and battered japanese models .
the country has been on a downward slope for most of the years since it gained independence from britain in 1948 .
after just over one decade of democracy , a military coup in 1962 brought a military junta to power , brutally steering the country on to the " burmese way to socialism " .
for the people , this was not good news .
today , the country ranks amongst the poorest in the world .
" our government is afraid of the students , very afraid . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's plenty of local food on offer , but prices are steep for my few days in burma -lrb- myanmar -rrb- , i have an english-speaking taxi driver provided by the airport 's tourist authorities .
he 's polite but very reserved and i avoid questions about the political situation - i do n't want to get myself into trouble , nor do i want to put him in an uncomfortable situation .
but then , one night , i catch a taxi on the road to get back to my hotel , and the driver seems curious to talk to me .
driving past a building that looks a bit like a university compound , i ask him about the country 's schools and higher education .
" there are few universities in the big towns , " he says in broken english .
he hesitates and then adds : " most universities are in the countryside , in small towns .
our government is very afraid of the students , very afraid .
there have been many demonstrations in the past . "
in 1988 , mounting discontent with the political leadership led to widespread protests across the country .
security forces killed thousands to stifle the popular uprising .
the last anti-government protests date back to only 2007 .
led by buddhist monks , the demonstrations were initially tolerated , but eventually the government launched yet another brutal crackdown .
aung san suu kyi ?
" popular , yes .
very popular . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi remains under house arrest " demonstrations ? "
i ask .
" demonstrations , " he confirms , turning his head to look at me sitting in the backseat .
i ask about aung san suu kyi , tell him that we hear a lot about her in the international media .
is she still popular amongst the people ?
" popular , yes .
very popular . "
his voice sounds excited , a suppressed tension as if he 's been burning to spell that out .
at the same time i am very aware that such a statement expressed to a foreigner could get him into serious trouble .
" she lives close to your hotel , " he says .
" on the other side of the lake .
but it 's not good to go there , you are not allowed to take a photograph of the house . "
aung san suu kyi is the head of the opposition national league for democracy .
in the country 's only free elections in 1990 she won a landslide victory .
but the ruling military junta dismissed the results and placed the politician under house arrest , where she 's been for most of the last 19 years .
in 1991 she was awarded the nobel peace prize .
forty dollars a month to live on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is not an uncommon sight in rural areas the next day the april heat is almost unbearable , it 's around 40 degrees celsius spiced with humidity and dust weighing down every single step in the afternoon sun .
street markets have a wide array of food on offer , there are even a few shops stacked with goods imported from the west or from the neighboring asian countries .
a look at the prices reveals that most of these things are far beyond reach for the normal population .
" oh , salaries are low in myanmar , very low , " my driver tells me when i ask about the average wage .
" a normal man will earn maybe 40 us dollars per month .
it 's difficult . "
he hints that there are many other things that you need money for besides food - corruption and the black market are thriving .
i see more of the country 's poverty on a trip through the countryside .
villages consist of little more than wooden huts , bicycles are probably the most common means of transportation , old cars and horse and ox carriages make their slow way along the sandy dirt roads .
the people look at foreigners with shy curiosity .
although there now is some degree of tourism , i do n't meet a single foreigner outside rangoon .
for many decades the country was utterly isolated , with practically no visitors allowed in . in the 1990s , travel restrictions were eased with the hope that foreigners would bring in money .
the country 's buddhist monasteries and pagodas are among the most beautiful and impressive in the world .
a black hole of information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will eu pressure bring a better future for the young generation ?
getting information about burma from the outside is fairly easy .
there was extensive coverage when , on may 2-3 , 2008 , the country were devastated by cyclone nargis , leaving 138,000 people dead or missing .
according to aid agencies , at least 250,000 people will require food handouts until the end of 2009 as a result .
in march 2009 the united nation 's special investigator tomas ojea quintana called on burma 's ruling junta to release more than 2,100 political prisoners .
but if you were inside the country at the time , it 's unlikely that you would have heard about any of this .
paris-based media watchdog reporters without borders calls the country a " black hole " .
myanmar is among the bottom 10 countries of the organization 's world press freedom ranking .
trying to check e-mails , i can access neither yahoo nor gmail .
at the hotel , however , there 's the new light of myanmar , an english language newspaper singing the praises of senior general than shwe , the chief of the military regime .
rangoon used to be the capital of the country until , in 2005 , the junta decided it needed a safer place - somewhere in the middle of nowhere .
naypyidaw was built from scratch some 300 kilometers north of rangoon and declared the capital in 2006 .
sanctions to keep up the pressure international pressure and tensions from within forced the government to announce general elections for 2010 .
but little progress has been made so far .
the eu has criticized that no steps have been taken to make the upcoming elections a credible , transparent and inclusive process based on international standards .
the eu 's political and economic sanctions against myanmar have been in place since 2006 and were strengthened after the 2007 crackdown .
they include a travel ban on burma officials , an arms embargo and a freezing of assets .
this year , on april 27 , the eu decided to extend those measures for another 12 months .
by doing so , the foreign ministers of the 27 nation bloc hope to keep up the pressure .
they have however made it clear that the eu is ready to ease sanctions - should there be genuine , democratic progress .

as dw reporter andreas illmer writes , burma has a long way to go to reach democracy . getting off the plane at rangoon -lrb- yangon -rrb- airport feels like stepping into a different world .
after making it past immigration control , i soon find myself in a taxi driving past a faded billboard reading " welcome to the golden land . "
the first impression is one of stark poverty .
coming from the buzzing metropolis that is thailand 's capital , bangkok , rangoon - although a city of 4 million - looks like little more than a sad provincial town , run-down and desolate .
in the early hours of morning only few people are around , trudging along the sidewalk or waiting for a bus .
there are some bicycles and a few cars - old and battered japanese models .
the country has been on a downward slope for most of the years since it gained independence from britain in 1948 .
after just over one decade of democracy , a military coup in 1962 brought a military junta to power , brutally steering the country on to the " burmese way to socialism " .
for the people , this was not good news .
today , the country ranks amongst the poorest in the world .

but then , one night , i catch a taxi on the road to get back to my hotel , and the driver seems curious to talk to me .
driving past a building that looks a bit like a university compound , i ask him about the country 's schools and higher education .
" there are few universities in the big towns , " he says in broken english .
he hesitates and then adds : " most universities are in the countryside , in small towns .
our government is very afraid of the students , very afraid .
there have been many demonstrations in the past . "
in 1988 , mounting discontent with the political leadership led to widespread protests across the country .
security forces killed thousands to stifle the popular uprising .
the last anti-government protests date back to only 2007 .
led by buddhist monks , the demonstrations were initially tolerated , but eventually the government launched yet another brutal crackdown .

" demonstrations , " he confirms , turning his head to look at me sitting in the backseat .
i ask about aung san suu kyi , tell him that we hear a lot about her in the international media .
is she still popular amongst the people ?
" popular , yes .
very popular . "
his voice sounds excited , a suppressed tension as if he 's been burning to spell that out .
at the same time i am very aware that such a statement expressed to a foreigner could get him into serious trouble .
" she lives close to your hotel , " he says .
" on the other side of the lake .
but it 's not good to go there , you are not allowed to take a photograph of the house . "
aung san suu kyi is the head of the opposition national league for democracy .
in the country 's only free elections in 1990 she won a landslide victory .
but the ruling military junta dismissed the results and placed the politician under house arrest , where she 's been for most of the last 19 years .
in 1991 she was awarded the nobel peace prize .

street markets have a wide array of food on offer , there are even a few shops stacked with goods imported from the west or from the neighboring asian countries .
a look at the prices reveals that most of these things are far beyond reach for the normal population .
" oh , salaries are low in myanmar , very low , " my driver tells me when i ask about the average wage .
" a normal man will earn maybe 40 us dollars per month .
it 's difficult . "
he hints that there are many other things that you need money for besides food - corruption and the black market are thriving .
i see more of the country 's poverty on a trip through the countryside .
villages consist of little more than wooden huts , bicycles are probably the most common means of transportation , old cars and horse and ox carriages make their slow way along the sandy dirt roads .
the people look at foreigners with shy curiosity .
although there now is some degree of tourism , i do n't meet a single foreigner outside rangoon .
for many decades the country was utterly isolated , with practically no visitors allowed in . in the 1990s , travel restrictions were eased with the hope that foreigners would bring in money .
the country 's buddhist monasteries and pagodas are among the most beautiful and impressive in the world .
a black hole of information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will eu pressure bring a better future for the young generation ?
getting information about burma from the outside is fairly easy .
there was extensive coverage when , on may 2-3 , 2008 , the country were devastated by cyclone nargis , leaving 138,000 people dead or missing .
according to aid agencies , at least 250,000 people will require food handouts until the end of 2009 as a result .
in march 2009 the united nation 's special investigator tomas ojea quintana called on burma 's ruling junta to release more than 2,100 political prisoners .
but if you were inside the country at the time , it 's unlikely that you would have heard about any of this .
paris-based media watchdog reporters without borders calls the country a " black hole " .
myanmar is among the bottom 10 countries of the organization 's world press freedom ranking .
trying to check e-mails , i can access neither yahoo nor gmail .
at the hotel , however , there 's the new light of myanmar , an english language newspaper singing the praises of senior general than shwe , the chief of the military regime .
rangoon used to be the capital of the country until , in 2005 , the junta decided it needed a safer place - somewhere in the middle of nowhere .
naypyidaw was built from scratch some 300 kilometers north of rangoon and declared the capital in 2006 .
sanctions to keep up the pressure international pressure and tensions from within forced the government to announce general elections for 2010 .
but little progress has been made so far .
the eu has criticized that no steps have been taken to make the upcoming elections a credible , transparent and inclusive process based on international standards .
the eu 's political and economic sanctions against myanmar have been in place since 2006 and were strengthened after the 2007 crackdown .
they include a travel ban on burma officials , an arms embargo and a freezing of assets .
this year , on april 27 , the eu decided to extend those measures for another 12 months .
by doing so , the foreign ministers of the 27 nation bloc hope to keep up the pressure .
they have however made it clear that the eu is ready to ease sanctions - should there be genuine , democratic progress .

as dw reporter andreas illmer writes , burma has a long way to go to reach democracy . getting off the plane at rangoon -lrb- yangon -rrb- airport feels like stepping into a different world .
after making it past immigration control , i soon find myself in a taxi driving past a faded billboard reading " welcome to the golden land . "
the first impression is one of stark poverty .
coming from the buzzing metropolis that is thailand 's capital , bangkok , rangoon - although a city of 4 million - looks like little more than a sad provincial town , run-down and desolate .
in the early hours of morning only few people are around , trudging along the sidewalk or waiting for a bus .
there are some bicycles and a few cars - old and battered japanese models .
the country has been on a downward slope for most of the years since it gained independence from britain in 1948 .
after just over one decade of democracy , a military coup in 1962 brought a military junta to power , brutally steering the country on to the " burmese way to socialism " .
for the people , this was not good news .
today , the country ranks amongst the poorest in the world .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's plenty of local food on offer , but prices are steep for my few days in burma -lrb- myanmar -rrb- , i have an english-speaking taxi driver provided by the airport 's tourist authorities .
he 's polite but very reserved and i avoid questions about the political situation - i do n't want to get myself into trouble , nor do i want to put him in an uncomfortable situation .
but then , one night , i catch a taxi on the road to get back to my hotel , and the driver seems curious to talk to me .
driving past a building that looks a bit like a university compound , i ask him about the country 's schools and higher education .
" there are few universities in the big towns , " he says in broken english .
he hesitates and then adds : " most universities are in the countryside , in small towns .
our government is very afraid of the students , very afraid .
there have been many demonstrations in the past . "
in 1988 , mounting discontent with the political leadership led to widespread protests across the country .
security forces killed thousands to stifle the popular uprising .

led by buddhist monks , the demonstrations were initially tolerated , but eventually the government launched yet another brutal crackdown .

led by buddhist monks , the demonstrations were initially tolerated , but eventually the government launched yet another brutal crackdown .
aung san suu kyi ?
" popular , yes .
very popular . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi remains under house arrest " demonstrations ? "
i ask .
" demonstrations , " he confirms , turning his head to look at me sitting in the backseat .
i ask about aung san suu kyi , tell him that we hear a lot about her in the international media .
is she still popular amongst the people ?
" popular , yes .
very popular . "
his voice sounds excited , a suppressed tension as if he 's been burning to spell that out .
at the same time i am very aware that such a statement expressed to a foreigner could get him into serious trouble .
" she lives close to your hotel , " he says .
" on the other side of the lake .
but it 's not good to go there , you are not allowed to take a photograph of the house . "
aung san suu kyi is the head of the opposition national league for democracy .
in the country 's only free elections in 1990 she won a landslide victory .
but the ruling military junta dismissed the results and placed the politician under house arrest , where she 's been for most of the last 19 years .
in 1991 she was awarded the nobel peace prize .
forty dollars a month to live on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is not an uncommon sight in rural areas the next day the april heat is almost unbearable , it 's around 40 degrees celsius spiced with humidity and dust weighing down every single step in the afternoon sun .
street markets have a wide array of food on offer , there are even a few shops stacked with goods imported from the west or from the neighboring asian countries .
a look at the prices reveals that most of these things are far beyond reach for the normal population .
" oh , salaries are low in myanmar , very low , " my driver tells me when i ask about the average wage .
" a normal man will earn maybe 40 us dollars per month .
it 's difficult . "
he hints that there are many other things that you need money for besides food - corruption and the black market are thriving .
i see more of the country 's poverty on a trip through the countryside .
villages consist of little more than wooden huts , bicycles are probably the most common means of transportation , old cars and horse and ox carriages make their slow way along the sandy dirt roads .
the people look at foreigners with shy curiosity .
although there now is some degree of tourism , i do n't meet a single foreigner outside rangoon .
for many decades the country was utterly isolated , with practically no visitors allowed in . in the 1990s , travel restrictions were eased with the hope that foreigners would bring in money .
the country 's buddhist monasteries and pagodas are among the most beautiful and impressive in the world .
a black hole of information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will eu pressure bring a better future for the young generation ?
getting information about burma from the outside is fairly easy .
there was extensive coverage when , on may 2-3 , 2008 , the country were devastated by cyclone nargis , leaving 138,000 people dead or missing .
according to aid agencies , at least 250,000 people will require food handouts until the end of 2009 as a result .
in march 2009 the united nation 's special investigator tomas ojea quintana called on burma 's ruling junta to release more than 2,100 political prisoners .
but if you were inside the country at the time , it 's unlikely that you would have heard about any of this .
paris-based media watchdog reporters without borders calls the country a " black hole " .
myanmar is among the bottom 10 countries of the organization 's world press freedom ranking .
trying to check e-mails , i can access neither yahoo nor gmail .
at the hotel , however , there 's the new light of myanmar , an english language newspaper singing the praises of senior general than shwe , the chief of the military regime .
rangoon used to be the capital of the country until , in 2005 , the junta decided it needed a safer place - somewhere in the middle of nowhere .
naypyidaw was built from scratch some 300 kilometers north of rangoon and declared the capital in 2006 .
sanctions to keep up the pressure international pressure and tensions from within forced the government to announce general elections for 2010 .
but little progress has been made so far .
the eu has criticized that no steps have been taken to make the upcoming elections a credible , transparent and inclusive process based on international standards .
the eu 's political and economic sanctions against myanmar have been in place since 2006 and were strengthened after the 2007 crackdown .
they include a travel ban on burma officials , an arms embargo and a freezing of assets .
this year , on april 27 , the eu decided to extend those measures for another 12 months .
by doing so , the foreign ministers of the 27 nation bloc hope to keep up the pressure .
they have however made it clear that the eu is ready to ease sanctions - should there be genuine , democratic progress .

she tracks down everything from van goghs to james bond 's 1963 aston martin . when victorine stille gets a call from an art collector about a stolen work , the first thing she does is enter the crucial details - like artist , year and frame color - in the so-called art loss register . the central databank was founded in london in 1991 and branched have since been added in new york , amsterdam , paris and cologne - where stille works . " what often happens is that , after it 's stolen , a work circulates through the black market for about two to three years , " said the art detective .
" we have a theory that they turn up again after about 15 years . " long-lost paintings might resurface at art auctions or fairs .
but for the rightful owners , 15 years is too long to wait . cross-check at art fairs aiming to speed up the recovery process , stille , who studied art management in amsterdam , spends much of her work day researching on the internet , scanning art auctions ' web sites .
she also attends sundry exhibitions and art fairs . " we visit art dealers ' stands at fairs to protect them and their reputations , and also to protect the participants from buying stolen art , " said the professional sleuth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : james bond had to get a new car after his was stolen in 1997 while she 's there , she checks the works on display against the art loss register to see if any have been reported as stolen . art thieves apparently prefer paintings , but the register also contains antiques , watches and furniture . stolen art on four wheels " we even have a james bond old-timer in our databank , " said stille .
" it 's a 1963 aston martin and was stolen in 1997 during filming .
it was used in both goldfinger and thunderball . " she compared the car to " the scream " by norwegian artist edvard munch , which was stolen from an oslo museum in 2006 and recovered two years later : " those are items that can never be sold , " she said . unlike munch 's masterpiece , the aston martin is still at large - though stille said suspects the thief is more likely to be driving the car around rather than hiding it in a garage somewhere . though the art detective and her colleagues are unlikely to spot james bond 's pride and joy on the way to the supermarket , they do have to rely sometimes on coincidence . " it 's a combination of being active and passive , " said stille .
" sometimes people just call us up and say , hey we saw this or that , or we know about a piece .
but we also actively look through auction catalogues and auction houses . " art dealers , collectors or buyers are also welcome to check the stolen art databank before investing in a piece . so far , stille and her team have recovered 230 million euros -lrb- us $ 304 million -rrb- worth of art .
in germany , approximately 180 pieces are considered missing . author : murat kojuncu / kate bowen editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as dw reporter andreas illmer writes , burma has a long way to go to reach democracy . getting off the plane at rangoon -lrb- yangon -rrb- airport feels like stepping into a different world .
after making it past immigration control , i soon find myself in a taxi driving past a faded billboard reading " welcome to the golden land . "
the first impression is one of stark poverty .
coming from the buzzing metropolis that is thailand 's capital , bangkok , rangoon - although a city of 4 million - looks like little more than a sad provincial town , run-down and desolate .
in the early hours of morning only few people are around , trudging along the sidewalk or waiting for a bus .
there are some bicycles and a few cars - old and battered japanese models .
the country has been on a downward slope for most of the years since it gained independence from britain in 1948 .
after just over one decade of democracy , a military coup in 1962 brought a military junta to power , brutally steering the country on to the " burmese way to socialism " .
for the people , this was not good news .
today , the country ranks amongst the poorest in the world .
" our government is afraid of the students , very afraid . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's plenty of local food on offer , but prices are steep for my few days in burma -lrb- myanmar -rrb- , i have an english-speaking taxi driver provided by the airport 's tourist authorities .
he 's polite but very reserved and i avoid questions about the political situation - i do n't want to get myself into trouble , nor do i want to put him in an uncomfortable situation .
but then , one night , i catch a taxi on the road to get back to my hotel , and the driver seems curious to talk to me .
driving past a building that looks a bit like a university compound , i ask him about the country 's schools and higher education .
" there are few universities in the big towns , " he says in broken english .
he hesitates and then adds : " most universities are in the countryside , in small towns .
our government is very afraid of the students , very afraid .
there have been many demonstrations in the past . "
in 1988 , mounting discontent with the political leadership led to widespread protests across the country .
security forces killed thousands to stifle the popular uprising .
the last anti-government protests date back to only 2007 .
led by buddhist monks , the demonstrations were initially tolerated , but eventually the government launched yet another brutal crackdown .
aung san suu kyi ?
" popular , yes .
very popular . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi remains under house arrest " demonstrations ? "
i ask .
" demonstrations , " he confirms , turning his head to look at me sitting in the backseat .
i ask about aung san suu kyi , tell him that we hear a lot about her in the international media .
is she still popular amongst the people ?
" popular , yes .
very popular . "
his voice sounds excited , a suppressed tension as if he 's been burning to spell that out .
at the same time i am very aware that such a statement expressed to a foreigner could get him into serious trouble .
" she lives close to your hotel , " he says .
" on the other side of the lake .
but it 's not good to go there , you are not allowed to take a photograph of the house . "
aung san suu kyi is the head of the opposition national league for democracy .
in the country 's only free elections in 1990 she won a landslide victory .
but the ruling military junta dismissed the results and placed the politician under house arrest , where she 's been for most of the last 19 years .
in 1991 she was awarded the nobel peace prize .
forty dollars a month to live on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is not an uncommon sight in rural areas the next day the april heat is almost unbearable , it 's around 40 degrees celsius spiced with humidity and dust weighing down every single step in the afternoon sun .
street markets have a wide array of food on offer , there are even a few shops stacked with goods imported from the west or from the neighboring asian countries .
a look at the prices reveals that most of these things are far beyond reach for the normal population .
" oh , salaries are low in myanmar , very low , " my driver tells me when i ask about the average wage .
" a normal man will earn maybe 40 us dollars per month .
it 's difficult . "
he hints that there are many other things that you need money for besides food - corruption and the black market are thriving .
i see more of the country 's poverty on a trip through the countryside .
villages consist of little more than wooden huts , bicycles are probably the most common means of transportation , old cars and horse and ox carriages make their slow way along the sandy dirt roads .
the people look at foreigners with shy curiosity .
although there now is some degree of tourism , i do n't meet a single foreigner outside rangoon .
for many decades the country was utterly isolated , with practically no visitors allowed in . in the 1990s , travel restrictions were eased with the hope that foreigners would bring in money .
the country 's buddhist monasteries and pagodas are among the most beautiful and impressive in the world .
a black hole of information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will eu pressure bring a better future for the young generation ?
getting information about burma from the outside is fairly easy .
there was extensive coverage when , on may 2-3 , 2008 , the country were devastated by cyclone nargis , leaving 138,000 people dead or missing .
according to aid agencies , at least 250,000 people will require food handouts until the end of 2009 as a result .
in march 2009 the united nation 's special investigator tomas ojea quintana called on burma 's ruling junta to release more than 2,100 political prisoners .
but if you were inside the country at the time , it 's unlikely that you would have heard about any of this .
paris-based media watchdog reporters without borders calls the country a " black hole " .
myanmar is among the bottom 10 countries of the organization 's world press freedom ranking .
trying to check e-mails , i can access neither yahoo nor gmail .
at the hotel , however , there 's the new light of myanmar , an english language newspaper singing the praises of senior general than shwe , the chief of the military regime .
rangoon used to be the capital of the country until , in 2005 , the junta decided it needed a safer place - somewhere in the middle of nowhere .
naypyidaw was built from scratch some 300 kilometers north of rangoon and declared the capital in 2006 .
sanctions to keep up the pressure international pressure and tensions from within forced the government to announce general elections for 2010 .
but little progress has been made so far .
the eu has criticized that no steps have been taken to make the upcoming elections a credible , transparent and inclusive process based on international standards .
the eu 's political and economic sanctions against myanmar have been in place since 2006 and were strengthened after the 2007 crackdown .
they include a travel ban on burma officials , an arms embargo and a freezing of assets .
this year , on april 27 , the eu decided to extend those measures for another 12 months .
by doing so , the foreign ministers of the 27 nation bloc hope to keep up the pressure .
they have however made it clear that the eu is ready to ease sanctions - should there be genuine , democratic progress .

as dw reporter andreas illmer writes , burma has a long way to go to reach democracy . getting off the plane at rangoon -lrb- yangon -rrb- airport feels like stepping into a different world .
after making it past immigration control , i soon find myself in a taxi driving past a faded billboard reading " welcome to the golden land . "
the first impression is one of stark poverty .
coming from the buzzing metropolis that is thailand 's capital , bangkok , rangoon - although a city of 4 million - looks like little more than a sad provincial town , run-down and desolate .
in the early hours of morning only few people are around , trudging along the sidewalk or waiting for a bus .
there are some bicycles and a few cars - old and battered japanese models .
the country has been on a downward slope for most of the years since it gained independence from britain in 1948 .
after just over one decade of democracy , a military coup in 1962 brought a military junta to power , brutally steering the country on to the " burmese way to socialism " .
for the people , this was not good news .
today , the country ranks amongst the poorest in the world .
" our government is afraid of the students , very afraid . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's plenty of local food on offer , but prices are steep for my few days in burma -lrb- myanmar -rrb- , i have an english-speaking taxi driver provided by the airport 's tourist authorities .
he 's polite but very reserved and i avoid questions about the political situation - i do n't want to get myself into trouble , nor do i want to put him in an uncomfortable situation .
but then , one night , i catch a taxi on the road to get back to my hotel , and the driver seems curious to talk to me .
driving past a building that looks a bit like a university compound , i ask him about the country 's schools and higher education .
" there are few universities in the big towns , " he says in broken english .
he hesitates and then adds : " most universities are in the countryside , in small towns .
our government is very afraid of the students , very afraid .
there have been many demonstrations in the past . "
in 1988 , mounting discontent with the political leadership led to widespread protests across the country .
security forces killed thousands to stifle the popular uprising .
the last anti-government protests date back to only 2007 .
led by buddhist monks , the demonstrations were initially tolerated , but eventually the government launched yet another brutal crackdown .
aung san suu kyi ?
" popular , yes .
very popular . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi remains under house arrest " demonstrations ? "
i ask .
" demonstrations , " he confirms , turning his head to look at me sitting in the backseat .
i ask about aung san suu kyi , tell him that we hear a lot about her in the international media .
is she still popular amongst the people ?
" popular , yes .
very popular . "
his voice sounds excited , a suppressed tension as if he 's been burning to spell that out .
at the same time i am very aware that such a statement expressed to a foreigner could get him into serious trouble .
" she lives close to your hotel , " he says .
" on the other side of the lake .
but it 's not good to go there , you are not allowed to take a photograph of the house . "
aung san suu kyi is the head of the opposition national league for democracy .
in the country 's only free elections in 1990 she won a landslide victory .
but the ruling military junta dismissed the results and placed the politician under house arrest , where she 's been for most of the last 19 years .
in 1991 she was awarded the nobel peace prize .
forty dollars a month to live on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is not an uncommon sight in rural areas the next day the april heat is almost unbearable , it 's around 40 degrees celsius spiced with humidity and dust weighing down every single step in the afternoon sun .
street markets have a wide array of food on offer , there are even a few shops stacked with goods imported from the west or from the neighboring asian countries .
a look at the prices reveals that most of these things are far beyond reach for the normal population .
" oh , salaries are low in myanmar , very low , " my driver tells me when i ask about the average wage .
" a normal man will earn maybe 40 us dollars per month .
it 's difficult . "
he hints that there are many other things that you need money for besides food - corruption and the black market are thriving .
i see more of the country 's poverty on a trip through the countryside .
villages consist of little more than wooden huts , bicycles are probably the most common means of transportation , old cars and horse and ox carriages make their slow way along the sandy dirt roads .
the people look at foreigners with shy curiosity .
although there now is some degree of tourism , i do n't meet a single foreigner outside rangoon .
for many decades the country was utterly isolated , with practically no visitors allowed in . in the 1990s , travel restrictions were eased with the hope that foreigners would bring in money .
the country 's buddhist monasteries and pagodas are among the most beautiful and impressive in the world .
a black hole of information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will eu pressure bring a better future for the young generation ?
getting information about burma from the outside is fairly easy .
there was extensive coverage when , on may 2-3 , 2008 , the country were devastated by cyclone nargis , leaving 138,000 people dead or missing .
according to aid agencies , at least 250,000 people will require food handouts until the end of 2009 as a result .
in march 2009 the united nation 's special investigator tomas ojea quintana called on burma 's ruling junta to release more than 2,100 political prisoners .
but if you were inside the country at the time , it 's unlikely that you would have heard about any of this .
paris-based media watchdog reporters without borders calls the country a " black hole " .
myanmar is among the bottom 10 countries of the organization 's world press freedom ranking .
trying to check e-mails , i can access neither yahoo nor gmail .
at the hotel , however , there 's the new light of myanmar , an english language newspaper singing the praises of senior general than shwe , the chief of the military regime .
rangoon used to be the capital of the country until , in 2005 , the junta decided it needed a safer place - somewhere in the middle of nowhere .
naypyidaw was built from scratch some 300 kilometers north of rangoon and declared the capital in 2006 .
sanctions to keep up the pressure international pressure and tensions from within forced the government to announce general elections for 2010 .
but little progress has been made so far .
the eu has criticized that no steps have been taken to make the upcoming elections a credible , transparent and inclusive process based on international standards .
the eu 's political and economic sanctions against myanmar have been in place since 2006 and were strengthened after the 2007 crackdown .
they include a travel ban on burma officials , an arms embargo and a freezing of assets .
this year , on april 27 , the eu decided to extend those measures for another 12 months .
by doing so , the foreign ministers of the 27 nation bloc hope to keep up the pressure .
they have however made it clear that the eu is ready to ease sanctions - should there be genuine , democratic progress .

she tracks down everything from van goghs to james bond 's 1963 aston martin . when victorine stille gets a call from an art collector about a stolen work , the first thing she does is enter the crucial details - like artist , year and frame color - in the so-called art loss register . the central databank was founded in london in 1991 and branched have since been added in new york , amsterdam , paris and cologne - where stille works . " what often happens is that , after it 's stolen , a work circulates through the black market for about two to three years , " said the art detective .
" we have a theory that they turn up again after about 15 years . " long-lost paintings might resurface at art auctions or fairs .
but for the rightful owners , 15 years is too long to wait . cross-check at art fairs aiming to speed up the recovery process , stille , who studied art management in amsterdam , spends much of her work day researching on the internet , scanning art auctions ' web sites .
she also attends sundry exhibitions and art fairs . " we visit art dealers ' stands at fairs to protect them and their reputations , and also to protect the participants from buying stolen art , " said the professional sleuth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : james bond had to get a new car after his was stolen in 1997 while she 's there , she checks the works on display against the art loss register to see if any have been reported as stolen . art thieves apparently prefer paintings , but the register also contains antiques , watches and furniture . stolen art on four wheels " we even have a james bond old-timer in our databank , " said stille .
" it 's a 1963 aston martin and was stolen in 1997 during filming .
it was used in both goldfinger and thunderball . " she compared the car to " the scream " by norwegian artist edvard munch , which was stolen from an oslo museum in 2006 and recovered two years later : " those are items that can never be sold , " she said . unlike munch 's masterpiece , the aston martin is still at large - though stille said suspects the thief is more likely to be driving the car around rather than hiding it in a garage somewhere . though the art detective and her colleagues are unlikely to spot james bond 's pride and joy on the way to the supermarket , they do have to rely sometimes on coincidence . " it 's a combination of being active and passive , " said stille .
" sometimes people just call us up and say , hey we saw this or that , or we know about a piece .
but we also actively look through auction catalogues and auction houses . " art dealers , collectors or buyers are also welcome to check the stolen art databank before investing in a piece . so far , stille and her team have recovered 230 million euros -lrb- us $ 304 million -rrb- worth of art .
in germany , approximately 180 pieces are considered missing . author : murat kojuncu / kate bowen editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" on the other side of the lake .

according to aid agencies , at least 250,000 people will require food handouts until the end of 2009 as a result .

the eu 's political and economic sanctions against myanmar have been in place since 2006 and were strengthened after the 2007 crackdown .
they include a travel ban on burma officials , an arms embargo and a freezing of assets .
this year , on april 27 , the eu decided to extend those measures for another 12 months .
by doing so , the foreign ministers of the 27 nation bloc hope to keep up the pressure .
they have however made it clear that the eu is ready to ease sanctions - should there be genuine , democratic progress .

as dw reporter andreas illmer writes , burma has a long way to go to reach democracy . getting off the plane at rangoon -lrb- yangon -rrb- airport feels like stepping into a different world .
after making it past immigration control , i soon find myself in a taxi driving past a faded billboard reading " welcome to the golden land . "
the first impression is one of stark poverty .
coming from the buzzing metropolis that is thailand 's capital , bangkok , rangoon - although a city of 4 million - looks like little more than a sad provincial town , run-down and desolate .
in the early hours of morning only few people are around , trudging along the sidewalk or waiting for a bus .
there are some bicycles and a few cars - old and battered japanese models .
the country has been on a downward slope for most of the years since it gained independence from britain in 1948 .
after just over one decade of democracy , a military coup in 1962 brought a military junta to power , brutally steering the country on to the " burmese way to socialism " .
for the people , this was not good news .
today , the country ranks amongst the poorest in the world .

but then , one night , i catch a taxi on the road to get back to my hotel , and the driver seems curious to talk to me .
driving past a building that looks a bit like a university compound , i ask him about the country 's schools and higher education .

but then , one night , i catch a taxi on the road to get back to my hotel , and the driver seems curious to talk to me .
driving past a building that looks a bit like a university compound , i ask him about the country 's schools and higher education .

he hesitates and then adds : " most universities are in the countryside , in small towns .
our government is very afraid of the students , very afraid .
there have been many demonstrations in the past . "
in 1988 , mounting discontent with the political leadership led to widespread protests across the country .
security forces killed thousands to stifle the popular uprising .
the last anti-government protests date back to only 2007 .
led by buddhist monks , the demonstrations were initially tolerated , but eventually the government launched yet another brutal crackdown .

i ask about aung san suu kyi , tell him that we hear a lot about her in the international media .
is she still popular amongst the people ?
" popular , yes .
very popular . "
his voice sounds excited , a suppressed tension as if he 's been burning to spell that out .
at the same time i am very aware that such a statement expressed to a foreigner could get him into serious trouble .
" she lives close to your hotel , " he says .
" on the other side of the lake .
but it 's not good to go there , you are not allowed to take a photograph of the house . "
aung san suu kyi is the head of the opposition national league for democracy .
in the country 's only free elections in 1990 she won a landslide victory .
but the ruling military junta dismissed the results and placed the politician under house arrest , where she 's been for most of the last 19 years .
in 1991 she was awarded the nobel peace prize .

there was extensive coverage when , on may 2-3 , 2008 , the country were devastated by cyclone nargis , leaving 138,000 people dead or missing .
according to aid agencies , at least 250,000 people will require food handouts until the end of 2009 as a result .
in march 2009 the united nation 's special investigator tomas ojea quintana called on burma 's ruling junta to release more than 2,100 political prisoners .

rangoon used to be the capital of the country until , in 2005 , the junta decided it needed a safer place - somewhere in the middle of nowhere .

sanctions to keep up the pressure international pressure and tensions from within forced the government to announce general elections for 2010 .
but little progress has been made so far .
the eu has criticized that no steps have been taken to make the upcoming elections a credible , transparent and inclusive process based on international standards .
the eu 's political and economic sanctions against myanmar have been in place since 2006 and were strengthened after the 2007 crackdown .
they include a travel ban on burma officials , an arms embargo and a freezing of assets .
this year , on april 27 , the eu decided to extend those measures for another 12 months .
by doing so , the foreign ministers of the 27 nation bloc hope to keep up the pressure .
they have however made it clear that the eu is ready to ease sanctions - should there be genuine , democratic progress .

for the people , this was not good news .
today , the country ranks amongst the poorest in the world .
" our government is afraid of the students , very afraid . "

he 's polite but very reserved and i avoid questions about the political situation - i do n't want to get myself into trouble , nor do i want to put him in an uncomfortable situation .
but then , one night , i catch a taxi on the road to get back to my hotel , and the driver seems curious to talk to me .
driving past a building that looks a bit like a university compound , i ask him about the country 's schools and higher education .
" there are few universities in the big towns , " he says in broken english .
he hesitates and then adds : " most universities are in the countryside , in small towns .
our government is very afraid of the students , very afraid .
there have been many demonstrations in the past . "
in 1988 , mounting discontent with the political leadership led to widespread protests across the country .
security forces killed thousands to stifle the popular uprising .
the last anti-government protests date back to only 2007 .
led by buddhist monks , the demonstrations were initially tolerated , but eventually the government launched yet another brutal crackdown .

i ask about aung san suu kyi , tell him that we hear a lot about her in the international media .
is she still popular amongst the people ?
" popular , yes .
very popular . "
his voice sounds excited , a suppressed tension as if he 's been burning to spell that out .
at the same time i am very aware that such a statement expressed to a foreigner could get him into serious trouble .
" she lives close to your hotel , " he says .
" on the other side of the lake .
but it 's not good to go there , you are not allowed to take a photograph of the house . "
aung san suu kyi is the head of the opposition national league for democracy .
in the country 's only free elections in 1990 she won a landslide victory .
but the ruling military junta dismissed the results and placed the politician under house arrest , where she 's been for most of the last 19 years .
in 1991 she was awarded the nobel peace prize .

a look at the prices reveals that most of these things are far beyond reach for the normal population .

" a normal man will earn maybe 40 us dollars per month .
it 's difficult . "
he hints that there are many other things that you need money for besides food - corruption and the black market are thriving .
i see more of the country 's poverty on a trip through the countryside .
villages consist of little more than wooden huts , bicycles are probably the most common means of transportation , old cars and horse and ox carriages make their slow way along the sandy dirt roads .
the people look at foreigners with shy curiosity .
although there now is some degree of tourism , i do n't meet a single foreigner outside rangoon .
for many decades the country was utterly isolated , with practically no visitors allowed in . in the 1990s , travel restrictions were eased with the hope that foreigners would bring in money .

getting information about burma from the outside is fairly easy .
there was extensive coverage when , on may 2-3 , 2008 , the country were devastated by cyclone nargis , leaving 138,000 people dead or missing .
according to aid agencies , at least 250,000 people will require food handouts until the end of 2009 as a result .
in march 2009 the united nation 's special investigator tomas ojea quintana called on burma 's ruling junta to release more than 2,100 political prisoners .
but if you were inside the country at the time , it 's unlikely that you would have heard about any of this .

myanmar is among the bottom 10 countries of the organization 's world press freedom ranking .

rangoon used to be the capital of the country until , in 2005 , the junta decided it needed a safer place - somewhere in the middle of nowhere .
naypyidaw was built from scratch some 300 kilometers north of rangoon and declared the capital in 2006 .
sanctions to keep up the pressure international pressure and tensions from within forced the government to announce general elections for 2010 .
but little progress has been made so far .
the eu has criticized that no steps have been taken to make the upcoming elections a credible , transparent and inclusive process based on international standards .
the eu 's political and economic sanctions against myanmar have been in place since 2006 and were strengthened after the 2007 crackdown .
they include a travel ban on burma officials , an arms embargo and a freezing of assets .
this year , on april 27 , the eu decided to extend those measures for another 12 months .
by doing so , the foreign ministers of the 27 nation bloc hope to keep up the pressure .
they have however made it clear that the eu is ready to ease sanctions - should there be genuine , democratic progress .

as dw reporter andreas illmer writes , burma has a long way to go to reach democracy . getting off the plane at rangoon -lrb- yangon -rrb- airport feels like stepping into a different world .
after making it past immigration control , i soon find myself in a taxi driving past a faded billboard reading " welcome to the golden land . "
the first impression is one of stark poverty .
coming from the buzzing metropolis that is thailand 's capital , bangkok , rangoon - although a city of 4 million - looks like little more than a sad provincial town , run-down and desolate .
in the early hours of morning only few people are around , trudging along the sidewalk or waiting for a bus .
there are some bicycles and a few cars - old and battered japanese models .
the country has been on a downward slope for most of the years since it gained independence from britain in 1948 .
after just over one decade of democracy , a military coup in 1962 brought a military junta to power , brutally steering the country on to the " burmese way to socialism " .
for the people , this was not good news .
today , the country ranks amongst the poorest in the world .
" our government is afraid of the students , very afraid . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's plenty of local food on offer , but prices are steep for my few days in burma -lrb- myanmar -rrb- , i have an english-speaking taxi driver provided by the airport 's tourist authorities .
he 's polite but very reserved and i avoid questions about the political situation - i do n't want to get myself into trouble , nor do i want to put him in an uncomfortable situation .
but then , one night , i catch a taxi on the road to get back to my hotel , and the driver seems curious to talk to me .
driving past a building that looks a bit like a university compound , i ask him about the country 's schools and higher education .
" there are few universities in the big towns , " he says in broken english .
he hesitates and then adds : " most universities are in the countryside , in small towns .
our government is very afraid of the students , very afraid .
there have been many demonstrations in the past . "
in 1988 , mounting discontent with the political leadership led to widespread protests across the country .
security forces killed thousands to stifle the popular uprising .
the last anti-government protests date back to only 2007 .
led by buddhist monks , the demonstrations were initially tolerated , but eventually the government launched yet another brutal crackdown .
aung san suu kyi ?
" popular , yes .
very popular . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi remains under house arrest " demonstrations ? "
i ask .
" demonstrations , " he confirms , turning his head to look at me sitting in the backseat .
i ask about aung san suu kyi , tell him that we hear a lot about her in the international media .
is she still popular amongst the people ?
" popular , yes .
very popular . "
his voice sounds excited , a suppressed tension as if he 's been burning to spell that out .
at the same time i am very aware that such a statement expressed to a foreigner could get him into serious trouble .
" she lives close to your hotel , " he says .
" on the other side of the lake .
but it 's not good to go there , you are not allowed to take a photograph of the house . "
aung san suu kyi is the head of the opposition national league for democracy .
in the country 's only free elections in 1990 she won a landslide victory .
but the ruling military junta dismissed the results and placed the politician under house arrest , where she 's been for most of the last 19 years .
in 1991 she was awarded the nobel peace prize .
forty dollars a month to live on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is not an uncommon sight in rural areas the next day the april heat is almost unbearable , it 's around 40 degrees celsius spiced with humidity and dust weighing down every single step in the afternoon sun .
street markets have a wide array of food on offer , there are even a few shops stacked with goods imported from the west or from the neighboring asian countries .
a look at the prices reveals that most of these things are far beyond reach for the normal population .
" oh , salaries are low in myanmar , very low , " my driver tells me when i ask about the average wage .
" a normal man will earn maybe 40 us dollars per month .
it 's difficult . "
he hints that there are many other things that you need money for besides food - corruption and the black market are thriving .
i see more of the country 's poverty on a trip through the countryside .
villages consist of little more than wooden huts , bicycles are probably the most common means of transportation , old cars and horse and ox carriages make their slow way along the sandy dirt roads .
the people look at foreigners with shy curiosity .
although there now is some degree of tourism , i do n't meet a single foreigner outside rangoon .
for many decades the country was utterly isolated , with practically no visitors allowed in . in the 1990s , travel restrictions were eased with the hope that foreigners would bring in money .
the country 's buddhist monasteries and pagodas are among the most beautiful and impressive in the world .
a black hole of information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will eu pressure bring a better future for the young generation ?
getting information about burma from the outside is fairly easy .
there was extensive coverage when , on may 2-3 , 2008 , the country were devastated by cyclone nargis , leaving 138,000 people dead or missing .
according to aid agencies , at least 250,000 people will require food handouts until the end of 2009 as a result .
in march 2009 the united nation 's special investigator tomas ojea quintana called on burma 's ruling junta to release more than 2,100 political prisoners .
but if you were inside the country at the time , it 's unlikely that you would have heard about any of this .
paris-based media watchdog reporters without borders calls the country a " black hole " .
myanmar is among the bottom 10 countries of the organization 's world press freedom ranking .
trying to check e-mails , i can access neither yahoo nor gmail .
at the hotel , however , there 's the new light of myanmar , an english language newspaper singing the praises of senior general than shwe , the chief of the military regime .
rangoon used to be the capital of the country until , in 2005 , the junta decided it needed a safer place - somewhere in the middle of nowhere .
naypyidaw was built from scratch some 300 kilometers north of rangoon and declared the capital in 2006 .
sanctions to keep up the pressure international pressure and tensions from within forced the government to announce general elections for 2010 .
but little progress has been made so far .
the eu has criticized that no steps have been taken to make the upcoming elections a credible , transparent and inclusive process based on international standards .
the eu 's political and economic sanctions against myanmar have been in place since 2006 and were strengthened after the 2007 crackdown .
they include a travel ban on burma officials , an arms embargo and a freezing of assets .
this year , on april 27 , the eu decided to extend those measures for another 12 months .
by doing so , the foreign ministers of the 27 nation bloc hope to keep up the pressure .
they have however made it clear that the eu is ready to ease sanctions - should there be genuine , democratic progress .

as dw reporter andreas illmer writes , burma has a long way to go to reach democracy . getting off the plane at rangoon -lrb- yangon -rrb- airport feels like stepping into a different world .
after making it past immigration control , i soon find myself in a taxi driving past a faded billboard reading " welcome to the golden land . "
the first impression is one of stark poverty .
coming from the buzzing metropolis that is thailand 's capital , bangkok , rangoon - although a city of 4 million - looks like little more than a sad provincial town , run-down and desolate .
in the early hours of morning only few people are around , trudging along the sidewalk or waiting for a bus .
there are some bicycles and a few cars - old and battered japanese models .
the country has been on a downward slope for most of the years since it gained independence from britain in 1948 .
after just over one decade of democracy , a military coup in 1962 brought a military junta to power , brutally steering the country on to the " burmese way to socialism " .
for the people , this was not good news .
today , the country ranks amongst the poorest in the world .
" our government is afraid of the students , very afraid . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's plenty of local food on offer , but prices are steep for my few days in burma -lrb- myanmar -rrb- , i have an english-speaking taxi driver provided by the airport 's tourist authorities .
he 's polite but very reserved and i avoid questions about the political situation - i do n't want to get myself into trouble , nor do i want to put him in an uncomfortable situation .
but then , one night , i catch a taxi on the road to get back to my hotel , and the driver seems curious to talk to me .
driving past a building that looks a bit like a university compound , i ask him about the country 's schools and higher education .
" there are few universities in the big towns , " he says in broken english .
he hesitates and then adds : " most universities are in the countryside , in small towns .
our government is very afraid of the students , very afraid .
there have been many demonstrations in the past . "
in 1988 , mounting discontent with the political leadership led to widespread protests across the country .
security forces killed thousands to stifle the popular uprising .
the last anti-government protests date back to only 2007 .
led by buddhist monks , the demonstrations were initially tolerated , but eventually the government launched yet another brutal crackdown .
aung san suu kyi ?
" popular , yes .
very popular . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi remains under house arrest " demonstrations ? "
i ask .
" demonstrations , " he confirms , turning his head to look at me sitting in the backseat .
i ask about aung san suu kyi , tell him that we hear a lot about her in the international media .
is she still popular amongst the people ?
" popular , yes .
very popular . "
his voice sounds excited , a suppressed tension as if he 's been burning to spell that out .
at the same time i am very aware that such a statement expressed to a foreigner could get him into serious trouble .
" she lives close to your hotel , " he says .
" on the other side of the lake .
but it 's not good to go there , you are not allowed to take a photograph of the house . "
aung san suu kyi is the head of the opposition national league for democracy .
in the country 's only free elections in 1990 she won a landslide victory .
but the ruling military junta dismissed the results and placed the politician under house arrest , where she 's been for most of the last 19 years .
in 1991 she was awarded the nobel peace prize .
forty dollars a month to live on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is not an uncommon sight in rural areas the next day the april heat is almost unbearable , it 's around 40 degrees celsius spiced with humidity and dust weighing down every single step in the afternoon sun .
street markets have a wide array of food on offer , there are even a few shops stacked with goods imported from the west or from the neighboring asian countries .
a look at the prices reveals that most of these things are far beyond reach for the normal population .
" oh , salaries are low in myanmar , very low , " my driver tells me when i ask about the average wage .
" a normal man will earn maybe 40 us dollars per month .
it 's difficult . "
he hints that there are many other things that you need money for besides food - corruption and the black market are thriving .
i see more of the country 's poverty on a trip through the countryside .
villages consist of little more than wooden huts , bicycles are probably the most common means of transportation , old cars and horse and ox carriages make their slow way along the sandy dirt roads .
the people look at foreigners with shy curiosity .
although there now is some degree of tourism , i do n't meet a single foreigner outside rangoon .
for many decades the country was utterly isolated , with practically no visitors allowed in . in the 1990s , travel restrictions were eased with the hope that foreigners would bring in money .
the country 's buddhist monasteries and pagodas are among the most beautiful and impressive in the world .
a black hole of information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will eu pressure bring a better future for the young generation ?
getting information about burma from the outside is fairly easy .
there was extensive coverage when , on may 2-3 , 2008 , the country were devastated by cyclone nargis , leaving 138,000 people dead or missing .
according to aid agencies , at least 250,000 people will require food handouts until the end of 2009 as a result .
in march 2009 the united nation 's special investigator tomas ojea quintana called on burma 's ruling junta to release more than 2,100 political prisoners .
but if you were inside the country at the time , it 's unlikely that you would have heard about any of this .
paris-based media watchdog reporters without borders calls the country a " black hole " .
myanmar is among the bottom 10 countries of the organization 's world press freedom ranking .
trying to check e-mails , i can access neither yahoo nor gmail .
at the hotel , however , there 's the new light of myanmar , an english language newspaper singing the praises of senior general than shwe , the chief of the military regime .
rangoon used to be the capital of the country until , in 2005 , the junta decided it needed a safer place - somewhere in the middle of nowhere .
naypyidaw was built from scratch some 300 kilometers north of rangoon and declared the capital in 2006 .
sanctions to keep up the pressure international pressure and tensions from within forced the government to announce general elections for 2010 .
but little progress has been made so far .
the eu has criticized that no steps have been taken to make the upcoming elections a credible , transparent and inclusive process based on international standards .
the eu 's political and economic sanctions against myanmar have been in place since 2006 and were strengthened after the 2007 crackdown .
they include a travel ban on burma officials , an arms embargo and a freezing of assets .
this year , on april 27 , the eu decided to extend those measures for another 12 months .
by doing so , the foreign ministers of the 27 nation bloc hope to keep up the pressure .
they have however made it clear that the eu is ready to ease sanctions - should there be genuine , democratic progress .

as dw reporter andreas illmer writes , burma has a long way to go to reach democracy . getting off the plane at rangoon -lrb- yangon -rrb- airport feels like stepping into a different world .
after making it past immigration control , i soon find myself in a taxi driving past a faded billboard reading " welcome to the golden land . "
the first impression is one of stark poverty .
coming from the buzzing metropolis that is thailand 's capital , bangkok , rangoon - although a city of 4 million - looks like little more than a sad provincial town , run-down and desolate .
in the early hours of morning only few people are around , trudging along the sidewalk or waiting for a bus .
there are some bicycles and a few cars - old and battered japanese models .
the country has been on a downward slope for most of the years since it gained independence from britain in 1948 .
after just over one decade of democracy , a military coup in 1962 brought a military junta to power , brutally steering the country on to the " burmese way to socialism " .
for the people , this was not good news .
today , the country ranks amongst the poorest in the world .
" our government is afraid of the students , very afraid . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's plenty of local food on offer , but prices are steep for my few days in burma -lrb- myanmar -rrb- , i have an english-speaking taxi driver provided by the airport 's tourist authorities .
he 's polite but very reserved and i avoid questions about the political situation - i do n't want to get myself into trouble , nor do i want to put him in an uncomfortable situation .
but then , one night , i catch a taxi on the road to get back to my hotel , and the driver seems curious to talk to me .
driving past a building that looks a bit like a university compound , i ask him about the country 's schools and higher education .
" there are few universities in the big towns , " he says in broken english .
he hesitates and then adds : " most universities are in the countryside , in small towns .
our government is very afraid of the students , very afraid .
there have been many demonstrations in the past . "
in 1988 , mounting discontent with the political leadership led to widespread protests across the country .
security forces killed thousands to stifle the popular uprising .
the last anti-government protests date back to only 2007 .
led by buddhist monks , the demonstrations were initially tolerated , but eventually the government launched yet another brutal crackdown .
aung san suu kyi ?
" popular , yes .
very popular . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi remains under house arrest " demonstrations ? "
i ask .
" demonstrations , " he confirms , turning his head to look at me sitting in the backseat .
i ask about aung san suu kyi , tell him that we hear a lot about her in the international media .
is she still popular amongst the people ?
" popular , yes .
very popular . "
his voice sounds excited , a suppressed tension as if he 's been burning to spell that out .
at the same time i am very aware that such a statement expressed to a foreigner could get him into serious trouble .
" she lives close to your hotel , " he says .
" on the other side of the lake .
but it 's not good to go there , you are not allowed to take a photograph of the house . "
aung san suu kyi is the head of the opposition national league for democracy .
in the country 's only free elections in 1990 she won a landslide victory .
but the ruling military junta dismissed the results and placed the politician under house arrest , where she 's been for most of the last 19 years .
in 1991 she was awarded the nobel peace prize .
forty dollars a month to live on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is not an uncommon sight in rural areas the next day the april heat is almost unbearable , it 's around 40 degrees celsius spiced with humidity and dust weighing down every single step in the afternoon sun .
street markets have a wide array of food on offer , there are even a few shops stacked with goods imported from the west or from the neighboring asian countries .
a look at the prices reveals that most of these things are far beyond reach for the normal population .
" oh , salaries are low in myanmar , very low , " my driver tells me when i ask about the average wage .
" a normal man will earn maybe 40 us dollars per month .
it 's difficult . "
he hints that there are many other things that you need money for besides food - corruption and the black market are thriving .
i see more of the country 's poverty on a trip through the countryside .
villages consist of little more than wooden huts , bicycles are probably the most common means of transportation , old cars and horse and ox carriages make their slow way along the sandy dirt roads .
the people look at foreigners with shy curiosity .
although there now is some degree of tourism , i do n't meet a single foreigner outside rangoon .
for many decades the country was utterly isolated , with practically no visitors allowed in . in the 1990s , travel restrictions were eased with the hope that foreigners would bring in money .
the country 's buddhist monasteries and pagodas are among the most beautiful and impressive in the world .
a black hole of information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will eu pressure bring a better future for the young generation ?
getting information about burma from the outside is fairly easy .
there was extensive coverage when , on may 2-3 , 2008 , the country were devastated by cyclone nargis , leaving 138,000 people dead or missing .
according to aid agencies , at least 250,000 people will require food handouts until the end of 2009 as a result .
in march 2009 the united nation 's special investigator tomas ojea quintana called on burma 's ruling junta to release more than 2,100 political prisoners .
but if you were inside the country at the time , it 's unlikely that you would have heard about any of this .
paris-based media watchdog reporters without borders calls the country a " black hole " .
myanmar is among the bottom 10 countries of the organization 's world press freedom ranking .
trying to check e-mails , i can access neither yahoo nor gmail .
at the hotel , however , there 's the new light of myanmar , an english language newspaper singing the praises of senior general than shwe , the chief of the military regime .
rangoon used to be the capital of the country until , in 2005 , the junta decided it needed a safer place - somewhere in the middle of nowhere .
naypyidaw was built from scratch some 300 kilometers north of rangoon and declared the capital in 2006 .
sanctions to keep up the pressure international pressure and tensions from within forced the government to announce general elections for 2010 .
but little progress has been made so far .
the eu has criticized that no steps have been taken to make the upcoming elections a credible , transparent and inclusive process based on international standards .
the eu 's political and economic sanctions against myanmar have been in place since 2006 and were strengthened after the 2007 crackdown .
they include a travel ban on burma officials , an arms embargo and a freezing of assets .
this year , on april 27 , the eu decided to extend those measures for another 12 months .
by doing so , the foreign ministers of the 27 nation bloc hope to keep up the pressure .
they have however made it clear that the eu is ready to ease sanctions - should there be genuine , democratic progress .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de civil rights -pipe- 03.05.2009 a trip to burma reveals a black hole of information großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside the pagodas , there 's more need than splendor one year ago , cyclone nargis devastated the southeast asian country of burma , but authorities have largely ignored the anniversary .
as dw reporter andreas illmer writes , burma has a long way to go to reach democracy . getting off the plane at rangoon -lrb- yangon -rrb- airport feels like stepping into a different world .
after making it past immigration control , i soon find myself in a taxi driving past a faded billboard reading " welcome to the golden land . "
the first impression is one of stark poverty .
coming from the buzzing metropolis that is thailand 's capital , bangkok , rangoon - although a city of 4 million - looks like little more than a sad provincial town , run-down and desolate .
in the early hours of morning only few people are around , trudging along the sidewalk or waiting for a bus .
there are some bicycles and a few cars - old and battered japanese models .
the country has been on a downward slope for most of the years since it gained independence from britain in 1948 .
after just over one decade of democracy , a military coup in 1962 brought a military junta to power , brutally steering the country on to the " burmese way to socialism " .
for the people , this was not good news .
today , the country ranks amongst the poorest in the world .
" our government is afraid of the students , very afraid . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's plenty of local food on offer , but prices are steep for my few days in burma -lrb- myanmar -rrb- , i have an english-speaking taxi driver provided by the airport 's tourist authorities .
he 's polite but very reserved and i avoid questions about the political situation - i do n't want to get myself into trouble , nor do i want to put him in an uncomfortable situation .
but then , one night , i catch a taxi on the road to get back to my hotel , and the driver seems curious to talk to me .
driving past a building that looks a bit like a university compound , i ask him about the country 's schools and higher education .
" there are few universities in the big towns , " he says in broken english .
he hesitates and then adds : " most universities are in the countryside , in small towns .
our government is very afraid of the students , very afraid .
there have been many demonstrations in the past . "
in 1988 , mounting discontent with the political leadership led to widespread protests across the country .
security forces killed thousands to stifle the popular uprising .
the last anti-government protests date back to only 2007 .
led by buddhist monks , the demonstrations were initially tolerated , but eventually the government launched yet another brutal crackdown .
aung san suu kyi ?
" popular , yes .
very popular . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi remains under house arrest " demonstrations ? "
i ask .
" demonstrations , " he confirms , turning his head to look at me sitting in the backseat .
i ask about aung san suu kyi , tell him that we hear a lot about her in the international media .
is she still popular amongst the people ?
" popular , yes .
very popular . "
his voice sounds excited , a suppressed tension as if he 's been burning to spell that out .
at the same time i am very aware that such a statement expressed to a foreigner could get him into serious trouble .
" she lives close to your hotel , " he says .
" on the other side of the lake .
but it 's not good to go there , you are not allowed to take a photograph of the house . "
aung san suu kyi is the head of the opposition national league for democracy .
in the country 's only free elections in 1990 she won a landslide victory .
but the ruling military junta dismissed the results and placed the politician under house arrest , where she 's been for most of the last 19 years .
in 1991 she was awarded the nobel peace prize .
forty dollars a month to live on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is not an uncommon sight in rural areas the next day the april heat is almost unbearable , it 's around 40 degrees celsius spiced with humidity and dust weighing down every single step in the afternoon sun .
street markets have a wide array of food on offer , there are even a few shops stacked with goods imported from the west or from the neighboring asian countries .
a look at the prices reveals that most of these things are far beyond reach for the normal population .
" oh , salaries are low in myanmar , very low , " my driver tells me when i ask about the average wage .
" a normal man will earn maybe 40 us dollars per month .
it 's difficult . "
he hints that there are many other things that you need money for besides food - corruption and the black market are thriving .
i see more of the country 's poverty on a trip through the countryside .
villages consist of little more than wooden huts , bicycles are probably the most common means of transportation , old cars and horse and ox carriages make their slow way along the sandy dirt roads .
the people look at foreigners with shy curiosity .
although there now is some degree of tourism , i do n't meet a single foreigner outside rangoon .
for many decades the country was utterly isolated , with practically no visitors allowed in . in the 1990s , travel restrictions were eased with the hope that foreigners would bring in money .
the country 's buddhist monasteries and pagodas are among the most beautiful and impressive in the world .
a black hole of information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will eu pressure bring a better future for the young generation ?
getting information about burma from the outside is fairly easy .
there was extensive coverage when , on may 2-3 , 2008 , the country were devastated by cyclone nargis , leaving 138,000 people dead or missing .
according to aid agencies , at least 250,000 people will require food handouts until the end of 2009 as a result .
in march 2009 the united nation 's special investigator tomas ojea quintana called on burma 's ruling junta to release more than 2,100 political prisoners .
but if you were inside the country at the time , it 's unlikely that you would have heard about any of this .
paris-based media watchdog reporters without borders calls the country a " black hole " .
myanmar is among the bottom 10 countries of the organization 's world press freedom ranking .
trying to check e-mails , i can access neither yahoo nor gmail .
at the hotel , however , there 's the new light of myanmar , an english language newspaper singing the praises of senior general than shwe , the chief of the military regime .
rangoon used to be the capital of the country until , in 2005 , the junta decided it needed a safer place - somewhere in the middle of nowhere .
naypyidaw was built from scratch some 300 kilometers north of rangoon and declared the capital in 2006 .
sanctions to keep up the pressure international pressure and tensions from within forced the government to announce general elections for 2010 .
but little progress has been made so far .
the eu has criticized that no steps have been taken to make the upcoming elections a credible , transparent and inclusive process based on international standards .
the eu 's political and economic sanctions against myanmar have been in place since 2006 and were strengthened after the 2007 crackdown .
they include a travel ban on burma officials , an arms embargo and a freezing of assets .
this year , on april 27 , the eu decided to extend those measures for another 12 months .
by doing so , the foreign ministers of the 27 nation bloc hope to keep up the pressure .
they have however made it clear that the eu is ready to ease sanctions - should there be genuine , democratic progress .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 03.05.2009 threatened pakistani journalist vows to keep writing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meera jamal says she wo n't give up her writing a deutsche welle intern , forced to leave her home in pakistan after receiving death threats , gives details of her ordeal . pakistani journalist , meera jamal , fled to germany last october following a spate of threats in response to her articles .
after spending several months in a german refugee camp , the media watchdog group , reporters without borders helped secure her an internship in deutsche welle 's urdu-speaking news department .
dw : pakistan is considered one of the most dangerous countries for journalists .
what is your own experience ?
meera jamal : i suppose that is pretty much true .
the danger which is faced by the journalist is on two folds ; one is from the secret services .
you see a lot of incidents of journalists being harassed , beaten up , or killed by them .
and the other is the islamic radical groups .
why did you leave pakistan ?
it was pretty much because of the islamic radical group .
i was writing on the issues of women 's rights and basic human rights , in which you have to , at times , criticise certain norms or rules followed by the islamic clerics or created by them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal 's writing focussed on women 's rights in pakistan and this did n't go well with the islamic radial groups .
for example , on international women 's day , i wrote about a prostitute - a 56 year old woman whose children never knew she was a prostitute .
i thought that she was a great example of how a woman can sacrifice herself in order to support her children .
that was really looked down upon .
the other example was my series of articles on women 's rights , for example the right of divorce , the right of separation , the right of child custody .
how were you threatened ?
initially it was phone calls , then it went on to be doubled by letters .
then , in august 2008 , i was stopped by four men on my way to work , which really scared me .
they threatened me , for my life .
it was really scary .
i felt so much in danger for myself and i felt like i was putting my family at risk .
i was totally shattered actually because of it .
you lived in karachi at the time , what do you think would have happened if you had stayed on in pakistan , despite the threats ?
i suppose these people are really unpredictable .
there are incidents where they can throw acid on you , or they can ambush you .
they can do anything .
being a woman , it 's the most difficult thing .
there 's a particular kind of asian mentality , where a woman represents the entire family 's moral standing in the society .
and if anything goes bad with the woman , the entire family would be defamed .
it 's pretty much difficult for you to combat that , and being a woman , it was horrible for me .
so they could have maybe killed you ?
yes , but killing is the easiest part .
your family and your defamation for your family , that 's the horrible part .
i think i would never want to have that happen to them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal describes herself as a " non-believer " do you think the fact that you were a woman reporting about women 's issues , was that the most enraging bit to the people who threatened you ?
or was it the issues you reported about ?
it was the issues , it was me being a woman and writing about such issues , instigating other woman and convincing them of my ideas .
it was partly because of my personal life as well , because i am a non-believer , which catches attention a lot .
" she 's a non-believer and she 's writing to defame islam " .
so these kinds of things triggered them off .
what triggered you in a situation that 's so difficult for journalists , to join the profession ?
actually , you feel very much satisfied when you are doing something that can improve society , or at least you feel that it can bring a change , even a little bit .
for instance , the write-ups i 've done are basically on social issues , human rights .
when you go and talk to the people and get feedback , that people are reading you and appreciate that woman .
there were instances when i got calls from people who wanted to help .
so when i get such responses , it makes you feel on top of the world .
that you are actually doing something , your pieces make a difference .
that 's what keeps you going .
it 's very intoxicating .
so it must have been very frustrating to come to germany as a refugee and at the beginning not to be able to work ?
it was more than frustration in the beginning , because you are totally isolated , you do n't have friends or family and it makes you feel like you are isolated from the rest of the world .
journalism becomes part of your digestive system , as you can say .
you read the news and it keeps you going , it runs in your blood .
so once you are taken out of that , you feel very much dehydrated for news .
so after spending some months in the refugee camp , you 've joined deutsche welle for a few months .
what do you think the future will be like ?
would you like to return to pakistan at some time or is that not an option at the moment ?
it is not the option at the moment , because i do n't want to put my family back at risk .
i do n't want to put myself back at risk .
so not at the moment .
but yes , i would love to go back .
no matter what lies in front of you , you have to try .
you ca n't give up .
if you give up , you die .
even if not physically , then at least mentally you accept defeat .
and that is not a thing i 've been trained to do by my parents .
they always told me to keep trying and give 100 percent .

dw : pakistan is considered one of the most dangerous countries for journalists .
what is your own experience ?
meera jamal : i suppose that is pretty much true .
the danger which is faced by the journalist is on two folds ; one is from the secret services .
you see a lot of incidents of journalists being harassed , beaten up , or killed by them .
and the other is the islamic radical groups .
why did you leave pakistan ?
it was pretty much because of the islamic radical group .
i was writing on the issues of women 's rights and basic human rights , in which you have to , at times , criticise certain norms or rules followed by the islamic clerics or created by them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal 's writing focussed on women 's rights in pakistan and this did n't go well with the islamic radial groups .
for example , on international women 's day , i wrote about a prostitute - a 56 year old woman whose children never knew she was a prostitute .
i thought that she was a great example of how a woman can sacrifice herself in order to support her children .
that was really looked down upon .
the other example was my series of articles on women 's rights , for example the right of divorce , the right of separation , the right of child custody .
how were you threatened ?
initially it was phone calls , then it went on to be doubled by letters .
then , in august 2008 , i was stopped by four men on my way to work , which really scared me .
they threatened me , for my life .
it was really scary .
i felt so much in danger for myself and i felt like i was putting my family at risk .
i was totally shattered actually because of it .
you lived in karachi at the time , what do you think would have happened if you had stayed on in pakistan , despite the threats ?
i suppose these people are really unpredictable .
there are incidents where they can throw acid on you , or they can ambush you .
they can do anything .
being a woman , it 's the most difficult thing .
there 's a particular kind of asian mentality , where a woman represents the entire family 's moral standing in the society .
and if anything goes bad with the woman , the entire family would be defamed .
it 's pretty much difficult for you to combat that , and being a woman , it was horrible for me .
so they could have maybe killed you ?
yes , but killing is the easiest part .
your family and your defamation for your family , that 's the horrible part .
i think i would never want to have that happen to them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal describes herself as a " non-believer " do you think the fact that you were a woman reporting about women 's issues , was that the most enraging bit to the people who threatened you ?
or was it the issues you reported about ?
it was the issues , it was me being a woman and writing about such issues , instigating other woman and convincing them of my ideas .
it was partly because of my personal life as well , because i am a non-believer , which catches attention a lot .
" she 's a non-believer and she 's writing to defame islam " .
so these kinds of things triggered them off .
what triggered you in a situation that 's so difficult for journalists , to join the profession ?
actually , you feel very much satisfied when you are doing something that can improve society , or at least you feel that it can bring a change , even a little bit .
for instance , the write-ups i 've done are basically on social issues , human rights .
when you go and talk to the people and get feedback , that people are reading you and appreciate that woman .
there were instances when i got calls from people who wanted to help .
so when i get such responses , it makes you feel on top of the world .
that you are actually doing something , your pieces make a difference .
that 's what keeps you going .
it 's very intoxicating .
so it must have been very frustrating to come to germany as a refugee and at the beginning not to be able to work ?
it was more than frustration in the beginning , because you are totally isolated , you do n't have friends or family and it makes you feel like you are isolated from the rest of the world .
journalism becomes part of your digestive system , as you can say .
you read the news and it keeps you going , it runs in your blood .
so once you are taken out of that , you feel very much dehydrated for news .
so after spending some months in the refugee camp , you 've joined deutsche welle for a few months .
what do you think the future will be like ?
would you like to return to pakistan at some time or is that not an option at the moment ?
it is not the option at the moment , because i do n't want to put my family back at risk .
i do n't want to put myself back at risk .
so not at the moment .
but yes , i would love to go back .
no matter what lies in front of you , you have to try .
you ca n't give up .
if you give up , you die .
even if not physically , then at least mentally you accept defeat .
and that is not a thing i 've been trained to do by my parents .
they always told me to keep trying and give 100 percent .

when you go and talk to the people and get feedback , that people are reading you and appreciate that woman .
there were instances when i got calls from people who wanted to help .
so when i get such responses , it makes you feel on top of the world .
that you are actually doing something , your pieces make a difference .
that 's what keeps you going .
it 's very intoxicating .
so it must have been very frustrating to come to germany as a refugee and at the beginning not to be able to work ?
it was more than frustration in the beginning , because you are totally isolated , you do n't have friends or family and it makes you feel like you are isolated from the rest of the world .
journalism becomes part of your digestive system , as you can say .
you read the news and it keeps you going , it runs in your blood .
so once you are taken out of that , you feel very much dehydrated for news .
so after spending some months in the refugee camp , you 've joined deutsche welle for a few months .
what do you think the future will be like ?
would you like to return to pakistan at some time or is that not an option at the moment ?
it is not the option at the moment , because i do n't want to put my family back at risk .
i do n't want to put myself back at risk .
so not at the moment .
but yes , i would love to go back .
no matter what lies in front of you , you have to try .
you ca n't give up .
if you give up , you die .
even if not physically , then at least mentally you accept defeat .
and that is not a thing i 've been trained to do by my parents .
they always told me to keep trying and give 100 percent .

" germany has to make its own assessment , " foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner told reporters in berlin .
an interior ministry spokesman added that " every decision is concerned with the individual case . " government officials also said that washington had drawn up an initial list of candidates slated for release , however they declined to say how many names were on the list under an agreement with the us administration to keep that information confidential . the spokesman added that the ministry would make its decisions on a case-by-case basis in consultation with other eu countries and officials from germany 's 16 federal states . he said that the criteria were related to german foreign residency law and would consider whether a detainee posed a security threat to germany . uighur reports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are 241 prisoners left at the guantanamo bay detention center der spiegel news magazine reported on saturday that up to 10 so-called non-dangerous captives were being considered for release in europe . german daily newspaper bild reported that the request concerned 10 chinese ethnic uighurs , who are viewed by beijing as " chinese terrorists .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 03.05.2009 study condemns germany 's car scrapping scheme as waste großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bonus is meant to soften the impact of the recession and promote greener cars researchers claim that germany 's car scrappage scheme - offering a government cash handout to everyone who trades in an old car for a new model - is wasteful because most claimants would have bought a new car anyway . the welt am sonntag newspaper quoted a study by the halle economic research institute -lrb- iwh -rrb- that said three out every four people who bought a new car and pocketed the bonus were intending to buy a new vehicle even without the handout . according to the institute , out of the expected 2 million subsidized car sales , 1.5 million would have happened anyway .
the iwh said the car scrapping incentive could burden the federal budget with 2,6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3,5 billion -rrb- . under the popular scheme , the government offers a 2,500-euro bonus to anyone who puts a car 9 years or older in the crusher and buys a new one . dirk niebel , secretary-general of the business-friendly free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , called the incentive " expensive junk . "

with just four matches to go , wolfsburg have 60 , three clear of champions bayern munich , who beat borussia moenchengladbach 2-1 .
hertha move up to third on 56 points , followed by vfb stuttgart and hamburg on 55 points .
although hertha started the brighter , it was hamburg who drew first blood when jansen steered ivica olic 's cross from the left into the far corner .
despite the early lead , martin jol 's side failed to take control and instead it was the visitors who continued to eke out the better chances in a flat-paced game .
marc stein tested frank rost in the hamburg goal with a shot from distance while rost also did well to turn away a cicero header on 32 minutes .
jansen registered hamburg 's first decent chance of the second period on 51 minutes with a header but jaroslav drobny saved well .
hertha equalized out of nothing on 66 minutes when kacar smashed the ball home from 28 metres out .
in a frantic finale , olic saw a shot saved by drobny , who also pulled off a fantastic reflex save from joris mathijsen to ensure a point for hertha .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's milivoje novakovic fires in the winner milivoje novakovic was the hero for cologne against bremen , tapping in the only goal of the game at the far post after 66 minutes .
the win moves cologne nine points clear of the relegation zone .
in other matches played saturday , schalke 's hopes of qualifying for next season 's europa cup received a setback as they were beaten 2-1 at home by bayer leverkusen .

with just four matches to go , wolfsburg have 60 , three clear of champions bayern munich , who beat borussia moenchengladbach 2-1 .
hertha move up to third on 56 points , followed by vfb stuttgart and hamburg on 55 points .
although hertha started the brighter , it was hamburg who drew first blood when jansen steered ivica olic 's cross from the left into the far corner .
despite the early lead , martin jol 's side failed to take control and instead it was the visitors who continued to eke out the better chances in a flat-paced game .
marc stein tested frank rost in the hamburg goal with a shot from distance while rost also did well to turn away a cicero header on 32 minutes .
jansen registered hamburg 's first decent chance of the second period on 51 minutes with a header but jaroslav drobny saved well .
hertha equalized out of nothing on 66 minutes when kacar smashed the ball home from 28 metres out .
in a frantic finale , olic saw a shot saved by drobny , who also pulled off a fantastic reflex save from joris mathijsen to ensure a point for hertha .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's milivoje novakovic fires in the winner milivoje novakovic was the hero for cologne against bremen , tapping in the only goal of the game at the far post after 66 minutes .

with just four matches to go , wolfsburg have 60 , three clear of champions bayern munich , who beat borussia moenchengladbach 2-1 .
hertha move up to third on 56 points , followed by vfb stuttgart and hamburg on 55 points .
although hertha started the brighter , it was hamburg who drew first blood when jansen steered ivica olic 's cross from the left into the far corner .
despite the early lead , martin jol 's side failed to take control and instead it was the visitors who continued to eke out the better chances in a flat-paced game .
marc stein tested frank rost in the hamburg goal with a shot from distance while rost also did well to turn away a cicero header on 32 minutes .
jansen registered hamburg 's first decent chance of the second period on 51 minutes with a header but jaroslav drobny saved well .
hertha equalized out of nothing on 66 minutes when kacar smashed the ball home from 28 metres out .
in a frantic finale , olic saw a shot saved by drobny , who also pulled off a fantastic reflex save from joris mathijsen to ensure a point for hertha .

the iwh said the car scrapping incentive could burden the federal budget with 2,6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3,5 billion -rrb- . under the popular scheme , the government offers a 2,500-euro bonus to anyone who puts a car 9 years or older in the crusher and buys a new one . dirk niebel , secretary-general of the business-friendly free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , called the incentive " expensive junk . "
the berlin government , he told welt am sonntag , let itself be pushed into an expensive subsidy program by the automobile industry . but the finance ministry in berlin defended the project . " the idea was for somebody who needs a new car to buy it now and not wait till next year , " a spokesman said on sunday . germany earmarked 5 billion euros to fund the anti-recession program .

germany is the second european nation to report a transmission within its borders .
spain 's 13 confirmed cases also include one person who had not recently traveled to mexico , but contracted the disease from his girlfriend , who had visited the country .
domestic transmissions have also occurred in the united states and mexico , according to hacker . " the virus has the potency to spread and it has the potential to change genetically and that 's why we remain concerned and watchful , " hacker said .

" germany is well-armed to counteract an epidemic , if that occurs " merkel told the newspaper , neue presse . " we have all the requirements to quickly deal with the situation if it intensifies .
our next step is to speak with all the states , to determine whether we have sufficient stocks of the anti-viral medication , " she said .
more cases surface in europe ireland has become the latest european country to confirm a case of the virus .
the irish health ministry said the patient had recently returned from mexico and was now recovering well .
italy has also confirmed cases of the h1n1 flu strain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 03.05.2009 threatened pakistani journalist vows to keep writing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meera jamal says she wo n't give up her writing a deutsche welle intern , forced to leave her home in pakistan after receiving death threats , gives details of her ordeal . pakistani journalist , meera jamal , fled to germany last october following a spate of threats in response to her articles .
after spending several months in a german refugee camp , the media watchdog group , reporters without borders helped secure her an internship in deutsche welle 's urdu-speaking news department .
dw : pakistan is considered one of the most dangerous countries for journalists .
what is your own experience ?
meera jamal : i suppose that is pretty much true .
the danger which is faced by the journalist is on two folds ; one is from the secret services .
you see a lot of incidents of journalists being harassed , beaten up , or killed by them .
and the other is the islamic radical groups .
why did you leave pakistan ?
it was pretty much because of the islamic radical group .
i was writing on the issues of women 's rights and basic human rights , in which you have to , at times , criticise certain norms or rules followed by the islamic clerics or created by them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal 's writing focussed on women 's rights in pakistan and this did n't go well with the islamic radial groups .
for example , on international women 's day , i wrote about a prostitute - a 56 year old woman whose children never knew she was a prostitute .
i thought that she was a great example of how a woman can sacrifice herself in order to support her children .
that was really looked down upon .
the other example was my series of articles on women 's rights , for example the right of divorce , the right of separation , the right of child custody .
how were you threatened ?
initially it was phone calls , then it went on to be doubled by letters .
then , in august 2008 , i was stopped by four men on my way to work , which really scared me .
they threatened me , for my life .
it was really scary .
i felt so much in danger for myself and i felt like i was putting my family at risk .
i was totally shattered actually because of it .
you lived in karachi at the time , what do you think would have happened if you had stayed on in pakistan , despite the threats ?
i suppose these people are really unpredictable .
there are incidents where they can throw acid on you , or they can ambush you .
they can do anything .
being a woman , it 's the most difficult thing .
there 's a particular kind of asian mentality , where a woman represents the entire family 's moral standing in the society .
and if anything goes bad with the woman , the entire family would be defamed .
it 's pretty much difficult for you to combat that , and being a woman , it was horrible for me .
so they could have maybe killed you ?
yes , but killing is the easiest part .
your family and your defamation for your family , that 's the horrible part .
i think i would never want to have that happen to them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal describes herself as a " non-believer " do you think the fact that you were a woman reporting about women 's issues , was that the most enraging bit to the people who threatened you ?
or was it the issues you reported about ?
it was the issues , it was me being a woman and writing about such issues , instigating other woman and convincing them of my ideas .
it was partly because of my personal life as well , because i am a non-believer , which catches attention a lot .
" she 's a non-believer and she 's writing to defame islam " .
so these kinds of things triggered them off .
what triggered you in a situation that 's so difficult for journalists , to join the profession ?
actually , you feel very much satisfied when you are doing something that can improve society , or at least you feel that it can bring a change , even a little bit .
for instance , the write-ups i 've done are basically on social issues , human rights .
when you go and talk to the people and get feedback , that people are reading you and appreciate that woman .
there were instances when i got calls from people who wanted to help .
so when i get such responses , it makes you feel on top of the world .
that you are actually doing something , your pieces make a difference .
that 's what keeps you going .
it 's very intoxicating .
so it must have been very frustrating to come to germany as a refugee and at the beginning not to be able to work ?
it was more than frustration in the beginning , because you are totally isolated , you do n't have friends or family and it makes you feel like you are isolated from the rest of the world .
journalism becomes part of your digestive system , as you can say .
you read the news and it keeps you going , it runs in your blood .
so once you are taken out of that , you feel very much dehydrated for news .
so after spending some months in the refugee camp , you 've joined deutsche welle for a few months .
what do you think the future will be like ?
would you like to return to pakistan at some time or is that not an option at the moment ?
it is not the option at the moment , because i do n't want to put my family back at risk .
i do n't want to put myself back at risk .
so not at the moment .
but yes , i would love to go back .
no matter what lies in front of you , you have to try .
you ca n't give up .
if you give up , you die .
even if not physically , then at least mentally you accept defeat .
and that is not a thing i 've been trained to do by my parents .
they always told me to keep trying and give 100 percent .

journalism becomes part of your digestive system , as you can say .
you read the news and it keeps you going , it runs in your blood .
so once you are taken out of that , you feel very much dehydrated for news .
so after spending some months in the refugee camp , you 've joined deutsche welle for a few months .
what do you think the future will be like ?
would you like to return to pakistan at some time or is that not an option at the moment ?
it is not the option at the moment , because i do n't want to put my family back at risk .
i do n't want to put myself back at risk .
so not at the moment .
but yes , i would love to go back .
no matter what lies in front of you , you have to try .
you ca n't give up .
if you give up , you die .
even if not physically , then at least mentally you accept defeat .
and that is not a thing i 've been trained to do by my parents .
they always told me to keep trying and give 100 percent .

after spending several months in a german refugee camp , the media watchdog group , reporters without borders helped secure her an internship in deutsche welle 's urdu-speaking news department .
dw : pakistan is considered one of the most dangerous countries for journalists .
what is your own experience ?
meera jamal : i suppose that is pretty much true .
the danger which is faced by the journalist is on two folds ; one is from the secret services .
you see a lot of incidents of journalists being harassed , beaten up , or killed by them .
and the other is the islamic radical groups .
why did you leave pakistan ?
it was pretty much because of the islamic radical group .
i was writing on the issues of women 's rights and basic human rights , in which you have to , at times , criticise certain norms or rules followed by the islamic clerics or created by them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal 's writing focussed on women 's rights in pakistan and this did n't go well with the islamic radial groups .
for example , on international women 's day , i wrote about a prostitute - a 56 year old woman whose children never knew she was a prostitute .
i thought that she was a great example of how a woman can sacrifice herself in order to support her children .
that was really looked down upon .
the other example was my series of articles on women 's rights , for example the right of divorce , the right of separation , the right of child custody .
how were you threatened ?
initially it was phone calls , then it went on to be doubled by letters .
then , in august 2008 , i was stopped by four men on my way to work , which really scared me .
they threatened me , for my life .
it was really scary .
i felt so much in danger for myself and i felt like i was putting my family at risk .
i was totally shattered actually because of it .
you lived in karachi at the time , what do you think would have happened if you had stayed on in pakistan , despite the threats ?
i suppose these people are really unpredictable .
there are incidents where they can throw acid on you , or they can ambush you .
they can do anything .
being a woman , it 's the most difficult thing .
there 's a particular kind of asian mentality , where a woman represents the entire family 's moral standing in the society .
and if anything goes bad with the woman , the entire family would be defamed .
it 's pretty much difficult for you to combat that , and being a woman , it was horrible for me .
so they could have maybe killed you ?
yes , but killing is the easiest part .
your family and your defamation for your family , that 's the horrible part .
i think i would never want to have that happen to them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal describes herself as a " non-believer " do you think the fact that you were a woman reporting about women 's issues , was that the most enraging bit to the people who threatened you ?
or was it the issues you reported about ?
it was the issues , it was me being a woman and writing about such issues , instigating other woman and convincing them of my ideas .
it was partly because of my personal life as well , because i am a non-believer , which catches attention a lot .
" she 's a non-believer and she 's writing to defame islam " .
so these kinds of things triggered them off .
what triggered you in a situation that 's so difficult for journalists , to join the profession ?
actually , you feel very much satisfied when you are doing something that can improve society , or at least you feel that it can bring a change , even a little bit .
for instance , the write-ups i 've done are basically on social issues , human rights .
when you go and talk to the people and get feedback , that people are reading you and appreciate that woman .
there were instances when i got calls from people who wanted to help .
so when i get such responses , it makes you feel on top of the world .
that you are actually doing something , your pieces make a difference .
that 's what keeps you going .
it 's very intoxicating .
so it must have been very frustrating to come to germany as a refugee and at the beginning not to be able to work ?
it was more than frustration in the beginning , because you are totally isolated , you do n't have friends or family and it makes you feel like you are isolated from the rest of the world .

yes , but killing is the easiest part .
your family and your defamation for your family , that 's the horrible part .
i think i would never want to have that happen to them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamal describes herself as a " non-believer " do you think the fact that you were a woman reporting about women 's issues , was that the most enraging bit to the people who threatened you ?
or was it the issues you reported about ?
it was the issues , it was me being a woman and writing about such issues , instigating other woman and convincing them of my ideas .
it was partly because of my personal life as well , because i am a non-believer , which catches attention a lot .
" she 's a non-believer and she 's writing to defame islam " .
so these kinds of things triggered them off .
what triggered you in a situation that 's so difficult for journalists , to join the profession ?
actually , you feel very much satisfied when you are doing something that can improve society , or at least you feel that it can bring a change , even a little bit .
for instance , the write-ups i 've done are basically on social issues , human rights .
when you go and talk to the people and get feedback , that people are reading you and appreciate that woman .
there were instances when i got calls from people who wanted to help .
so when i get such responses , it makes you feel on top of the world .
that you are actually doing something , your pieces make a difference .
that 's what keeps you going .
it 's very intoxicating .
so it must have been very frustrating to come to germany as a refugee and at the beginning not to be able to work ?
it was more than frustration in the beginning , because you are totally isolated , you do n't have friends or family and it makes you feel like you are isolated from the rest of the world .
journalism becomes part of your digestive system , as you can say .
you read the news and it keeps you going , it runs in your blood .
so once you are taken out of that , you feel very much dehydrated for news .
so after spending some months in the refugee camp , you 've joined deutsche welle for a few months .
what do you think the future will be like ?
would you like to return to pakistan at some time or is that not an option at the moment ?
it is not the option at the moment , because i do n't want to put my family back at risk .
i do n't want to put myself back at risk .
so not at the moment .
but yes , i would love to go back .
no matter what lies in front of you , you have to try .
you ca n't give up .
if you give up , you die .
even if not physically , then at least mentally you accept defeat .
and that is not a thing i 've been trained to do by my parents .
they always told me to keep trying and give 100 percent .

she tracks down everything from van goghs to james bond 's 1963 aston martin . when victorine stille gets a call from an art collector about a stolen work , the first thing she does is enter the crucial details - like artist , year and frame color - in the so-called art loss register . the central databank was founded in london in 1991 and branched have since been added in new york , amsterdam , paris and cologne - where stille works . " what often happens is that , after it 's stolen , a work circulates through the black market for about two to three years , " said the art detective .
" we have a theory that they turn up again after about 15 years . " long-lost paintings might resurface at art auctions or fairs .
but for the rightful owners , 15 years is too long to wait . cross-check at art fairs aiming to speed up the recovery process , stille , who studied art management in amsterdam , spends much of her work day researching on the internet , scanning art auctions ' web sites .

it was used in both goldfinger and thunderball . " she compared the car to " the scream " by norwegian artist edvard munch , which was stolen from an oslo museum in 2006 and recovered two years later : " those are items that can never be sold , " she said . unlike munch 's masterpiece , the aston martin is still at large - though stille said suspects the thief is more likely to be driving the car around rather than hiding it in a garage somewhere . though the art detective and her colleagues are unlikely to spot james bond 's pride and joy on the way to the supermarket , they do have to rely sometimes on coincidence . " it 's a combination of being active and passive , " said stille .

" germany has to make its own assessment , " foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner told reporters in berlin .
an interior ministry spokesman added that " every decision is concerned with the individual case . " government officials also said that washington had drawn up an initial list of candidates slated for release , however they declined to say how many names were on the list under an agreement with the us administration to keep that information confidential . the spokesman added that the ministry would make its decisions on a case-by-case basis in consultation with other eu countries and officials from germany 's 16 federal states . he said that the criteria were related to german foreign residency law and would consider whether a detainee posed a security threat to germany . uighur reports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are 241 prisoners left at the guantanamo bay detention center der spiegel news magazine reported on saturday that up to 10 so-called non-dangerous captives were being considered for release in europe . german daily newspaper bild reported that the request concerned 10 chinese ethnic uighurs , who are viewed by beijing as " chinese terrorists . "
munich , in the southern german state bavaria , is home to around 500 uighurs , the largest known community in exile . but bavaria 's interior minister joachim herrmann told bild his state would not offer its " candidacy to welcome these people . "
most of the 17 uighurs held at guantanamo have been cleared of being enemy combatants . officials say it will be critical for the german government to be assured that none of the released prisoners have ties to terrorist networks .
us officials will also have to explain why the prisoners can not be sent back to their home countries or settled in the us . around 50 detainees are unable to return to their homelands because of the danger that they will be tortured there . government divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd and cdu appear to be on a collision course over accepting guantanamo inmates us president barack obama fulfilled one of his campaign promises in the first days of his presidency by ordering the closure of the controversial detention center on the cuban coast . now he must decide what to do with the 241 remaining prisoners . us attorney general eric holder said in berlin last week that washington would soon like to release 30 prisoners . while other european nations , including france and portugal , have indicated they are willing to accept guantanamo prisoners , germany 's fractious left-right government is at odds over the issue . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat running for chancellor this year , said in an open letter to obama in january that germany would be willing to take in detainees if it helped him close guantanamo . but the conservative interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said obama could not expect germany to accept freed inmates . according to bild , schaeuble wants first to exhaust all possibilities of their being resettled within the united states . dfm / hf / nrt / tt / rm , ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany has to make its own assessment , " foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner told reporters in berlin .
an interior ministry spokesman added that " every decision is concerned with the individual case . " government officials also said that washington had drawn up an initial list of candidates slated for release , however they declined to say how many names were on the list under an agreement with the us administration to keep that information confidential . the spokesman added that the ministry would make its decisions on a case-by-case basis in consultation with other eu countries and officials from germany 's 16 federal states . he said that the criteria were related to german foreign residency law and would consider whether a detainee posed a security threat to germany . uighur reports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are 241 prisoners left at the guantanamo bay detention center der spiegel news magazine reported on saturday that up to 10 so-called non-dangerous captives were being considered for release in europe . german daily newspaper bild reported that the request concerned 10 chinese ethnic uighurs , who are viewed by beijing as " chinese terrorists . "
munich , in the southern german state bavaria , is home to around 500 uighurs , the largest known community in exile . but bavaria 's interior minister joachim herrmann told bild his state would not offer its " candidacy to welcome these people . "
most of the 17 uighurs held at guantanamo have been cleared of being enemy combatants . officials say it will be critical for the german government to be assured that none of the released prisoners have ties to terrorist networks .
us officials will also have to explain why the prisoners can not be sent back to their home countries or settled in the us . around 50 detainees are unable to return to their homelands because of the danger that they will be tortured there . government divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd and cdu appear to be on a collision course over accepting guantanamo inmates us president barack obama fulfilled one of his campaign promises in the first days of his presidency by ordering the closure of the controversial detention center on the cuban coast . now he must decide what to do with the 241 remaining prisoners . us attorney general eric holder said in berlin last week that washington would soon like to release 30 prisoners . while other european nations , including france and portugal , have indicated they are willing to accept guantanamo prisoners , germany 's fractious left-right government is at odds over the issue . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat running for chancellor this year , said in an open letter to obama in january that germany would be willing to take in detainees if it helped him close guantanamo . but the conservative interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said obama could not expect germany to accept freed inmates . according to bild , schaeuble wants first to exhaust all possibilities of their being resettled within the united states . dfm / hf / nrt / tt / rm , ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany has to make its own assessment , " foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner told reporters in berlin .
an interior ministry spokesman added that " every decision is concerned with the individual case . " government officials also said that washington had drawn up an initial list of candidates slated for release , however they declined to say how many names were on the list under an agreement with the us administration to keep that information confidential . the spokesman added that the ministry would make its decisions on a case-by-case basis in consultation with other eu countries and officials from germany 's 16 federal states . he said that the criteria were related to german foreign residency law and would consider whether a detainee posed a security threat to germany . uighur reports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are 241 prisoners left at the guantanamo bay detention center der spiegel news magazine reported on saturday that up to 10 so-called non-dangerous captives were being considered for release in europe . german daily newspaper bild reported that the request concerned 10 chinese ethnic uighurs , who are viewed by beijing as " chinese terrorists . "
munich , in the southern german state bavaria , is home to around 500 uighurs , the largest known community in exile . but bavaria 's interior minister joachim herrmann told bild his state would not offer its " candidacy to welcome these people . "
most of the 17 uighurs held at guantanamo have been cleared of being enemy combatants . officials say it will be critical for the german government to be assured that none of the released prisoners have ties to terrorist networks .
us officials will also have to explain why the prisoners can not be sent back to their home countries or settled in the us . around 50 detainees are unable to return to their homelands because of the danger that they will be tortured there . government divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd and cdu appear to be on a collision course over accepting guantanamo inmates us president barack obama fulfilled one of his campaign promises in the first days of his presidency by ordering the closure of the controversial detention center on the cuban coast . now he must decide what to do with the 241 remaining prisoners . us attorney general eric holder said in berlin last week that washington would soon like to release 30 prisoners . while other european nations , including france and portugal , have indicated they are willing to accept guantanamo prisoners , germany 's fractious left-right government is at odds over the issue . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat running for chancellor this year , said in an open letter to obama in january that germany would be willing to take in detainees if it helped him close guantanamo . but the conservative interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said obama could not expect germany to accept freed inmates . according to bild , schaeuble wants first to exhaust all possibilities of their being resettled within the united states . dfm / hf / nrt / tt / rm , ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany has to make its own assessment , " foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner told reporters in berlin .
an interior ministry spokesman added that " every decision is concerned with the individual case . " government officials also said that washington had drawn up an initial list of candidates slated for release , however they declined to say how many names were on the list under an agreement with the us administration to keep that information confidential . the spokesman added that the ministry would make its decisions on a case-by-case basis in consultation with other eu countries and officials from germany 's 16 federal states . he said that the criteria were related to german foreign residency law and would consider whether a detainee posed a security threat to germany . uighur reports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are 241 prisoners left at the guantanamo bay detention center der spiegel news magazine reported on saturday that up to 10 so-called non-dangerous captives were being considered for release in europe . german daily newspaper bild reported that the request concerned 10 chinese ethnic uighurs , who are viewed by beijing as " chinese terrorists . "
munich , in the southern german state bavaria , is home to around 500 uighurs , the largest known community in exile . but bavaria 's interior minister joachim herrmann told bild his state would not offer its " candidacy to welcome these people . "
most of the 17 uighurs held at guantanamo have been cleared of being enemy combatants . officials say it will be critical for the german government to be assured that none of the released prisoners have ties to terrorist networks .
us officials will also have to explain why the prisoners can not be sent back to their home countries or settled in the us . around 50 detainees are unable to return to their homelands because of the danger that they will be tortured there . government divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd and cdu appear to be on a collision course over accepting guantanamo inmates us president barack obama fulfilled one of his campaign promises in the first days of his presidency by ordering the closure of the controversial detention center on the cuban coast . now he must decide what to do with the 241 remaining prisoners . us attorney general eric holder said in berlin last week that washington would soon like to release 30 prisoners . while other european nations , including france and portugal , have indicated they are willing to accept guantanamo prisoners , germany 's fractious left-right government is at odds over the issue . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat running for chancellor this year , said in an open letter to obama in january that germany would be willing to take in detainees if it helped him close guantanamo . but the conservative interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said obama could not expect germany to accept freed inmates . according to bild , schaeuble wants first to exhaust all possibilities of their being resettled within the united states . dfm / hf / nrt / tt / rm , ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany has to make its own assessment , " foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner told reporters in berlin .
an interior ministry spokesman added that " every decision is concerned with the individual case . " government officials also said that washington had drawn up an initial list of candidates slated for release , however they declined to say how many names were on the list under an agreement with the us administration to keep that information confidential . the spokesman added that the ministry would make its decisions on a case-by-case basis in consultation with other eu countries and officials from germany 's 16 federal states . he said that the criteria were related to german foreign residency law and would consider whether a detainee posed a security threat to germany . uighur reports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are 241 prisoners left at the guantanamo bay detention center der spiegel news magazine reported on saturday that up to 10 so-called non-dangerous captives were being considered for release in europe . german daily newspaper bild reported that the request concerned 10 chinese ethnic uighurs , who are viewed by beijing as " chinese terrorists . "
munich , in the southern german state bavaria , is home to around 500 uighurs , the largest known community in exile . but bavaria 's interior minister joachim herrmann told bild his state would not offer its " candidacy to welcome these people . "
most of the 17 uighurs held at guantanamo have been cleared of being enemy combatants . officials say it will be critical for the german government to be assured that none of the released prisoners have ties to terrorist networks .
us officials will also have to explain why the prisoners can not be sent back to their home countries or settled in the us . around 50 detainees are unable to return to their homelands because of the danger that they will be tortured there . government divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd and cdu appear to be on a collision course over accepting guantanamo inmates us president barack obama fulfilled one of his campaign promises in the first days of his presidency by ordering the closure of the controversial detention center on the cuban coast . now he must decide what to do with the 241 remaining prisoners . us attorney general eric holder said in berlin last week that washington would soon like to release 30 prisoners . while other european nations , including france and portugal , have indicated they are willing to accept guantanamo prisoners , germany 's fractious left-right government is at odds over the issue . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat running for chancellor this year , said in an open letter to obama in january that germany would be willing to take in detainees if it helped him close guantanamo . but the conservative interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said obama could not expect germany to accept freed inmates . according to bild , schaeuble wants first to exhaust all possibilities of their being resettled within the united states . dfm / hf / nrt / tt / rm , ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with just four matches to go , wolfsburg have 60 , three clear of champions bayern munich , who beat borussia moenchengladbach 2-1 .
hertha move up to third on 56 points , followed by vfb stuttgart and hamburg on 55 points .
although hertha started the brighter , it was hamburg who drew first blood when jansen steered ivica olic 's cross from the left into the far corner .
despite the early lead , martin jol 's side failed to take control and instead it was the visitors who continued to eke out the better chances in a flat-paced game .
marc stein tested frank rost in the hamburg goal with a shot from distance while rost also did well to turn away a cicero header on 32 minutes .
jansen registered hamburg 's first decent chance of the second period on 51 minutes with a header but jaroslav drobny saved well .
hertha equalized out of nothing on 66 minutes when kacar smashed the ball home from 28 metres out .
in a frantic finale , olic saw a shot saved by drobny , who also pulled off a fantastic reflex save from joris mathijsen to ensure a point for hertha .

" this is the 16th year the united nations has commemorated world press freedom day on may 3 .
in a statement marking the day , un secretary general ban ki-moon said that a free press played an important roll in solving the world 's problems and gave a voice to minorities .
ban called on all governments to ensure that the rights of journalists are respected .
according to the paris-based reporters without borders 60 journalists were killed and 929 were physically attacked or threatened in 2008 .
roughly a hundred journalists are currently imprisoned and ban said china , cuba and eritrea account for half of those cases .
heavy-handed governments may infringe upon the rights of the press themselves or they may turn a blind eye to attacks against journalists .
ban said he was “ alarmed at the way journalists are increasingly being targeted around the world , and dismayed when such crimes are not thoroughly investigated and prosecuted . ”
ban added that it was unacceptable that fear often led to journalists censoring themselves .
" journalists must be able to do their job free of intimidation and harassment , " he said .

us-iranian reporter roxana saberi was sentenced to eight years in prison last month in tehran on charges of spying for the us government .
in a statement observing world press freedom day , us president barack obama said he was “ especially concerned about the citizens from our own country currently under detention abroad . ”
obama said he was using the occasion to “ sound the alarm about the growing number of journalists silenced by death or jail as they attempt to bring daily news to the public . ”
posthumous award for murdered sri lankan the un cultural agency unesco is to posthumously award sri lankan journalist lasantha wickrematunga its 2009 press freedom prize for his work as a newspaper editor .
wickrematunga was shot dead in early january as he drove to work at the sunday leader , a newspaper critical of the sri lankan government and especially of its bloody and costly war against tamil rebels .

the iwh said the car scrapping incentive could burden the federal budget with 2,6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3,5 billion -rrb- . under the popular scheme , the government offers a 2,500-euro bonus to anyone who puts a car 9 years or older in the crusher and buys a new one . dirk niebel , secretary-general of the business-friendly free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , called the incentive " expensive junk . "
the berlin government , he told welt am sonntag , let itself be pushed into an expensive subsidy program by the automobile industry . but the finance ministry in berlin defended the project . " the idea was for somebody who needs a new car to buy it now and not wait till next year , " a spokesman said on sunday . germany earmarked 5 billion euros to fund the anti-recession program .

services across wales , from refuse collection to home care and from social work to nursery nursing , may be affected by industrial action .
employers have offered people working for local authorities a rise of 0.5 % for 2009-10 .
local government leaders say this is all that they can afford if jobs are to be protected .
other public sector workers , such as teachers , nurses and police officers will receive rises of more than 2 % .
gmb union delegates have met in cardiff to discuss the employers ' offer .
they are upset and angered by it and are in the process of deciding how to oppose it .
senior organiser john phillips told the meeting : " the initial position that the trade unions have taken nationally is that the offer was inadequate , totally inadequate . "
there is no chance of a significant increase on the offer that 's already put down " steve thomas , welsh local government association " it did n't meet any of the aspirations or justifications for pay this year and we were unable to recommend it .
" probably by the end of next friday we 'll be in an informed position as to what gmb members want to do in response to this derisory , insulting and totally inadequate offer that the local government employers have made . "
union officials like unison 's dominic macaskill are particularly upset about what they see as the aggressive negotiating stance taken by the national employers for local government services , who are based in england .
unions have been told that if they do n't accept the 0.5 % offer by 1 june , it will be withdrawn and workers wo n't get any increase .
mr macaskill , head of local government for unison cymru wales , believes that the offer is a " politically motivated act " .
he said : " what 's happened is the local government association , which is the england-based and at the moment tory-controlled organisation , had tabled a 0.5 % pay offer , which in terms of the pay offers which have been in place for other public sector workers is completely out of sync " .
trade union unite also say their members are incensed by the pay offer , especially when it is considered that scottish council workers will get a 2.5 % rise next year , nhs workers will get 2.75 % and teachers and mps will get 2.3 % .
but the welsh local government association 's chief executive argues 0.5 % is now all that can be afforded if council jobs are to be saved during the recession .
steve thomas says the welsh assembly budget will be cut by £ 216m in 2010 , which will mean harsh cuts to councils ' budgets .
he denies the pay offer is a politically-motivated attack on the public sector , and points out that the employers ' negotiating team includes several prominent labour mayors .
mr thomas said : " the pay offer is determined both by context and it 's determined by affordability .
" the people making this offer are not just the conservative party in terms of the lga .
" there 's a range , there 's a cross party organisation in the lga and this goes across the political spectrum . "
mr thomas added that the pay settlement offered is necessary to try to preserve local authority jobs .
he said : " there were 700 redundancies in the welsh context -lrb- 2008 -rrb- .
there are a further 2000 possible job losses in welsh local government in the next 18 months to two years .
" i think what we 've got to try and do at the present time is not so much concentrate on pay , but concentrate on employment . "
as the employers have put the 01 june 2009 deadline on accepting their offer , all three unions are consulting their members about future action .
john phillips , for the gmb union , said : " we can not discount the possibility of industrial action being contemplated during the course of this particular pay round . "
the wlga 's chief executive said the organisation is always concerned at the prospect of industrial action and tries to avoid it at all costs , but that he doubted the public sector workforce currently had " an appetite " for industrial action .
mr thomas said : " i would urge the unions to come back to the negotiating table so we can have meaningful discussions around this .
" there is no chance of a significant increase on the offer that 's already put down . "

services across wales , from refuse collection to home care and from social work to nursery nursing , may be affected by industrial action .
employers have offered people working for local authorities a rise of 0.5 % for 2009-10 .
local government leaders say this is all that they can afford if jobs are to be protected .
other public sector workers , such as teachers , nurses and police officers will receive rises of more than 2 % .
gmb union delegates have met in cardiff to discuss the employers ' offer .
they are upset and angered by it and are in the process of deciding how to oppose it .
senior organiser john phillips told the meeting : " the initial position that the trade unions have taken nationally is that the offer was inadequate , totally inadequate .
there is no chance of a significant increase on the offer that 's already put down steve thomas , welsh local government association " it did n't meet any of the aspirations or justifications for pay this year and we were unable to recommend it .
" probably by the end of next friday we 'll be in an informed position as to what gmb members want to do in response to this derisory , insulting and totally inadequate offer that the local government employers have made . "
union officials like unison 's dominic macaskill are particularly upset about what they see as the aggressive negotiating stance taken by the national employers for local government services , who are based in england .
unions have been told that if they do n't accept the 0.5 % offer by 1 june , it will be withdrawn and workers wo n't get any increase .

unions claim the offer is inadequate but councils say they are trying to protect jobs mr macaskill , head of local government for unison cymru wales , believes that the offer is a " politically motivated act " .
he said : " what 's happened is the local government association , which is the england-based and at the moment tory-controlled organisation , had tabled a 0.5 % pay offer , which in terms of the pay offers which have been in place for other public sector workers is completely out of sync " .
trade union unite also say their members are incensed by the pay offer , especially when it is considered that scottish council workers will get a 2.5 % rise next year , nhs workers will get 2.75 % and teachers and mps will get 2.3 % .
but the welsh local government association 's chief executive argues 0.5 % is now all that can be afforded if council jobs are to be saved during the recession .
steve thomas says the welsh assembly budget will be cut by £ 216m in 2010 , which will mean harsh cuts to councils ' budgets .
he denies the pay offer is a politically-motivated attack on the public sector , and points out that the employers ' negotiating team includes several prominent labour mayors .
the gmb met on friday to discuss the employers ' office mr thomas said : " the pay offer is determined both by context and it 's determined by affordability .
" the people making this offer are not just the conservative party in terms of the lga .
" there 's a range , there 's a cross party organisation in the lga and this goes across the political spectrum . "
mr thomas added that the pay settlement offered is necessary to try to preserve local authority jobs .
he said : " there were 700 redundancies in the welsh context -lrb- 2008 -rrb- .
there are a further 2000 possible job losses in welsh local government in the next 18 months to two years .
" i think what we 've got to try and do at the present time is not so much concentrate on pay , but concentrate on employment . "
as the employers have put the 01 june 2009 deadline on accepting their offer , all three unions are consulting their members about future action .
john phillips , for the gmb union , said : " we can not discount the possibility of industrial action being contemplated during the course of this particular pay round . "
the wlga 's chief executive said the organisation is always concerned at the prospect of industrial action and tries to avoid it at all costs , but that he doubted the public sector workforce currently had " an appetite " for industrial action .
mr thomas said : " i would urge the unions to come back to the negotiating table so we can have meaningful discussions around this .
" there is no chance of a significant increase on the offer that 's already put down . "
