on sunday , chinese premier wen jiabao reflected the close ties between the two pledging $ 10 billion in loans and announcing that tariffs on 95 percent of products from the least-developed african nations would be removed .
china 's foreign minister said on monday that these ties would ultimately help africans " improve their livelihood . "
" china is present in almost every african country , " said denis tull , a researcher with the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" and it 's not just a matter of buying raw materials nor is it part of a grand strategy . "
dominic johnson , africa expert with the berlin-based newspaper tageszeitung told deutsche welle that , " there seems to be a shift away on the chinese side from simply investing in natural resource extraction or buying oil toward investing in african infrastructure . "
a few days ago , china and nigeria signed a contract on building a railway line - a much-needed development as the railway infrastructure in africa 's most populous state dates back to colonial times .
the first ones to benefit from a better transport system in nigeria are the chinese themselves .
chinese companies are keen to develop the nigerian market , as johnson explained : " nigeria has a rapidly growing middle class .
and geographically it is located perfectly to supply the entire west african market .
so it 's a very interesting country for doing business . "
the chinese export mainly basic consumer goods to nigeria - clothes , shoes , but also electronics and motorcycles .
" chinese traders have been very good at settling down in african markets , bringing in lots of goods at low prices and really pushing themselves into the consumer market , " said johnson .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese companies are investing in african infrastructure projects africa has become a busy hub it does n't do any harm that china is an emerging country itself , said johnson , on the contrary : " in fact it strengthens the chinese , because on the political level they can say to the africans : we 're both against the mighty west .
some african leaders feel quite happy about that .
they look at china and say : forty years ago china was as poor as us , look at them now , should n't we be doing the same thing ? "
however , tull only partially agrees with that assessment : " frankly speaking this may contribute to some sympathy , but i do n't think this is substantially influencing the relationship .
i think both sides , the chinese and the african side are very pragmatic in their relationship and i would n't say that there is so much spinning or ideology involved , " he said .
after all the chinese are not the only new players on the african market , as tull explains : " there is an increased presence of other emerging countries like india , like brazil , etc .
this means there is certainly more competition .
africa has become a busy place , politically and economically . "
no room for human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa 's relationship with former colonial powers like germany is still strong it also means that european partners have to share their interests with others , but tull is convinced that africa 's relationship with its former colonial powers will remain a special one : " europe 's relationship with africa has a certain depth , an historical depth , and it certainly has a lot of intensity .
therefore i do n't think that the chinese influence will grow to an extent that there would be no europeans left in africa in 20 years time or so .
the europeans will always have a presence there and will always maintain these networks , contacts and long-standing connections . "
it remains to be seen however how much influence western countries will have in africa in the future .
china presents itself to african states as a partner and not as a donor .
it makes deals without political conditions , but not necessarily without political impact .
johnson says that china tends to support the government of the day , like in sudan : " china is one of the main arm suppliers for the government of sudan .
that has made a difference for the darfur war .
also china stopped the un security council from taking measures against sudan .
so there is certainly political influence there . "
guinea is another example , says tull , " where it has been reported that the government has signed a seven-billion-dollar deal with chinese companies at a time when the new military regime is under immense international pressure over the recent massacre of civilians in the capital of conakry .
that too illustrates that the chinese are really not paying attention at all to human rights . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 07.11.2009 a german gangsta-rapper changes his tune großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapper samy deluxe engages youth with his organization former gangster-rapper samy deluxe has recultivated his image and is targeting german youth with his new positive message .
through his organization crossover , deluxe hopes to bring young adults together to promote better understanding . samy deluxe is not only successful , having sold over one million albums , he also has a voice that resonates with young people , especially between the ages of 15 and 20 .
this hip-hop idol also has a talent for bringing politics and social engagement to the attention of an otherwise disinterested generation through his songs .
messages like " i have a chance to make something of myself ” and " there is a lot we can do to fight off boredom " permeate his lyrics .
deluxe was not always so socially-minded .
he began his career as a rapper surrounding himself with the usual luxurious cars and beautiful women .
at that time his rhymes generally concentrated on sex , drugs and his own magnificence .
since then , deluxe has successfully transformed himself into a hip-hop artist known for his contemplative lyrics .
today his music showcases his thoughts on things like national identity , the condition of the german social state and the importance of giving today 's youth better opportunities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crossover program has had a successful start on his new cd " dis wo ich herkomm " -lrb- this is where i come from -rrb- , samy deluxe croons to soft reggae beats : this is our germany this is your germany this is the land where we live this is the new germany … a change in tone deluxe is considered one of the most successful german rappers ever , and he is well aware of his influence on young adults .
the change of tone in his music reflects this awareness .
" the concept for this album was to give people courage and to spur them to think critically about their lives and their surroundings , " the hip-hop artist explained .
born samuel sorge , the son of a sudanese father and german mother , deluxe grew up in hamburg , where he was exposed at an early age to social exclusion and ghettoization .
early in his life he was forced to develop strategies to overcome such barriers .
growing up in a mostly white area , deluxe was keenly aware of his difference from his friends and neighbors .
he consequently surrounded himself with other black german friends , hoping to discover his african roots .
in school he also had many turkish and croatian friends and he later went to the united states .
" i 've come to know many cultures and i feel comfortable when i 'm in a group that 's different from me . "
deluxe also addresses the youth of the ' hartz iv generation ' -lrb- those dependent on the german welfare system -rrb- in his songs .
many of these young adults do not foresee a good future for themselves .
but deluxe feels that the way the german system is organized , with a large middle class , young adults really do have a chance to make something of themselves .
building teams to overcome barriers in order to share his experiences with others , samy deluxe founded the non-profit organization crossover , along with designer julia von dohnanyi and marvin willoughby , a former german national basketball player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making music is one of the crossover methods von dohnanyi lived in the united states for many years and understands how important communication is in breaking down barriers .
“ the more people you know and the more types of people you get to know , the easier it is in life .
if you close yourself off and only have a ' my way is the right way ' attitude , life will be tough , " she commented .
crossover has organized basketball and hip-hop workshops at several secondary schools in hamburg to bring together students of different social backgrounds .
the program teamed up young people from exclusive residential areas with those of socially disadvantaged backgrounds and challenged them to make their own rhymes and beats .
many of the workshops were advertized across germany and attracted youth from all over country , partially due to deluxe 's name .
one of the young adults who participated was 17-year-old tom ulris from aschaffenberg .
he was excited about the sense of community that developed out of teamwork .
" i found it fascinating to learn about the differences between young people from all over germany , " he said .
" some of us came from the east and some from the west , but after an hour , it felt like we were one team , ” tom commented .
integration is a challenge for both sides crossover places a lot of emphasis on integration , regardless of whether the young adults are rich or poor , from eastern or western germany , or they are from immigrant families .
von dohnanyi feels that it is very important for youth to believe in the process of integration .
to encourage this belief , she urges team work in which the same expectations are placed upon everyone .
only when each person does his or her share can the project be successful .
sophie niebergal also believes in the value of cultural diversity in germany .
this is why she decided to do a one-year internship with the crossover organization .
she wants to work with young adults to help them start breaking down the barriers that still divide them .
as his organization grows in size and popularity among young people , samy deluxe may start to believe that some of the lyrics of his songs are ringing true . … it 's about time that people start to wake up and begin to speak about something other than celebrities , football and the weather , like how we can improve the conditions for our youth and right now because this is our germany this is your germany … author : zoran arbutina / gmb editor : louisa schaefer / bk send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

through his organization crossover , deluxe hopes to bring young adults together to promote better understanding . samy deluxe is not only successful , having sold over one million albums , he also has a voice that resonates with young people , especially between the ages of 15 and 20 .
this hip-hop idol also has a talent for bringing politics and social engagement to the attention of an otherwise disinterested generation through his songs .
messages like " i have a chance to make something of myself ” and " there is a lot we can do to fight off boredom " permeate his lyrics .
deluxe was not always so socially-minded .
he began his career as a rapper surrounding himself with the usual luxurious cars and beautiful women .
at that time his rhymes generally concentrated on sex , drugs and his own magnificence .
since then , deluxe has successfully transformed himself into a hip-hop artist known for his contemplative lyrics .
today his music showcases his thoughts on things like national identity , the condition of the german social state and the importance of giving today 's youth better opportunities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crossover program has had a successful start on his new cd " dis wo ich herkomm " -lrb- this is where i come from -rrb- , samy deluxe croons to soft reggae beats : this is our germany this is your germany this is the land where we live this is the new germany … a change in tone deluxe is considered one of the most successful german rappers ever , and he is well aware of his influence on young adults .
the change of tone in his music reflects this awareness .
" the concept for this album was to give people courage and to spur them to think critically about their lives and their surroundings , " the hip-hop artist explained .
born samuel sorge , the son of a sudanese father and german mother , deluxe grew up in hamburg , where he was exposed at an early age to social exclusion and ghettoization .
early in his life he was forced to develop strategies to overcome such barriers .
growing up in a mostly white area , deluxe was keenly aware of his difference from his friends and neighbors .
he consequently surrounded himself with other black german friends , hoping to discover his african roots .
in school he also had many turkish and croatian friends and he later went to the united states .
" i 've come to know many cultures and i feel comfortable when i 'm in a group that 's different from me . "
deluxe also addresses the youth of the ' hartz iv generation ' -lrb- those dependent on the german welfare system -rrb- in his songs .
many of these young adults do not foresee a good future for themselves .
but deluxe feels that the way the german system is organized , with a large middle class , young adults really do have a chance to make something of themselves .
building teams to overcome barriers in order to share his experiences with others , samy deluxe founded the non-profit organization crossover , along with designer julia von dohnanyi and marvin willoughby , a former german national basketball player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making music is one of the crossover methods von dohnanyi lived in the united states for many years and understands how important communication is in breaking down barriers .
“ the more people you know and the more types of people you get to know , the easier it is in life .
if you close yourself off and only have a ' my way is the right way ' attitude , life will be tough , " she commented .
crossover has organized basketball and hip-hop workshops at several secondary schools in hamburg to bring together students of different social backgrounds .
the program teamed up young people from exclusive residential areas with those of socially disadvantaged backgrounds and challenged them to make their own rhymes and beats .
many of the workshops were advertized across germany and attracted youth from all over country , partially due to deluxe 's name .
one of the young adults who participated was 17-year-old tom ulris from aschaffenberg .
he was excited about the sense of community that developed out of teamwork .
" i found it fascinating to learn about the differences between young people from all over germany , " he said .
" some of us came from the east and some from the west , but after an hour , it felt like we were one team , ” tom commented .
integration is a challenge for both sides crossover places a lot of emphasis on integration , regardless of whether the young adults are rich or poor , from eastern or western germany , or they are from immigrant families .
von dohnanyi feels that it is very important for youth to believe in the process of integration .
to encourage this belief , she urges team work in which the same expectations are placed upon everyone .
only when each person does his or her share can the project be successful .
sophie niebergal also believes in the value of cultural diversity in germany .
this is why she decided to do a one-year internship with the crossover organization .
she wants to work with young adults to help them start breaking down the barriers that still divide them .
as his organization grows in size and popularity among young people , samy deluxe may start to believe that some of the lyrics of his songs are ringing true . … it 's about time that people start to wake up and begin to speak about something other than celebrities , football and the weather , like how we can improve the conditions for our youth and right now because this is our germany this is your germany … author : zoran arbutina / gmb editor : louisa schaefer / bk send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the futuristic design is said to include a large dome and two 55-meter minarets .
the construction of the mosque , which is expected to be completed in two years ' time , is set to begin after a long and acrimonious dispute between ditib and non-muslim residents of the city which is home to the cologne cathedral , one of the most renowned cathedrals in the world .

" you are all part of what is an historic moment for us , " she added . fritz schramma , the former mayor of cologne , who is from chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said that the architecture of the mosque was " a symbol of a budding flower , " inviting people in .
the futuristic design is said to include a large dome and two 55-meter minarets .
the construction of the mosque , which is expected to be completed in two years ' time , is set to begin after a long and acrimonious dispute between ditib and non-muslim residents of the city which is home to the cologne cathedral , one of the most renowned cathedrals in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing prokoeln group held a demonstration against the mosque opponents of the mosque say it will spoil cologne 's skyline , by diverting attention from the gothic cathedral .
right-wing extremists have been particularly vocal in their opposition to the construction of the mosque and staged a small protest on saturday .
the heated debate leading up to the ceremony echoes the tensions that emerged in berlin where a mosque was constructed in recent years .
some analysts say it points to the intensifying conflict between a growing muslim community in the country and across western europe .
in the end , ditib struck a compromise , agreeing not to broadcast the call to prayer in order to avoid friction with the non-muslim residents of the neighborhood .
at the ceremony , thomas kufen , integration commissioner of the state of north rhine-westphalia , described the islamic house of worship as a sign that muslims " had arrived " in the german society .
" this mosque will be a piece of jewelry , " he added .
" it has been a long road , " kufen said , referring to the difficult and prolonged discussions over the construction of the mosque .
" it gave rise to hostility and hurt . "
however , he said the fact that the foundation stone had been laid was a sign that xenophobia stands no chance. rb / dpa / epd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the two murders provoked international condemnation in january . one of two suspects arrested for the high-profile killings of two people who exposed abuses of the russian army in chechnya has confessed , his lawyer said friday .
but the motive of 24-year-old nikita tikhonov , who was charged with the murders this week along with yevgenia khasis , was " personal and in no way linked to his professional activities , " lawyer evgeni skirpelev said .
anastasia baburova of the opposition newspaper novaya gazeta had been working with markelov when they were killed together on january 19 . skirpelev told reporters that his client tikhonov " regretted that she was next to the lawyer " when they were shot .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the killings caused outrage in russia and abroad tikhonov also apparently denied an accusation by the head of the fsb security service , alexander bortnikov , that he was a member of an extreme nationalist group .
bortnikov said the unnamed group was amassing weapons and had been implicated in a racist murder .
the fsb chief made the accusation while briefing president dmitry medvedev about the arrests .
tikhonov also insisted that he had acted alone in the killings .
russian newspaper kommersant reported that investigators believe khasis tailed the victims and informed tikhonov of their whereabouts .
the masked gunman managed to flee after the shootings , carried out in broad daylight on a busy street in the russian capital .
the arrests had been cautiously welcomed by human rights groups , who complain that many killings of russian journalists and activists go unsolved. bk / afp / ap editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on sunday , chinese premier wen jiabao reflected the close ties between the two pledging $ 10 billion in loans and announcing that tariffs on 95 percent of products from the least-developed african nations would be removed .
china 's foreign minister said on monday that these ties would ultimately help africans " improve their livelihood . "
" china is present in almost every african country , " said denis tull , a researcher with the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" and it 's not just a matter of buying raw materials nor is it part of a grand strategy . "
dominic johnson , africa expert with the berlin-based newspaper tageszeitung told deutsche welle that , " there seems to be a shift away on the chinese side from simply investing in natural resource extraction or buying oil toward investing in african infrastructure . "
a few days ago , china and nigeria signed a contract on building a railway line - a much-needed development as the railway infrastructure in africa 's most populous state dates back to colonial times .
the first ones to benefit from a better transport system in nigeria are the chinese themselves .
chinese companies are keen to develop the nigerian market , as johnson explained : " nigeria has a rapidly growing middle class .
and geographically it is located perfectly to supply the entire west african market .
so it 's a very interesting country for doing business . "
the chinese export mainly basic consumer goods to nigeria - clothes , shoes , but also electronics and motorcycles .
" chinese traders have been very good at settling down in african markets , bringing in lots of goods at low prices and really pushing themselves into the consumer market , " said johnson .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese companies are investing in african infrastructure projects africa has become a busy hub it does n't do any harm that china is an emerging country itself , said johnson , on the contrary : " in fact it strengthens the chinese , because on the political level they can say to the africans : we 're both against the mighty west .
some african leaders feel quite happy about that .
they look at china and say : forty years ago china was as poor as us , look at them now , should n't we be doing the same thing ? "
however , tull only partially agrees with that assessment : " frankly speaking this may contribute to some sympathy , but i do n't think this is substantially influencing the relationship .
i think both sides , the chinese and the african side are very pragmatic in their relationship and i would n't say that there is so much spinning or ideology involved , " he said .
after all the chinese are not the only new players on the african market , as tull explains : " there is an increased presence of other emerging countries like india , like brazil , etc .
this means there is certainly more competition .
africa has become a busy place , politically and economically . "
no room for human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa 's relationship with former colonial powers like germany is still strong it also means that european partners have to share their interests with others , but tull is convinced that africa 's relationship with its former colonial powers will remain a special one : " europe 's relationship with africa has a certain depth , an historical depth , and it certainly has a lot of intensity .
therefore i do n't think that the chinese influence will grow to an extent that there would be no europeans left in africa in 20 years time or so .
the europeans will always have a presence there and will always maintain these networks , contacts and long-standing connections . "
it remains to be seen however how much influence western countries will have in africa in the future .
china presents itself to african states as a partner and not as a donor .
it makes deals without political conditions , but not necessarily without political impact .
johnson says that china tends to support the government of the day , like in sudan : " china is one of the main arm suppliers for the government of sudan .
that has made a difference for the darfur war .
also china stopped the un security council from taking measures against sudan .
so there is certainly political influence there . "
guinea is another example , says tull , " where it has been reported that the government has signed a seven-billion-dollar deal with chinese companies at a time when the new military regime is under immense international pressure over the recent massacre of civilians in the capital of conakry .
that too illustrates that the chinese are really not paying attention at all to human rights . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 07.11.2009 new ideas abound at the inventor 's fair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kitty clap represented just one of almost 800 inventions on display in nuremberg international inventors meet in nuremberg to display their prototypes from november 5 to 8 .
young students show promising potential , but one aisle remains empty : the iranian group did n't get visas . every year hundreds of inventors from all over the world come to nuremberg 's inventor 's fair iena to show off their latest ideas .
about 800 inventions from 33 countries are on display this year , presenting a wide range of inventions from improved household appliances to high-tech equipment .
according to iena , the number of presented inventions exceeds previous presentations in iena 's 60-year history .
many individual inventors from germany take part in signo -lrb- protection of ideas for commercial usage -rrb- inventor 's clubs .
38 of these locally organized clubs present about 190 ideas on this year 's fair .
young inventors in focus especially young inventors draw attention to their ideas .
many young students are part of inventor 's clubs at their school and professionally introduce their products to trade experts . eleven-year old raphael krauthann from signo invention club " querdenker " -lrb- " lateral thinker " -rrb- presents his idea on how to reach for crutches on the floor with a magnetic device .
he developed his idea when one of his friends was struggling with crutches because they kept falling on the floor .
" it was really annoying , so i said i 'm going to invent something , " explained raphael krauthann .
other kids from the " querdenker " club in ingolstadt also had ideas with great potential .
andreas finkenzeller 's device prevents burning by accident from an electric iron .
the 13-year-old invented a system that stops the electricity flow in an iron if it has not been moved in a certain time period .
and michael stamp , 14 , who had to visit the hospital because fireworks exploded in his hand developed a device that lids the explosive charge in a safe distance by stepping on a handle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : displayed inventions ranged from household appliances to high-tech equipment 20-year-old florian nuber was facing a different kind of problem .
his cat brought dead mice inside his parents ' house , so he grabbed two of his apprenticeship colleges at wodego to find a solution .
florian nuber , christoph seger and sebastian soderer then invented the kitty clap which uses sensors to check the cat 's outlines .
it will only allow the cat to come in if it is not carrying a mouse .
if the cat is transporting a mouse , its figure would be different . antibacterial solutions in times of swine flu and other potential infections , inventions such as spanish inventor juan edilbato rodriguez morales ' automatic hygienic mat come in handy .
first the rotating brush moistened with water and disinfectant cleans the shoe , then the dryer eliminates the remaining water .
this could be used in hospitals , at airports or other places where a lot of people gather to prevent germ spreading .
an antibacterial door handle and antibacterial pens also reduce the chance of infection with germs .
a lot of infections in hospitals are caused by door handles because everyone touches them , said bruno gruber , a professional inventor of 33 years experience .
altogether he has registered 400 patents so far .
the most difficult part , he said , is to find someone who wants to produce and sell a product which starts off as a prototype .
" inventing is easy , marketing is my biggest problem , " said gruber .
problems with patents but inventors are also facing problems with patents .
registering patents can take years , claims gruber .
" it should be accelerated , because it is damaging for the industry .
especially in tough times it is important that new ideas get introduced to the market quickly , but the patent office is understaffed . "
approximately 700 patent examiners are working for the german patent office .
gruber said they need to double the workforce .
the german patent office is currently searching for new patent examiners .
bernd antonius from the german patent office admits they are a little behind with patent applications .
another problem for inventors is the rising annual fee to keep the patent .
if inventors do n't find a company right away , they choose to secure the patent until they can find someone who is willing to produce the product .
otherwise their invention could be used by anyone for free .
registering a patent itself is not so expensive , explained gruber , but needing a specialized patent lawyer for complicated matters is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : space reserved for iranian inventors remained empty no visa for iranians iena is meant to be an exchange for international inventors , but this year one aisle remains almost completely empty .
the president of " the first institute of researchers and inventors in iran , " dr. alireza rastegar , said he did n't get visa appointments for a group of 45 young inventors at the german embassy in tehran even though he applied in time .
" we have been coming to iena for the past five years , and we never had a problem , " said rastegar .
" i am very very angry .
the iranian booths are empty .
this is a very bad position for us and this exhibition . "
rastegar booked 72 square meters -lrb- 775 square feet -rrb- of the fair for young iranian inventors .
he himself could travel to germany because he holds a swiss visa ; the few students who are at the fair got visas through italy or a family invitation from germany , he said .
that 's why babak khodaparast could present his emergency cooling system that can be used to transport a human organ in a cold device .
kambiz shirzadian , who has lived in germany for 30 years , came to represent his nephew 's booth because he did n't get a visa as well .
according to shirzadian , when he asked the german embassy in tehran about the visa application , he was told such an application did n't exist .
lydia zetl , project manager of iena , is surprised that the iranian group did n't get their visa appointments .
" for me it was obvious that they would get their visas , because they are exhibiting for several years now and it has always worked in the past . "
she said she was told that the iranian group was too late in order to get an appointment .
rastegar said he is going to discuss the issue with the iranian ambassador in berlin on monday .
for shirzadian the worst part is the disappointment the young people must feel who were eager to present their ideas and to meet international researchers .

young students show promising potential , but one aisle remains empty : the iranian group did n't get visas . every year hundreds of inventors from all over the world come to nuremberg 's inventor 's fair iena to show off their latest ideas .
about 800 inventions from 33 countries are on display this year , presenting a wide range of inventions from improved household appliances to high-tech equipment .
according to iena , the number of presented inventions exceeds previous presentations in iena 's 60-year history .
many individual inventors from germany take part in signo -lrb- protection of ideas for commercial usage -rrb- inventor 's clubs .
38 of these locally organized clubs present about 190 ideas on this year 's fair .
young inventors in focus especially young inventors draw attention to their ideas .
many young students are part of inventor 's clubs at their school and professionally introduce their products to trade experts . eleven-year old raphael krauthann from signo invention club " querdenker " -lrb- " lateral thinker " -rrb- presents his idea on how to reach for crutches on the floor with a magnetic device .
he developed his idea when one of his friends was struggling with crutches because they kept falling on the floor .
" it was really annoying , so i said i 'm going to invent something , " explained raphael krauthann .
other kids from the " querdenker " club in ingolstadt also had ideas with great potential .
andreas finkenzeller 's device prevents burning by accident from an electric iron .
the 13-year-old invented a system that stops the electricity flow in an iron if it has not been moved in a certain time period .
and michael stamp , 14 , who had to visit the hospital because fireworks exploded in his hand developed a device that lids the explosive charge in a safe distance by stepping on a handle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : displayed inventions ranged from household appliances to high-tech equipment 20-year-old florian nuber was facing a different kind of problem .
his cat brought dead mice inside his parents ' house , so he grabbed two of his apprenticeship colleges at wodego to find a solution .
florian nuber , christoph seger and sebastian soderer then invented the kitty clap which uses sensors to check the cat 's outlines .
it will only allow the cat to come in if it is not carrying a mouse .
if the cat is transporting a mouse , its figure would be different . antibacterial solutions in times of swine flu and other potential infections , inventions such as spanish inventor juan edilbato rodriguez morales ' automatic hygienic mat come in handy .
first the rotating brush moistened with water and disinfectant cleans the shoe , then the dryer eliminates the remaining water .
this could be used in hospitals , at airports or other places where a lot of people gather to prevent germ spreading .
an antibacterial door handle and antibacterial pens also reduce the chance of infection with germs .
a lot of infections in hospitals are caused by door handles because everyone touches them , said bruno gruber , a professional inventor of 33 years experience .
altogether he has registered 400 patents so far .
the most difficult part , he said , is to find someone who wants to produce and sell a product which starts off as a prototype .
" inventing is easy , marketing is my biggest problem , " said gruber .
problems with patents but inventors are also facing problems with patents .
registering patents can take years , claims gruber .
" it should be accelerated , because it is damaging for the industry .
especially in tough times it is important that new ideas get introduced to the market quickly , but the patent office is understaffed . "
approximately 700 patent examiners are working for the german patent office .
gruber said they need to double the workforce .
the german patent office is currently searching for new patent examiners .
bernd antonius from the german patent office admits they are a little behind with patent applications .
another problem for inventors is the rising annual fee to keep the patent .
if inventors do n't find a company right away , they choose to secure the patent until they can find someone who is willing to produce the product .
otherwise their invention could be used by anyone for free .
registering a patent itself is not so expensive , explained gruber , but needing a specialized patent lawyer for complicated matters is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : space reserved for iranian inventors remained empty no visa for iranians iena is meant to be an exchange for international inventors , but this year one aisle remains almost completely empty .
the president of " the first institute of researchers and inventors in iran , " dr. alireza rastegar , said he did n't get visa appointments for a group of 45 young inventors at the german embassy in tehran even though he applied in time .
" we have been coming to iena for the past five years , and we never had a problem , " said rastegar .
" i am very very angry .
the iranian booths are empty .
this is a very bad position for us and this exhibition . "
rastegar booked 72 square meters -lrb- 775 square feet -rrb- of the fair for young iranian inventors .
he himself could travel to germany because he holds a swiss visa ; the few students who are at the fair got visas through italy or a family invitation from germany , he said .
that 's why babak khodaparast could present his emergency cooling system that can be used to transport a human organ in a cold device .
kambiz shirzadian , who has lived in germany for 30 years , came to represent his nephew 's booth because he did n't get a visa as well .
according to shirzadian , when he asked the german embassy in tehran about the visa application , he was told such an application did n't exist .
lydia zetl , project manager of iena , is surprised that the iranian group did n't get their visa appointments .
" for me it was obvious that they would get their visas , because they are exhibiting for several years now and it has always worked in the past . "
she said she was told that the iranian group was too late in order to get an appointment .
rastegar said he is going to discuss the issue with the iranian ambassador in berlin on monday .
for shirzadian the worst part is the disappointment the young people must feel who were eager to present their ideas and to meet international researchers .

" we ca n't have our soldiers hampered by legal doubts , especially when they are forced to make decisions under extreme time pressure , " guttenberg said .
guttenberg 's comments came after he voiced his support of a controversial airstrike ordered by a german commander in afghanistan in september .
guttenberg backed the decision of colonel georg klein to launch an air attack on two fuel tankers that had been hijacked by taliban militants near a german military base in northern afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's zu guttenberg backs the controversial airstrike according to a nato report , up to 142 people , including several civilians that had gathered around the tankers to siphon fuel after they had stalled , were killed in the strike .
guttenberg acknowledged that civilians were killed in the attack and also that " some procedural errors " were committed .
nonetheless , he put his full support behind colonel klein 's decision , calling it " militarily appropriate . "
criticism from opposition several german politicians have openly disagreed with guttenberg 's backing of the airstrike .
social democrat defense expert rainer arnold told the berlin daily tagesspiegel that guttenberg 's evaluation was " illegitimate and unreasonable . "
" if -lsb- guttenberg -rsb- believes that dropping bombs in afghanistan on large masses of people is alright , then the social democrats can no longer go along with him . "
the defense expert of the green party , omri nouripour , found guttenberg 's justification of the airstrike peculiar , especially considering that guttenberg admitted that mistakes were made .
" this issue should n't be treated as a mere bagatelle . that would make it look like the defense ministry pays no attention to the rules , " nouripour said .
bigger issue at hand the debates caused by the september airstrike have brought up the more large-scale question of whether germany is technically at war in afghanistan .
a court in the eastern state of saxony has passed the klein case on to germany 's top federal prosecution office , which will examine whether it is a matter for international law or german law .
for this to be determined the federal prosecutor must establish whether germany 's participation in the nato isaf mission constitutes an " armed conflict . "
the head of the german military alliance , colonel ulrich kirsch , told the mass-circulated bild zeitung that the german operation in afghanistan constituted war .

former bundeswehr general harald kujat went further , warning of " catastrophic consequences " should germany pursue its investigations of the airstrike and impose penalties on colonel klein .
" every soldier and officer would think twice about assuming any responsibility under such conditions , " he told the daily frankfurter rundschau .
under german constitution , it is illegal for the country to enter a war , except for purposes of defense .
over sixty years following the nazi era , germans remain highly skeptical of military operations .
it was only a decade ago that german troops participated in their first foreign combat mission since the end of wwii .

" we ca n't have our soldiers hampered by legal doubts , especially when they are forced to make decisions under extreme time pressure , " guttenberg said .
guttenberg 's comments came after he voiced his support of a controversial airstrike ordered by a german commander in afghanistan in september .
guttenberg backed the decision of colonel georg klein to launch an air attack on two fuel tankers that had been hijacked by taliban militants near a german military base in northern afghanistan .

" if -lsb- guttenberg -rsb- believes that dropping bombs in afghanistan on large masses of people is alright , then the social democrats can no longer go along with him . "
the defense expert of the green party , omri nouripour , found guttenberg 's justification of the airstrike peculiar , especially considering that guttenberg admitted that mistakes were made .
" this issue should n't be treated as a mere bagatelle . that would make it look like the defense ministry pays no attention to the rules , " nouripour said .
bigger issue at hand the debates caused by the september airstrike have brought up the more large-scale question of whether germany is technically at war in afghanistan .
a court in the eastern state of saxony has passed the klein case on to germany 's top federal prosecution office , which will examine whether it is a matter for international law or german law .
for this to be determined the federal prosecutor must establish whether germany 's participation in the nato isaf mission constitutes an " armed conflict . "
the head of the german military alliance , colonel ulrich kirsch , told the mass-circulated bild zeitung that the german operation in afghanistan constituted war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 07.11.2009 germany worried over vaccine shortage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production shortfalls are causing long waits for the shot vaccine shortages point to a shift in public opinion toward the hazards of the swine flu in germany .
some people are facing waiting periods of weeks before vaccination will be available . only two weeks after beginning a national vaccination campaign against h1n1 , the intial skepticism over the vaccine has apparently vanished in germany .
the rise in cases and deaths within europe is thought to be the reason for an apparent swing in public opinion about the dangers posed by swine flu .
in september a study found that 62 percent of germans polled would not get vaccinated .
now , due to high demand and supply shortages there are waiting lists to receive the swine flu vaccine .
in some parts of germany , those wating for vaccinations are facing a delay of several weeks .
the rhineland-palatinate ministry of health reported part of the reason for the wait is that that less vaccine was produced than expected .
they cited production shortfalls with the manufacturer .
the baden-wuerttemberg ministry of social affairs complained of " a lack of management " that led to the shortage of vaccine .
can it be too perfect ?
according to the managing director of pharmacists for schleswig-holstein frank jaschkowski , the problem with the vaccine shortage lay with the stringent quality control standards .
" the quality standards for the vaccine are extremely high , " jaschkowski said .
" so it would n't be released unless it was absolutely flawless . "
all across the country , health officials are reporting a significant increase in those seeking swine flu vaccinations .
federal health minister philipp roesler told the german daily bild on saturday that he wanted to assess the swine flu situation at a health ministers ' conference on wednesday .
" along with my colleagues from the various states ' health ministries , i would like to compare notes about where potential weaknesses in the national vaccination supply scheme may exist , " roesler said. sjt / ap / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some people are facing waiting periods of weeks before vaccination will be available . only two weeks after beginning a national vaccination campaign against h1n1 , the intial skepticism over the vaccine has apparently vanished in germany .
the rise in cases and deaths within europe is thought to be the reason for an apparent swing in public opinion about the dangers posed by swine flu .
in september a study found that 62 percent of germans polled would not get vaccinated .
now , due to high demand and supply shortages there are waiting lists to receive the swine flu vaccine .
in some parts of germany , those wating for vaccinations are facing a delay of several weeks .
the rhineland-palatinate ministry of health reported part of the reason for the wait is that that less vaccine was produced than expected .
they cited production shortfalls with the manufacturer .
the baden-wuerttemberg ministry of social affairs complained of " a lack of management " that led to the shortage of vaccine .

according to the managing director of pharmacists for schleswig-holstein frank jaschkowski , the problem with the vaccine shortage lay with the stringent quality control standards .
" the quality standards for the vaccine are extremely high , " jaschkowski said .
" so it would n't be released unless it was absolutely flawless . "
all across the country , health officials are reporting a significant increase in those seeking swine flu vaccinations .
federal health minister philipp roesler told the german daily bild on saturday that he wanted to assess the swine flu situation at a health ministers ' conference on wednesday .

bayern grabbed the lead on 31 minutes when defender holger badstuber sent a free kick into the box and van buyten was at hand to tap in after schalke 's kevin kuranyi accidentally headed the ball into the belgian 's path .
the balance was restored just before the break when lukas schmitz floated a free kick into the box and matip , until recently in schalke 's under-19 team , rose above bayern defenders to head home .
the result leaves munich stranded in eighth place with 20 points while schalke are fourth with 22 points .

through his organization crossover , deluxe hopes to bring young adults together to promote better understanding . samy deluxe is not only successful , having sold over one million albums , he also has a voice that resonates with young people , especially between the ages of 15 and 20 .
this hip-hop idol also has a talent for bringing politics and social engagement to the attention of an otherwise disinterested generation through his songs .
messages like " i have a chance to make something of myself ” and " there is a lot we can do to fight off boredom " permeate his lyrics .
deluxe was not always so socially-minded .
he began his career as a rapper surrounding himself with the usual luxurious cars and beautiful women .
at that time his rhymes generally concentrated on sex , drugs and his own magnificence .
since then , deluxe has successfully transformed himself into a hip-hop artist known for his contemplative lyrics .
today his music showcases his thoughts on things like national identity , the condition of the german social state and the importance of giving today 's youth better opportunities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crossover program has had a successful start on his new cd " dis wo ich herkomm " -lrb- this is where i come from -rrb- , samy deluxe croons to soft reggae beats : this is our germany this is your germany this is the land where we live this is the new germany … a change in tone deluxe is considered one of the most successful german rappers ever , and he is well aware of his influence on young adults .
the change of tone in his music reflects this awareness .
" the concept for this album was to give people courage and to spur them to think critically about their lives and their surroundings , " the hip-hop artist explained .
born samuel sorge , the son of a sudanese father and german mother , deluxe grew up in hamburg , where he was exposed at an early age to social exclusion and ghettoization .
early in his life he was forced to develop strategies to overcome such barriers .
growing up in a mostly white area , deluxe was keenly aware of his difference from his friends and neighbors .
he consequently surrounded himself with other black german friends , hoping to discover his african roots .
in school he also had many turkish and croatian friends and he later went to the united states .
" i 've come to know many cultures and i feel comfortable when i 'm in a group that 's different from me . "
deluxe also addresses the youth of the ' hartz iv generation ' -lrb- those dependent on the german welfare system -rrb- in his songs .
many of these young adults do not foresee a good future for themselves .
but deluxe feels that the way the german system is organized , with a large middle class , young adults really do have a chance to make something of themselves .
building teams to overcome barriers in order to share his experiences with others , samy deluxe founded the non-profit organization crossover , along with designer julia von dohnanyi and marvin willoughby , a former german national basketball player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making music is one of the crossover methods von dohnanyi lived in the united states for many years and understands how important communication is in breaking down barriers .
“ the more people you know and the more types of people you get to know , the easier it is in life .
if you close yourself off and only have a ' my way is the right way ' attitude , life will be tough , " she commented .
crossover has organized basketball and hip-hop workshops at several secondary schools in hamburg to bring together students of different social backgrounds .
the program teamed up young people from exclusive residential areas with those of socially disadvantaged backgrounds and challenged them to make their own rhymes and beats .
many of the workshops were advertized across germany and attracted youth from all over country , partially due to deluxe 's name .
one of the young adults who participated was 17-year-old tom ulris from aschaffenberg .
he was excited about the sense of community that developed out of teamwork .
" i found it fascinating to learn about the differences between young people from all over germany , " he said .
" some of us came from the east and some from the west , but after an hour , it felt like we were one team , ” tom commented .
integration is a challenge for both sides crossover places a lot of emphasis on integration , regardless of whether the young adults are rich or poor , from eastern or western germany , or they are from immigrant families .
von dohnanyi feels that it is very important for youth to believe in the process of integration .
to encourage this belief , she urges team work in which the same expectations are placed upon everyone .
only when each person does his or her share can the project be successful .
sophie niebergal also believes in the value of cultural diversity in germany .
this is why she decided to do a one-year internship with the crossover organization .
she wants to work with young adults to help them start breaking down the barriers that still divide them .
as his organization grows in size and popularity among young people , samy deluxe may start to believe that some of the lyrics of his songs are ringing true . … it 's about time that people start to wake up and begin to speak about something other than celebrities , football and the weather , like how we can improve the conditions for our youth and right now because this is our germany this is your germany … author : zoran arbutina / gmb editor : louisa schaefer / bk send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on sunday , chinese premier wen jiabao reflected the close ties between the two pledging $ 10 billion in loans and announcing that tariffs on 95 percent of products from the least-developed african nations would be removed .
china 's foreign minister said on monday that these ties would ultimately help africans " improve their livelihood . "
" china is present in almost every african country , " said denis tull , a researcher with the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" and it 's not just a matter of buying raw materials nor is it part of a grand strategy . "
dominic johnson , africa expert with the berlin-based newspaper tageszeitung told deutsche welle that , " there seems to be a shift away on the chinese side from simply investing in natural resource extraction or buying oil toward investing in african infrastructure . "
a few days ago , china and nigeria signed a contract on building a railway line - a much-needed development as the railway infrastructure in africa 's most populous state dates back to colonial times .
the first ones to benefit from a better transport system in nigeria are the chinese themselves .
chinese companies are keen to develop the nigerian market , as johnson explained : " nigeria has a rapidly growing middle class .
and geographically it is located perfectly to supply the entire west african market .
so it 's a very interesting country for doing business . "
the chinese export mainly basic consumer goods to nigeria - clothes , shoes , but also electronics and motorcycles .
" chinese traders have been very good at settling down in african markets , bringing in lots of goods at low prices and really pushing themselves into the consumer market , " said johnson .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese companies are investing in african infrastructure projects africa has become a busy hub it does n't do any harm that china is an emerging country itself , said johnson , on the contrary : " in fact it strengthens the chinese , because on the political level they can say to the africans : we 're both against the mighty west .
some african leaders feel quite happy about that .
they look at china and say : forty years ago china was as poor as us , look at them now , should n't we be doing the same thing ? "
however , tull only partially agrees with that assessment : " frankly speaking this may contribute to some sympathy , but i do n't think this is substantially influencing the relationship .
i think both sides , the chinese and the african side are very pragmatic in their relationship and i would n't say that there is so much spinning or ideology involved , " he said .
after all the chinese are not the only new players on the african market , as tull explains : " there is an increased presence of other emerging countries like india , like brazil , etc .
this means there is certainly more competition .
africa has become a busy place , politically and economically . "
no room for human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa 's relationship with former colonial powers like germany is still strong it also means that european partners have to share their interests with others , but tull is convinced that africa 's relationship with its former colonial powers will remain a special one : " europe 's relationship with africa has a certain depth , an historical depth , and it certainly has a lot of intensity .
therefore i do n't think that the chinese influence will grow to an extent that there would be no europeans left in africa in 20 years time or so .
the europeans will always have a presence there and will always maintain these networks , contacts and long-standing connections . "
it remains to be seen however how much influence western countries will have in africa in the future .
china presents itself to african states as a partner and not as a donor .
it makes deals without political conditions , but not necessarily without political impact .
johnson says that china tends to support the government of the day , like in sudan : " china is one of the main arm suppliers for the government of sudan .
that has made a difference for the darfur war .
also china stopped the un security council from taking measures against sudan .
so there is certainly political influence there . "
guinea is another example , says tull , " where it has been reported that the government has signed a seven-billion-dollar deal with chinese companies at a time when the new military regime is under immense international pressure over the recent massacre of civilians in the capital of conakry .
that too illustrates that the chinese are really not paying attention at all to human rights . "

on sunday , chinese premier wen jiabao reflected the close ties between the two pledging $ 10 billion in loans and announcing that tariffs on 95 percent of products from the least-developed african nations would be removed .
china 's foreign minister said on monday that these ties would ultimately help africans " improve their livelihood . "
" china is present in almost every african country , " said denis tull , a researcher with the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" and it 's not just a matter of buying raw materials nor is it part of a grand strategy . "
dominic johnson , africa expert with the berlin-based newspaper tageszeitung told deutsche welle that , " there seems to be a shift away on the chinese side from simply investing in natural resource extraction or buying oil toward investing in african infrastructure . "
a few days ago , china and nigeria signed a contract on building a railway line - a much-needed development as the railway infrastructure in africa 's most populous state dates back to colonial times .
the first ones to benefit from a better transport system in nigeria are the chinese themselves .
chinese companies are keen to develop the nigerian market , as johnson explained : " nigeria has a rapidly growing middle class .
and geographically it is located perfectly to supply the entire west african market .
so it 's a very interesting country for doing business . "
the chinese export mainly basic consumer goods to nigeria - clothes , shoes , but also electronics and motorcycles .
" chinese traders have been very good at settling down in african markets , bringing in lots of goods at low prices and really pushing themselves into the consumer market , " said johnson .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese companies are investing in african infrastructure projects africa has become a busy hub it does n't do any harm that china is an emerging country itself , said johnson , on the contrary : " in fact it strengthens the chinese , because on the political level they can say to the africans : we 're both against the mighty west .
some african leaders feel quite happy about that .
they look at china and say : forty years ago china was as poor as us , look at them now , should n't we be doing the same thing ? "
however , tull only partially agrees with that assessment : " frankly speaking this may contribute to some sympathy , but i do n't think this is substantially influencing the relationship .
i think both sides , the chinese and the african side are very pragmatic in their relationship and i would n't say that there is so much spinning or ideology involved , " he said .
after all the chinese are not the only new players on the african market , as tull explains : " there is an increased presence of other emerging countries like india , like brazil , etc .
this means there is certainly more competition .
africa has become a busy place , politically and economically . "
no room for human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa 's relationship with former colonial powers like germany is still strong it also means that european partners have to share their interests with others , but tull is convinced that africa 's relationship with its former colonial powers will remain a special one : " europe 's relationship with africa has a certain depth , an historical depth , and it certainly has a lot of intensity .
therefore i do n't think that the chinese influence will grow to an extent that there would be no europeans left in africa in 20 years time or so .
the europeans will always have a presence there and will always maintain these networks , contacts and long-standing connections . "
it remains to be seen however how much influence western countries will have in africa in the future .
china presents itself to african states as a partner and not as a donor .
it makes deals without political conditions , but not necessarily without political impact .
johnson says that china tends to support the government of the day , like in sudan : " china is one of the main arm suppliers for the government of sudan .
that has made a difference for the darfur war .
also china stopped the un security council from taking measures against sudan .
so there is certainly political influence there . "
guinea is another example , says tull , " where it has been reported that the government has signed a seven-billion-dollar deal with chinese companies at a time when the new military regime is under immense international pressure over the recent massacre of civilians in the capital of conakry .
that too illustrates that the chinese are really not paying attention at all to human rights . "

bayern grabbed the lead on 31 minutes when defender holger badstuber sent a free kick into the box and van buyten was at hand to tap in after schalke 's kevin kuranyi accidentally headed the ball into the belgian 's path .
the balance was restored just before the break when lukas schmitz floated a free kick into the box and matip , until recently in schalke 's under-19 team , rose above bayern defenders to head home .
the result leaves munich stranded in eighth place with 20 points while schalke are fourth with 22 points .
bayer leverkusen leads the way with 26 points from a 4-0 demolition of eintracht frankfurt on friday .
werder bremen and sv hamburg are on 22 like schalke , ahead of their sunday games against borussia dortmund and in hannover 96 , respectively .
in saturday 's other fixtures , vfl wolfsburg won 2-1 at tsg hoffenheim as second-half goals from zvejzdan misimovic and grafite reversed hoffenheim 's lead from vedad ibisevic .

young students show promising potential , but one aisle remains empty : the iranian group did n't get visas . every year hundreds of inventors from all over the world come to nuremberg 's inventor 's fair iena to show off their latest ideas .
about 800 inventions from 33 countries are on display this year , presenting a wide range of inventions from improved household appliances to high-tech equipment .
according to iena , the number of presented inventions exceeds previous presentations in iena 's 60-year history .
many individual inventors from germany take part in signo -lrb- protection of ideas for commercial usage -rrb- inventor 's clubs .
38 of these locally organized clubs present about 190 ideas on this year 's fair .
young inventors in focus especially young inventors draw attention to their ideas .
many young students are part of inventor 's clubs at their school and professionally introduce their products to trade experts . eleven-year old raphael krauthann from signo invention club " querdenker " -lrb- " lateral thinker " -rrb- presents his idea on how to reach for crutches on the floor with a magnetic device .
he developed his idea when one of his friends was struggling with crutches because they kept falling on the floor .
" it was really annoying , so i said i 'm going to invent something , " explained raphael krauthann .
other kids from the " querdenker " club in ingolstadt also had ideas with great potential .
andreas finkenzeller 's device prevents burning by accident from an electric iron .
the 13-year-old invented a system that stops the electricity flow in an iron if it has not been moved in a certain time period .
and michael stamp , 14 , who had to visit the hospital because fireworks exploded in his hand developed a device that lids the explosive charge in a safe distance by stepping on a handle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : displayed inventions ranged from household appliances to high-tech equipment 20-year-old florian nuber was facing a different kind of problem .
his cat brought dead mice inside his parents ' house , so he grabbed two of his apprenticeship colleges at wodego to find a solution .
florian nuber , christoph seger and sebastian soderer then invented the kitty clap which uses sensors to check the cat 's outlines .
it will only allow the cat to come in if it is not carrying a mouse .
if the cat is transporting a mouse , its figure would be different . antibacterial solutions in times of swine flu and other potential infections , inventions such as spanish inventor juan edilbato rodriguez morales ' automatic hygienic mat come in handy .
first the rotating brush moistened with water and disinfectant cleans the shoe , then the dryer eliminates the remaining water .
this could be used in hospitals , at airports or other places where a lot of people gather to prevent germ spreading .
an antibacterial door handle and antibacterial pens also reduce the chance of infection with germs .
a lot of infections in hospitals are caused by door handles because everyone touches them , said bruno gruber , a professional inventor of 33 years experience .
altogether he has registered 400 patents so far .
the most difficult part , he said , is to find someone who wants to produce and sell a product which starts off as a prototype .
" inventing is easy , marketing is my biggest problem , " said gruber .
problems with patents but inventors are also facing problems with patents .
registering patents can take years , claims gruber .
" it should be accelerated , because it is damaging for the industry .
especially in tough times it is important that new ideas get introduced to the market quickly , but the patent office is understaffed . "
approximately 700 patent examiners are working for the german patent office .
gruber said they need to double the workforce .
the german patent office is currently searching for new patent examiners .
bernd antonius from the german patent office admits they are a little behind with patent applications .
another problem for inventors is the rising annual fee to keep the patent .
if inventors do n't find a company right away , they choose to secure the patent until they can find someone who is willing to produce the product .
otherwise their invention could be used by anyone for free .
registering a patent itself is not so expensive , explained gruber , but needing a specialized patent lawyer for complicated matters is .

the president of " the first institute of researchers and inventors in iran , " dr. alireza rastegar , said he did n't get visa appointments for a group of 45 young inventors at the german embassy in tehran even though he applied in time .
" we have been coming to iena for the past five years , and we never had a problem , " said rastegar .
" i am very very angry .
the iranian booths are empty .
this is a very bad position for us and this exhibition . "
rastegar booked 72 square meters -lrb- 775 square feet -rrb- of the fair for young iranian inventors .
he himself could travel to germany because he holds a swiss visa ; the few students who are at the fair got visas through italy or a family invitation from germany , he said .
that 's why babak khodaparast could present his emergency cooling system that can be used to transport a human organ in a cold device .
kambiz shirzadian , who has lived in germany for 30 years , came to represent his nephew 's booth because he did n't get a visa as well .
according to shirzadian , when he asked the german embassy in tehran about the visa application , he was told such an application did n't exist .
lydia zetl , project manager of iena , is surprised that the iranian group did n't get their visa appointments .
" for me it was obvious that they would get their visas , because they are exhibiting for several years now and it has always worked in the past . "
she said she was told that the iranian group was too late in order to get an appointment .
rastegar said he is going to discuss the issue with the iranian ambassador in berlin on monday .
for shirzadian the worst part is the disappointment the young people must feel who were eager to present their ideas and to meet international researchers .

young students show promising potential , but one aisle remains empty : the iranian group did n't get visas . every year hundreds of inventors from all over the world come to nuremberg 's inventor 's fair iena to show off their latest ideas .
about 800 inventions from 33 countries are on display this year , presenting a wide range of inventions from improved household appliances to high-tech equipment .
according to iena , the number of presented inventions exceeds previous presentations in iena 's 60-year history .
many individual inventors from germany take part in signo -lrb- protection of ideas for commercial usage -rrb- inventor 's clubs .
38 of these locally organized clubs present about 190 ideas on this year 's fair .
young inventors in focus especially young inventors draw attention to their ideas .
many young students are part of inventor 's clubs at their school and professionally introduce their products to trade experts . eleven-year old raphael krauthann from signo invention club " querdenker " -lrb- " lateral thinker " -rrb- presents his idea on how to reach for crutches on the floor with a magnetic device .
he developed his idea when one of his friends was struggling with crutches because they kept falling on the floor .
" it was really annoying , so i said i 'm going to invent something , " explained raphael krauthann .
other kids from the " querdenker " club in ingolstadt also had ideas with great potential .
andreas finkenzeller 's device prevents burning by accident from an electric iron .
the 13-year-old invented a system that stops the electricity flow in an iron if it has not been moved in a certain time period .
and michael stamp , 14 , who had to visit the hospital because fireworks exploded in his hand developed a device that lids the explosive charge in a safe distance by stepping on a handle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : displayed inventions ranged from household appliances to high-tech equipment 20-year-old florian nuber was facing a different kind of problem .
his cat brought dead mice inside his parents ' house , so he grabbed two of his apprenticeship colleges at wodego to find a solution .

" we ca n't have our soldiers hampered by legal doubts , especially when they are forced to make decisions under extreme time pressure , " guttenberg said .
guttenberg 's comments came after he voiced his support of a controversial airstrike ordered by a german commander in afghanistan in september .
guttenberg backed the decision of colonel georg klein to launch an air attack on two fuel tankers that had been hijacked by taliban militants near a german military base in northern afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's zu guttenberg backs the controversial airstrike according to a nato report , up to 142 people , including several civilians that had gathered around the tankers to siphon fuel after they had stalled , were killed in the strike .

social democrat defense expert rainer arnold told the berlin daily tagesspiegel that guttenberg 's evaluation was " illegitimate and unreasonable . "
" if -lsb- guttenberg -rsb- believes that dropping bombs in afghanistan on large masses of people is alright , then the social democrats can no longer go along with him . "
the defense expert of the green party , omri nouripour , found guttenberg 's justification of the airstrike peculiar , especially considering that guttenberg admitted that mistakes were made .
" this issue should n't be treated as a mere bagatelle . that would make it look like the defense ministry pays no attention to the rules , " nouripour said .
bigger issue at hand the debates caused by the september airstrike have brought up the more large-scale question of whether germany is technically at war in afghanistan .
a court in the eastern state of saxony has passed the klein case on to germany 's top federal prosecution office , which will examine whether it is a matter for international law or german law .
for this to be determined the federal prosecutor must establish whether germany 's participation in the nato isaf mission constitutes an " armed conflict . "
the head of the german military alliance , colonel ulrich kirsch , told the mass-circulated bild zeitung that the german operation in afghanistan constituted war .

former bundeswehr general harald kujat went further , warning of " catastrophic consequences " should germany pursue its investigations of the airstrike and impose penalties on colonel klein .
" every soldier and officer would think twice about assuming any responsibility under such conditions , " he told the daily frankfurter rundschau .
under german constitution , it is illegal for the country to enter a war , except for purposes of defense .

some people are facing waiting periods of weeks before vaccination will be available . only two weeks after beginning a national vaccination campaign against h1n1 , the intial skepticism over the vaccine has apparently vanished in germany .
the rise in cases and deaths within europe is thought to be the reason for an apparent swing in public opinion about the dangers posed by swine flu .
in september a study found that 62 percent of germans polled would not get vaccinated .
now , due to high demand and supply shortages there are waiting lists to receive the swine flu vaccine .
in some parts of germany , those wating for vaccinations are facing a delay of several weeks .
the rhineland-palatinate ministry of health reported part of the reason for the wait is that that less vaccine was produced than expected .
they cited production shortfalls with the manufacturer .
the baden-wuerttemberg ministry of social affairs complained of " a lack of management " that led to the shortage of vaccine .
can it be too perfect ?
according to the managing director of pharmacists for schleswig-holstein frank jaschkowski , the problem with the vaccine shortage lay with the stringent quality control standards .
" the quality standards for the vaccine are extremely high , " jaschkowski said .
" so it would n't be released unless it was absolutely flawless . "
all across the country , health officials are reporting a significant increase in those seeking swine flu vaccinations .
federal health minister philipp roesler told the german daily bild on saturday that he wanted to assess the swine flu situation at a health ministers ' conference on wednesday .

" we ca n't have our soldiers hampered by legal doubts , especially when they are forced to make decisions under extreme time pressure , " guttenberg said .
guttenberg 's comments came after he voiced his support of a controversial airstrike ordered by a german commander in afghanistan in september .
guttenberg backed the decision of colonel georg klein to launch an air attack on two fuel tankers that had been hijacked by taliban militants near a german military base in northern afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's zu guttenberg backs the controversial airstrike according to a nato report , up to 142 people , including several civilians that had gathered around the tankers to siphon fuel after they had stalled , were killed in the strike .
guttenberg acknowledged that civilians were killed in the attack and also that " some procedural errors " were committed .
nonetheless , he put his full support behind colonel klein 's decision , calling it " militarily appropriate . "
criticism from opposition several german politicians have openly disagreed with guttenberg 's backing of the airstrike .
social democrat defense expert rainer arnold told the berlin daily tagesspiegel that guttenberg 's evaluation was " illegitimate and unreasonable . "
" if -lsb- guttenberg -rsb- believes that dropping bombs in afghanistan on large masses of people is alright , then the social democrats can no longer go along with him . "
the defense expert of the green party , omri nouripour , found guttenberg 's justification of the airstrike peculiar , especially considering that guttenberg admitted that mistakes were made .
" this issue should n't be treated as a mere bagatelle . that would make it look like the defense ministry pays no attention to the rules , " nouripour said .
bigger issue at hand the debates caused by the september airstrike have brought up the more large-scale question of whether germany is technically at war in afghanistan .
a court in the eastern state of saxony has passed the klein case on to germany 's top federal prosecution office , which will examine whether it is a matter for international law or german law .
for this to be determined the federal prosecutor must establish whether germany 's participation in the nato isaf mission constitutes an " armed conflict . "
the head of the german military alliance , colonel ulrich kirsch , told the mass-circulated bild zeitung that the german operation in afghanistan constituted war .
bildunterschrift : civilans and militants were among those killed in the airstrike , says nato " the justice ministry has stated explicitly what we are dealing with in afghanistan : a non-international armed conflict .
this is a war . "
former bundeswehr general harald kujat went further , warning of " catastrophic consequences " should germany pursue its investigations of the airstrike and impose penalties on colonel klein .
" every soldier and officer would think twice about assuming any responsibility under such conditions , " he told the daily frankfurter rundschau .
under german constitution , it is illegal for the country to enter a war , except for purposes of defense .
over sixty years following the nazi era , germans remain highly skeptical of military operations .
it was only a decade ago that german troops participated in their first foreign combat mission since the end of wwii .
opinion polls show a majority of germans oppose the engagement in afghanistan and want the over 4,000 troops there to come home. glb / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some people are facing waiting periods of weeks before vaccination will be available . only two weeks after beginning a national vaccination campaign against h1n1 , the intial skepticism over the vaccine has apparently vanished in germany .
the rise in cases and deaths within europe is thought to be the reason for an apparent swing in public opinion about the dangers posed by swine flu .

the rhineland-palatinate ministry of health reported part of the reason for the wait is that that less vaccine was produced than expected .
they cited production shortfalls with the manufacturer .
the baden-wuerttemberg ministry of social affairs complained of " a lack of management " that led to the shortage of vaccine .

according to the managing director of pharmacists for schleswig-holstein frank jaschkowski , the problem with the vaccine shortage lay with the stringent quality control standards .
" the quality standards for the vaccine are extremely high , " jaschkowski said .

bayern grabbed the lead on 31 minutes when defender holger badstuber sent a free kick into the box and van buyten was at hand to tap in after schalke 's kevin kuranyi accidentally headed the ball into the belgian 's path .
the balance was restored just before the break when lukas schmitz floated a free kick into the box and matip , until recently in schalke 's under-19 team , rose above bayern defenders to head home .
the result leaves munich stranded in eighth place with 20 points while schalke are fourth with 22 points .

" you are all part of what is an historic moment for us , " she added . fritz schramma , the former mayor of cologne , who is from chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said that the architecture of the mosque was " a symbol of a budding flower , " inviting people in .
the futuristic design is said to include a large dome and two 55-meter minarets .
the construction of the mosque , which is expected to be completed in two years ' time , is set to begin after a long and acrimonious dispute between ditib and non-muslim residents of the city which is home to the cologne cathedral , one of the most renowned cathedrals in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing prokoeln group held a demonstration against the mosque opponents of the mosque say it will spoil cologne 's skyline , by diverting attention from the gothic cathedral .
right-wing extremists have been particularly vocal in their opposition to the construction of the mosque and staged a small protest on saturday .
the heated debate leading up to the ceremony echoes the tensions that emerged in berlin where a mosque was constructed in recent years .
some analysts say it points to the intensifying conflict between a growing muslim community in the country and across western europe .
in the end , ditib struck a compromise , agreeing not to broadcast the call to prayer in order to avoid friction with the non-muslim residents of the neighborhood .
at the ceremony , thomas kufen , integration commissioner of the state of north rhine-westphalia , described the islamic house of worship as a sign that muslims " had arrived " in the german society .
" this mosque will be a piece of jewelry , " he added .
" it has been a long road , " kufen said , referring to the difficult and prolonged discussions over the construction of the mosque .
" it gave rise to hostility and hurt . "
however , he said the fact that the foundation stone had been laid was a sign that xenophobia stands no chance. rb / dpa / epd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the construction of the mosque , which is expected to be completed in two years ' time , is set to begin after a long and acrimonious dispute between ditib and non-muslim residents of the city which is home to the cologne cathedral , one of the most renowned cathedrals in the world .

bayern grabbed the lead on 31 minutes when defender holger badstuber sent a free kick into the box and van buyten was at hand to tap in after schalke 's kevin kuranyi accidentally headed the ball into the belgian 's path .
the balance was restored just before the break when lukas schmitz floated a free kick into the box and matip , until recently in schalke 's under-19 team , rose above bayern defenders to head home .
the result leaves munich stranded in eighth place with 20 points while schalke are fourth with 22 points .
bayer leverkusen leads the way with 26 points from a 4-0 demolition of eintracht frankfurt on friday .
werder bremen and sv hamburg are on 22 like schalke , ahead of their sunday games against borussia dortmund and in hannover 96 , respectively .

through his organization crossover , deluxe hopes to bring young adults together to promote better understanding . samy deluxe is not only successful , having sold over one million albums , he also has a voice that resonates with young people , especially between the ages of 15 and 20 .
this hip-hop idol also has a talent for bringing politics and social engagement to the attention of an otherwise disinterested generation through his songs .
messages like " i have a chance to make something of myself ” and " there is a lot we can do to fight off boredom " permeate his lyrics .
deluxe was not always so socially-minded .
he began his career as a rapper surrounding himself with the usual luxurious cars and beautiful women .
at that time his rhymes generally concentrated on sex , drugs and his own magnificence .
since then , deluxe has successfully transformed himself into a hip-hop artist known for his contemplative lyrics .
today his music showcases his thoughts on things like national identity , the condition of the german social state and the importance of giving today 's youth better opportunities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crossover program has had a successful start on his new cd " dis wo ich herkomm " -lrb- this is where i come from -rrb- , samy deluxe croons to soft reggae beats : this is our germany this is your germany this is the land where we live this is the new germany … a change in tone deluxe is considered one of the most successful german rappers ever , and he is well aware of his influence on young adults .
the change of tone in his music reflects this awareness .
" the concept for this album was to give people courage and to spur them to think critically about their lives and their surroundings , " the hip-hop artist explained .
born samuel sorge , the son of a sudanese father and german mother , deluxe grew up in hamburg , where he was exposed at an early age to social exclusion and ghettoization .
early in his life he was forced to develop strategies to overcome such barriers .
growing up in a mostly white area , deluxe was keenly aware of his difference from his friends and neighbors .
he consequently surrounded himself with other black german friends , hoping to discover his african roots .
in school he also had many turkish and croatian friends and he later went to the united states .
" i 've come to know many cultures and i feel comfortable when i 'm in a group that 's different from me . "
deluxe also addresses the youth of the ' hartz iv generation ' -lrb- those dependent on the german welfare system -rrb- in his songs .
many of these young adults do not foresee a good future for themselves .
but deluxe feels that the way the german system is organized , with a large middle class , young adults really do have a chance to make something of themselves .
building teams to overcome barriers in order to share his experiences with others , samy deluxe founded the non-profit organization crossover , along with designer julia von dohnanyi and marvin willoughby , a former german national basketball player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making music is one of the crossover methods von dohnanyi lived in the united states for many years and understands how important communication is in breaking down barriers .
“ the more people you know and the more types of people you get to know , the easier it is in life .
if you close yourself off and only have a ' my way is the right way ' attitude , life will be tough , " she commented .
crossover has organized basketball and hip-hop workshops at several secondary schools in hamburg to bring together students of different social backgrounds .
the program teamed up young people from exclusive residential areas with those of socially disadvantaged backgrounds and challenged them to make their own rhymes and beats .
many of the workshops were advertized across germany and attracted youth from all over country , partially due to deluxe 's name .
one of the young adults who participated was 17-year-old tom ulris from aschaffenberg .
he was excited about the sense of community that developed out of teamwork .
" i found it fascinating to learn about the differences between young people from all over germany , " he said .
" some of us came from the east and some from the west , but after an hour , it felt like we were one team , ” tom commented .
integration is a challenge for both sides crossover places a lot of emphasis on integration , regardless of whether the young adults are rich or poor , from eastern or western germany , or they are from immigrant families .
von dohnanyi feels that it is very important for youth to believe in the process of integration .
to encourage this belief , she urges team work in which the same expectations are placed upon everyone .
only when each person does his or her share can the project be successful .
sophie niebergal also believes in the value of cultural diversity in germany .
this is why she decided to do a one-year internship with the crossover organization .
she wants to work with young adults to help them start breaking down the barriers that still divide them .
as his organization grows in size and popularity among young people , samy deluxe may start to believe that some of the lyrics of his songs are ringing true . … it 's about time that people start to wake up and begin to speak about something other than celebrities , football and the weather , like how we can improve the conditions for our youth and right now because this is our germany this is your germany … author : zoran arbutina / gmb editor : louisa schaefer / bk send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the change of tone in his music reflects this awareness .
" the concept for this album was to give people courage and to spur them to think critically about their lives and their surroundings , " the hip-hop artist explained .
born samuel sorge , the son of a sudanese father and german mother , deluxe grew up in hamburg , where he was exposed at an early age to social exclusion and ghettoization .
early in his life he was forced to develop strategies to overcome such barriers .
growing up in a mostly white area , deluxe was keenly aware of his difference from his friends and neighbors .
he consequently surrounded himself with other black german friends , hoping to discover his african roots .
in school he also had many turkish and croatian friends and he later went to the united states .
" i 've come to know many cultures and i feel comfortable when i 'm in a group that 's different from me . "
deluxe also addresses the youth of the ' hartz iv generation ' -lrb- those dependent on the german welfare system -rrb- in his songs .
many of these young adults do not foresee a good future for themselves .
but deluxe feels that the way the german system is organized , with a large middle class , young adults really do have a chance to make something of themselves .
building teams to overcome barriers in order to share his experiences with others , samy deluxe founded the non-profit organization crossover , along with designer julia von dohnanyi and marvin willoughby , a former german national basketball player .

“ the more people you know and the more types of people you get to know , the easier it is in life .
if you close yourself off and only have a ' my way is the right way ' attitude , life will be tough , " she commented .
crossover has organized basketball and hip-hop workshops at several secondary schools in hamburg to bring together students of different social backgrounds .
the program teamed up young people from exclusive residential areas with those of socially disadvantaged backgrounds and challenged them to make their own rhymes and beats .
many of the workshops were advertized across germany and attracted youth from all over country , partially due to deluxe 's name .
one of the young adults who participated was 17-year-old tom ulris from aschaffenberg .
he was excited about the sense of community that developed out of teamwork .
" i found it fascinating to learn about the differences between young people from all over germany , " he said .

through his organization crossover , deluxe hopes to bring young adults together to promote better understanding . samy deluxe is not only successful , having sold over one million albums , he also has a voice that resonates with young people , especially between the ages of 15 and 20 .
this hip-hop idol also has a talent for bringing politics and social engagement to the attention of an otherwise disinterested generation through his songs .
messages like " i have a chance to make something of myself ” and " there is a lot we can do to fight off boredom " permeate his lyrics .
deluxe was not always so socially-minded .
he began his career as a rapper surrounding himself with the usual luxurious cars and beautiful women .
at that time his rhymes generally concentrated on sex , drugs and his own magnificence .
since then , deluxe has successfully transformed himself into a hip-hop artist known for his contemplative lyrics .
today his music showcases his thoughts on things like national identity , the condition of the german social state and the importance of giving today 's youth better opportunities .

" you are all part of what is an historic moment for us , " she added . fritz schramma , the former mayor of cologne , who is from chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said that the architecture of the mosque was " a symbol of a budding flower , " inviting people in .
the futuristic design is said to include a large dome and two 55-meter minarets .
the construction of the mosque , which is expected to be completed in two years ' time , is set to begin after a long and acrimonious dispute between ditib and non-muslim residents of the city which is home to the cologne cathedral , one of the most renowned cathedrals in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing prokoeln group held a demonstration against the mosque opponents of the mosque say it will spoil cologne 's skyline , by diverting attention from the gothic cathedral .
right-wing extremists have been particularly vocal in their opposition to the construction of the mosque and staged a small protest on saturday .
the heated debate leading up to the ceremony echoes the tensions that emerged in berlin where a mosque was constructed in recent years .
some analysts say it points to the intensifying conflict between a growing muslim community in the country and across western europe .
in the end , ditib struck a compromise , agreeing not to broadcast the call to prayer in order to avoid friction with the non-muslim residents of the neighborhood .
at the ceremony , thomas kufen , integration commissioner of the state of north rhine-westphalia , described the islamic house of worship as a sign that muslims " had arrived " in the german society .
" this mosque will be a piece of jewelry , " he added .
" it has been a long road , " kufen said , referring to the difficult and prolonged discussions over the construction of the mosque .
" it gave rise to hostility and hurt . "
however , he said the fact that the foundation stone had been laid was a sign that xenophobia stands no chance. rb / dpa / epd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

through his organization crossover , deluxe hopes to bring young adults together to promote better understanding . samy deluxe is not only successful , having sold over one million albums , he also has a voice that resonates with young people , especially between the ages of 15 and 20 .
this hip-hop idol also has a talent for bringing politics and social engagement to the attention of an otherwise disinterested generation through his songs .
messages like " i have a chance to make something of myself ” and " there is a lot we can do to fight off boredom " permeate his lyrics .
deluxe was not always so socially-minded .
he began his career as a rapper surrounding himself with the usual luxurious cars and beautiful women .
at that time his rhymes generally concentrated on sex , drugs and his own magnificence .
since then , deluxe has successfully transformed himself into a hip-hop artist known for his contemplative lyrics .
today his music showcases his thoughts on things like national identity , the condition of the german social state and the importance of giving today 's youth better opportunities .

the change of tone in his music reflects this awareness .
" the concept for this album was to give people courage and to spur them to think critically about their lives and their surroundings , " the hip-hop artist explained .
born samuel sorge , the son of a sudanese father and german mother , deluxe grew up in hamburg , where he was exposed at an early age to social exclusion and ghettoization .
early in his life he was forced to develop strategies to overcome such barriers .
growing up in a mostly white area , deluxe was keenly aware of his difference from his friends and neighbors .
he consequently surrounded himself with other black german friends , hoping to discover his african roots .
in school he also had many turkish and croatian friends and he later went to the united states .
" i 've come to know many cultures and i feel comfortable when i 'm in a group that 's different from me . "
deluxe also addresses the youth of the ' hartz iv generation ' -lrb- those dependent on the german welfare system -rrb- in his songs .
many of these young adults do not foresee a good future for themselves .
but deluxe feels that the way the german system is organized , with a large middle class , young adults really do have a chance to make something of themselves .
building teams to overcome barriers in order to share his experiences with others , samy deluxe founded the non-profit organization crossover , along with designer julia von dohnanyi and marvin willoughby , a former german national basketball player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making music is one of the crossover methods von dohnanyi lived in the united states for many years and understands how important communication is in breaking down barriers .
“ the more people you know and the more types of people you get to know , the easier it is in life .
if you close yourself off and only have a ' my way is the right way ' attitude , life will be tough , " she commented .
crossover has organized basketball and hip-hop workshops at several secondary schools in hamburg to bring together students of different social backgrounds .
the program teamed up young people from exclusive residential areas with those of socially disadvantaged backgrounds and challenged them to make their own rhymes and beats .
many of the workshops were advertized across germany and attracted youth from all over country , partially due to deluxe 's name .
one of the young adults who participated was 17-year-old tom ulris from aschaffenberg .
he was excited about the sense of community that developed out of teamwork .
" i found it fascinating to learn about the differences between young people from all over germany , " he said .
" some of us came from the east and some from the west , but after an hour , it felt like we were one team , ” tom commented .
integration is a challenge for both sides crossover places a lot of emphasis on integration , regardless of whether the young adults are rich or poor , from eastern or western germany , or they are from immigrant families .
von dohnanyi feels that it is very important for youth to believe in the process of integration .
to encourage this belief , she urges team work in which the same expectations are placed upon everyone .
only when each person does his or her share can the project be successful .
sophie niebergal also believes in the value of cultural diversity in germany .
this is why she decided to do a one-year internship with the crossover organization .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 07.11.2009 new ideas abound at the inventor 's fair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kitty clap represented just one of almost 800 inventions on display in nuremberg international inventors meet in nuremberg to display their prototypes from november 5 to 8 .
young students show promising potential , but one aisle remains empty : the iranian group did n't get visas . every year hundreds of inventors from all over the world come to nuremberg 's inventor 's fair iena to show off their latest ideas .
about 800 inventions from 33 countries are on display this year , presenting a wide range of inventions from improved household appliances to high-tech equipment .
according to iena , the number of presented inventions exceeds previous presentations in iena 's 60-year history .
many individual inventors from germany take part in signo -lrb- protection of ideas for commercial usage -rrb- inventor 's clubs .
38 of these locally organized clubs present about 190 ideas on this year 's fair .
young inventors in focus especially young inventors draw attention to their ideas .
many young students are part of inventor 's clubs at their school and professionally introduce their products to trade experts . eleven-year old raphael krauthann from signo invention club " querdenker " -lrb- " lateral thinker " -rrb- presents his idea on how to reach for crutches on the floor with a magnetic device .
he developed his idea when one of his friends was struggling with crutches because they kept falling on the floor .
" it was really annoying , so i said i 'm going to invent something , " explained raphael krauthann .
other kids from the " querdenker " club in ingolstadt also had ideas with great potential .
andreas finkenzeller 's device prevents burning by accident from an electric iron .
the 13-year-old invented a system that stops the electricity flow in an iron if it has not been moved in a certain time period .
and michael stamp , 14 , who had to visit the hospital because fireworks exploded in his hand developed a device that lids the explosive charge in a safe distance by stepping on a handle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : displayed inventions ranged from household appliances to high-tech equipment 20-year-old florian nuber was facing a different kind of problem .
his cat brought dead mice inside his parents ' house , so he grabbed two of his apprenticeship colleges at wodego to find a solution .
florian nuber , christoph seger and sebastian soderer then invented the kitty clap which uses sensors to check the cat 's outlines .
it will only allow the cat to come in if it is not carrying a mouse .
if the cat is transporting a mouse , its figure would be different . antibacterial solutions in times of swine flu and other potential infections , inventions such as spanish inventor juan edilbato rodriguez morales ' automatic hygienic mat come in handy .
first the rotating brush moistened with water and disinfectant cleans the shoe , then the dryer eliminates the remaining water .
this could be used in hospitals , at airports or other places where a lot of people gather to prevent germ spreading .
an antibacterial door handle and antibacterial pens also reduce the chance of infection with germs .
a lot of infections in hospitals are caused by door handles because everyone touches them , said bruno gruber , a professional inventor of 33 years experience .
altogether he has registered 400 patents so far .
the most difficult part , he said , is to find someone who wants to produce and sell a product which starts off as a prototype .
" inventing is easy , marketing is my biggest problem , " said gruber .
problems with patents but inventors are also facing problems with patents .
registering patents can take years , claims gruber .
" it should be accelerated , because it is damaging for the industry .
especially in tough times it is important that new ideas get introduced to the market quickly , but the patent office is understaffed . "
approximately 700 patent examiners are working for the german patent office .
gruber said they need to double the workforce .
the german patent office is currently searching for new patent examiners .
bernd antonius from the german patent office admits they are a little behind with patent applications .
another problem for inventors is the rising annual fee to keep the patent .
if inventors do n't find a company right away , they choose to secure the patent until they can find someone who is willing to produce the product .
otherwise their invention could be used by anyone for free .
registering a patent itself is not so expensive , explained gruber , but needing a specialized patent lawyer for complicated matters is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : space reserved for iranian inventors remained empty no visa for iranians iena is meant to be an exchange for international inventors , but this year one aisle remains almost completely empty .
the president of " the first institute of researchers and inventors in iran , " dr. alireza rastegar , said he did n't get visa appointments for a group of 45 young inventors at the german embassy in tehran even though he applied in time .
" we have been coming to iena for the past five years , and we never had a problem , " said rastegar .
" i am very very angry .
the iranian booths are empty .
this is a very bad position for us and this exhibition . "
rastegar booked 72 square meters -lrb- 775 square feet -rrb- of the fair for young iranian inventors .
he himself could travel to germany because he holds a swiss visa ; the few students who are at the fair got visas through italy or a family invitation from germany , he said .
that 's why babak khodaparast could present his emergency cooling system that can be used to transport a human organ in a cold device .
kambiz shirzadian , who has lived in germany for 30 years , came to represent his nephew 's booth because he did n't get a visa as well .
according to shirzadian , when he asked the german embassy in tehran about the visa application , he was told such an application did n't exist .
lydia zetl , project manager of iena , is surprised that the iranian group did n't get their visa appointments .
" for me it was obvious that they would get their visas , because they are exhibiting for several years now and it has always worked in the past . "
she said she was told that the iranian group was too late in order to get an appointment .
rastegar said he is going to discuss the issue with the iranian ambassador in berlin on monday .
for shirzadian the worst part is the disappointment the young people must feel who were eager to present their ideas and to meet international researchers .

the two murders provoked international condemnation in january . one of two suspects arrested for the high-profile killings of two people who exposed abuses of the russian army in chechnya has confessed , his lawyer said friday .
but the motive of 24-year-old nikita tikhonov , who was charged with the murders this week along with yevgenia khasis , was " personal and in no way linked to his professional activities , " lawyer evgeni skirpelev said .

bortnikov said the unnamed group was amassing weapons and had been implicated in a racist murder .
the fsb chief made the accusation while briefing president dmitry medvedev about the arrests .
tikhonov also insisted that he had acted alone in the killings .
russian newspaper kommersant reported that investigators believe khasis tailed the victims and informed tikhonov of their whereabouts .
the masked gunman managed to flee after the shootings , carried out in broad daylight on a busy street in the russian capital .
the arrests had been cautiously welcomed by human rights groups , who complain that many killings of russian journalists and activists go unsolved. bk / afp / ap editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the killings caused outrage in russia and abroad tikhonov also apparently denied an accusation by the head of the fsb security service , alexander bortnikov , that he was a member of an extreme nationalist group .
bortnikov said the unnamed group was amassing weapons and had been implicated in a racist murder .
the fsb chief made the accusation while briefing president dmitry medvedev about the arrests .
tikhonov also insisted that he had acted alone in the killings .
russian newspaper kommersant reported that investigators believe khasis tailed the victims and informed tikhonov of their whereabouts .
the masked gunman managed to flee after the shootings , carried out in broad daylight on a busy street in the russian capital .
the arrests had been cautiously welcomed by human rights groups , who complain that many killings of russian journalists and activists go unsolved. bk / afp / ap editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on sunday , chinese premier wen jiabao reflected the close ties between the two pledging $ 10 billion in loans and announcing that tariffs on 95 percent of products from the least-developed african nations would be removed .
china 's foreign minister said on monday that these ties would ultimately help africans " improve their livelihood . "
" china is present in almost every african country , " said denis tull , a researcher with the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" and it 's not just a matter of buying raw materials nor is it part of a grand strategy . "
dominic johnson , africa expert with the berlin-based newspaper tageszeitung told deutsche welle that , " there seems to be a shift away on the chinese side from simply investing in natural resource extraction or buying oil toward investing in african infrastructure . "
a few days ago , china and nigeria signed a contract on building a railway line - a much-needed development as the railway infrastructure in africa 's most populous state dates back to colonial times .
the first ones to benefit from a better transport system in nigeria are the chinese themselves .
chinese companies are keen to develop the nigerian market , as johnson explained : " nigeria has a rapidly growing middle class .
and geographically it is located perfectly to supply the entire west african market .
so it 's a very interesting country for doing business . "
the chinese export mainly basic consumer goods to nigeria - clothes , shoes , but also electronics and motorcycles .
" chinese traders have been very good at settling down in african markets , bringing in lots of goods at low prices and really pushing themselves into the consumer market , " said johnson .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese companies are investing in african infrastructure projects africa has become a busy hub it does n't do any harm that china is an emerging country itself , said johnson , on the contrary : " in fact it strengthens the chinese , because on the political level they can say to the africans : we 're both against the mighty west .
some african leaders feel quite happy about that .
they look at china and say : forty years ago china was as poor as us , look at them now , should n't we be doing the same thing ? "
however , tull only partially agrees with that assessment : " frankly speaking this may contribute to some sympathy , but i do n't think this is substantially influencing the relationship .
i think both sides , the chinese and the african side are very pragmatic in their relationship and i would n't say that there is so much spinning or ideology involved , " he said .
after all the chinese are not the only new players on the african market , as tull explains : " there is an increased presence of other emerging countries like india , like brazil , etc .
this means there is certainly more competition .
africa has become a busy place , politically and economically . "
no room for human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa 's relationship with former colonial powers like germany is still strong it also means that european partners have to share their interests with others , but tull is convinced that africa 's relationship with its former colonial powers will remain a special one : " europe 's relationship with africa has a certain depth , an historical depth , and it certainly has a lot of intensity .
therefore i do n't think that the chinese influence will grow to an extent that there would be no europeans left in africa in 20 years time or so .
the europeans will always have a presence there and will always maintain these networks , contacts and long-standing connections . "
it remains to be seen however how much influence western countries will have in africa in the future .
china presents itself to african states as a partner and not as a donor .
it makes deals without political conditions , but not necessarily without political impact .
johnson says that china tends to support the government of the day , like in sudan : " china is one of the main arm suppliers for the government of sudan .
that has made a difference for the darfur war .
also china stopped the un security council from taking measures against sudan .
so there is certainly political influence there . "
guinea is another example , says tull , " where it has been reported that the government has signed a seven-billion-dollar deal with chinese companies at a time when the new military regime is under immense international pressure over the recent massacre of civilians in the capital of conakry .
that too illustrates that the chinese are really not paying attention at all to human rights . "

on sunday , chinese premier wen jiabao reflected the close ties between the two pledging $ 10 billion in loans and announcing that tariffs on 95 percent of products from the least-developed african nations would be removed .
china 's foreign minister said on monday that these ties would ultimately help africans " improve their livelihood . "
" china is present in almost every african country , " said denis tull , a researcher with the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" and it 's not just a matter of buying raw materials nor is it part of a grand strategy . "
dominic johnson , africa expert with the berlin-based newspaper tageszeitung told deutsche welle that , " there seems to be a shift away on the chinese side from simply investing in natural resource extraction or buying oil toward investing in african infrastructure . "
a few days ago , china and nigeria signed a contract on building a railway line - a much-needed development as the railway infrastructure in africa 's most populous state dates back to colonial times .
the first ones to benefit from a better transport system in nigeria are the chinese themselves .
chinese companies are keen to develop the nigerian market , as johnson explained : " nigeria has a rapidly growing middle class .
and geographically it is located perfectly to supply the entire west african market .
so it 's a very interesting country for doing business . "
the chinese export mainly basic consumer goods to nigeria - clothes , shoes , but also electronics and motorcycles .
" chinese traders have been very good at settling down in african markets , bringing in lots of goods at low prices and really pushing themselves into the consumer market , " said johnson .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese companies are investing in african infrastructure projects africa has become a busy hub it does n't do any harm that china is an emerging country itself , said johnson , on the contrary : " in fact it strengthens the chinese , because on the political level they can say to the africans : we 're both against the mighty west .
some african leaders feel quite happy about that .
they look at china and say : forty years ago china was as poor as us , look at them now , should n't we be doing the same thing ? "
however , tull only partially agrees with that assessment : " frankly speaking this may contribute to some sympathy , but i do n't think this is substantially influencing the relationship .
i think both sides , the chinese and the african side are very pragmatic in their relationship and i would n't say that there is so much spinning or ideology involved , " he said .
after all the chinese are not the only new players on the african market , as tull explains : " there is an increased presence of other emerging countries like india , like brazil , etc .
this means there is certainly more competition .

bayern grabbed the lead on 31 minutes when defender holger badstuber sent a free kick into the box and van buyten was at hand to tap in after schalke 's kevin kuranyi accidentally headed the ball into the belgian 's path .
the balance was restored just before the break when lukas schmitz floated a free kick into the box and matip , until recently in schalke 's under-19 team , rose above bayern defenders to head home .
the result leaves munich stranded in eighth place with 20 points while schalke are fourth with 22 points .
bayer leverkusen leads the way with 26 points from a 4-0 demolition of eintracht frankfurt on friday .
werder bremen and sv hamburg are on 22 like schalke , ahead of their sunday games against borussia dortmund and in hannover 96 , respectively .
in saturday 's other fixtures , vfl wolfsburg won 2-1 at tsg hoffenheim as second-half goals from zvejzdan misimovic and grafite reversed hoffenheim 's lead from vedad ibisevic .
wolfsburg have 21 points and so have mainz 05 , 1-0 winners over lowly nuremberg from elkin soto 's 38th-minute strike .
borussia moenchengladbach and vfb stuttgart produced no goals , while vfl bochum lost 2-1 at home against sc freiburg .

german sporting goods maker adidas is hoping that the next round of world cup mania , together with changes at its us reebok unit , will help pull sales out of the doldrums . adidas ceo herbert hainer said he is looking to 2010 , when the soccer world cup is to be played in south africa , for a boost in sales .
the company reported a third-quarter revenue drop of 7 percent from a year earlier , as sales in its sports-performance division struggled .
customers were keeping their purse-strings tied as a result of the financial crisis , the company said .
' cautiously optimistic ' despite crisis still , the world 's second-largest sporting goods manufacturer said it was " cautiously optimistic " about 2010 results , with hopes that world cup soccer fever , and a new approach to products at its us reebok unit , would boost sales as early as the current quarter .

the company expects to outfit 12 of the teams competing for the cup , including germany and spain .
the company , based in herzogenaurach , germany , predicted its soccer products would lead to record sales of more than 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- in 2010 .
" this year , our industry and our group have faced unprecedented challenges , " said hainer said in his third-quarter report , which was released on wednesday .
" however , we have tackled the challenges head on .
we have successfully adapted to our difficult surroundings .
and our drive for operational excellence has meant we have strongly improved our financial position . "
plans to release ' explosion ' of new products as adidas continues to trim costs in the third quarter , hainer says he believes the worst is over for the company - despite ongoing difficult markets in the usa and china : " the mood swings between fear and optimism , " he told reporters in a press conference .
for 2009 , adidas predicted net gains of between 230 and 260 million euros , assuming fourth-quarter improvements tied to the world cup .

" its true that we have n't focused on that unit in the last 10 years , " hainer said .

german sporting goods maker adidas is hoping that the next round of world cup mania , together with changes at its us reebok unit , will help pull sales out of the doldrums . adidas ceo herbert hainer said he is looking to 2010 , when the soccer world cup is to be played in south africa , for a boost in sales .
the company reported a third-quarter revenue drop of 7 percent from a year earlier , as sales in its sports-performance division struggled .
customers were keeping their purse-strings tied as a result of the financial crisis , the company said .
' cautiously optimistic ' despite crisis still , the world 's second-largest sporting goods manufacturer said it was " cautiously optimistic " about 2010 results , with hopes that world cup soccer fever , and a new approach to products at its us reebok unit , would boost sales as early as the current quarter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo hainer will focus on outdoors as well as soccer adidas is betting heavily on world cup , which starts june 11 , to improve its fortunes .
the company expects to outfit 12 of the teams competing for the cup , including germany and spain .
the company , based in herzogenaurach , germany , predicted its soccer products would lead to record sales of more than 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- in 2010 .
" this year , our industry and our group have faced unprecedented challenges , " said hainer said in his third-quarter report , which was released on wednesday .
" however , we have tackled the challenges head on .
we have successfully adapted to our difficult surroundings .
and our drive for operational excellence has meant we have strongly improved our financial position . "
plans to release ' explosion ' of new products as adidas continues to trim costs in the third quarter , hainer says he believes the worst is over for the company - despite ongoing difficult markets in the usa and china : " the mood swings between fear and optimism , " he told reporters in a press conference .
for 2009 , adidas predicted net gains of between 230 and 260 million euros , assuming fourth-quarter improvements tied to the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas unit reebok has been troublesome the company said it will release an " explosion " of new soccer-related products , and it has already begun with a soccer boot designed by former france captain zinedine zidane .
the predator x boot is the 10th version of a series that started in 1994 .
next week adidas will unveil the jersey to be worn by germany 's world cup team .
new focus for outdoor sector further plans for adidas include putting more focus on its outdoor-sporting-goods unit , hainer told online business news source mittelfranken.business.on.
" its true that we have n't focused on that unit in the last 10 years , " hainer said .
" now we are starting to make it a focal point . ... for example , we have renewed our partnership with -lrb- mountain climber -rrb- reinhold messsner , who wore adidas shoes in the himalayas 30 years ago . "
" i strongly believe that adidas will be the athletic outdoor brand of the future , " he added. jen / reuters / dpa editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on sunday , chinese premier wen jiabao reflected the close ties between the two pledging $ 10 billion in loans and announcing that tariffs on 95 percent of products from the least-developed african nations would be removed .
china 's foreign minister said on monday that these ties would ultimately help africans " improve their livelihood . "
" china is present in almost every african country , " said denis tull , a researcher with the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" and it 's not just a matter of buying raw materials nor is it part of a grand strategy . "
dominic johnson , africa expert with the berlin-based newspaper tageszeitung told deutsche welle that , " there seems to be a shift away on the chinese side from simply investing in natural resource extraction or buying oil toward investing in african infrastructure . "
a few days ago , china and nigeria signed a contract on building a railway line - a much-needed development as the railway infrastructure in africa 's most populous state dates back to colonial times .
the first ones to benefit from a better transport system in nigeria are the chinese themselves .
chinese companies are keen to develop the nigerian market , as johnson explained : " nigeria has a rapidly growing middle class .
and geographically it is located perfectly to supply the entire west african market .
so it 's a very interesting country for doing business . "
the chinese export mainly basic consumer goods to nigeria - clothes , shoes , but also electronics and motorcycles .
" chinese traders have been very good at settling down in african markets , bringing in lots of goods at low prices and really pushing themselves into the consumer market , " said johnson .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese companies are investing in african infrastructure projects africa has become a busy hub it does n't do any harm that china is an emerging country itself , said johnson , on the contrary : " in fact it strengthens the chinese , because on the political level they can say to the africans : we 're both against the mighty west .
some african leaders feel quite happy about that .
they look at china and say : forty years ago china was as poor as us , look at them now , should n't we be doing the same thing ? "
however , tull only partially agrees with that assessment : " frankly speaking this may contribute to some sympathy , but i do n't think this is substantially influencing the relationship .
i think both sides , the chinese and the african side are very pragmatic in their relationship and i would n't say that there is so much spinning or ideology involved , " he said .
after all the chinese are not the only new players on the african market , as tull explains : " there is an increased presence of other emerging countries like india , like brazil , etc .
this means there is certainly more competition .
africa has become a busy place , politically and economically . "
no room for human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa 's relationship with former colonial powers like germany is still strong it also means that european partners have to share their interests with others , but tull is convinced that africa 's relationship with its former colonial powers will remain a special one : " europe 's relationship with africa has a certain depth , an historical depth , and it certainly has a lot of intensity .
therefore i do n't think that the chinese influence will grow to an extent that there would be no europeans left in africa in 20 years time or so .
the europeans will always have a presence there and will always maintain these networks , contacts and long-standing connections . "
it remains to be seen however how much influence western countries will have in africa in the future .
china presents itself to african states as a partner and not as a donor .
it makes deals without political conditions , but not necessarily without political impact .
johnson says that china tends to support the government of the day , like in sudan : " china is one of the main arm suppliers for the government of sudan .
that has made a difference for the darfur war .
also china stopped the un security council from taking measures against sudan .
so there is certainly political influence there . "
guinea is another example , says tull , " where it has been reported that the government has signed a seven-billion-dollar deal with chinese companies at a time when the new military regime is under immense international pressure over the recent massacre of civilians in the capital of conakry .
that too illustrates that the chinese are really not paying attention at all to human rights . "

some people are facing waiting periods of weeks before vaccination will be available . only two weeks after beginning a national vaccination campaign against h1n1 , the intial skepticism over the vaccine has apparently vanished in germany .
the rise in cases and deaths within europe is thought to be the reason for an apparent swing in public opinion about the dangers posed by swine flu .
in september a study found that 62 percent of germans polled would not get vaccinated .
now , due to high demand and supply shortages there are waiting lists to receive the swine flu vaccine .
in some parts of germany , those wating for vaccinations are facing a delay of several weeks .
the rhineland-palatinate ministry of health reported part of the reason for the wait is that that less vaccine was produced than expected .
they cited production shortfalls with the manufacturer .
the baden-wuerttemberg ministry of social affairs complained of " a lack of management " that led to the shortage of vaccine .
can it be too perfect ?
according to the managing director of pharmacists for schleswig-holstein frank jaschkowski , the problem with the vaccine shortage lay with the stringent quality control standards .
" the quality standards for the vaccine are extremely high , " jaschkowski said .
" so it would n't be released unless it was absolutely flawless . "
all across the country , health officials are reporting a significant increase in those seeking swine flu vaccinations .
federal health minister philipp roesler told the german daily bild on saturday that he wanted to assess the swine flu situation at a health ministers ' conference on wednesday .
" along with my colleagues from the various states ' health ministries , i would like to compare notes about where potential weaknesses in the national vaccination supply scheme may exist , " roesler said. sjt / ap / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

through his organization crossover , deluxe hopes to bring young adults together to promote better understanding . samy deluxe is not only successful , having sold over one million albums , he also has a voice that resonates with young people , especially between the ages of 15 and 20 .
this hip-hop idol also has a talent for bringing politics and social engagement to the attention of an otherwise disinterested generation through his songs .
messages like " i have a chance to make something of myself ” and " there is a lot we can do to fight off boredom " permeate his lyrics .
deluxe was not always so socially-minded .
he began his career as a rapper surrounding himself with the usual luxurious cars and beautiful women .
at that time his rhymes generally concentrated on sex , drugs and his own magnificence .
since then , deluxe has successfully transformed himself into a hip-hop artist known for his contemplative lyrics .
today his music showcases his thoughts on things like national identity , the condition of the german social state and the importance of giving today 's youth better opportunities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crossover program has had a successful start on his new cd " dis wo ich herkomm " -lrb- this is where i come from -rrb- , samy deluxe croons to soft reggae beats : this is our germany this is your germany this is the land where we live this is the new germany … a change in tone deluxe is considered one of the most successful german rappers ever , and he is well aware of his influence on young adults .
the change of tone in his music reflects this awareness .
" the concept for this album was to give people courage and to spur them to think critically about their lives and their surroundings , " the hip-hop artist explained .
born samuel sorge , the son of a sudanese father and german mother , deluxe grew up in hamburg , where he was exposed at an early age to social exclusion and ghettoization .
early in his life he was forced to develop strategies to overcome such barriers .
growing up in a mostly white area , deluxe was keenly aware of his difference from his friends and neighbors .
he consequently surrounded himself with other black german friends , hoping to discover his african roots .
in school he also had many turkish and croatian friends and he later went to the united states .
" i 've come to know many cultures and i feel comfortable when i 'm in a group that 's different from me . "
deluxe also addresses the youth of the ' hartz iv generation ' -lrb- those dependent on the german welfare system -rrb- in his songs .
many of these young adults do not foresee a good future for themselves .
but deluxe feels that the way the german system is organized , with a large middle class , young adults really do have a chance to make something of themselves .
building teams to overcome barriers in order to share his experiences with others , samy deluxe founded the non-profit organization crossover , along with designer julia von dohnanyi and marvin willoughby , a former german national basketball player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making music is one of the crossover methods von dohnanyi lived in the united states for many years and understands how important communication is in breaking down barriers .
“ the more people you know and the more types of people you get to know , the easier it is in life .
if you close yourself off and only have a ' my way is the right way ' attitude , life will be tough , " she commented .
crossover has organized basketball and hip-hop workshops at several secondary schools in hamburg to bring together students of different social backgrounds .
the program teamed up young people from exclusive residential areas with those of socially disadvantaged backgrounds and challenged them to make their own rhymes and beats .
many of the workshops were advertized across germany and attracted youth from all over country , partially due to deluxe 's name .
one of the young adults who participated was 17-year-old tom ulris from aschaffenberg .
he was excited about the sense of community that developed out of teamwork .
" i found it fascinating to learn about the differences between young people from all over germany , " he said .
" some of us came from the east and some from the west , but after an hour , it felt like we were one team , ” tom commented .
integration is a challenge for both sides crossover places a lot of emphasis on integration , regardless of whether the young adults are rich or poor , from eastern or western germany , or they are from immigrant families .
von dohnanyi feels that it is very important for youth to believe in the process of integration .
to encourage this belief , she urges team work in which the same expectations are placed upon everyone .
only when each person does his or her share can the project be successful .
sophie niebergal also believes in the value of cultural diversity in germany .
this is why she decided to do a one-year internship with the crossover organization .
she wants to work with young adults to help them start breaking down the barriers that still divide them .
as his organization grows in size and popularity among young people , samy deluxe may start to believe that some of the lyrics of his songs are ringing true . … it 's about time that people start to wake up and begin to speak about something other than celebrities , football and the weather , like how we can improve the conditions for our youth and right now because this is our germany this is your germany … author : zoran arbutina / gmb editor : louisa schaefer / bk send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some people are facing waiting periods of weeks before vaccination will be available . only two weeks after beginning a national vaccination campaign against h1n1 , the intial skepticism over the vaccine has apparently vanished in germany .
the rise in cases and deaths within europe is thought to be the reason for an apparent swing in public opinion about the dangers posed by swine flu .
in september a study found that 62 percent of germans polled would not get vaccinated .
now , due to high demand and supply shortages there are waiting lists to receive the swine flu vaccine .
in some parts of germany , those wating for vaccinations are facing a delay of several weeks .
the rhineland-palatinate ministry of health reported part of the reason for the wait is that that less vaccine was produced than expected .
they cited production shortfalls with the manufacturer .
the baden-wuerttemberg ministry of social affairs complained of " a lack of management " that led to the shortage of vaccine .
can it be too perfect ?
according to the managing director of pharmacists for schleswig-holstein frank jaschkowski , the problem with the vaccine shortage lay with the stringent quality control standards .
" the quality standards for the vaccine are extremely high , " jaschkowski said .
" so it would n't be released unless it was absolutely flawless . "
all across the country , health officials are reporting a significant increase in those seeking swine flu vaccinations .
federal health minister philipp roesler told the german daily bild on saturday that he wanted to assess the swine flu situation at a health ministers ' conference on wednesday .
" along with my colleagues from the various states ' health ministries , i would like to compare notes about where potential weaknesses in the national vaccination supply scheme may exist , " roesler said. sjt / ap / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : crunchtime for afghanistan troop increase for afghanistan must be linked to reforms , says expert nato agrees on the need for new strategy in afghanistan opinion : how the west has yet again failed afghanistan can tajikistan and ' aiming low ' be a model for afghanistan ? bundeswehr -pipe- 07.11.2009 debate on germany 's status in afghanistan opens up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's afghanistan mission is widely unpopular in germany germany 's defense minister has called for clarification of germany 's status in afghanistan , after a contoversial airstrike ordered by a german commander raised the question of whether the country is at war . german defense minister , karl-theodor zu guttenberg , told the daily sueddeutsche zeitung that legal security must be established for all german bundeswehr soldiers - in particular those taking part in complicated missions like germany 's participation in the nato isaf mission in afghanistan .
" we ca n't have our soldiers hampered by legal doubts , especially when they are forced to make decisions under extreme time pressure , " guttenberg said .
guttenberg 's comments came after he voiced his support of a controversial airstrike ordered by a german commander in afghanistan in september .
guttenberg backed the decision of colonel georg klein to launch an air attack on two fuel tankers that had been hijacked by taliban militants near a german military base in northern afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's zu guttenberg backs the controversial airstrike according to a nato report , up to 142 people , including several civilians that had gathered around the tankers to siphon fuel after they had stalled , were killed in the strike .
guttenberg acknowledged that civilians were killed in the attack and also that " some procedural errors " were committed .
nonetheless , he put his full support behind colonel klein 's decision , calling it " militarily appropriate . "
criticism from opposition several german politicians have openly disagreed with guttenberg 's backing of the airstrike .
social democrat defense expert rainer arnold told the berlin daily tagesspiegel that guttenberg 's evaluation was " illegitimate and unreasonable . "

" we ca n't have our soldiers hampered by legal doubts , especially when they are forced to make decisions under extreme time pressure , " guttenberg said .
guttenberg 's comments came after he voiced his support of a controversial airstrike ordered by a german commander in afghanistan in september .
guttenberg backed the decision of colonel georg klein to launch an air attack on two fuel tankers that had been hijacked by taliban militants near a german military base in northern afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's zu guttenberg backs the controversial airstrike according to a nato report , up to 142 people , including several civilians that had gathered around the tankers to siphon fuel after they had stalled , were killed in the strike .
guttenberg acknowledged that civilians were killed in the attack and also that " some procedural errors " were committed .
nonetheless , he put his full support behind colonel klein 's decision , calling it " militarily appropriate . "
criticism from opposition several german politicians have openly disagreed with guttenberg 's backing of the airstrike .
social democrat defense expert rainer arnold told the berlin daily tagesspiegel that guttenberg 's evaluation was " illegitimate and unreasonable . "
" if -lsb- guttenberg -rsb- believes that dropping bombs in afghanistan on large masses of people is alright , then the social democrats can no longer go along with him . "
the defense expert of the green party , omri nouripour , found guttenberg 's justification of the airstrike peculiar , especially considering that guttenberg admitted that mistakes were made .
" this issue should n't be treated as a mere bagatelle . that would make it look like the defense ministry pays no attention to the rules , " nouripour said .
bigger issue at hand the debates caused by the september airstrike have brought up the more large-scale question of whether germany is technically at war in afghanistan .
a court in the eastern state of saxony has passed the klein case on to germany 's top federal prosecution office , which will examine whether it is a matter for international law or german law .
for this to be determined the federal prosecutor must establish whether germany 's participation in the nato isaf mission constitutes an " armed conflict . "
the head of the german military alliance , colonel ulrich kirsch , told the mass-circulated bild zeitung that the german operation in afghanistan constituted war .
bildunterschrift : civilans and militants were among those killed in the airstrike , says nato " the justice ministry has stated explicitly what we are dealing with in afghanistan : a non-international armed conflict .
this is a war . "
former bundeswehr general harald kujat went further , warning of " catastrophic consequences " should germany pursue its investigations of the airstrike and impose penalties on colonel klein .
" every soldier and officer would think twice about assuming any responsibility under such conditions , " he told the daily frankfurter rundschau .
under german constitution , it is illegal for the country to enter a war , except for purposes of defense .
over sixty years following the nazi era , germans remain highly skeptical of military operations .
it was only a decade ago that german troops participated in their first foreign combat mission since the end of wwii .
opinion polls show a majority of germans oppose the engagement in afghanistan and want the over 4,000 troops there to come home. glb / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to the managing director of pharmacists for schleswig-holstein frank jaschkowski , the problem with the vaccine shortage lay with the stringent quality control standards .
" the quality standards for the vaccine are extremely high , " jaschkowski said .
" so it would n't be released unless it was absolutely flawless . "
all across the country , health officials are reporting a significant increase in those seeking swine flu vaccinations .

the futuristic design is said to include a large dome and two 55-meter minarets .
the construction of the mosque , which is expected to be completed in two years ' time , is set to begin after a long and acrimonious dispute between ditib and non-muslim residents of the city which is home to the cologne cathedral , one of the most renowned cathedrals in the world .

right-wing extremists have been particularly vocal in their opposition to the construction of the mosque and staged a small protest on saturday .
the heated debate leading up to the ceremony echoes the tensions that emerged in berlin where a mosque was constructed in recent years .
some analysts say it points to the intensifying conflict between a growing muslim community in the country and across western europe .
in the end , ditib struck a compromise , agreeing not to broadcast the call to prayer in order to avoid friction with the non-muslim residents of the neighborhood .
at the ceremony , thomas kufen , integration commissioner of the state of north rhine-westphalia , described the islamic house of worship as a sign that muslims " had arrived " in the german society .
" this mosque will be a piece of jewelry , " he added .
" it has been a long road , " kufen said , referring to the difficult and prolonged discussions over the construction of the mosque .
" it gave rise to hostility and hurt . "

" you are all part of what is an historic moment for us , " she added . fritz schramma , the former mayor of cologne , who is from chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said that the architecture of the mosque was " a symbol of a budding flower , " inviting people in .
the futuristic design is said to include a large dome and two 55-meter minarets .
the construction of the mosque , which is expected to be completed in two years ' time , is set to begin after a long and acrimonious dispute between ditib and non-muslim residents of the city which is home to the cologne cathedral , one of the most renowned cathedrals in the world .

the heated debate leading up to the ceremony echoes the tensions that emerged in berlin where a mosque was constructed in recent years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 07.11.2009 new ideas abound at the inventor 's fair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kitty clap represented just one of almost 800 inventions on display in nuremberg international inventors meet in nuremberg to display their prototypes from november 5 to 8 .
young students show promising potential , but one aisle remains empty : the iranian group did n't get visas . every year hundreds of inventors from all over the world come to nuremberg 's inventor 's fair iena to show off their latest ideas .
about 800 inventions from 33 countries are on display this year , presenting a wide range of inventions from improved household appliances to high-tech equipment .
according to iena , the number of presented inventions exceeds previous presentations in iena 's 60-year history .
many individual inventors from germany take part in signo -lrb- protection of ideas for commercial usage -rrb- inventor 's clubs .
38 of these locally organized clubs present about 190 ideas on this year 's fair .
young inventors in focus especially young inventors draw attention to their ideas .
many young students are part of inventor 's clubs at their school and professionally introduce their products to trade experts . eleven-year old raphael krauthann from signo invention club " querdenker " -lrb- " lateral thinker " -rrb- presents his idea on how to reach for crutches on the floor with a magnetic device .
he developed his idea when one of his friends was struggling with crutches because they kept falling on the floor .
" it was really annoying , so i said i 'm going to invent something , " explained raphael krauthann .
other kids from the " querdenker " club in ingolstadt also had ideas with great potential .
andreas finkenzeller 's device prevents burning by accident from an electric iron .
the 13-year-old invented a system that stops the electricity flow in an iron if it has not been moved in a certain time period .
and michael stamp , 14 , who had to visit the hospital because fireworks exploded in his hand developed a device that lids the explosive charge in a safe distance by stepping on a handle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : displayed inventions ranged from household appliances to high-tech equipment 20-year-old florian nuber was facing a different kind of problem .
his cat brought dead mice inside his parents ' house , so he grabbed two of his apprenticeship colleges at wodego to find a solution .
florian nuber , christoph seger and sebastian soderer then invented the kitty clap which uses sensors to check the cat 's outlines .
it will only allow the cat to come in if it is not carrying a mouse .
if the cat is transporting a mouse , its figure would be different . antibacterial solutions in times of swine flu and other potential infections , inventions such as spanish inventor juan edilbato rodriguez morales ' automatic hygienic mat come in handy .
first the rotating brush moistened with water and disinfectant cleans the shoe , then the dryer eliminates the remaining water .
this could be used in hospitals , at airports or other places where a lot of people gather to prevent germ spreading .
an antibacterial door handle and antibacterial pens also reduce the chance of infection with germs .
a lot of infections in hospitals are caused by door handles because everyone touches them , said bruno gruber , a professional inventor of 33 years experience .
altogether he has registered 400 patents so far .
the most difficult part , he said , is to find someone who wants to produce and sell a product which starts off as a prototype .
" inventing is easy , marketing is my biggest problem , " said gruber .
problems with patents but inventors are also facing problems with patents .
registering patents can take years , claims gruber .
" it should be accelerated , because it is damaging for the industry .
especially in tough times it is important that new ideas get introduced to the market quickly , but the patent office is understaffed . "
approximately 700 patent examiners are working for the german patent office .
gruber said they need to double the workforce .
the german patent office is currently searching for new patent examiners .
bernd antonius from the german patent office admits they are a little behind with patent applications .
another problem for inventors is the rising annual fee to keep the patent .
if inventors do n't find a company right away , they choose to secure the patent until they can find someone who is willing to produce the product .
otherwise their invention could be used by anyone for free .
registering a patent itself is not so expensive , explained gruber , but needing a specialized patent lawyer for complicated matters is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : space reserved for iranian inventors remained empty no visa for iranians iena is meant to be an exchange for international inventors , but this year one aisle remains almost completely empty .
the president of " the first institute of researchers and inventors in iran , " dr. alireza rastegar , said he did n't get visa appointments for a group of 45 young inventors at the german embassy in tehran even though he applied in time .
" we have been coming to iena for the past five years , and we never had a problem , " said rastegar .
" i am very very angry .
the iranian booths are empty .
this is a very bad position for us and this exhibition . "
rastegar booked 72 square meters -lrb- 775 square feet -rrb- of the fair for young iranian inventors .
he himself could travel to germany because he holds a swiss visa ; the few students who are at the fair got visas through italy or a family invitation from germany , he said .
that 's why babak khodaparast could present his emergency cooling system that can be used to transport a human organ in a cold device .
kambiz shirzadian , who has lived in germany for 30 years , came to represent his nephew 's booth because he did n't get a visa as well .
according to shirzadian , when he asked the german embassy in tehran about the visa application , he was told such an application did n't exist .
lydia zetl , project manager of iena , is surprised that the iranian group did n't get their visa appointments .
" for me it was obvious that they would get their visas , because they are exhibiting for several years now and it has always worked in the past . "
she said she was told that the iranian group was too late in order to get an appointment .
rastegar said he is going to discuss the issue with the iranian ambassador in berlin on monday .
for shirzadian the worst part is the disappointment the young people must feel who were eager to present their ideas and to meet international researchers .

bayern grabbed the lead on 31 minutes when defender holger badstuber sent a free kick into the box and van buyten was at hand to tap in after schalke 's kevin kuranyi accidentally headed the ball into the belgian 's path .
the balance was restored just before the break when lukas schmitz floated a free kick into the box and matip , until recently in schalke 's under-19 team , rose above bayern defenders to head home .
the result leaves munich stranded in eighth place with 20 points while schalke are fourth with 22 points .
bayer leverkusen leads the way with 26 points from a 4-0 demolition of eintracht frankfurt on friday .
werder bremen and sv hamburg are on 22 like schalke , ahead of their sunday games against borussia dortmund and in hannover 96 , respectively .
in saturday 's other fixtures , vfl wolfsburg won 2-1 at tsg hoffenheim as second-half goals from zvejzdan misimovic and grafite reversed hoffenheim 's lead from vedad ibisevic .

borussia moenchengladbach and vfb stuttgart produced no goals , while vfl bochum lost 2-1 at home against sc freiburg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 07.11.2009 new ideas abound at the inventor 's fair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kitty clap represented just one of almost 800 inventions on display in nuremberg international inventors meet in nuremberg to display their prototypes from november 5 to 8 .
young students show promising potential , but one aisle remains empty : the iranian group did n't get visas . every year hundreds of inventors from all over the world come to nuremberg 's inventor 's fair iena to show off their latest ideas .
about 800 inventions from 33 countries are on display this year , presenting a wide range of inventions from improved household appliances to high-tech equipment .
according to iena , the number of presented inventions exceeds previous presentations in iena 's 60-year history .
many individual inventors from germany take part in signo -lrb- protection of ideas for commercial usage -rrb- inventor 's clubs .
38 of these locally organized clubs present about 190 ideas on this year 's fair .
young inventors in focus especially young inventors draw attention to their ideas .
many young students are part of inventor 's clubs at their school and professionally introduce their products to trade experts . eleven-year old raphael krauthann from signo invention club " querdenker " -lrb- " lateral thinker " -rrb- presents his idea on how to reach for crutches on the floor with a magnetic device .
he developed his idea when one of his friends was struggling with crutches because they kept falling on the floor .
" it was really annoying , so i said i 'm going to invent something , " explained raphael krauthann .
other kids from the " querdenker " club in ingolstadt also had ideas with great potential .
andreas finkenzeller 's device prevents burning by accident from an electric iron .
the 13-year-old invented a system that stops the electricity flow in an iron if it has not been moved in a certain time period .
and michael stamp , 14 , who had to visit the hospital because fireworks exploded in his hand developed a device that lids the explosive charge in a safe distance by stepping on a handle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : displayed inventions ranged from household appliances to high-tech equipment 20-year-old florian nuber was facing a different kind of problem .
his cat brought dead mice inside his parents ' house , so he grabbed two of his apprenticeship colleges at wodego to find a solution .
florian nuber , christoph seger and sebastian soderer then invented the kitty clap which uses sensors to check the cat 's outlines .
it will only allow the cat to come in if it is not carrying a mouse .
if the cat is transporting a mouse , its figure would be different . antibacterial solutions in times of swine flu and other potential infections , inventions such as spanish inventor juan edilbato rodriguez morales ' automatic hygienic mat come in handy .
first the rotating brush moistened with water and disinfectant cleans the shoe , then the dryer eliminates the remaining water .
this could be used in hospitals , at airports or other places where a lot of people gather to prevent germ spreading .
an antibacterial door handle and antibacterial pens also reduce the chance of infection with germs .
a lot of infections in hospitals are caused by door handles because everyone touches them , said bruno gruber , a professional inventor of 33 years experience .
altogether he has registered 400 patents so far .
the most difficult part , he said , is to find someone who wants to produce and sell a product which starts off as a prototype .
" inventing is easy , marketing is my biggest problem , " said gruber .
problems with patents but inventors are also facing problems with patents .
registering patents can take years , claims gruber .
" it should be accelerated , because it is damaging for the industry .
especially in tough times it is important that new ideas get introduced to the market quickly , but the patent office is understaffed . "
approximately 700 patent examiners are working for the german patent office .
gruber said they need to double the workforce .
the german patent office is currently searching for new patent examiners .
bernd antonius from the german patent office admits they are a little behind with patent applications .
another problem for inventors is the rising annual fee to keep the patent .
if inventors do n't find a company right away , they choose to secure the patent until they can find someone who is willing to produce the product .
otherwise their invention could be used by anyone for free .
registering a patent itself is not so expensive , explained gruber , but needing a specialized patent lawyer for complicated matters is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : space reserved for iranian inventors remained empty no visa for iranians iena is meant to be an exchange for international inventors , but this year one aisle remains almost completely empty .
the president of " the first institute of researchers and inventors in iran , " dr. alireza rastegar , said he did n't get visa appointments for a group of 45 young inventors at the german embassy in tehran even though he applied in time .
" we have been coming to iena for the past five years , and we never had a problem , " said rastegar .
" i am very very angry .
the iranian booths are empty .
this is a very bad position for us and this exhibition . "
rastegar booked 72 square meters -lrb- 775 square feet -rrb- of the fair for young iranian inventors .
he himself could travel to germany because he holds a swiss visa ; the few students who are at the fair got visas through italy or a family invitation from germany , he said .
that 's why babak khodaparast could present his emergency cooling system that can be used to transport a human organ in a cold device .
kambiz shirzadian , who has lived in germany for 30 years , came to represent his nephew 's booth because he did n't get a visa as well .
according to shirzadian , when he asked the german embassy in tehran about the visa application , he was told such an application did n't exist .
lydia zetl , project manager of iena , is surprised that the iranian group did n't get their visa appointments .
" for me it was obvious that they would get their visas , because they are exhibiting for several years now and it has always worked in the past . "
she said she was told that the iranian group was too late in order to get an appointment .
rastegar said he is going to discuss the issue with the iranian ambassador in berlin on monday .
for shirzadian the worst part is the disappointment the young people must feel who were eager to present their ideas and to meet international researchers .

through his organization crossover , deluxe hopes to bring young adults together to promote better understanding . samy deluxe is not only successful , having sold over one million albums , he also has a voice that resonates with young people , especially between the ages of 15 and 20 .
this hip-hop idol also has a talent for bringing politics and social engagement to the attention of an otherwise disinterested generation through his songs .
messages like " i have a chance to make something of myself ” and " there is a lot we can do to fight off boredom " permeate his lyrics .
deluxe was not always so socially-minded .
he began his career as a rapper surrounding himself with the usual luxurious cars and beautiful women .
at that time his rhymes generally concentrated on sex , drugs and his own magnificence .
since then , deluxe has successfully transformed himself into a hip-hop artist known for his contemplative lyrics .
today his music showcases his thoughts on things like national identity , the condition of the german social state and the importance of giving today 's youth better opportunities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crossover program has had a successful start on his new cd " dis wo ich herkomm " -lrb- this is where i come from -rrb- , samy deluxe croons to soft reggae beats : this is our germany this is your germany this is the land where we live this is the new germany … a change in tone deluxe is considered one of the most successful german rappers ever , and he is well aware of his influence on young adults .
the change of tone in his music reflects this awareness .
" the concept for this album was to give people courage and to spur them to think critically about their lives and their surroundings , " the hip-hop artist explained .
born samuel sorge , the son of a sudanese father and german mother , deluxe grew up in hamburg , where he was exposed at an early age to social exclusion and ghettoization .
early in his life he was forced to develop strategies to overcome such barriers .
growing up in a mostly white area , deluxe was keenly aware of his difference from his friends and neighbors .
he consequently surrounded himself with other black german friends , hoping to discover his african roots .
in school he also had many turkish and croatian friends and he later went to the united states .
" i 've come to know many cultures and i feel comfortable when i 'm in a group that 's different from me . "
deluxe also addresses the youth of the ' hartz iv generation ' -lrb- those dependent on the german welfare system -rrb- in his songs .
many of these young adults do not foresee a good future for themselves .
but deluxe feels that the way the german system is organized , with a large middle class , young adults really do have a chance to make something of themselves .
building teams to overcome barriers in order to share his experiences with others , samy deluxe founded the non-profit organization crossover , along with designer julia von dohnanyi and marvin willoughby , a former german national basketball player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making music is one of the crossover methods von dohnanyi lived in the united states for many years and understands how important communication is in breaking down barriers .
“ the more people you know and the more types of people you get to know , the easier it is in life .
if you close yourself off and only have a ' my way is the right way ' attitude , life will be tough , " she commented .
crossover has organized basketball and hip-hop workshops at several secondary schools in hamburg to bring together students of different social backgrounds .
the program teamed up young people from exclusive residential areas with those of socially disadvantaged backgrounds and challenged them to make their own rhymes and beats .
many of the workshops were advertized across germany and attracted youth from all over country , partially due to deluxe 's name .
one of the young adults who participated was 17-year-old tom ulris from aschaffenberg .
he was excited about the sense of community that developed out of teamwork .
" i found it fascinating to learn about the differences between young people from all over germany , " he said .
" some of us came from the east and some from the west , but after an hour , it felt like we were one team , ” tom commented .
integration is a challenge for both sides crossover places a lot of emphasis on integration , regardless of whether the young adults are rich or poor , from eastern or western germany , or they are from immigrant families .
von dohnanyi feels that it is very important for youth to believe in the process of integration .
to encourage this belief , she urges team work in which the same expectations are placed upon everyone .
only when each person does his or her share can the project be successful .
sophie niebergal also believes in the value of cultural diversity in germany .
this is why she decided to do a one-year internship with the crossover organization .
she wants to work with young adults to help them start breaking down the barriers that still divide them .

some people are facing waiting periods of weeks before vaccination will be available . only two weeks after beginning a national vaccination campaign against h1n1 , the intial skepticism over the vaccine has apparently vanished in germany .
the rise in cases and deaths within europe is thought to be the reason for an apparent swing in public opinion about the dangers posed by swine flu .
in september a study found that 62 percent of germans polled would not get vaccinated .
now , due to high demand and supply shortages there are waiting lists to receive the swine flu vaccine .
in some parts of germany , those wating for vaccinations are facing a delay of several weeks .
the rhineland-palatinate ministry of health reported part of the reason for the wait is that that less vaccine was produced than expected .
they cited production shortfalls with the manufacturer .
the baden-wuerttemberg ministry of social affairs complained of " a lack of management " that led to the shortage of vaccine .
can it be too perfect ?
according to the managing director of pharmacists for schleswig-holstein frank jaschkowski , the problem with the vaccine shortage lay with the stringent quality control standards .
" the quality standards for the vaccine are extremely high , " jaschkowski said .
" so it would n't be released unless it was absolutely flawless . "
all across the country , health officials are reporting a significant increase in those seeking swine flu vaccinations .
federal health minister philipp roesler told the german daily bild on saturday that he wanted to assess the swine flu situation at a health ministers ' conference on wednesday .
" along with my colleagues from the various states ' health ministries , i would like to compare notes about where potential weaknesses in the national vaccination supply scheme may exist , " roesler said. sjt / ap / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" you are all part of what is an historic moment for us , " she added . fritz schramma , the former mayor of cologne , who is from chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said that the architecture of the mosque was " a symbol of a budding flower , " inviting people in .
the futuristic design is said to include a large dome and two 55-meter minarets .
the construction of the mosque , which is expected to be completed in two years ' time , is set to begin after a long and acrimonious dispute between ditib and non-muslim residents of the city which is home to the cologne cathedral , one of the most renowned cathedrals in the world .

right-wing extremists have been particularly vocal in their opposition to the construction of the mosque and staged a small protest on saturday .
the heated debate leading up to the ceremony echoes the tensions that emerged in berlin where a mosque was constructed in recent years .
some analysts say it points to the intensifying conflict between a growing muslim community in the country and across western europe .
in the end , ditib struck a compromise , agreeing not to broadcast the call to prayer in order to avoid friction with the non-muslim residents of the neighborhood .
at the ceremony , thomas kufen , integration commissioner of the state of north rhine-westphalia , described the islamic house of worship as a sign that muslims " had arrived " in the german society .
" this mosque will be a piece of jewelry , " he added .
" it has been a long road , " kufen said , referring to the difficult and prolonged discussions over the construction of the mosque .
" it gave rise to hostility and hurt . "
however , he said the fact that the foundation stone had been laid was a sign that xenophobia stands no chance. rb / dpa / epd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on sunday , chinese premier wen jiabao reflected the close ties between the two pledging $ 10 billion in loans and announcing that tariffs on 95 percent of products from the least-developed african nations would be removed .
china 's foreign minister said on monday that these ties would ultimately help africans " improve their livelihood . "
" china is present in almost every african country , " said denis tull , a researcher with the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" and it 's not just a matter of buying raw materials nor is it part of a grand strategy . "
dominic johnson , africa expert with the berlin-based newspaper tageszeitung told deutsche welle that , " there seems to be a shift away on the chinese side from simply investing in natural resource extraction or buying oil toward investing in african infrastructure . "
a few days ago , china and nigeria signed a contract on building a railway line - a much-needed development as the railway infrastructure in africa 's most populous state dates back to colonial times .
the first ones to benefit from a better transport system in nigeria are the chinese themselves .
chinese companies are keen to develop the nigerian market , as johnson explained : " nigeria has a rapidly growing middle class .
and geographically it is located perfectly to supply the entire west african market .
so it 's a very interesting country for doing business . "
the chinese export mainly basic consumer goods to nigeria - clothes , shoes , but also electronics and motorcycles .
" chinese traders have been very good at settling down in african markets , bringing in lots of goods at low prices and really pushing themselves into the consumer market , " said johnson .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese companies are investing in african infrastructure projects africa has become a busy hub it does n't do any harm that china is an emerging country itself , said johnson , on the contrary : " in fact it strengthens the chinese , because on the political level they can say to the africans : we 're both against the mighty west .
some african leaders feel quite happy about that .
they look at china and say : forty years ago china was as poor as us , look at them now , should n't we be doing the same thing ? "
however , tull only partially agrees with that assessment : " frankly speaking this may contribute to some sympathy , but i do n't think this is substantially influencing the relationship .
i think both sides , the chinese and the african side are very pragmatic in their relationship and i would n't say that there is so much spinning or ideology involved , " he said .
after all the chinese are not the only new players on the african market , as tull explains : " there is an increased presence of other emerging countries like india , like brazil , etc .
this means there is certainly more competition .
africa has become a busy place , politically and economically . "
no room for human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa 's relationship with former colonial powers like germany is still strong it also means that european partners have to share their interests with others , but tull is convinced that africa 's relationship with its former colonial powers will remain a special one : " europe 's relationship with africa has a certain depth , an historical depth , and it certainly has a lot of intensity .
therefore i do n't think that the chinese influence will grow to an extent that there would be no europeans left in africa in 20 years time or so .
the europeans will always have a presence there and will always maintain these networks , contacts and long-standing connections . "
it remains to be seen however how much influence western countries will have in africa in the future .
china presents itself to african states as a partner and not as a donor .
it makes deals without political conditions , but not necessarily without political impact .
johnson says that china tends to support the government of the day , like in sudan : " china is one of the main arm suppliers for the government of sudan .
that has made a difference for the darfur war .
also china stopped the un security council from taking measures against sudan .
so there is certainly political influence there . "
guinea is another example , says tull , " where it has been reported that the government has signed a seven-billion-dollar deal with chinese companies at a time when the new military regime is under immense international pressure over the recent massacre of civilians in the capital of conakry .
that too illustrates that the chinese are really not paying attention at all to human rights . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human trafficking is a major problem in moldova single mothers in search of prosperity are particularly easy prey for human traffickers .
though the numbers of victims in the past three years has fallen from 507 to 151 , the problem still exists , said elena mereacre .
the former librarian founded the organization " compasiune " - or " compassion " - in costesti eight years ago .
" we have 12 children here who with their mothers fell into the hands of human traffickers in poland , russia and ukraine , " mereacre said .
" they had to beg on the streets from morning till night and were n't allowed to keep any of the money . "
" when they return here , the children are often emotionally and physically shattered , " mereacre said .
sometimes , women emigrate and then return to their native villages with one or two children - the undesired " by product " of years of prostitution .
the main countries of destination are turkey , russia and saudi arabia .
" they do n't dare to tell their relatives about it because they are ashamed , " mereacre said .
" many relationships end in divorce .
the husbands are mainly concerned with saving face .
they do n't want the entire village to find out that their own family fell victim to human traffickers . "
mereacre sees to these children .
her organization , funded by donations from abroad , offers sewing and cooking courses for the women .
she said she tries on a small scale to give them a prospect for the future and above all , enable them to live a life with dignity .
empathy for human traffickers whether there are in fact less victims of human trafficking is debatable , said martin wintersberger from the eu border assistance mission .
he said he could not rule out a certain glut in this sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gorceag wants to help women find the strength to move forward experts report however that the traffickers themselves have also changed their technique .
though the victims live and work in difficult conditions abroad , they often have more rights than they used to .
they are allowed to send money home and telephone with their relatives .
sometimes , the human trafficker mutates for his victims into an almost nice guy , said lidia gorceag , a psychologist in a counseling center for former sex-trafficking victims .
" when a woman who comes from complete poverty suddenly lives in a nice hotel , always has a full refrigerator , hot water and nice bedding , that can alter their view for reality , " gorceag said .
in a recent case she treated , she needed two months of convincing to get a woman to see the truth .
but in order to keep women from getting into such a situation in the first place , moldova has to first fight poverty .
this is one of the central challenges for the country 's western-leaning government elected earlier this year .

german sporting goods maker adidas is hoping that the next round of world cup mania , together with changes at its us reebok unit , will help pull sales out of the doldrums . adidas ceo herbert hainer said he is looking to 2010 , when the soccer world cup is to be played in south africa , for a boost in sales .
the company reported a third-quarter revenue drop of 7 percent from a year earlier , as sales in its sports-performance division struggled .
customers were keeping their purse-strings tied as a result of the financial crisis , the company said .
' cautiously optimistic ' despite crisis still , the world 's second-largest sporting goods manufacturer said it was " cautiously optimistic " about 2010 results , with hopes that world cup soccer fever , and a new approach to products at its us reebok unit , would boost sales as early as the current quarter .

the company expects to outfit 12 of the teams competing for the cup , including germany and spain .
the company , based in herzogenaurach , germany , predicted its soccer products would lead to record sales of more than 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- in 2010 .
" this year , our industry and our group have faced unprecedented challenges , " said hainer said in his third-quarter report , which was released on wednesday .
" however , we have tackled the challenges head on .
we have successfully adapted to our difficult surroundings .
and our drive for operational excellence has meant we have strongly improved our financial position . "
plans to release ' explosion ' of new products as adidas continues to trim costs in the third quarter , hainer says he believes the worst is over for the company - despite ongoing difficult markets in the usa and china : " the mood swings between fear and optimism , " he told reporters in a press conference .
for 2009 , adidas predicted net gains of between 230 and 260 million euros , assuming fourth-quarter improvements tied to the world cup .

increasing parts of the population are leaving in search of a better life .
but many return disillusioned . in soviet times , moldova was thriving .
today , it is one of the poorest countries in europe .
the town of costesti , home to 12,000 people , is in an isolated and bleak region some 35 kilometers south of moldova 's capital chisinau .
the roads are unsurfaced , the homes deserted or run down .
in the local secondary school , 25 soon-to-be graduates are following instructions .
when the teacher asks them who wants to go abroad after they finish school , almost all hands shoot up in the air .
" i want to study and then work abroad if it 's possible , " said 17-year-old docina .
" and i want to travel to other countries , to see how people live there , and learn other languages . "
she said she does n't see any occupational future in her country .
" no , because moldova is a poor country , " docina said .
her classmate christina said she dreams of a career as a designer .
no occupational future these girls do n't know where they 're going to go - maybe to russia , spain , italy or even the united states .
they do n't really know what the work conditions are in those countries .
but they are certain that it must be better than in moldova .
after all , one of their parents is also working abroad .
in most cases , it 's the mothers who earn their money elsewhere .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in costesti face an uncertain future " we telephone regularly and once a year , my mother comes to visit , " many young people report .
they do n't see any future for themselves in their home country .
it 's understandable , considering the current monthly wage of some 140 euros -lrb- $ 206 -rrb- .
also , they all agree that moldova is simply too poor .
the girls said they believe they can only bring forward their country from far away when they emigrate .
these young women are right in their assumption .
migration has developed into a central economic factor for moldova .
last year , emigrants from moldova transferred $ 2 billion to their home country , according to the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- .
this was more than the entire national budget , iom said .
danger of human trafficking one quarter of the country 's four million people has already left moldova .
many children grow up with only one parent .
often , the fathers stay behind , are overtaxed with the situation and drink away their sorrows .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human trafficking is a major problem in moldova single mothers in search of prosperity are particularly easy prey for human traffickers .
though the numbers of victims in the past three years has fallen from 507 to 151 , the problem still exists , said elena mereacre .
the former librarian founded the organization " compasiune " - or " compassion " - in costesti eight years ago .
" we have 12 children here who with their mothers fell into the hands of human traffickers in poland , russia and ukraine , " mereacre said .
" they had to beg on the streets from morning till night and were n't allowed to keep any of the money . "
" when they return here , the children are often emotionally and physically shattered , " mereacre said .
sometimes , women emigrate and then return to their native villages with one or two children - the undesired " by product " of years of prostitution .
the main countries of destination are turkey , russia and saudi arabia .
" they do n't dare to tell their relatives about it because they are ashamed , " mereacre said .
" many relationships end in divorce .
the husbands are mainly concerned with saving face .
they do n't want the entire village to find out that their own family fell victim to human traffickers . "
mereacre sees to these children .
her organization , funded by donations from abroad , offers sewing and cooking courses for the women .
she said she tries on a small scale to give them a prospect for the future and above all , enable them to live a life with dignity .
empathy for human traffickers whether there are in fact less victims of human trafficking is debatable , said martin wintersberger from the eu border assistance mission .
he said he could not rule out a certain glut in this sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gorceag wants to help women find the strength to move forward experts report however that the traffickers themselves have also changed their technique .
though the victims live and work in difficult conditions abroad , they often have more rights than they used to .
they are allowed to send money home and telephone with their relatives .
sometimes , the human trafficker mutates for his victims into an almost nice guy , said lidia gorceag , a psychologist in a counseling center for former sex-trafficking victims .
" when a woman who comes from complete poverty suddenly lives in a nice hotel , always has a full refrigerator , hot water and nice bedding , that can alter their view for reality , " gorceag said .
in a recent case she treated , she needed two months of convincing to get a woman to see the truth .
but in order to keep women from getting into such a situation in the first place , moldova has to first fight poverty .
this is one of the central challenges for the country 's western-leaning government elected earlier this year .

customers were keeping their purse-strings tied as a result of the financial crisis , the company said .
' cautiously optimistic ' despite crisis still , the world 's second-largest sporting goods manufacturer said it was " cautiously optimistic " about 2010 results , with hopes that world cup soccer fever , and a new approach to products at its us reebok unit , would boost sales as early as the current quarter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : crunchtime for afghanistan troop increase for afghanistan must be linked to reforms , says expert nato agrees on the need for new strategy in afghanistan opinion : how the west has yet again failed afghanistan can tajikistan and ' aiming low ' be a model for afghanistan ? bundeswehr -pipe- 07.11.2009 debate on germany 's status in afghanistan opens up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's afghanistan mission is widely unpopular in germany germany 's defense minister has called for clarification of germany 's status in afghanistan , after a contoversial airstrike ordered by a german commander raised the question of whether the country is at war . german defense minister , karl-theodor zu guttenberg , told the daily sueddeutsche zeitung that legal security must be established for all german bundeswehr soldiers - in particular those taking part in complicated missions like germany 's participation in the nato isaf mission in afghanistan .
" we ca n't have our soldiers hampered by legal doubts , especially when they are forced to make decisions under extreme time pressure , " guttenberg said .
guttenberg 's comments came after he voiced his support of a controversial airstrike ordered by a german commander in afghanistan in september .
guttenberg backed the decision of colonel georg klein to launch an air attack on two fuel tankers that had been hijacked by taliban militants near a german military base in northern afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's zu guttenberg backs the controversial airstrike according to a nato report , up to 142 people , including several civilians that had gathered around the tankers to siphon fuel after they had stalled , were killed in the strike .
guttenberg acknowledged that civilians were killed in the attack and also that " some procedural errors " were committed .
nonetheless , he put his full support behind colonel klein 's decision , calling it " militarily appropriate . "
criticism from opposition several german politicians have openly disagreed with guttenberg 's backing of the airstrike .
social democrat defense expert rainer arnold told the berlin daily tagesspiegel that guttenberg 's evaluation was " illegitimate and unreasonable . "
" if -lsb- guttenberg -rsb- believes that dropping bombs in afghanistan on large masses of people is alright , then the social democrats can no longer go along with him . "
the defense expert of the green party , omri nouripour , found guttenberg 's justification of the airstrike peculiar , especially considering that guttenberg admitted that mistakes were made .
" this issue should n't be treated as a mere bagatelle . that would make it look like the defense ministry pays no attention to the rules , " nouripour said .
bigger issue at hand the debates caused by the september airstrike have brought up the more large-scale question of whether germany is technically at war in afghanistan .
a court in the eastern state of saxony has passed the klein case on to germany 's top federal prosecution office , which will examine whether it is a matter for international law or german law .
for this to be determined the federal prosecutor must establish whether germany 's participation in the nato isaf mission constitutes an " armed conflict . "
the head of the german military alliance , colonel ulrich kirsch , told the mass-circulated bild zeitung that the german operation in afghanistan constituted war .
bildunterschrift : civilans and militants were among those killed in the airstrike , says nato " the justice ministry has stated explicitly what we are dealing with in afghanistan : a non-international armed conflict .
this is a war . "
former bundeswehr general harald kujat went further , warning of " catastrophic consequences " should germany pursue its investigations of the airstrike and impose penalties on colonel klein .
" every soldier and officer would think twice about assuming any responsibility under such conditions , " he told the daily frankfurter rundschau .
under german constitution , it is illegal for the country to enter a war , except for purposes of defense .
over sixty years following the nazi era , germans remain highly skeptical of military operations .
it was only a decade ago that german troops participated in their first foreign combat mission since the end of wwii .
opinion polls show a majority of germans oppose the engagement in afghanistan and want the over 4,000 troops there to come home. glb / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on sunday , chinese premier wen jiabao reflected the close ties between the two pledging $ 10 billion in loans and announcing that tariffs on 95 percent of products from the least-developed african nations would be removed .
china 's foreign minister said on monday that these ties would ultimately help africans " improve their livelihood . "
" china is present in almost every african country , " said denis tull , a researcher with the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" and it 's not just a matter of buying raw materials nor is it part of a grand strategy . "
dominic johnson , africa expert with the berlin-based newspaper tageszeitung told deutsche welle that , " there seems to be a shift away on the chinese side from simply investing in natural resource extraction or buying oil toward investing in african infrastructure . "
a few days ago , china and nigeria signed a contract on building a railway line - a much-needed development as the railway infrastructure in africa 's most populous state dates back to colonial times .
the first ones to benefit from a better transport system in nigeria are the chinese themselves .
chinese companies are keen to develop the nigerian market , as johnson explained : " nigeria has a rapidly growing middle class .
and geographically it is located perfectly to supply the entire west african market .
so it 's a very interesting country for doing business . "
the chinese export mainly basic consumer goods to nigeria - clothes , shoes , but also electronics and motorcycles .
" chinese traders have been very good at settling down in african markets , bringing in lots of goods at low prices and really pushing themselves into the consumer market , " said johnson .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese companies are investing in african infrastructure projects africa has become a busy hub it does n't do any harm that china is an emerging country itself , said johnson , on the contrary : " in fact it strengthens the chinese , because on the political level they can say to the africans : we 're both against the mighty west .
some african leaders feel quite happy about that .
they look at china and say : forty years ago china was as poor as us , look at them now , should n't we be doing the same thing ? "
however , tull only partially agrees with that assessment : " frankly speaking this may contribute to some sympathy , but i do n't think this is substantially influencing the relationship .
i think both sides , the chinese and the african side are very pragmatic in their relationship and i would n't say that there is so much spinning or ideology involved , " he said .
after all the chinese are not the only new players on the african market , as tull explains : " there is an increased presence of other emerging countries like india , like brazil , etc .
this means there is certainly more competition .
africa has become a busy place , politically and economically . "
no room for human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa 's relationship with former colonial powers like germany is still strong it also means that european partners have to share their interests with others , but tull is convinced that africa 's relationship with its former colonial powers will remain a special one : " europe 's relationship with africa has a certain depth , an historical depth , and it certainly has a lot of intensity .
therefore i do n't think that the chinese influence will grow to an extent that there would be no europeans left in africa in 20 years time or so .
the europeans will always have a presence there and will always maintain these networks , contacts and long-standing connections . "
it remains to be seen however how much influence western countries will have in africa in the future .
china presents itself to african states as a partner and not as a donor .
it makes deals without political conditions , but not necessarily without political impact .
johnson says that china tends to support the government of the day , like in sudan : " china is one of the main arm suppliers for the government of sudan .
that has made a difference for the darfur war .
also china stopped the un security council from taking measures against sudan .
so there is certainly political influence there . "
guinea is another example , says tull , " where it has been reported that the government has signed a seven-billion-dollar deal with chinese companies at a time when the new military regime is under immense international pressure over the recent massacre of civilians in the capital of conakry .
that too illustrates that the chinese are really not paying attention at all to human rights . "

guinea is another example , says tull , " where it has been reported that the government has signed a seven-billion-dollar deal with chinese companies at a time when the new military regime is under immense international pressure over the recent massacre of civilians in the capital of conakry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 07.11.2009 germany worried over vaccine shortage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production shortfalls are causing long waits for the shot vaccine shortages point to a shift in public opinion toward the hazards of the swine flu in germany .
some people are facing waiting periods of weeks before vaccination will be available . only two weeks after beginning a national vaccination campaign against h1n1 , the intial skepticism over the vaccine has apparently vanished in germany .
the rise in cases and deaths within europe is thought to be the reason for an apparent swing in public opinion about the dangers posed by swine flu .
in september a study found that 62 percent of germans polled would not get vaccinated .
now , due to high demand and supply shortages there are waiting lists to receive the swine flu vaccine .
in some parts of germany , those wating for vaccinations are facing a delay of several weeks .
the rhineland-palatinate ministry of health reported part of the reason for the wait is that that less vaccine was produced than expected .
they cited production shortfalls with the manufacturer .
the baden-wuerttemberg ministry of social affairs complained of " a lack of management " that led to the shortage of vaccine .
can it be too perfect ?
according to the managing director of pharmacists for schleswig-holstein frank jaschkowski , the problem with the vaccine shortage lay with the stringent quality control standards .
" the quality standards for the vaccine are extremely high , " jaschkowski said .
" so it would n't be released unless it was absolutely flawless . "
all across the country , health officials are reporting a significant increase in those seeking swine flu vaccinations .
federal health minister philipp roesler told the german daily bild on saturday that he wanted to assess the swine flu situation at a health ministers ' conference on wednesday .
" along with my colleagues from the various states ' health ministries , i would like to compare notes about where potential weaknesses in the national vaccination supply scheme may exist , " roesler said. sjt / ap / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some people are facing waiting periods of weeks before vaccination will be available . only two weeks after beginning a national vaccination campaign against h1n1 , the intial skepticism over the vaccine has apparently vanished in germany .
the rise in cases and deaths within europe is thought to be the reason for an apparent swing in public opinion about the dangers posed by swine flu .
in september a study found that 62 percent of germans polled would not get vaccinated .
now , due to high demand and supply shortages there are waiting lists to receive the swine flu vaccine .
in some parts of germany , those wating for vaccinations are facing a delay of several weeks .
the rhineland-palatinate ministry of health reported part of the reason for the wait is that that less vaccine was produced than expected .
they cited production shortfalls with the manufacturer .
the baden-wuerttemberg ministry of social affairs complained of " a lack of management " that led to the shortage of vaccine .
can it be too perfect ?
according to the managing director of pharmacists for schleswig-holstein frank jaschkowski , the problem with the vaccine shortage lay with the stringent quality control standards .
" the quality standards for the vaccine are extremely high , " jaschkowski said .
" so it would n't be released unless it was absolutely flawless . "
all across the country , health officials are reporting a significant increase in those seeking swine flu vaccinations .
federal health minister philipp roesler told the german daily bild on saturday that he wanted to assess the swine flu situation at a health ministers ' conference on wednesday .
" along with my colleagues from the various states ' health ministries , i would like to compare notes about where potential weaknesses in the national vaccination supply scheme may exist , " roesler said. sjt / ap / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some people are facing waiting periods of weeks before vaccination will be available . only two weeks after beginning a national vaccination campaign against h1n1 , the intial skepticism over the vaccine has apparently vanished in germany .
the rise in cases and deaths within europe is thought to be the reason for an apparent swing in public opinion about the dangers posed by swine flu .
in september a study found that 62 percent of germans polled would not get vaccinated .
now , due to high demand and supply shortages there are waiting lists to receive the swine flu vaccine .
in some parts of germany , those wating for vaccinations are facing a delay of several weeks .
the rhineland-palatinate ministry of health reported part of the reason for the wait is that that less vaccine was produced than expected .
they cited production shortfalls with the manufacturer .
the baden-wuerttemberg ministry of social affairs complained of " a lack of management " that led to the shortage of vaccine .
can it be too perfect ?
according to the managing director of pharmacists for schleswig-holstein frank jaschkowski , the problem with the vaccine shortage lay with the stringent quality control standards .
" the quality standards for the vaccine are extremely high , " jaschkowski said .
" so it would n't be released unless it was absolutely flawless . "
all across the country , health officials are reporting a significant increase in those seeking swine flu vaccinations .
federal health minister philipp roesler told the german daily bild on saturday that he wanted to assess the swine flu situation at a health ministers ' conference on wednesday .
" along with my colleagues from the various states ' health ministries , i would like to compare notes about where potential weaknesses in the national vaccination supply scheme may exist , " roesler said. sjt / ap / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

through his organization crossover , deluxe hopes to bring young adults together to promote better understanding . samy deluxe is not only successful , having sold over one million albums , he also has a voice that resonates with young people , especially between the ages of 15 and 20 .
this hip-hop idol also has a talent for bringing politics and social engagement to the attention of an otherwise disinterested generation through his songs .
messages like " i have a chance to make something of myself ” and " there is a lot we can do to fight off boredom " permeate his lyrics .
deluxe was not always so socially-minded .
he began his career as a rapper surrounding himself with the usual luxurious cars and beautiful women .
at that time his rhymes generally concentrated on sex , drugs and his own magnificence .
since then , deluxe has successfully transformed himself into a hip-hop artist known for his contemplative lyrics .
today his music showcases his thoughts on things like national identity , the condition of the german social state and the importance of giving today 's youth better opportunities .

the change of tone in his music reflects this awareness .
" the concept for this album was to give people courage and to spur them to think critically about their lives and their surroundings , " the hip-hop artist explained .
born samuel sorge , the son of a sudanese father and german mother , deluxe grew up in hamburg , where he was exposed at an early age to social exclusion and ghettoization .
early in his life he was forced to develop strategies to overcome such barriers .
growing up in a mostly white area , deluxe was keenly aware of his difference from his friends and neighbors .
he consequently surrounded himself with other black german friends , hoping to discover his african roots .
in school he also had many turkish and croatian friends and he later went to the united states .
" i 've come to know many cultures and i feel comfortable when i 'm in a group that 's different from me . "
deluxe also addresses the youth of the ' hartz iv generation ' -lrb- those dependent on the german welfare system -rrb- in his songs .
many of these young adults do not foresee a good future for themselves .
but deluxe feels that the way the german system is organized , with a large middle class , young adults really do have a chance to make something of themselves .
building teams to overcome barriers in order to share his experiences with others , samy deluxe founded the non-profit organization crossover , along with designer julia von dohnanyi and marvin willoughby , a former german national basketball player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making music is one of the crossover methods von dohnanyi lived in the united states for many years and understands how important communication is in breaking down barriers .
“ the more people you know and the more types of people you get to know , the easier it is in life .
if you close yourself off and only have a ' my way is the right way ' attitude , life will be tough , " she commented .
crossover has organized basketball and hip-hop workshops at several secondary schools in hamburg to bring together students of different social backgrounds .
the program teamed up young people from exclusive residential areas with those of socially disadvantaged backgrounds and challenged them to make their own rhymes and beats .
many of the workshops were advertized across germany and attracted youth from all over country , partially due to deluxe 's name .
one of the young adults who participated was 17-year-old tom ulris from aschaffenberg .
he was excited about the sense of community that developed out of teamwork .
" i found it fascinating to learn about the differences between young people from all over germany , " he said .
" some of us came from the east and some from the west , but after an hour , it felt like we were one team , ” tom commented .
integration is a challenge for both sides crossover places a lot of emphasis on integration , regardless of whether the young adults are rich or poor , from eastern or western germany , or they are from immigrant families .
von dohnanyi feels that it is very important for youth to believe in the process of integration .
to encourage this belief , she urges team work in which the same expectations are placed upon everyone .
only when each person does his or her share can the project be successful .
sophie niebergal also believes in the value of cultural diversity in germany .
this is why she decided to do a one-year internship with the crossover organization .
she wants to work with young adults to help them start breaking down the barriers that still divide them .

crossover has organized basketball and hip-hop workshops at several secondary schools in hamburg to bring together students of different social backgrounds .

through his organization crossover , deluxe hopes to bring young adults together to promote better understanding . samy deluxe is not only successful , having sold over one million albums , he also has a voice that resonates with young people , especially between the ages of 15 and 20 .
this hip-hop idol also has a talent for bringing politics and social engagement to the attention of an otherwise disinterested generation through his songs .
messages like " i have a chance to make something of myself ” and " there is a lot we can do to fight off boredom " permeate his lyrics .
deluxe was not always so socially-minded .
he began his career as a rapper surrounding himself with the usual luxurious cars and beautiful women .
at that time his rhymes generally concentrated on sex , drugs and his own magnificence .
since then , deluxe has successfully transformed himself into a hip-hop artist known for his contemplative lyrics .
today his music showcases his thoughts on things like national identity , the condition of the german social state and the importance of giving today 's youth better opportunities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crossover program has had a successful start on his new cd " dis wo ich herkomm " -lrb- this is where i come from -rrb- , samy deluxe croons to soft reggae beats : this is our germany this is your germany this is the land where we live this is the new germany … a change in tone deluxe is considered one of the most successful german rappers ever , and he is well aware of his influence on young adults .
the change of tone in his music reflects this awareness .
" the concept for this album was to give people courage and to spur them to think critically about their lives and their surroundings , " the hip-hop artist explained .
born samuel sorge , the son of a sudanese father and german mother , deluxe grew up in hamburg , where he was exposed at an early age to social exclusion and ghettoization .
early in his life he was forced to develop strategies to overcome such barriers .
growing up in a mostly white area , deluxe was keenly aware of his difference from his friends and neighbors .
he consequently surrounded himself with other black german friends , hoping to discover his african roots .
in school he also had many turkish and croatian friends and he later went to the united states .

" you are all part of what is an historic moment for us , " she added . fritz schramma , the former mayor of cologne , who is from chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said that the architecture of the mosque was " a symbol of a budding flower , " inviting people in .
the futuristic design is said to include a large dome and two 55-meter minarets .
the construction of the mosque , which is expected to be completed in two years ' time , is set to begin after a long and acrimonious dispute between ditib and non-muslim residents of the city which is home to the cologne cathedral , one of the most renowned cathedrals in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing prokoeln group held a demonstration against the mosque opponents of the mosque say it will spoil cologne 's skyline , by diverting attention from the gothic cathedral .
right-wing extremists have been particularly vocal in their opposition to the construction of the mosque and staged a small protest on saturday .
the heated debate leading up to the ceremony echoes the tensions that emerged in berlin where a mosque was constructed in recent years .
some analysts say it points to the intensifying conflict between a growing muslim community in the country and across western europe .
in the end , ditib struck a compromise , agreeing not to broadcast the call to prayer in order to avoid friction with the non-muslim residents of the neighborhood .
at the ceremony , thomas kufen , integration commissioner of the state of north rhine-westphalia , described the islamic house of worship as a sign that muslims " had arrived " in the german society .
" this mosque will be a piece of jewelry , " he added .
" it has been a long road , " kufen said , referring to the difficult and prolonged discussions over the construction of the mosque .
" it gave rise to hostility and hurt . "
however , he said the fact that the foundation stone had been laid was a sign that xenophobia stands no chance. rb / dpa / epd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some analysts say it points to the intensifying conflict between a growing muslim community in the country and across western europe .
in the end , ditib struck a compromise , agreeing not to broadcast the call to prayer in order to avoid friction with the non-muslim residents of the neighborhood .
at the ceremony , thomas kufen , integration commissioner of the state of north rhine-westphalia , described the islamic house of worship as a sign that muslims " had arrived " in the german society .
" this mosque will be a piece of jewelry , " he added .
" it has been a long road , " kufen said , referring to the difficult and prolonged discussions over the construction of the mosque .
" it gave rise to hostility and hurt . "
however , he said the fact that the foundation stone had been laid was a sign that xenophobia stands no chance. rb / dpa / epd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bayern grabbed the lead on 31 minutes when defender holger badstuber sent a free kick into the box and van buyten was at hand to tap in after schalke 's kevin kuranyi accidentally headed the ball into the belgian 's path .
the balance was restored just before the break when lukas schmitz floated a free kick into the box and matip , until recently in schalke 's under-19 team , rose above bayern defenders to head home .
the result leaves munich stranded in eighth place with 20 points while schalke are fourth with 22 points .
bayer leverkusen leads the way with 26 points from a 4-0 demolition of eintracht frankfurt on friday .
werder bremen and sv hamburg are on 22 like schalke , ahead of their sunday games against borussia dortmund and in hannover 96 , respectively .
in saturday 's other fixtures , vfl wolfsburg won 2-1 at tsg hoffenheim as second-half goals from zvejzdan misimovic and grafite reversed hoffenheim 's lead from vedad ibisevic .
wolfsburg have 21 points and so have mainz 05 , 1-0 winners over lowly nuremberg from elkin soto 's 38th-minute strike .
borussia moenchengladbach and vfb stuttgart produced no goals , while vfl bochum lost 2-1 at home against sc freiburg .

" we ca n't have our soldiers hampered by legal doubts , especially when they are forced to make decisions under extreme time pressure , " guttenberg said .
guttenberg 's comments came after he voiced his support of a controversial airstrike ordered by a german commander in afghanistan in september .
guttenberg backed the decision of colonel georg klein to launch an air attack on two fuel tankers that had been hijacked by taliban militants near a german military base in northern afghanistan .

the defense expert of the green party , omri nouripour , found guttenberg 's justification of the airstrike peculiar , especially considering that guttenberg admitted that mistakes were made .
" this issue should n't be treated as a mere bagatelle . that would make it look like the defense ministry pays no attention to the rules , " nouripour said .
bigger issue at hand the debates caused by the september airstrike have brought up the more large-scale question of whether germany is technically at war in afghanistan .
a court in the eastern state of saxony has passed the klein case on to germany 's top federal prosecution office , which will examine whether it is a matter for international law or german law .
for this to be determined the federal prosecutor must establish whether germany 's participation in the nato isaf mission constitutes an " armed conflict . "
the head of the german military alliance , colonel ulrich kirsch , told the mass-circulated bild zeitung that the german operation in afghanistan constituted war .

former bundeswehr general harald kujat went further , warning of " catastrophic consequences " should germany pursue its investigations of the airstrike and impose penalties on colonel klein .
" every soldier and officer would think twice about assuming any responsibility under such conditions , " he told the daily frankfurter rundschau .
under german constitution , it is illegal for the country to enter a war , except for purposes of defense .
over sixty years following the nazi era , germans remain highly skeptical of military operations .

" we ca n't have our soldiers hampered by legal doubts , especially when they are forced to make decisions under extreme time pressure , " guttenberg said .
guttenberg 's comments came after he voiced his support of a controversial airstrike ordered by a german commander in afghanistan in september .

" if -lsb- guttenberg -rsb- believes that dropping bombs in afghanistan on large masses of people is alright , then the social democrats can no longer go along with him . "
the defense expert of the green party , omri nouripour , found guttenberg 's justification of the airstrike peculiar , especially considering that guttenberg admitted that mistakes were made .

bigger issue at hand the debates caused by the september airstrike have brought up the more large-scale question of whether germany is technically at war in afghanistan .
a court in the eastern state of saxony has passed the klein case on to germany 's top federal prosecution office , which will examine whether it is a matter for international law or german law .
for this to be determined the federal prosecutor must establish whether germany 's participation in the nato isaf mission constitutes an " armed conflict . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 07.11.2009 new ideas abound at the inventor 's fair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kitty clap represented just one of almost 800 inventions on display in nuremberg international inventors meet in nuremberg to display their prototypes from november 5 to 8 .
young students show promising potential , but one aisle remains empty : the iranian group did n't get visas . every year hundreds of inventors from all over the world come to nuremberg 's inventor 's fair iena to show off their latest ideas .
about 800 inventions from 33 countries are on display this year , presenting a wide range of inventions from improved household appliances to high-tech equipment .
according to iena , the number of presented inventions exceeds previous presentations in iena 's 60-year history .
many individual inventors from germany take part in signo -lrb- protection of ideas for commercial usage -rrb- inventor 's clubs .
38 of these locally organized clubs present about 190 ideas on this year 's fair .
young inventors in focus especially young inventors draw attention to their ideas .
many young students are part of inventor 's clubs at their school and professionally introduce their products to trade experts . eleven-year old raphael krauthann from signo invention club " querdenker " -lrb- " lateral thinker " -rrb- presents his idea on how to reach for crutches on the floor with a magnetic device .
he developed his idea when one of his friends was struggling with crutches because they kept falling on the floor .
" it was really annoying , so i said i 'm going to invent something , " explained raphael krauthann .
other kids from the " querdenker " club in ingolstadt also had ideas with great potential .
andreas finkenzeller 's device prevents burning by accident from an electric iron .
the 13-year-old invented a system that stops the electricity flow in an iron if it has not been moved in a certain time period .
and michael stamp , 14 , who had to visit the hospital because fireworks exploded in his hand developed a device that lids the explosive charge in a safe distance by stepping on a handle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : displayed inventions ranged from household appliances to high-tech equipment 20-year-old florian nuber was facing a different kind of problem .
his cat brought dead mice inside his parents ' house , so he grabbed two of his apprenticeship colleges at wodego to find a solution .
florian nuber , christoph seger and sebastian soderer then invented the kitty clap which uses sensors to check the cat 's outlines .
it will only allow the cat to come in if it is not carrying a mouse .
if the cat is transporting a mouse , its figure would be different . antibacterial solutions in times of swine flu and other potential infections , inventions such as spanish inventor juan edilbato rodriguez morales ' automatic hygienic mat come in handy .
first the rotating brush moistened with water and disinfectant cleans the shoe , then the dryer eliminates the remaining water .
this could be used in hospitals , at airports or other places where a lot of people gather to prevent germ spreading .
an antibacterial door handle and antibacterial pens also reduce the chance of infection with germs .
a lot of infections in hospitals are caused by door handles because everyone touches them , said bruno gruber , a professional inventor of 33 years experience .
altogether he has registered 400 patents so far .
the most difficult part , he said , is to find someone who wants to produce and sell a product which starts off as a prototype .
" inventing is easy , marketing is my biggest problem , " said gruber .
problems with patents but inventors are also facing problems with patents .
registering patents can take years , claims gruber .
" it should be accelerated , because it is damaging for the industry .
especially in tough times it is important that new ideas get introduced to the market quickly , but the patent office is understaffed . "
approximately 700 patent examiners are working for the german patent office .
gruber said they need to double the workforce .
the german patent office is currently searching for new patent examiners .
bernd antonius from the german patent office admits they are a little behind with patent applications .
another problem for inventors is the rising annual fee to keep the patent .
if inventors do n't find a company right away , they choose to secure the patent until they can find someone who is willing to produce the product .
otherwise their invention could be used by anyone for free .
registering a patent itself is not so expensive , explained gruber , but needing a specialized patent lawyer for complicated matters is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : space reserved for iranian inventors remained empty no visa for iranians iena is meant to be an exchange for international inventors , but this year one aisle remains almost completely empty .
the president of " the first institute of researchers and inventors in iran , " dr. alireza rastegar , said he did n't get visa appointments for a group of 45 young inventors at the german embassy in tehran even though he applied in time .
" we have been coming to iena for the past five years , and we never had a problem , " said rastegar .
" i am very very angry .
the iranian booths are empty .
this is a very bad position for us and this exhibition . "
rastegar booked 72 square meters -lrb- 775 square feet -rrb- of the fair for young iranian inventors .
he himself could travel to germany because he holds a swiss visa ; the few students who are at the fair got visas through italy or a family invitation from germany , he said .
that 's why babak khodaparast could present his emergency cooling system that can be used to transport a human organ in a cold device .
kambiz shirzadian , who has lived in germany for 30 years , came to represent his nephew 's booth because he did n't get a visa as well .
according to shirzadian , when he asked the german embassy in tehran about the visa application , he was told such an application did n't exist .
lydia zetl , project manager of iena , is surprised that the iranian group did n't get their visa appointments .
" for me it was obvious that they would get their visas , because they are exhibiting for several years now and it has always worked in the past . "
she said she was told that the iranian group was too late in order to get an appointment .
rastegar said he is going to discuss the issue with the iranian ambassador in berlin on monday .
for shirzadian the worst part is the disappointment the young people must feel who were eager to present their ideas and to meet international researchers .

young students show promising potential , but one aisle remains empty : the iranian group did n't get visas . every year hundreds of inventors from all over the world come to nuremberg 's inventor 's fair iena to show off their latest ideas .
about 800 inventions from 33 countries are on display this year , presenting a wide range of inventions from improved household appliances to high-tech equipment .
according to iena , the number of presented inventions exceeds previous presentations in iena 's 60-year history .
many individual inventors from germany take part in signo -lrb- protection of ideas for commercial usage -rrb- inventor 's clubs .
38 of these locally organized clubs present about 190 ideas on this year 's fair .
young inventors in focus especially young inventors draw attention to their ideas .
many young students are part of inventor 's clubs at their school and professionally introduce their products to trade experts . eleven-year old raphael krauthann from signo invention club " querdenker " -lrb- " lateral thinker " -rrb- presents his idea on how to reach for crutches on the floor with a magnetic device .
he developed his idea when one of his friends was struggling with crutches because they kept falling on the floor .
" it was really annoying , so i said i 'm going to invent something , " explained raphael krauthann .
other kids from the " querdenker " club in ingolstadt also had ideas with great potential .
andreas finkenzeller 's device prevents burning by accident from an electric iron .
the 13-year-old invented a system that stops the electricity flow in an iron if it has not been moved in a certain time period .
and michael stamp , 14 , who had to visit the hospital because fireworks exploded in his hand developed a device that lids the explosive charge in a safe distance by stepping on a handle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : displayed inventions ranged from household appliances to high-tech equipment 20-year-old florian nuber was facing a different kind of problem .
his cat brought dead mice inside his parents ' house , so he grabbed two of his apprenticeship colleges at wodego to find a solution .
florian nuber , christoph seger and sebastian soderer then invented the kitty clap which uses sensors to check the cat 's outlines .
it will only allow the cat to come in if it is not carrying a mouse .
if the cat is transporting a mouse , its figure would be different . antibacterial solutions in times of swine flu and other potential infections , inventions such as spanish inventor juan edilbato rodriguez morales ' automatic hygienic mat come in handy .
first the rotating brush moistened with water and disinfectant cleans the shoe , then the dryer eliminates the remaining water .
this could be used in hospitals , at airports or other places where a lot of people gather to prevent germ spreading .
an antibacterial door handle and antibacterial pens also reduce the chance of infection with germs .
a lot of infections in hospitals are caused by door handles because everyone touches them , said bruno gruber , a professional inventor of 33 years experience .
altogether he has registered 400 patents so far .
the most difficult part , he said , is to find someone who wants to produce and sell a product which starts off as a prototype .
" inventing is easy , marketing is my biggest problem , " said gruber .
problems with patents but inventors are also facing problems with patents .
registering patents can take years , claims gruber .
" it should be accelerated , because it is damaging for the industry .
especially in tough times it is important that new ideas get introduced to the market quickly , but the patent office is understaffed . "
approximately 700 patent examiners are working for the german patent office .
gruber said they need to double the workforce .
the german patent office is currently searching for new patent examiners .
bernd antonius from the german patent office admits they are a little behind with patent applications .
another problem for inventors is the rising annual fee to keep the patent .
if inventors do n't find a company right away , they choose to secure the patent until they can find someone who is willing to produce the product .
otherwise their invention could be used by anyone for free .
registering a patent itself is not so expensive , explained gruber , but needing a specialized patent lawyer for complicated matters is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : space reserved for iranian inventors remained empty no visa for iranians iena is meant to be an exchange for international inventors , but this year one aisle remains almost completely empty .
the president of " the first institute of researchers and inventors in iran , " dr. alireza rastegar , said he did n't get visa appointments for a group of 45 young inventors at the german embassy in tehran even though he applied in time .
" we have been coming to iena for the past five years , and we never had a problem , " said rastegar .
" i am very very angry .
the iranian booths are empty .
this is a very bad position for us and this exhibition . "
rastegar booked 72 square meters -lrb- 775 square feet -rrb- of the fair for young iranian inventors .
he himself could travel to germany because he holds a swiss visa ; the few students who are at the fair got visas through italy or a family invitation from germany , he said .
that 's why babak khodaparast could present his emergency cooling system that can be used to transport a human organ in a cold device .
kambiz shirzadian , who has lived in germany for 30 years , came to represent his nephew 's booth because he did n't get a visa as well .
according to shirzadian , when he asked the german embassy in tehran about the visa application , he was told such an application did n't exist .
lydia zetl , project manager of iena , is surprised that the iranian group did n't get their visa appointments .
" for me it was obvious that they would get their visas , because they are exhibiting for several years now and it has always worked in the past . "
she said she was told that the iranian group was too late in order to get an appointment .
rastegar said he is going to discuss the issue with the iranian ambassador in berlin on monday .
for shirzadian the worst part is the disappointment the young people must feel who were eager to present their ideas and to meet international researchers .

" you are all part of what is an historic moment for us , " she added . fritz schramma , the former mayor of cologne , who is from chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said that the architecture of the mosque was " a symbol of a budding flower , " inviting people in .
the futuristic design is said to include a large dome and two 55-meter minarets .
the construction of the mosque , which is expected to be completed in two years ' time , is set to begin after a long and acrimonious dispute between ditib and non-muslim residents of the city which is home to the cologne cathedral , one of the most renowned cathedrals in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing prokoeln group held a demonstration against the mosque opponents of the mosque say it will spoil cologne 's skyline , by diverting attention from the gothic cathedral .
right-wing extremists have been particularly vocal in their opposition to the construction of the mosque and staged a small protest on saturday .
the heated debate leading up to the ceremony echoes the tensions that emerged in berlin where a mosque was constructed in recent years .
some analysts say it points to the intensifying conflict between a growing muslim community in the country and across western europe .
in the end , ditib struck a compromise , agreeing not to broadcast the call to prayer in order to avoid friction with the non-muslim residents of the neighborhood .
at the ceremony , thomas kufen , integration commissioner of the state of north rhine-westphalia , described the islamic house of worship as a sign that muslims " had arrived " in the german society .
" this mosque will be a piece of jewelry , " he added .
" it has been a long road , " kufen said , referring to the difficult and prolonged discussions over the construction of the mosque .
" it gave rise to hostility and hurt . "
however , he said the fact that the foundation stone had been laid was a sign that xenophobia stands no chance. rb / dpa / epd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : crunchtime for afghanistan troop increase for afghanistan must be linked to reforms , says expert nato agrees on the need for new strategy in afghanistan opinion : how the west has yet again failed afghanistan can tajikistan and ' aiming low ' be a model for afghanistan ? bundeswehr -pipe- 07.11.2009 debate on germany 's status in afghanistan opens up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's afghanistan mission is widely unpopular in germany germany 's defense minister has called for clarification of germany 's status in afghanistan , after a contoversial airstrike ordered by a german commander raised the question of whether the country is at war . german defense minister , karl-theodor zu guttenberg , told the daily sueddeutsche zeitung that legal security must be established for all german bundeswehr soldiers - in particular those taking part in complicated missions like germany 's participation in the nato isaf mission in afghanistan .
" we ca n't have our soldiers hampered by legal doubts , especially when they are forced to make decisions under extreme time pressure , " guttenberg said .
guttenberg 's comments came after he voiced his support of a controversial airstrike ordered by a german commander in afghanistan in september .
guttenberg backed the decision of colonel georg klein to launch an air attack on two fuel tankers that had been hijacked by taliban militants near a german military base in northern afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's zu guttenberg backs the controversial airstrike according to a nato report , up to 142 people , including several civilians that had gathered around the tankers to siphon fuel after they had stalled , were killed in the strike .
guttenberg acknowledged that civilians were killed in the attack and also that " some procedural errors " were committed .
nonetheless , he put his full support behind colonel klein 's decision , calling it " militarily appropriate . "
criticism from opposition several german politicians have openly disagreed with guttenberg 's backing of the airstrike .
social democrat defense expert rainer arnold told the berlin daily tagesspiegel that guttenberg 's evaluation was " illegitimate and unreasonable . "
" if -lsb- guttenberg -rsb- believes that dropping bombs in afghanistan on large masses of people is alright , then the social democrats can no longer go along with him . "
the defense expert of the green party , omri nouripour , found guttenberg 's justification of the airstrike peculiar , especially considering that guttenberg admitted that mistakes were made .
" this issue should n't be treated as a mere bagatelle . that would make it look like the defense ministry pays no attention to the rules , " nouripour said .
bigger issue at hand the debates caused by the september airstrike have brought up the more large-scale question of whether germany is technically at war in afghanistan .
a court in the eastern state of saxony has passed the klein case on to germany 's top federal prosecution office , which will examine whether it is a matter for international law or german law .
for this to be determined the federal prosecutor must establish whether germany 's participation in the nato isaf mission constitutes an " armed conflict . "
the head of the german military alliance , colonel ulrich kirsch , told the mass-circulated bild zeitung that the german operation in afghanistan constituted war .
bildunterschrift : civilans and militants were among those killed in the airstrike , says nato " the justice ministry has stated explicitly what we are dealing with in afghanistan : a non-international armed conflict .
this is a war . "
former bundeswehr general harald kujat went further , warning of " catastrophic consequences " should germany pursue its investigations of the airstrike and impose penalties on colonel klein .
" every soldier and officer would think twice about assuming any responsibility under such conditions , " he told the daily frankfurter rundschau .
under german constitution , it is illegal for the country to enter a war , except for purposes of defense .
over sixty years following the nazi era , germans remain highly skeptical of military operations .
it was only a decade ago that german troops participated in their first foreign combat mission since the end of wwii .
opinion polls show a majority of germans oppose the engagement in afghanistan and want the over 4,000 troops there to come home. glb / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

through his organization crossover , deluxe hopes to bring young adults together to promote better understanding . samy deluxe is not only successful , having sold over one million albums , he also has a voice that resonates with young people , especially between the ages of 15 and 20 .
this hip-hop idol also has a talent for bringing politics and social engagement to the attention of an otherwise disinterested generation through his songs .
messages like " i have a chance to make something of myself ” and " there is a lot we can do to fight off boredom " permeate his lyrics .
deluxe was not always so socially-minded .
he began his career as a rapper surrounding himself with the usual luxurious cars and beautiful women .
at that time his rhymes generally concentrated on sex , drugs and his own magnificence .
since then , deluxe has successfully transformed himself into a hip-hop artist known for his contemplative lyrics .
today his music showcases his thoughts on things like national identity , the condition of the german social state and the importance of giving today 's youth better opportunities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crossover program has had a successful start on his new cd " dis wo ich herkomm " -lrb- this is where i come from -rrb- , samy deluxe croons to soft reggae beats : this is our germany this is your germany this is the land where we live this is the new germany … a change in tone deluxe is considered one of the most successful german rappers ever , and he is well aware of his influence on young adults .
the change of tone in his music reflects this awareness .
" the concept for this album was to give people courage and to spur them to think critically about their lives and their surroundings , " the hip-hop artist explained .
born samuel sorge , the son of a sudanese father and german mother , deluxe grew up in hamburg , where he was exposed at an early age to social exclusion and ghettoization .
early in his life he was forced to develop strategies to overcome such barriers .
growing up in a mostly white area , deluxe was keenly aware of his difference from his friends and neighbors .
he consequently surrounded himself with other black german friends , hoping to discover his african roots .
in school he also had many turkish and croatian friends and he later went to the united states .
" i 've come to know many cultures and i feel comfortable when i 'm in a group that 's different from me . "
deluxe also addresses the youth of the ' hartz iv generation ' -lrb- those dependent on the german welfare system -rrb- in his songs .
many of these young adults do not foresee a good future for themselves .
but deluxe feels that the way the german system is organized , with a large middle class , young adults really do have a chance to make something of themselves .
building teams to overcome barriers in order to share his experiences with others , samy deluxe founded the non-profit organization crossover , along with designer julia von dohnanyi and marvin willoughby , a former german national basketball player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making music is one of the crossover methods von dohnanyi lived in the united states for many years and understands how important communication is in breaking down barriers .
“ the more people you know and the more types of people you get to know , the easier it is in life .
if you close yourself off and only have a ' my way is the right way ' attitude , life will be tough , " she commented .
crossover has organized basketball and hip-hop workshops at several secondary schools in hamburg to bring together students of different social backgrounds .
the program teamed up young people from exclusive residential areas with those of socially disadvantaged backgrounds and challenged them to make their own rhymes and beats .
many of the workshops were advertized across germany and attracted youth from all over country , partially due to deluxe 's name .
one of the young adults who participated was 17-year-old tom ulris from aschaffenberg .
he was excited about the sense of community that developed out of teamwork .
" i found it fascinating to learn about the differences between young people from all over germany , " he said .
" some of us came from the east and some from the west , but after an hour , it felt like we were one team , ” tom commented .
integration is a challenge for both sides crossover places a lot of emphasis on integration , regardless of whether the young adults are rich or poor , from eastern or western germany , or they are from immigrant families .
von dohnanyi feels that it is very important for youth to believe in the process of integration .
to encourage this belief , she urges team work in which the same expectations are placed upon everyone .
only when each person does his or her share can the project be successful .
sophie niebergal also believes in the value of cultural diversity in germany .
this is why she decided to do a one-year internship with the crossover organization .
she wants to work with young adults to help them start breaking down the barriers that still divide them .
as his organization grows in size and popularity among young people , samy deluxe may start to believe that some of the lyrics of his songs are ringing true . … it 's about time that people start to wake up and begin to speak about something other than celebrities , football and the weather , like how we can improve the conditions for our youth and right now because this is our germany this is your germany … author : zoran arbutina / gmb editor : louisa schaefer / bk send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

born samuel sorge , the son of a sudanese father and german mother , deluxe grew up in hamburg , where he was exposed at an early age to social exclusion and ghettoization .
early in his life he was forced to develop strategies to overcome such barriers .
growing up in a mostly white area , deluxe was keenly aware of his difference from his friends and neighbors .
he consequently surrounded himself with other black german friends , hoping to discover his african roots .
in school he also had many turkish and croatian friends and he later went to the united states .
" i 've come to know many cultures and i feel comfortable when i 'm in a group that 's different from me . "
deluxe also addresses the youth of the ' hartz iv generation ' -lrb- those dependent on the german welfare system -rrb- in his songs .
many of these young adults do not foresee a good future for themselves .
but deluxe feels that the way the german system is organized , with a large middle class , young adults really do have a chance to make something of themselves .
building teams to overcome barriers in order to share his experiences with others , samy deluxe founded the non-profit organization crossover , along with designer julia von dohnanyi and marvin willoughby , a former german national basketball player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making music is one of the crossover methods von dohnanyi lived in the united states for many years and understands how important communication is in breaking down barriers .
“ the more people you know and the more types of people you get to know , the easier it is in life .
if you close yourself off and only have a ' my way is the right way ' attitude , life will be tough , " she commented .
crossover has organized basketball and hip-hop workshops at several secondary schools in hamburg to bring together students of different social backgrounds .
the program teamed up young people from exclusive residential areas with those of socially disadvantaged backgrounds and challenged them to make their own rhymes and beats .
many of the workshops were advertized across germany and attracted youth from all over country , partially due to deluxe 's name .
one of the young adults who participated was 17-year-old tom ulris from aschaffenberg .
he was excited about the sense of community that developed out of teamwork .
" i found it fascinating to learn about the differences between young people from all over germany , " he said .
" some of us came from the east and some from the west , but after an hour , it felt like we were one team , ” tom commented .
integration is a challenge for both sides crossover places a lot of emphasis on integration , regardless of whether the young adults are rich or poor , from eastern or western germany , or they are from immigrant families .
von dohnanyi feels that it is very important for youth to believe in the process of integration .
to encourage this belief , she urges team work in which the same expectations are placed upon everyone .
only when each person does his or her share can the project be successful .
sophie niebergal also believes in the value of cultural diversity in germany .
this is why she decided to do a one-year internship with the crossover organization .
she wants to work with young adults to help them start breaking down the barriers that still divide them .
as his organization grows in size and popularity among young people , samy deluxe may start to believe that some of the lyrics of his songs are ringing true . … it 's about time that people start to wake up and begin to speak about something other than celebrities , football and the weather , like how we can improve the conditions for our youth and right now because this is our germany this is your germany … author : zoran arbutina / gmb editor : louisa schaefer / bk send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we ca n't have our soldiers hampered by legal doubts , especially when they are forced to make decisions under extreme time pressure , " guttenberg said .
guttenberg 's comments came after he voiced his support of a controversial airstrike ordered by a german commander in afghanistan in september .
guttenberg backed the decision of colonel georg klein to launch an air attack on two fuel tankers that had been hijacked by taliban militants near a german military base in northern afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's zu guttenberg backs the controversial airstrike according to a nato report , up to 142 people , including several civilians that had gathered around the tankers to siphon fuel after they had stalled , were killed in the strike .
guttenberg acknowledged that civilians were killed in the attack and also that " some procedural errors " were committed .
nonetheless , he put his full support behind colonel klein 's decision , calling it " militarily appropriate . "
criticism from opposition several german politicians have openly disagreed with guttenberg 's backing of the airstrike .
social democrat defense expert rainer arnold told the berlin daily tagesspiegel that guttenberg 's evaluation was " illegitimate and unreasonable . "
" if -lsb- guttenberg -rsb- believes that dropping bombs in afghanistan on large masses of people is alright , then the social democrats can no longer go along with him . "
the defense expert of the green party , omri nouripour , found guttenberg 's justification of the airstrike peculiar , especially considering that guttenberg admitted that mistakes were made .
" this issue should n't be treated as a mere bagatelle . that would make it look like the defense ministry pays no attention to the rules , " nouripour said .
bigger issue at hand the debates caused by the september airstrike have brought up the more large-scale question of whether germany is technically at war in afghanistan .
a court in the eastern state of saxony has passed the klein case on to germany 's top federal prosecution office , which will examine whether it is a matter for international law or german law .
for this to be determined the federal prosecutor must establish whether germany 's participation in the nato isaf mission constitutes an " armed conflict . "
the head of the german military alliance , colonel ulrich kirsch , told the mass-circulated bild zeitung that the german operation in afghanistan constituted war .
bildunterschrift : civilans and militants were among those killed in the airstrike , says nato " the justice ministry has stated explicitly what we are dealing with in afghanistan : a non-international armed conflict .
this is a war . "
former bundeswehr general harald kujat went further , warning of " catastrophic consequences " should germany pursue its investigations of the airstrike and impose penalties on colonel klein .
" every soldier and officer would think twice about assuming any responsibility under such conditions , " he told the daily frankfurter rundschau .
under german constitution , it is illegal for the country to enter a war , except for purposes of defense .
over sixty years following the nazi era , germans remain highly skeptical of military operations .
it was only a decade ago that german troops participated in their first foreign combat mission since the end of wwii .
opinion polls show a majority of germans oppose the engagement in afghanistan and want the over 4,000 troops there to come home. glb / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.11.2009 moldova suffering from wave of migration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elections in june left the country in turmoil with tough challenges ahead the new western-leaning government in moldova faces many challenges in the southern european country .
increasing parts of the population are leaving in search of a better life .
but many return disillusioned . in soviet times , moldova was thriving .
today , it is one of the poorest countries in europe .
the town of costesti , home to 12,000 people , is in an isolated and bleak region some 35 kilometers south of moldova 's capital chisinau .
the roads are unsurfaced , the homes deserted or run down .
in the local secondary school , 25 soon-to-be graduates are following instructions .
when the teacher asks them who wants to go abroad after they finish school , almost all hands shoot up in the air .
" i want to study and then work abroad if it 's possible , " said 17-year-old docina .
" and i want to travel to other countries , to see how people live there , and learn other languages . "
she said she does n't see any occupational future in her country .
" no , because moldova is a poor country , " docina said .
her classmate christina said she dreams of a career as a designer .
no occupational future these girls do n't know where they 're going to go - maybe to russia , spain , italy or even the united states .
they do n't really know what the work conditions are in those countries .
but they are certain that it must be better than in moldova .
after all , one of their parents is also working abroad .
in most cases , it 's the mothers who earn their money elsewhere .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in costesti face an uncertain future " we telephone regularly and once a year , my mother comes to visit , " many young people report .
they do n't see any future for themselves in their home country .
it 's understandable , considering the current monthly wage of some 140 euros -lrb- $ 206 -rrb- .
also , they all agree that moldova is simply too poor .
the girls said they believe they can only bring forward their country from far away when they emigrate .
these young women are right in their assumption .
migration has developed into a central economic factor for moldova .
last year , emigrants from moldova transferred $ 2 billion to their home country , according to the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- .
this was more than the entire national budget , iom said .
danger of human trafficking one quarter of the country 's four million people has already left moldova .
many children grow up with only one parent .
often , the fathers stay behind , are overtaxed with the situation and drink away their sorrows .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human trafficking is a major problem in moldova single mothers in search of prosperity are particularly easy prey for human traffickers .
though the numbers of victims in the past three years has fallen from 507 to 151 , the problem still exists , said elena mereacre .
the former librarian founded the organization " compasiune " - or " compassion " - in costesti eight years ago .
" we have 12 children here who with their mothers fell into the hands of human traffickers in poland , russia and ukraine , " mereacre said .
" they had to beg on the streets from morning till night and were n't allowed to keep any of the money . "
" when they return here , the children are often emotionally and physically shattered , " mereacre said .
sometimes , women emigrate and then return to their native villages with one or two children - the undesired " by product " of years of prostitution .
the main countries of destination are turkey , russia and saudi arabia .
" they do n't dare to tell their relatives about it because they are ashamed , " mereacre said .
" many relationships end in divorce .
the husbands are mainly concerned with saving face .
they do n't want the entire village to find out that their own family fell victim to human traffickers . "
mereacre sees to these children .
her organization , funded by donations from abroad , offers sewing and cooking courses for the women .
she said she tries on a small scale to give them a prospect for the future and above all , enable them to live a life with dignity .
empathy for human traffickers whether there are in fact less victims of human trafficking is debatable , said martin wintersberger from the eu border assistance mission .
he said he could not rule out a certain glut in this sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gorceag wants to help women find the strength to move forward experts report however that the traffickers themselves have also changed their technique .
though the victims live and work in difficult conditions abroad , they often have more rights than they used to .
they are allowed to send money home and telephone with their relatives .
sometimes , the human trafficker mutates for his victims into an almost nice guy , said lidia gorceag , a psychologist in a counseling center for former sex-trafficking victims .
" when a woman who comes from complete poverty suddenly lives in a nice hotel , always has a full refrigerator , hot water and nice bedding , that can alter their view for reality , " gorceag said .
in a recent case she treated , she needed two months of convincing to get a woman to see the truth .
but in order to keep women from getting into such a situation in the first place , moldova has to first fight poverty .
this is one of the central challenges for the country 's western-leaning government elected earlier this year .

bayern grabbed the lead on 31 minutes when defender holger badstuber sent a free kick into the box and van buyten was at hand to tap in after schalke 's kevin kuranyi accidentally headed the ball into the belgian 's path .
the balance was restored just before the break when lukas schmitz floated a free kick into the box and matip , until recently in schalke 's under-19 team , rose above bayern defenders to head home .
the result leaves munich stranded in eighth place with 20 points while schalke are fourth with 22 points .
bayer leverkusen leads the way with 26 points from a 4-0 demolition of eintracht frankfurt on friday .
werder bremen and sv hamburg are on 22 like schalke , ahead of their sunday games against borussia dortmund and in hannover 96 , respectively .

" you are all part of what is an historic moment for us , " she added . fritz schramma , the former mayor of cologne , who is from chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said that the architecture of the mosque was " a symbol of a budding flower , " inviting people in .
the futuristic design is said to include a large dome and two 55-meter minarets .
the construction of the mosque , which is expected to be completed in two years ' time , is set to begin after a long and acrimonious dispute between ditib and non-muslim residents of the city which is home to the cologne cathedral , one of the most renowned cathedrals in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing prokoeln group held a demonstration against the mosque opponents of the mosque say it will spoil cologne 's skyline , by diverting attention from the gothic cathedral .
right-wing extremists have been particularly vocal in their opposition to the construction of the mosque and staged a small protest on saturday .
the heated debate leading up to the ceremony echoes the tensions that emerged in berlin where a mosque was constructed in recent years .
some analysts say it points to the intensifying conflict between a growing muslim community in the country and across western europe .
in the end , ditib struck a compromise , agreeing not to broadcast the call to prayer in order to avoid friction with the non-muslim residents of the neighborhood .
at the ceremony , thomas kufen , integration commissioner of the state of north rhine-westphalia , described the islamic house of worship as a sign that muslims " had arrived " in the german society .
" this mosque will be a piece of jewelry , " he added .
" it has been a long road , " kufen said , referring to the difficult and prolonged discussions over the construction of the mosque .
" it gave rise to hostility and hurt . "
however , he said the fact that the foundation stone had been laid was a sign that xenophobia stands no chance. rb / dpa / epd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" you are all part of what is an historic moment for us , " she added . fritz schramma , the former mayor of cologne , who is from chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said that the architecture of the mosque was " a symbol of a budding flower , " inviting people in .
the futuristic design is said to include a large dome and two 55-meter minarets .
the construction of the mosque , which is expected to be completed in two years ' time , is set to begin after a long and acrimonious dispute between ditib and non-muslim residents of the city which is home to the cologne cathedral , one of the most renowned cathedrals in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing prokoeln group held a demonstration against the mosque opponents of the mosque say it will spoil cologne 's skyline , by diverting attention from the gothic cathedral .
right-wing extremists have been particularly vocal in their opposition to the construction of the mosque and staged a small protest on saturday .
the heated debate leading up to the ceremony echoes the tensions that emerged in berlin where a mosque was constructed in recent years .
some analysts say it points to the intensifying conflict between a growing muslim community in the country and across western europe .
in the end , ditib struck a compromise , agreeing not to broadcast the call to prayer in order to avoid friction with the non-muslim residents of the neighborhood .
at the ceremony , thomas kufen , integration commissioner of the state of north rhine-westphalia , described the islamic house of worship as a sign that muslims " had arrived " in the german society .
" this mosque will be a piece of jewelry , " he added .
" it has been a long road , " kufen said , referring to the difficult and prolonged discussions over the construction of the mosque .
" it gave rise to hostility and hurt . "
however , he said the fact that the foundation stone had been laid was a sign that xenophobia stands no chance. rb / dpa / epd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german sporting goods maker adidas is hoping that the next round of world cup mania , together with changes at its us reebok unit , will help pull sales out of the doldrums . adidas ceo herbert hainer said he is looking to 2010 , when the soccer world cup is to be played in south africa , for a boost in sales .
the company reported a third-quarter revenue drop of 7 percent from a year earlier , as sales in its sports-performance division struggled .
customers were keeping their purse-strings tied as a result of the financial crisis , the company said .
' cautiously optimistic ' despite crisis still , the world 's second-largest sporting goods manufacturer said it was " cautiously optimistic " about 2010 results , with hopes that world cup soccer fever , and a new approach to products at its us reebok unit , would boost sales as early as the current quarter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo hainer will focus on outdoors as well as soccer adidas is betting heavily on world cup , which starts june 11 , to improve its fortunes .
the company expects to outfit 12 of the teams competing for the cup , including germany and spain .
the company , based in herzogenaurach , germany , predicted its soccer products would lead to record sales of more than 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- in 2010 .
" this year , our industry and our group have faced unprecedented challenges , " said hainer said in his third-quarter report , which was released on wednesday .
" however , we have tackled the challenges head on .
we have successfully adapted to our difficult surroundings .
and our drive for operational excellence has meant we have strongly improved our financial position . "
plans to release ' explosion ' of new products as adidas continues to trim costs in the third quarter , hainer says he believes the worst is over for the company - despite ongoing difficult markets in the usa and china : " the mood swings between fear and optimism , " he told reporters in a press conference .
for 2009 , adidas predicted net gains of between 230 and 260 million euros , assuming fourth-quarter improvements tied to the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas unit reebok has been troublesome the company said it will release an " explosion " of new soccer-related products , and it has already begun with a soccer boot designed by former france captain zinedine zidane .
the predator x boot is the 10th version of a series that started in 1994 .
next week adidas will unveil the jersey to be worn by germany 's world cup team .
new focus for outdoor sector further plans for adidas include putting more focus on its outdoor-sporting-goods unit , hainer told online business news source mittelfranken.business.on.
" its true that we have n't focused on that unit in the last 10 years , " hainer said .
" now we are starting to make it a focal point . ... for example , we have renewed our partnership with -lrb- mountain climber -rrb- reinhold messsner , who wore adidas shoes in the himalayas 30 years ago . "
" i strongly believe that adidas will be the athletic outdoor brand of the future , " he added. jen / reuters / dpa editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on sunday , chinese premier wen jiabao reflected the close ties between the two pledging $ 10 billion in loans and announcing that tariffs on 95 percent of products from the least-developed african nations would be removed .
china 's foreign minister said on monday that these ties would ultimately help africans " improve their livelihood . "
" china is present in almost every african country , " said denis tull , a researcher with the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" and it 's not just a matter of buying raw materials nor is it part of a grand strategy . "
dominic johnson , africa expert with the berlin-based newspaper tageszeitung told deutsche welle that , " there seems to be a shift away on the chinese side from simply investing in natural resource extraction or buying oil toward investing in african infrastructure . "
a few days ago , china and nigeria signed a contract on building a railway line - a much-needed development as the railway infrastructure in africa 's most populous state dates back to colonial times .
the first ones to benefit from a better transport system in nigeria are the chinese themselves .
chinese companies are keen to develop the nigerian market , as johnson explained : " nigeria has a rapidly growing middle class .
and geographically it is located perfectly to supply the entire west african market .
so it 's a very interesting country for doing business . "
the chinese export mainly basic consumer goods to nigeria - clothes , shoes , but also electronics and motorcycles .
" chinese traders have been very good at settling down in african markets , bringing in lots of goods at low prices and really pushing themselves into the consumer market , " said johnson .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese companies are investing in african infrastructure projects africa has become a busy hub it does n't do any harm that china is an emerging country itself , said johnson , on the contrary : " in fact it strengthens the chinese , because on the political level they can say to the africans : we 're both against the mighty west .
some african leaders feel quite happy about that .
they look at china and say : forty years ago china was as poor as us , look at them now , should n't we be doing the same thing ? "
however , tull only partially agrees with that assessment : " frankly speaking this may contribute to some sympathy , but i do n't think this is substantially influencing the relationship .
i think both sides , the chinese and the african side are very pragmatic in their relationship and i would n't say that there is so much spinning or ideology involved , " he said .
after all the chinese are not the only new players on the african market , as tull explains : " there is an increased presence of other emerging countries like india , like brazil , etc .
this means there is certainly more competition .
africa has become a busy place , politically and economically . "
no room for human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa 's relationship with former colonial powers like germany is still strong it also means that european partners have to share their interests with others , but tull is convinced that africa 's relationship with its former colonial powers will remain a special one : " europe 's relationship with africa has a certain depth , an historical depth , and it certainly has a lot of intensity .
therefore i do n't think that the chinese influence will grow to an extent that there would be no europeans left in africa in 20 years time or so .
the europeans will always have a presence there and will always maintain these networks , contacts and long-standing connections . "
it remains to be seen however how much influence western countries will have in africa in the future .
china presents itself to african states as a partner and not as a donor .
it makes deals without political conditions , but not necessarily without political impact .
johnson says that china tends to support the government of the day , like in sudan : " china is one of the main arm suppliers for the government of sudan .
that has made a difference for the darfur war .
also china stopped the un security council from taking measures against sudan .
so there is certainly political influence there . "
guinea is another example , says tull , " where it has been reported that the government has signed a seven-billion-dollar deal with chinese companies at a time when the new military regime is under immense international pressure over the recent massacre of civilians in the capital of conakry .
that too illustrates that the chinese are really not paying attention at all to human rights . "

some people are facing waiting periods of weeks before vaccination will be available . only two weeks after beginning a national vaccination campaign against h1n1 , the intial skepticism over the vaccine has apparently vanished in germany .
the rise in cases and deaths within europe is thought to be the reason for an apparent swing in public opinion about the dangers posed by swine flu .
in september a study found that 62 percent of germans polled would not get vaccinated .
now , due to high demand and supply shortages there are waiting lists to receive the swine flu vaccine .
in some parts of germany , those wating for vaccinations are facing a delay of several weeks .
the rhineland-palatinate ministry of health reported part of the reason for the wait is that that less vaccine was produced than expected .
they cited production shortfalls with the manufacturer .
the baden-wuerttemberg ministry of social affairs complained of " a lack of management " that led to the shortage of vaccine .
can it be too perfect ?
according to the managing director of pharmacists for schleswig-holstein frank jaschkowski , the problem with the vaccine shortage lay with the stringent quality control standards .
" the quality standards for the vaccine are extremely high , " jaschkowski said .
" so it would n't be released unless it was absolutely flawless . "
all across the country , health officials are reporting a significant increase in those seeking swine flu vaccinations .
federal health minister philipp roesler told the german daily bild on saturday that he wanted to assess the swine flu situation at a health ministers ' conference on wednesday .
" along with my colleagues from the various states ' health ministries , i would like to compare notes about where potential weaknesses in the national vaccination supply scheme may exist , " roesler said. sjt / ap / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some people are facing waiting periods of weeks before vaccination will be available . only two weeks after beginning a national vaccination campaign against h1n1 , the intial skepticism over the vaccine has apparently vanished in germany .
the rise in cases and deaths within europe is thought to be the reason for an apparent swing in public opinion about the dangers posed by swine flu .
in september a study found that 62 percent of germans polled would not get vaccinated .
now , due to high demand and supply shortages there are waiting lists to receive the swine flu vaccine .
in some parts of germany , those wating for vaccinations are facing a delay of several weeks .
the rhineland-palatinate ministry of health reported part of the reason for the wait is that that less vaccine was produced than expected .
they cited production shortfalls with the manufacturer .
the baden-wuerttemberg ministry of social affairs complained of " a lack of management " that led to the shortage of vaccine .
can it be too perfect ?
according to the managing director of pharmacists for schleswig-holstein frank jaschkowski , the problem with the vaccine shortage lay with the stringent quality control standards .
" the quality standards for the vaccine are extremely high , " jaschkowski said .
" so it would n't be released unless it was absolutely flawless . "
all across the country , health officials are reporting a significant increase in those seeking swine flu vaccinations .
federal health minister philipp roesler told the german daily bild on saturday that he wanted to assess the swine flu situation at a health ministers ' conference on wednesday .
" along with my colleagues from the various states ' health ministries , i would like to compare notes about where potential weaknesses in the national vaccination supply scheme may exist , " roesler said. sjt / ap / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bayern grabbed the lead on 31 minutes when defender holger badstuber sent a free kick into the box and van buyten was at hand to tap in after schalke 's kevin kuranyi accidentally headed the ball into the belgian 's path .
the balance was restored just before the break when lukas schmitz floated a free kick into the box and matip , until recently in schalke 's under-19 team , rose above bayern defenders to head home .

short term worker programs and companies going bankrupt have put more of a drain on the budget than anticipated . the bundesagentur fuer arbeit -lrb- ba -rrb- , germany 's federal employment agency , is expected to be 16 billion euros -lrb- $ 23.7 billion -rrb- in the hole for the coming year , a spokeswoman confirmed on saturday after reporting by the news magazine spiegel .
for 2010 , the ba is expecting a total deficit of 18.8 billion euros , though they have 1.8 billion euros in reserve .
the balance will have to be underwritten by the federal government .
these figures came to light in a draft budget by the ba .
expenditures of nearly 54 billion euros outweighed the department 's income of 36.1 billion euros , resulting in the deficit .
calculations for next year show an expected cost of 22.5 billion euros in unemployment claims alone , 4.8 billion euros more than in 2009 , an increase of more than 21 percent year-over-year .
the expenses for short term workers , employees who are working fewer days per week as a cost-cutting measure , are likely to decline however .
the ba calculated a reduction in the coming year of 530,000 benefit recipients .
already in this year the reserves of the ba have soaked up shortages of almost 17 billion euros .
experts had long expected that , due to improving labor market trends , there would be a balance of 3 billion euros in the reserves .
however , short term worker programs and companies going bankrupt have put more of a drain on the budget than anticipated .

through his organization crossover , deluxe hopes to bring young adults together to promote better understanding . samy deluxe is not only successful , having sold over one million albums , he also has a voice that resonates with young people , especially between the ages of 15 and 20 .
this hip-hop idol also has a talent for bringing politics and social engagement to the attention of an otherwise disinterested generation through his songs .
messages like " i have a chance to make something of myself ” and " there is a lot we can do to fight off boredom " permeate his lyrics .
deluxe was not always so socially-minded .
he began his career as a rapper surrounding himself with the usual luxurious cars and beautiful women .
at that time his rhymes generally concentrated on sex , drugs and his own magnificence .
since then , deluxe has successfully transformed himself into a hip-hop artist known for his contemplative lyrics .
today his music showcases his thoughts on things like national identity , the condition of the german social state and the importance of giving today 's youth better opportunities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crossover program has had a successful start on his new cd " dis wo ich herkomm " -lrb- this is where i come from -rrb- , samy deluxe croons to soft reggae beats : this is our germany this is your germany this is the land where we live this is the new germany … a change in tone deluxe is considered one of the most successful german rappers ever , and he is well aware of his influence on young adults .
the change of tone in his music reflects this awareness .
" the concept for this album was to give people courage and to spur them to think critically about their lives and their surroundings , " the hip-hop artist explained .
born samuel sorge , the son of a sudanese father and german mother , deluxe grew up in hamburg , where he was exposed at an early age to social exclusion and ghettoization .
early in his life he was forced to develop strategies to overcome such barriers .
growing up in a mostly white area , deluxe was keenly aware of his difference from his friends and neighbors .
he consequently surrounded himself with other black german friends , hoping to discover his african roots .
in school he also had many turkish and croatian friends and he later went to the united states .
" i 've come to know many cultures and i feel comfortable when i 'm in a group that 's different from me . "
deluxe also addresses the youth of the ' hartz iv generation ' -lrb- those dependent on the german welfare system -rrb- in his songs .
many of these young adults do not foresee a good future for themselves .
but deluxe feels that the way the german system is organized , with a large middle class , young adults really do have a chance to make something of themselves .
building teams to overcome barriers in order to share his experiences with others , samy deluxe founded the non-profit organization crossover , along with designer julia von dohnanyi and marvin willoughby , a former german national basketball player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making music is one of the crossover methods von dohnanyi lived in the united states for many years and understands how important communication is in breaking down barriers .
“ the more people you know and the more types of people you get to know , the easier it is in life .
if you close yourself off and only have a ' my way is the right way ' attitude , life will be tough , " she commented .
crossover has organized basketball and hip-hop workshops at several secondary schools in hamburg to bring together students of different social backgrounds .
the program teamed up young people from exclusive residential areas with those of socially disadvantaged backgrounds and challenged them to make their own rhymes and beats .
many of the workshops were advertized across germany and attracted youth from all over country , partially due to deluxe 's name .
one of the young adults who participated was 17-year-old tom ulris from aschaffenberg .
he was excited about the sense of community that developed out of teamwork .
" i found it fascinating to learn about the differences between young people from all over germany , " he said .
" some of us came from the east and some from the west , but after an hour , it felt like we were one team , ” tom commented .
integration is a challenge for both sides crossover places a lot of emphasis on integration , regardless of whether the young adults are rich or poor , from eastern or western germany , or they are from immigrant families .
von dohnanyi feels that it is very important for youth to believe in the process of integration .
to encourage this belief , she urges team work in which the same expectations are placed upon everyone .
only when each person does his or her share can the project be successful .
sophie niebergal also believes in the value of cultural diversity in germany .
this is why she decided to do a one-year internship with the crossover organization .
she wants to work with young adults to help them start breaking down the barriers that still divide them .
as his organization grows in size and popularity among young people , samy deluxe may start to believe that some of the lyrics of his songs are ringing true . … it 's about time that people start to wake up and begin to speak about something other than celebrities , football and the weather , like how we can improve the conditions for our youth and right now because this is our germany this is your germany … author : zoran arbutina / gmb editor : louisa schaefer / bk send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

through his organization crossover , deluxe hopes to bring young adults together to promote better understanding . samy deluxe is not only successful , having sold over one million albums , he also has a voice that resonates with young people , especially between the ages of 15 and 20 .
this hip-hop idol also has a talent for bringing politics and social engagement to the attention of an otherwise disinterested generation through his songs .
messages like " i have a chance to make something of myself ” and " there is a lot we can do to fight off boredom " permeate his lyrics .
deluxe was not always so socially-minded .
he began his career as a rapper surrounding himself with the usual luxurious cars and beautiful women .
at that time his rhymes generally concentrated on sex , drugs and his own magnificence .
since then , deluxe has successfully transformed himself into a hip-hop artist known for his contemplative lyrics .
today his music showcases his thoughts on things like national identity , the condition of the german social state and the importance of giving today 's youth better opportunities .

the change of tone in his music reflects this awareness .
" the concept for this album was to give people courage and to spur them to think critically about their lives and their surroundings , " the hip-hop artist explained .
born samuel sorge , the son of a sudanese father and german mother , deluxe grew up in hamburg , where he was exposed at an early age to social exclusion and ghettoization .
early in his life he was forced to develop strategies to overcome such barriers .
growing up in a mostly white area , deluxe was keenly aware of his difference from his friends and neighbors .
he consequently surrounded himself with other black german friends , hoping to discover his african roots .
in school he also had many turkish and croatian friends and he later went to the united states .
" i 've come to know many cultures and i feel comfortable when i 'm in a group that 's different from me . "
deluxe also addresses the youth of the ' hartz iv generation ' -lrb- those dependent on the german welfare system -rrb- in his songs .
many of these young adults do not foresee a good future for themselves .
but deluxe feels that the way the german system is organized , with a large middle class , young adults really do have a chance to make something of themselves .
building teams to overcome barriers in order to share his experiences with others , samy deluxe founded the non-profit organization crossover , along with designer julia von dohnanyi and marvin willoughby , a former german national basketball player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making music is one of the crossover methods von dohnanyi lived in the united states for many years and understands how important communication is in breaking down barriers .
“ the more people you know and the more types of people you get to know , the easier it is in life .
if you close yourself off and only have a ' my way is the right way ' attitude , life will be tough , " she commented .
crossover has organized basketball and hip-hop workshops at several secondary schools in hamburg to bring together students of different social backgrounds .
the program teamed up young people from exclusive residential areas with those of socially disadvantaged backgrounds and challenged them to make their own rhymes and beats .
many of the workshops were advertized across germany and attracted youth from all over country , partially due to deluxe 's name .
one of the young adults who participated was 17-year-old tom ulris from aschaffenberg .
he was excited about the sense of community that developed out of teamwork .
" i found it fascinating to learn about the differences between young people from all over germany , " he said .
" some of us came from the east and some from the west , but after an hour , it felt like we were one team , ” tom commented .
integration is a challenge for both sides crossover places a lot of emphasis on integration , regardless of whether the young adults are rich or poor , from eastern or western germany , or they are from immigrant families .
von dohnanyi feels that it is very important for youth to believe in the process of integration .
to encourage this belief , she urges team work in which the same expectations are placed upon everyone .
only when each person does his or her share can the project be successful .

through his organization crossover , deluxe hopes to bring young adults together to promote better understanding . samy deluxe is not only successful , having sold over one million albums , he also has a voice that resonates with young people , especially between the ages of 15 and 20 .
this hip-hop idol also has a talent for bringing politics and social engagement to the attention of an otherwise disinterested generation through his songs .
messages like " i have a chance to make something of myself ” and " there is a lot we can do to fight off boredom " permeate his lyrics .
deluxe was not always so socially-minded .
he began his career as a rapper surrounding himself with the usual luxurious cars and beautiful women .
at that time his rhymes generally concentrated on sex , drugs and his own magnificence .
since then , deluxe has successfully transformed himself into a hip-hop artist known for his contemplative lyrics .
today his music showcases his thoughts on things like national identity , the condition of the german social state and the importance of giving today 's youth better opportunities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crossover program has had a successful start on his new cd " dis wo ich herkomm " -lrb- this is where i come from -rrb- , samy deluxe croons to soft reggae beats : this is our germany this is your germany this is the land where we live this is the new germany … a change in tone deluxe is considered one of the most successful german rappers ever , and he is well aware of his influence on young adults .
the change of tone in his music reflects this awareness .
" the concept for this album was to give people courage and to spur them to think critically about their lives and their surroundings , " the hip-hop artist explained .
born samuel sorge , the son of a sudanese father and german mother , deluxe grew up in hamburg , where he was exposed at an early age to social exclusion and ghettoization .
early in his life he was forced to develop strategies to overcome such barriers .
growing up in a mostly white area , deluxe was keenly aware of his difference from his friends and neighbors .
he consequently surrounded himself with other black german friends , hoping to discover his african roots .
in school he also had many turkish and croatian friends and he later went to the united states .
" i 've come to know many cultures and i feel comfortable when i 'm in a group that 's different from me . "
deluxe also addresses the youth of the ' hartz iv generation ' -lrb- those dependent on the german welfare system -rrb- in his songs .
many of these young adults do not foresee a good future for themselves .
but deluxe feels that the way the german system is organized , with a large middle class , young adults really do have a chance to make something of themselves .
building teams to overcome barriers in order to share his experiences with others , samy deluxe founded the non-profit organization crossover , along with designer julia von dohnanyi and marvin willoughby , a former german national basketball player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making music is one of the crossover methods von dohnanyi lived in the united states for many years and understands how important communication is in breaking down barriers .
“ the more people you know and the more types of people you get to know , the easier it is in life .
if you close yourself off and only have a ' my way is the right way ' attitude , life will be tough , " she commented .
crossover has organized basketball and hip-hop workshops at several secondary schools in hamburg to bring together students of different social backgrounds .
the program teamed up young people from exclusive residential areas with those of socially disadvantaged backgrounds and challenged them to make their own rhymes and beats .
many of the workshops were advertized across germany and attracted youth from all over country , partially due to deluxe 's name .

short term worker programs and companies going bankrupt have put more of a drain on the budget than anticipated . the bundesagentur fuer arbeit -lrb- ba -rrb- , germany 's federal employment agency , is expected to be 16 billion euros -lrb- $ 23.7 billion -rrb- in the hole for the coming year , a spokeswoman confirmed on saturday after reporting by the news magazine spiegel .
for 2010 , the ba is expecting a total deficit of 18.8 billion euros , though they have 1.8 billion euros in reserve .
the balance will have to be underwritten by the federal government .
these figures came to light in a draft budget by the ba .
expenditures of nearly 54 billion euros outweighed the department 's income of 36.1 billion euros , resulting in the deficit .
calculations for next year show an expected cost of 22.5 billion euros in unemployment claims alone , 4.8 billion euros more than in 2009 , an increase of more than 21 percent year-over-year .
the expenses for short term workers , employees who are working fewer days per week as a cost-cutting measure , are likely to decline however .
the ba calculated a reduction in the coming year of 530,000 benefit recipients .
already in this year the reserves of the ba have soaked up shortages of almost 17 billion euros .
experts had long expected that , due to improving labor market trends , there would be a balance of 3 billion euros in the reserves .
however , short term worker programs and companies going bankrupt have put more of a drain on the budget than anticipated .

" you are all part of what is an historic moment for us , " she added . fritz schramma , the former mayor of cologne , who is from chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said that the architecture of the mosque was " a symbol of a budding flower , " inviting people in .

" you are all part of what is an historic moment for us , " she added . fritz schramma , the former mayor of cologne , who is from chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said that the architecture of the mosque was " a symbol of a budding flower , " inviting people in .
the futuristic design is said to include a large dome and two 55-meter minarets .
the construction of the mosque , which is expected to be completed in two years ' time , is set to begin after a long and acrimonious dispute between ditib and non-muslim residents of the city which is home to the cologne cathedral , one of the most renowned cathedrals in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing prokoeln group held a demonstration against the mosque opponents of the mosque say it will spoil cologne 's skyline , by diverting attention from the gothic cathedral .
right-wing extremists have been particularly vocal in their opposition to the construction of the mosque and staged a small protest on saturday .
the heated debate leading up to the ceremony echoes the tensions that emerged in berlin where a mosque was constructed in recent years .
some analysts say it points to the intensifying conflict between a growing muslim community in the country and across western europe .
in the end , ditib struck a compromise , agreeing not to broadcast the call to prayer in order to avoid friction with the non-muslim residents of the neighborhood .
at the ceremony , thomas kufen , integration commissioner of the state of north rhine-westphalia , described the islamic house of worship as a sign that muslims " had arrived " in the german society .
" this mosque will be a piece of jewelry , " he added .
" it has been a long road , " kufen said , referring to the difficult and prolonged discussions over the construction of the mosque .
" it gave rise to hostility and hurt . "
however , he said the fact that the foundation stone had been laid was a sign that xenophobia stands no chance. rb / dpa / epd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we ca n't have our soldiers hampered by legal doubts , especially when they are forced to make decisions under extreme time pressure , " guttenberg said .
guttenberg 's comments came after he voiced his support of a controversial airstrike ordered by a german commander in afghanistan in september .
guttenberg backed the decision of colonel georg klein to launch an air attack on two fuel tankers that had been hijacked by taliban militants near a german military base in northern afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's zu guttenberg backs the controversial airstrike according to a nato report , up to 142 people , including several civilians that had gathered around the tankers to siphon fuel after they had stalled , were killed in the strike .
guttenberg acknowledged that civilians were killed in the attack and also that " some procedural errors " were committed .
nonetheless , he put his full support behind colonel klein 's decision , calling it " militarily appropriate . "
criticism from opposition several german politicians have openly disagreed with guttenberg 's backing of the airstrike .
social democrat defense expert rainer arnold told the berlin daily tagesspiegel that guttenberg 's evaluation was " illegitimate and unreasonable . "
" if -lsb- guttenberg -rsb- believes that dropping bombs in afghanistan on large masses of people is alright , then the social democrats can no longer go along with him . "
the defense expert of the green party , omri nouripour , found guttenberg 's justification of the airstrike peculiar , especially considering that guttenberg admitted that mistakes were made .
" this issue should n't be treated as a mere bagatelle . that would make it look like the defense ministry pays no attention to the rules , " nouripour said .
bigger issue at hand the debates caused by the september airstrike have brought up the more large-scale question of whether germany is technically at war in afghanistan .
a court in the eastern state of saxony has passed the klein case on to germany 's top federal prosecution office , which will examine whether it is a matter for international law or german law .
for this to be determined the federal prosecutor must establish whether germany 's participation in the nato isaf mission constitutes an " armed conflict . "
the head of the german military alliance , colonel ulrich kirsch , told the mass-circulated bild zeitung that the german operation in afghanistan constituted war .
bildunterschrift : civilans and militants were among those killed in the airstrike , says nato " the justice ministry has stated explicitly what we are dealing with in afghanistan : a non-international armed conflict .
this is a war . "
former bundeswehr general harald kujat went further , warning of " catastrophic consequences " should germany pursue its investigations of the airstrike and impose penalties on colonel klein .
" every soldier and officer would think twice about assuming any responsibility under such conditions , " he told the daily frankfurter rundschau .
under german constitution , it is illegal for the country to enter a war , except for purposes of defense .
over sixty years following the nazi era , germans remain highly skeptical of military operations .
it was only a decade ago that german troops participated in their first foreign combat mission since the end of wwii .

" we ca n't have our soldiers hampered by legal doubts , especially when they are forced to make decisions under extreme time pressure , " guttenberg said .
guttenberg 's comments came after he voiced his support of a controversial airstrike ordered by a german commander in afghanistan in september .
guttenberg backed the decision of colonel georg klein to launch an air attack on two fuel tankers that had been hijacked by taliban militants near a german military base in northern afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's zu guttenberg backs the controversial airstrike according to a nato report , up to 142 people , including several civilians that had gathered around the tankers to siphon fuel after they had stalled , were killed in the strike .
guttenberg acknowledged that civilians were killed in the attack and also that " some procedural errors " were committed .
nonetheless , he put his full support behind colonel klein 's decision , calling it " militarily appropriate . "
criticism from opposition several german politicians have openly disagreed with guttenberg 's backing of the airstrike .
social democrat defense expert rainer arnold told the berlin daily tagesspiegel that guttenberg 's evaluation was " illegitimate and unreasonable . "
" if -lsb- guttenberg -rsb- believes that dropping bombs in afghanistan on large masses of people is alright , then the social democrats can no longer go along with him . "
the defense expert of the green party , omri nouripour , found guttenberg 's justification of the airstrike peculiar , especially considering that guttenberg admitted that mistakes were made .
" this issue should n't be treated as a mere bagatelle . that would make it look like the defense ministry pays no attention to the rules , " nouripour said .
bigger issue at hand the debates caused by the september airstrike have brought up the more large-scale question of whether germany is technically at war in afghanistan .
a court in the eastern state of saxony has passed the klein case on to germany 's top federal prosecution office , which will examine whether it is a matter for international law or german law .
for this to be determined the federal prosecutor must establish whether germany 's participation in the nato isaf mission constitutes an " armed conflict . "
the head of the german military alliance , colonel ulrich kirsch , told the mass-circulated bild zeitung that the german operation in afghanistan constituted war .
bildunterschrift : civilans and militants were among those killed in the airstrike , says nato " the justice ministry has stated explicitly what we are dealing with in afghanistan : a non-international armed conflict .
this is a war . "
former bundeswehr general harald kujat went further , warning of " catastrophic consequences " should germany pursue its investigations of the airstrike and impose penalties on colonel klein .
" every soldier and officer would think twice about assuming any responsibility under such conditions , " he told the daily frankfurter rundschau .
under german constitution , it is illegal for the country to enter a war , except for purposes of defense .
over sixty years following the nazi era , germans remain highly skeptical of military operations .
it was only a decade ago that german troops participated in their first foreign combat mission since the end of wwii .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 07.11.2009 new ideas abound at the inventor 's fair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kitty clap represented just one of almost 800 inventions on display in nuremberg international inventors meet in nuremberg to display their prototypes from november 5 to 8 .
young students show promising potential , but one aisle remains empty : the iranian group did n't get visas . every year hundreds of inventors from all over the world come to nuremberg 's inventor 's fair iena to show off their latest ideas .
about 800 inventions from 33 countries are on display this year , presenting a wide range of inventions from improved household appliances to high-tech equipment .
according to iena , the number of presented inventions exceeds previous presentations in iena 's 60-year history .
many individual inventors from germany take part in signo -lrb- protection of ideas for commercial usage -rrb- inventor 's clubs .
38 of these locally organized clubs present about 190 ideas on this year 's fair .
young inventors in focus especially young inventors draw attention to their ideas .
many young students are part of inventor 's clubs at their school and professionally introduce their products to trade experts . eleven-year old raphael krauthann from signo invention club " querdenker " -lrb- " lateral thinker " -rrb- presents his idea on how to reach for crutches on the floor with a magnetic device .
he developed his idea when one of his friends was struggling with crutches because they kept falling on the floor .
" it was really annoying , so i said i 'm going to invent something , " explained raphael krauthann .
other kids from the " querdenker " club in ingolstadt also had ideas with great potential .
andreas finkenzeller 's device prevents burning by accident from an electric iron .
the 13-year-old invented a system that stops the electricity flow in an iron if it has not been moved in a certain time period .
and michael stamp , 14 , who had to visit the hospital because fireworks exploded in his hand developed a device that lids the explosive charge in a safe distance by stepping on a handle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : displayed inventions ranged from household appliances to high-tech equipment 20-year-old florian nuber was facing a different kind of problem .
his cat brought dead mice inside his parents ' house , so he grabbed two of his apprenticeship colleges at wodego to find a solution .
florian nuber , christoph seger and sebastian soderer then invented the kitty clap which uses sensors to check the cat 's outlines .
it will only allow the cat to come in if it is not carrying a mouse .
if the cat is transporting a mouse , its figure would be different . antibacterial solutions in times of swine flu and other potential infections , inventions such as spanish inventor juan edilbato rodriguez morales ' automatic hygienic mat come in handy .
first the rotating brush moistened with water and disinfectant cleans the shoe , then the dryer eliminates the remaining water .
this could be used in hospitals , at airports or other places where a lot of people gather to prevent germ spreading .
an antibacterial door handle and antibacterial pens also reduce the chance of infection with germs .
a lot of infections in hospitals are caused by door handles because everyone touches them , said bruno gruber , a professional inventor of 33 years experience .
altogether he has registered 400 patents so far .
the most difficult part , he said , is to find someone who wants to produce and sell a product which starts off as a prototype .
" inventing is easy , marketing is my biggest problem , " said gruber .
problems with patents but inventors are also facing problems with patents .
registering patents can take years , claims gruber .
" it should be accelerated , because it is damaging for the industry .
especially in tough times it is important that new ideas get introduced to the market quickly , but the patent office is understaffed . "
approximately 700 patent examiners are working for the german patent office .
gruber said they need to double the workforce .
the german patent office is currently searching for new patent examiners .
bernd antonius from the german patent office admits they are a little behind with patent applications .
another problem for inventors is the rising annual fee to keep the patent .
if inventors do n't find a company right away , they choose to secure the patent until they can find someone who is willing to produce the product .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : space reserved for iranian inventors remained empty no visa for iranians iena is meant to be an exchange for international inventors , but this year one aisle remains almost completely empty .
the president of " the first institute of researchers and inventors in iran , " dr. alireza rastegar , said he did n't get visa appointments for a group of 45 young inventors at the german embassy in tehran even though he applied in time .
" we have been coming to iena for the past five years , and we never had a problem , " said rastegar .
" i am very very angry .
the iranian booths are empty .
this is a very bad position for us and this exhibition . "
rastegar booked 72 square meters -lrb- 775 square feet -rrb- of the fair for young iranian inventors .
he himself could travel to germany because he holds a swiss visa ; the few students who are at the fair got visas through italy or a family invitation from germany , he said .
that 's why babak khodaparast could present his emergency cooling system that can be used to transport a human organ in a cold device .
kambiz shirzadian , who has lived in germany for 30 years , came to represent his nephew 's booth because he did n't get a visa as well .
according to shirzadian , when he asked the german embassy in tehran about the visa application , he was told such an application did n't exist .
lydia zetl , project manager of iena , is surprised that the iranian group did n't get their visa appointments .
" for me it was obvious that they would get their visas , because they are exhibiting for several years now and it has always worked in the past . "
she said she was told that the iranian group was too late in order to get an appointment .
rastegar said he is going to discuss the issue with the iranian ambassador in berlin on monday .
for shirzadian the worst part is the disappointment the young people must feel who were eager to present their ideas and to meet international researchers .

young students show promising potential , but one aisle remains empty : the iranian group did n't get visas . every year hundreds of inventors from all over the world come to nuremberg 's inventor 's fair iena to show off their latest ideas .
about 800 inventions from 33 countries are on display this year , presenting a wide range of inventions from improved household appliances to high-tech equipment .
according to iena , the number of presented inventions exceeds previous presentations in iena 's 60-year history .
many individual inventors from germany take part in signo -lrb- protection of ideas for commercial usage -rrb- inventor 's clubs .
38 of these locally organized clubs present about 190 ideas on this year 's fair .
young inventors in focus especially young inventors draw attention to their ideas .
many young students are part of inventor 's clubs at their school and professionally introduce their products to trade experts . eleven-year old raphael krauthann from signo invention club " querdenker " -lrb- " lateral thinker " -rrb- presents his idea on how to reach for crutches on the floor with a magnetic device .
he developed his idea when one of his friends was struggling with crutches because they kept falling on the floor .
" it was really annoying , so i said i 'm going to invent something , " explained raphael krauthann .
other kids from the " querdenker " club in ingolstadt also had ideas with great potential .
andreas finkenzeller 's device prevents burning by accident from an electric iron .
the 13-year-old invented a system that stops the electricity flow in an iron if it has not been moved in a certain time period .
and michael stamp , 14 , who had to visit the hospital because fireworks exploded in his hand developed a device that lids the explosive charge in a safe distance by stepping on a handle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : displayed inventions ranged from household appliances to high-tech equipment 20-year-old florian nuber was facing a different kind of problem .
his cat brought dead mice inside his parents ' house , so he grabbed two of his apprenticeship colleges at wodego to find a solution .
florian nuber , christoph seger and sebastian soderer then invented the kitty clap which uses sensors to check the cat 's outlines .
it will only allow the cat to come in if it is not carrying a mouse .
if the cat is transporting a mouse , its figure would be different . antibacterial solutions in times of swine flu and other potential infections , inventions such as spanish inventor juan edilbato rodriguez morales ' automatic hygienic mat come in handy .
first the rotating brush moistened with water and disinfectant cleans the shoe , then the dryer eliminates the remaining water .
this could be used in hospitals , at airports or other places where a lot of people gather to prevent germ spreading .
an antibacterial door handle and antibacterial pens also reduce the chance of infection with germs .
a lot of infections in hospitals are caused by door handles because everyone touches them , said bruno gruber , a professional inventor of 33 years experience .
altogether he has registered 400 patents so far .
the most difficult part , he said , is to find someone who wants to produce and sell a product which starts off as a prototype .
" inventing is easy , marketing is my biggest problem , " said gruber .
problems with patents but inventors are also facing problems with patents .
registering patents can take years , claims gruber .
" it should be accelerated , because it is damaging for the industry .
especially in tough times it is important that new ideas get introduced to the market quickly , but the patent office is understaffed . "
approximately 700 patent examiners are working for the german patent office .
gruber said they need to double the workforce .
the german patent office is currently searching for new patent examiners .
bernd antonius from the german patent office admits they are a little behind with patent applications .
another problem for inventors is the rising annual fee to keep the patent .
if inventors do n't find a company right away , they choose to secure the patent until they can find someone who is willing to produce the product .
otherwise their invention could be used by anyone for free .
registering a patent itself is not so expensive , explained gruber , but needing a specialized patent lawyer for complicated matters is .

young students show promising potential , but one aisle remains empty : the iranian group did n't get visas . every year hundreds of inventors from all over the world come to nuremberg 's inventor 's fair iena to show off their latest ideas .
about 800 inventions from 33 countries are on display this year , presenting a wide range of inventions from improved household appliances to high-tech equipment .
according to iena , the number of presented inventions exceeds previous presentations in iena 's 60-year history .
many individual inventors from germany take part in signo -lrb- protection of ideas for commercial usage -rrb- inventor 's clubs .
38 of these locally organized clubs present about 190 ideas on this year 's fair .
young inventors in focus especially young inventors draw attention to their ideas .
many young students are part of inventor 's clubs at their school and professionally introduce their products to trade experts . eleven-year old raphael krauthann from signo invention club " querdenker " -lrb- " lateral thinker " -rrb- presents his idea on how to reach for crutches on the floor with a magnetic device .
he developed his idea when one of his friends was struggling with crutches because they kept falling on the floor .
" it was really annoying , so i said i 'm going to invent something , " explained raphael krauthann .
other kids from the " querdenker " club in ingolstadt also had ideas with great potential .
andreas finkenzeller 's device prevents burning by accident from an electric iron .
the 13-year-old invented a system that stops the electricity flow in an iron if it has not been moved in a certain time period .
and michael stamp , 14 , who had to visit the hospital because fireworks exploded in his hand developed a device that lids the explosive charge in a safe distance by stepping on a handle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : displayed inventions ranged from household appliances to high-tech equipment 20-year-old florian nuber was facing a different kind of problem .
his cat brought dead mice inside his parents ' house , so he grabbed two of his apprenticeship colleges at wodego to find a solution .
florian nuber , christoph seger and sebastian soderer then invented the kitty clap which uses sensors to check the cat 's outlines .
it will only allow the cat to come in if it is not carrying a mouse .
if the cat is transporting a mouse , its figure would be different . antibacterial solutions in times of swine flu and other potential infections , inventions such as spanish inventor juan edilbato rodriguez morales ' automatic hygienic mat come in handy .
first the rotating brush moistened with water and disinfectant cleans the shoe , then the dryer eliminates the remaining water .
this could be used in hospitals , at airports or other places where a lot of people gather to prevent germ spreading .
an antibacterial door handle and antibacterial pens also reduce the chance of infection with germs .
a lot of infections in hospitals are caused by door handles because everyone touches them , said bruno gruber , a professional inventor of 33 years experience .
altogether he has registered 400 patents so far .
the most difficult part , he said , is to find someone who wants to produce and sell a product which starts off as a prototype .
" inventing is easy , marketing is my biggest problem , " said gruber .
problems with patents but inventors are also facing problems with patents .
registering patents can take years , claims gruber .
" it should be accelerated , because it is damaging for the industry .
especially in tough times it is important that new ideas get introduced to the market quickly , but the patent office is understaffed . "
approximately 700 patent examiners are working for the german patent office .
gruber said they need to double the workforce .
the german patent office is currently searching for new patent examiners .
bernd antonius from the german patent office admits they are a little behind with patent applications .
another problem for inventors is the rising annual fee to keep the patent .
if inventors do n't find a company right away , they choose to secure the patent until they can find someone who is willing to produce the product .
otherwise their invention could be used by anyone for free .
registering a patent itself is not so expensive , explained gruber , but needing a specialized patent lawyer for complicated matters is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : space reserved for iranian inventors remained empty no visa for iranians iena is meant to be an exchange for international inventors , but this year one aisle remains almost completely empty .
the president of " the first institute of researchers and inventors in iran , " dr. alireza rastegar , said he did n't get visa appointments for a group of 45 young inventors at the german embassy in tehran even though he applied in time .
" we have been coming to iena for the past five years , and we never had a problem , " said rastegar .
" i am very very angry .
the iranian booths are empty .
this is a very bad position for us and this exhibition . "
rastegar booked 72 square meters -lrb- 775 square feet -rrb- of the fair for young iranian inventors .
he himself could travel to germany because he holds a swiss visa ; the few students who are at the fair got visas through italy or a family invitation from germany , he said .
that 's why babak khodaparast could present his emergency cooling system that can be used to transport a human organ in a cold device .
kambiz shirzadian , who has lived in germany for 30 years , came to represent his nephew 's booth because he did n't get a visa as well .
according to shirzadian , when he asked the german embassy in tehran about the visa application , he was told such an application did n't exist .
lydia zetl , project manager of iena , is surprised that the iranian group did n't get their visa appointments .
" for me it was obvious that they would get their visas , because they are exhibiting for several years now and it has always worked in the past . "
she said she was told that the iranian group was too late in order to get an appointment .
rastegar said he is going to discuss the issue with the iranian ambassador in berlin on monday .
for shirzadian the worst part is the disappointment the young people must feel who were eager to present their ideas and to meet international researchers .

bayern grabbed the lead on 31 minutes when defender holger badstuber sent a free kick into the box and van buyten was at hand to tap in after schalke 's kevin kuranyi accidentally headed the ball into the belgian 's path .
the balance was restored just before the break when lukas schmitz floated a free kick into the box and matip , until recently in schalke 's under-19 team , rose above bayern defenders to head home .
the result leaves munich stranded in eighth place with 20 points while schalke are fourth with 22 points .
bayer leverkusen leads the way with 26 points from a 4-0 demolition of eintracht frankfurt on friday .

bayern grabbed the lead on 31 minutes when defender holger badstuber sent a free kick into the box and van buyten was at hand to tap in after schalke 's kevin kuranyi accidentally headed the ball into the belgian 's path .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 07.11.2009 germany worried over vaccine shortage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production shortfalls are causing long waits for the shot vaccine shortages point to a shift in public opinion toward the hazards of the swine flu in germany .
some people are facing waiting periods of weeks before vaccination will be available . only two weeks after beginning a national vaccination campaign against h1n1 , the intial skepticism over the vaccine has apparently vanished in germany .
the rise in cases and deaths within europe is thought to be the reason for an apparent swing in public opinion about the dangers posed by swine flu .
in september a study found that 62 percent of germans polled would not get vaccinated .
now , due to high demand and supply shortages there are waiting lists to receive the swine flu vaccine .
in some parts of germany , those wating for vaccinations are facing a delay of several weeks .
the rhineland-palatinate ministry of health reported part of the reason for the wait is that that less vaccine was produced than expected .
they cited production shortfalls with the manufacturer .
the baden-wuerttemberg ministry of social affairs complained of " a lack of management " that led to the shortage of vaccine .
can it be too perfect ?
according to the managing director of pharmacists for schleswig-holstein frank jaschkowski , the problem with the vaccine shortage lay with the stringent quality control standards .
" the quality standards for the vaccine are extremely high , " jaschkowski said .
" so it would n't be released unless it was absolutely flawless . "
all across the country , health officials are reporting a significant increase in those seeking swine flu vaccinations .
federal health minister philipp roesler told the german daily bild on saturday that he wanted to assess the swine flu situation at a health ministers ' conference on wednesday .
" along with my colleagues from the various states ' health ministries , i would like to compare notes about where potential weaknesses in the national vaccination supply scheme may exist , " roesler said. sjt / ap / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on sunday , chinese premier wen jiabao reflected the close ties between the two pledging $ 10 billion in loans and announcing that tariffs on 95 percent of products from the least-developed african nations would be removed .
china 's foreign minister said on monday that these ties would ultimately help africans " improve their livelihood . "
" china is present in almost every african country , " said denis tull , a researcher with the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" and it 's not just a matter of buying raw materials nor is it part of a grand strategy . "
dominic johnson , africa expert with the berlin-based newspaper tageszeitung told deutsche welle that , " there seems to be a shift away on the chinese side from simply investing in natural resource extraction or buying oil toward investing in african infrastructure . "
a few days ago , china and nigeria signed a contract on building a railway line - a much-needed development as the railway infrastructure in africa 's most populous state dates back to colonial times .
the first ones to benefit from a better transport system in nigeria are the chinese themselves .
chinese companies are keen to develop the nigerian market , as johnson explained : " nigeria has a rapidly growing middle class .
and geographically it is located perfectly to supply the entire west african market .
so it 's a very interesting country for doing business . "
the chinese export mainly basic consumer goods to nigeria - clothes , shoes , but also electronics and motorcycles .
" chinese traders have been very good at settling down in african markets , bringing in lots of goods at low prices and really pushing themselves into the consumer market , " said johnson .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese companies are investing in african infrastructure projects africa has become a busy hub it does n't do any harm that china is an emerging country itself , said johnson , on the contrary : " in fact it strengthens the chinese , because on the political level they can say to the africans : we 're both against the mighty west .
some african leaders feel quite happy about that .
they look at china and say : forty years ago china was as poor as us , look at them now , should n't we be doing the same thing ? "
however , tull only partially agrees with that assessment : " frankly speaking this may contribute to some sympathy , but i do n't think this is substantially influencing the relationship .
i think both sides , the chinese and the african side are very pragmatic in their relationship and i would n't say that there is so much spinning or ideology involved , " he said .
after all the chinese are not the only new players on the african market , as tull explains : " there is an increased presence of other emerging countries like india , like brazil , etc .
this means there is certainly more competition .
africa has become a busy place , politically and economically . "
no room for human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa 's relationship with former colonial powers like germany is still strong it also means that european partners have to share their interests with others , but tull is convinced that africa 's relationship with its former colonial powers will remain a special one : " europe 's relationship with africa has a certain depth , an historical depth , and it certainly has a lot of intensity .
therefore i do n't think that the chinese influence will grow to an extent that there would be no europeans left in africa in 20 years time or so .
the europeans will always have a presence there and will always maintain these networks , contacts and long-standing connections . "
it remains to be seen however how much influence western countries will have in africa in the future .
china presents itself to african states as a partner and not as a donor .
it makes deals without political conditions , but not necessarily without political impact .
johnson says that china tends to support the government of the day , like in sudan : " china is one of the main arm suppliers for the government of sudan .
that has made a difference for the darfur war .
also china stopped the un security council from taking measures against sudan .
so there is certainly political influence there . "
guinea is another example , says tull , " where it has been reported that the government has signed a seven-billion-dollar deal with chinese companies at a time when the new military regime is under immense international pressure over the recent massacre of civilians in the capital of conakry .
that too illustrates that the chinese are really not paying attention at all to human rights . "

on sunday , chinese premier wen jiabao reflected the close ties between the two pledging $ 10 billion in loans and announcing that tariffs on 95 percent of products from the least-developed african nations would be removed .
china 's foreign minister said on monday that these ties would ultimately help africans " improve their livelihood . "
" china is present in almost every african country , " said denis tull , a researcher with the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" and it 's not just a matter of buying raw materials nor is it part of a grand strategy . "
dominic johnson , africa expert with the berlin-based newspaper tageszeitung told deutsche welle that , " there seems to be a shift away on the chinese side from simply investing in natural resource extraction or buying oil toward investing in african infrastructure . "
a few days ago , china and nigeria signed a contract on building a railway line - a much-needed development as the railway infrastructure in africa 's most populous state dates back to colonial times .
the first ones to benefit from a better transport system in nigeria are the chinese themselves .
chinese companies are keen to develop the nigerian market , as johnson explained : " nigeria has a rapidly growing middle class .
and geographically it is located perfectly to supply the entire west african market .
so it 's a very interesting country for doing business . "
the chinese export mainly basic consumer goods to nigeria - clothes , shoes , but also electronics and motorcycles .
" chinese traders have been very good at settling down in african markets , bringing in lots of goods at low prices and really pushing themselves into the consumer market , " said johnson .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese companies are investing in african infrastructure projects africa has become a busy hub it does n't do any harm that china is an emerging country itself , said johnson , on the contrary : " in fact it strengthens the chinese , because on the political level they can say to the africans : we 're both against the mighty west .
some african leaders feel quite happy about that .
they look at china and say : forty years ago china was as poor as us , look at them now , should n't we be doing the same thing ? "
however , tull only partially agrees with that assessment : " frankly speaking this may contribute to some sympathy , but i do n't think this is substantially influencing the relationship .
i think both sides , the chinese and the african side are very pragmatic in their relationship and i would n't say that there is so much spinning or ideology involved , " he said .
after all the chinese are not the only new players on the african market , as tull explains : " there is an increased presence of other emerging countries like india , like brazil , etc .
this means there is certainly more competition .
africa has become a busy place , politically and economically . "
no room for human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa 's relationship with former colonial powers like germany is still strong it also means that european partners have to share their interests with others , but tull is convinced that africa 's relationship with its former colonial powers will remain a special one : " europe 's relationship with africa has a certain depth , an historical depth , and it certainly has a lot of intensity .
therefore i do n't think that the chinese influence will grow to an extent that there would be no europeans left in africa in 20 years time or so .
the europeans will always have a presence there and will always maintain these networks , contacts and long-standing connections . "
it remains to be seen however how much influence western countries will have in africa in the future .
china presents itself to african states as a partner and not as a donor .
it makes deals without political conditions , but not necessarily without political impact .
johnson says that china tends to support the government of the day , like in sudan : " china is one of the main arm suppliers for the government of sudan .
that has made a difference for the darfur war .
also china stopped the un security council from taking measures against sudan .
so there is certainly political influence there . "
guinea is another example , says tull , " where it has been reported that the government has signed a seven-billion-dollar deal with chinese companies at a time when the new military regime is under immense international pressure over the recent massacre of civilians in the capital of conakry .
that too illustrates that the chinese are really not paying attention at all to human rights . "

on sunday , chinese premier wen jiabao reflected the close ties between the two pledging $ 10 billion in loans and announcing that tariffs on 95 percent of products from the least-developed african nations would be removed .
china 's foreign minister said on monday that these ties would ultimately help africans " improve their livelihood . "
" china is present in almost every african country , " said denis tull , a researcher with the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" and it 's not just a matter of buying raw materials nor is it part of a grand strategy . "
dominic johnson , africa expert with the berlin-based newspaper tageszeitung told deutsche welle that , " there seems to be a shift away on the chinese side from simply investing in natural resource extraction or buying oil toward investing in african infrastructure . "
a few days ago , china and nigeria signed a contract on building a railway line - a much-needed development as the railway infrastructure in africa 's most populous state dates back to colonial times .
the first ones to benefit from a better transport system in nigeria are the chinese themselves .
chinese companies are keen to develop the nigerian market , as johnson explained : " nigeria has a rapidly growing middle class .
and geographically it is located perfectly to supply the entire west african market .
so it 's a very interesting country for doing business . "
the chinese export mainly basic consumer goods to nigeria - clothes , shoes , but also electronics and motorcycles .
" chinese traders have been very good at settling down in african markets , bringing in lots of goods at low prices and really pushing themselves into the consumer market , " said johnson .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese companies are investing in african infrastructure projects africa has become a busy hub it does n't do any harm that china is an emerging country itself , said johnson , on the contrary : " in fact it strengthens the chinese , because on the political level they can say to the africans : we 're both against the mighty west .
some african leaders feel quite happy about that .
they look at china and say : forty years ago china was as poor as us , look at them now , should n't we be doing the same thing ? "
however , tull only partially agrees with that assessment : " frankly speaking this may contribute to some sympathy , but i do n't think this is substantially influencing the relationship .
i think both sides , the chinese and the african side are very pragmatic in their relationship and i would n't say that there is so much spinning or ideology involved , " he said .
after all the chinese are not the only new players on the african market , as tull explains : " there is an increased presence of other emerging countries like india , like brazil , etc .
this means there is certainly more competition .
africa has become a busy place , politically and economically . "
no room for human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa 's relationship with former colonial powers like germany is still strong it also means that european partners have to share their interests with others , but tull is convinced that africa 's relationship with its former colonial powers will remain a special one : " europe 's relationship with africa has a certain depth , an historical depth , and it certainly has a lot of intensity .
therefore i do n't think that the chinese influence will grow to an extent that there would be no europeans left in africa in 20 years time or so .
the europeans will always have a presence there and will always maintain these networks , contacts and long-standing connections . "
it remains to be seen however how much influence western countries will have in africa in the future .
china presents itself to african states as a partner and not as a donor .
it makes deals without political conditions , but not necessarily without political impact .
johnson says that china tends to support the government of the day , like in sudan : " china is one of the main arm suppliers for the government of sudan .
that has made a difference for the darfur war .
also china stopped the un security council from taking measures against sudan .
so there is certainly political influence there . "
guinea is another example , says tull , " where it has been reported that the government has signed a seven-billion-dollar deal with chinese companies at a time when the new military regime is under immense international pressure over the recent massacre of civilians in the capital of conakry .
that too illustrates that the chinese are really not paying attention at all to human rights . "

some people are facing waiting periods of weeks before vaccination will be available . only two weeks after beginning a national vaccination campaign against h1n1 , the intial skepticism over the vaccine has apparently vanished in germany .
the rise in cases and deaths within europe is thought to be the reason for an apparent swing in public opinion about the dangers posed by swine flu .
in september a study found that 62 percent of germans polled would not get vaccinated .
now , due to high demand and supply shortages there are waiting lists to receive the swine flu vaccine .
in some parts of germany , those wating for vaccinations are facing a delay of several weeks .
the rhineland-palatinate ministry of health reported part of the reason for the wait is that that less vaccine was produced than expected .
they cited production shortfalls with the manufacturer .
the baden-wuerttemberg ministry of social affairs complained of " a lack of management " that led to the shortage of vaccine .
can it be too perfect ?
according to the managing director of pharmacists for schleswig-holstein frank jaschkowski , the problem with the vaccine shortage lay with the stringent quality control standards .
" the quality standards for the vaccine are extremely high , " jaschkowski said .
" so it would n't be released unless it was absolutely flawless . "
all across the country , health officials are reporting a significant increase in those seeking swine flu vaccinations .
federal health minister philipp roesler told the german daily bild on saturday that he wanted to assess the swine flu situation at a health ministers ' conference on wednesday .
" along with my colleagues from the various states ' health ministries , i would like to compare notes about where potential weaknesses in the national vaccination supply scheme may exist , " roesler said. sjt / ap / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bayern grabbed the lead on 31 minutes when defender holger badstuber sent a free kick into the box and van buyten was at hand to tap in after schalke 's kevin kuranyi accidentally headed the ball into the belgian 's path .
the balance was restored just before the break when lukas schmitz floated a free kick into the box and matip , until recently in schalke 's under-19 team , rose above bayern defenders to head home .
the result leaves munich stranded in eighth place with 20 points while schalke are fourth with 22 points .

some people are facing waiting periods of weeks before vaccination will be available . only two weeks after beginning a national vaccination campaign against h1n1 , the intial skepticism over the vaccine has apparently vanished in germany .
the rise in cases and deaths within europe is thought to be the reason for an apparent swing in public opinion about the dangers posed by swine flu .
in september a study found that 62 percent of germans polled would not get vaccinated .
now , due to high demand and supply shortages there are waiting lists to receive the swine flu vaccine .
in some parts of germany , those wating for vaccinations are facing a delay of several weeks .
the rhineland-palatinate ministry of health reported part of the reason for the wait is that that less vaccine was produced than expected .
they cited production shortfalls with the manufacturer .
the baden-wuerttemberg ministry of social affairs complained of " a lack of management " that led to the shortage of vaccine .
can it be too perfect ?
according to the managing director of pharmacists for schleswig-holstein frank jaschkowski , the problem with the vaccine shortage lay with the stringent quality control standards .
" the quality standards for the vaccine are extremely high , " jaschkowski said .
" so it would n't be released unless it was absolutely flawless . "
all across the country , health officials are reporting a significant increase in those seeking swine flu vaccinations .
federal health minister philipp roesler told the german daily bild on saturday that he wanted to assess the swine flu situation at a health ministers ' conference on wednesday .
" along with my colleagues from the various states ' health ministries , i would like to compare notes about where potential weaknesses in the national vaccination supply scheme may exist , " roesler said. sjt / ap / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german sporting goods maker adidas is hoping that the next round of world cup mania , together with changes at its us reebok unit , will help pull sales out of the doldrums . adidas ceo herbert hainer said he is looking to 2010 , when the soccer world cup is to be played in south africa , for a boost in sales .
the company reported a third-quarter revenue drop of 7 percent from a year earlier , as sales in its sports-performance division struggled .
customers were keeping their purse-strings tied as a result of the financial crisis , the company said .
' cautiously optimistic ' despite crisis still , the world 's second-largest sporting goods manufacturer said it was " cautiously optimistic " about 2010 results , with hopes that world cup soccer fever , and a new approach to products at its us reebok unit , would boost sales as early as the current quarter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo hainer will focus on outdoors as well as soccer adidas is betting heavily on world cup , which starts june 11 , to improve its fortunes .
the company expects to outfit 12 of the teams competing for the cup , including germany and spain .
the company , based in herzogenaurach , germany , predicted its soccer products would lead to record sales of more than 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- in 2010 .
" this year , our industry and our group have faced unprecedented challenges , " said hainer said in his third-quarter report , which was released on wednesday .
" however , we have tackled the challenges head on .
we have successfully adapted to our difficult surroundings .
and our drive for operational excellence has meant we have strongly improved our financial position . "
plans to release ' explosion ' of new products as adidas continues to trim costs in the third quarter , hainer says he believes the worst is over for the company - despite ongoing difficult markets in the usa and china : " the mood swings between fear and optimism , " he told reporters in a press conference .
for 2009 , adidas predicted net gains of between 230 and 260 million euros , assuming fourth-quarter improvements tied to the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas unit reebok has been troublesome the company said it will release an " explosion " of new soccer-related products , and it has already begun with a soccer boot designed by former france captain zinedine zidane .
the predator x boot is the 10th version of a series that started in 1994 .
next week adidas will unveil the jersey to be worn by germany 's world cup team .
new focus for outdoor sector further plans for adidas include putting more focus on its outdoor-sporting-goods unit , hainer told online business news source mittelfranken.business.on.
" its true that we have n't focused on that unit in the last 10 years , " hainer said .
" now we are starting to make it a focal point . ... for example , we have renewed our partnership with -lrb- mountain climber -rrb- reinhold messsner , who wore adidas shoes in the himalayas 30 years ago . "
" i strongly believe that adidas will be the athletic outdoor brand of the future , " he added. jen / reuters / dpa editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german sporting goods maker adidas is hoping that the next round of world cup mania , together with changes at its us reebok unit , will help pull sales out of the doldrums . adidas ceo herbert hainer said he is looking to 2010 , when the soccer world cup is to be played in south africa , for a boost in sales .
the company reported a third-quarter revenue drop of 7 percent from a year earlier , as sales in its sports-performance division struggled .
customers were keeping their purse-strings tied as a result of the financial crisis , the company said .
' cautiously optimistic ' despite crisis still , the world 's second-largest sporting goods manufacturer said it was " cautiously optimistic " about 2010 results , with hopes that world cup soccer fever , and a new approach to products at its us reebok unit , would boost sales as early as the current quarter .

the company expects to outfit 12 of the teams competing for the cup , including germany and spain .
the company , based in herzogenaurach , germany , predicted its soccer products would lead to record sales of more than 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- in 2010 .
" this year , our industry and our group have faced unprecedented challenges , " said hainer said in his third-quarter report , which was released on wednesday .
" however , we have tackled the challenges head on .
we have successfully adapted to our difficult surroundings .
and our drive for operational excellence has meant we have strongly improved our financial position . "
plans to release ' explosion ' of new products as adidas continues to trim costs in the third quarter , hainer says he believes the worst is over for the company - despite ongoing difficult markets in the usa and china : " the mood swings between fear and optimism , " he told reporters in a press conference .
for 2009 , adidas predicted net gains of between 230 and 260 million euros , assuming fourth-quarter improvements tied to the world cup .

german sporting goods maker adidas is hoping that the next round of world cup mania , together with changes at its us reebok unit , will help pull sales out of the doldrums . adidas ceo herbert hainer said he is looking to 2010 , when the soccer world cup is to be played in south africa , for a boost in sales .
the company reported a third-quarter revenue drop of 7 percent from a year earlier , as sales in its sports-performance division struggled .
customers were keeping their purse-strings tied as a result of the financial crisis , the company said .
' cautiously optimistic ' despite crisis still , the world 's second-largest sporting goods manufacturer said it was " cautiously optimistic " about 2010 results , with hopes that world cup soccer fever , and a new approach to products at its us reebok unit , would boost sales as early as the current quarter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo hainer will focus on outdoors as well as soccer adidas is betting heavily on world cup , which starts june 11 , to improve its fortunes .
the company expects to outfit 12 of the teams competing for the cup , including germany and spain .
the company , based in herzogenaurach , germany , predicted its soccer products would lead to record sales of more than 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- in 2010 .
" this year , our industry and our group have faced unprecedented challenges , " said hainer said in his third-quarter report , which was released on wednesday .
" however , we have tackled the challenges head on .
we have successfully adapted to our difficult surroundings .
and our drive for operational excellence has meant we have strongly improved our financial position . "
plans to release ' explosion ' of new products as adidas continues to trim costs in the third quarter , hainer says he believes the worst is over for the company - despite ongoing difficult markets in the usa and china : " the mood swings between fear and optimism , " he told reporters in a press conference .
for 2009 , adidas predicted net gains of between 230 and 260 million euros , assuming fourth-quarter improvements tied to the world cup .

next week adidas will unveil the jersey to be worn by germany 's world cup team .
new focus for outdoor sector further plans for adidas include putting more focus on its outdoor-sporting-goods unit , hainer told online business news source mittelfranken.business.on.
" its true that we have n't focused on that unit in the last 10 years , " hainer said .
" now we are starting to make it a focal point . ... for example , we have renewed our partnership with -lrb- mountain climber -rrb- reinhold messsner , who wore adidas shoes in the himalayas 30 years ago . "

customers were keeping their purse-strings tied as a result of the financial crisis , the company said .
' cautiously optimistic ' despite crisis still , the world 's second-largest sporting goods manufacturer said it was " cautiously optimistic " about 2010 results , with hopes that world cup soccer fever , and a new approach to products at its us reebok unit , would boost sales as early as the current quarter .

german sporting goods maker adidas is hoping that the next round of world cup mania , together with changes at its us reebok unit , will help pull sales out of the doldrums . adidas ceo herbert hainer said he is looking to 2010 , when the soccer world cup is to be played in south africa , for a boost in sales .
the company reported a third-quarter revenue drop of 7 percent from a year earlier , as sales in its sports-performance division struggled .
customers were keeping their purse-strings tied as a result of the financial crisis , the company said .
' cautiously optimistic ' despite crisis still , the world 's second-largest sporting goods manufacturer said it was " cautiously optimistic " about 2010 results , with hopes that world cup soccer fever , and a new approach to products at its us reebok unit , would boost sales as early as the current quarter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo hainer will focus on outdoors as well as soccer adidas is betting heavily on world cup , which starts june 11 , to improve its fortunes .
the company expects to outfit 12 of the teams competing for the cup , including germany and spain .
the company , based in herzogenaurach , germany , predicted its soccer products would lead to record sales of more than 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- in 2010 .
" this year , our industry and our group have faced unprecedented challenges , " said hainer said in his third-quarter report , which was released on wednesday .
" however , we have tackled the challenges head on .
we have successfully adapted to our difficult surroundings .
and our drive for operational excellence has meant we have strongly improved our financial position . "
plans to release ' explosion ' of new products as adidas continues to trim costs in the third quarter , hainer says he believes the worst is over for the company - despite ongoing difficult markets in the usa and china : " the mood swings between fear and optimism , " he told reporters in a press conference .
for 2009 , adidas predicted net gains of between 230 and 260 million euros , assuming fourth-quarter improvements tied to the world cup .

next week adidas will unveil the jersey to be worn by germany 's world cup team .
new focus for outdoor sector further plans for adidas include putting more focus on its outdoor-sporting-goods unit , hainer told online business news source mittelfranken.business.on.
" its true that we have n't focused on that unit in the last 10 years , " hainer said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 07.11.2009 a german gangsta-rapper changes his tune großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapper samy deluxe engages youth with his organization former gangster-rapper samy deluxe has recultivated his image and is targeting german youth with his new positive message .
through his organization crossover , deluxe hopes to bring young adults together to promote better understanding . samy deluxe is not only successful , having sold over one million albums , he also has a voice that resonates with young people , especially between the ages of 15 and 20 .
this hip-hop idol also has a talent for bringing politics and social engagement to the attention of an otherwise disinterested generation through his songs .
messages like " i have a chance to make something of myself ” and " there is a lot we can do to fight off boredom " permeate his lyrics .
deluxe was not always so socially-minded .
he began his career as a rapper surrounding himself with the usual luxurious cars and beautiful women .
at that time his rhymes generally concentrated on sex , drugs and his own magnificence .
since then , deluxe has successfully transformed himself into a hip-hop artist known for his contemplative lyrics .
today his music showcases his thoughts on things like national identity , the condition of the german social state and the importance of giving today 's youth better opportunities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crossover program has had a successful start on his new cd " dis wo ich herkomm " -lrb- this is where i come from -rrb- , samy deluxe croons to soft reggae beats : this is our germany this is your germany this is the land where we live this is the new germany … a change in tone deluxe is considered one of the most successful german rappers ever , and he is well aware of his influence on young adults .
the change of tone in his music reflects this awareness .
" the concept for this album was to give people courage and to spur them to think critically about their lives and their surroundings , " the hip-hop artist explained .
born samuel sorge , the son of a sudanese father and german mother , deluxe grew up in hamburg , where he was exposed at an early age to social exclusion and ghettoization .
early in his life he was forced to develop strategies to overcome such barriers .
growing up in a mostly white area , deluxe was keenly aware of his difference from his friends and neighbors .
he consequently surrounded himself with other black german friends , hoping to discover his african roots .
in school he also had many turkish and croatian friends and he later went to the united states .
" i 've come to know many cultures and i feel comfortable when i 'm in a group that 's different from me . "
deluxe also addresses the youth of the ' hartz iv generation ' -lrb- those dependent on the german welfare system -rrb- in his songs .
many of these young adults do not foresee a good future for themselves .
but deluxe feels that the way the german system is organized , with a large middle class , young adults really do have a chance to make something of themselves .
building teams to overcome barriers in order to share his experiences with others , samy deluxe founded the non-profit organization crossover , along with designer julia von dohnanyi and marvin willoughby , a former german national basketball player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making music is one of the crossover methods von dohnanyi lived in the united states for many years and understands how important communication is in breaking down barriers .
“ the more people you know and the more types of people you get to know , the easier it is in life .
if you close yourself off and only have a ' my way is the right way ' attitude , life will be tough , " she commented .
crossover has organized basketball and hip-hop workshops at several secondary schools in hamburg to bring together students of different social backgrounds .
the program teamed up young people from exclusive residential areas with those of socially disadvantaged backgrounds and challenged them to make their own rhymes and beats .
many of the workshops were advertized across germany and attracted youth from all over country , partially due to deluxe 's name .
one of the young adults who participated was 17-year-old tom ulris from aschaffenberg .
he was excited about the sense of community that developed out of teamwork .
" i found it fascinating to learn about the differences between young people from all over germany , " he said .
" some of us came from the east and some from the west , but after an hour , it felt like we were one team , ” tom commented .
integration is a challenge for both sides crossover places a lot of emphasis on integration , regardless of whether the young adults are rich or poor , from eastern or western germany , or they are from immigrant families .
von dohnanyi feels that it is very important for youth to believe in the process of integration .
to encourage this belief , she urges team work in which the same expectations are placed upon everyone .
only when each person does his or her share can the project be successful .
sophie niebergal also believes in the value of cultural diversity in germany .
this is why she decided to do a one-year internship with the crossover organization .
she wants to work with young adults to help them start breaking down the barriers that still divide them .
as his organization grows in size and popularity among young people , samy deluxe may start to believe that some of the lyrics of his songs are ringing true . … it 's about time that people start to wake up and begin to speak about something other than celebrities , football and the weather , like how we can improve the conditions for our youth and right now because this is our germany this is your germany … author : zoran arbutina / gmb editor : louisa schaefer / bk send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

through his organization crossover , deluxe hopes to bring young adults together to promote better understanding . samy deluxe is not only successful , having sold over one million albums , he also has a voice that resonates with young people , especially between the ages of 15 and 20 .
this hip-hop idol also has a talent for bringing politics and social engagement to the attention of an otherwise disinterested generation through his songs .
messages like " i have a chance to make something of myself ” and " there is a lot we can do to fight off boredom " permeate his lyrics .
deluxe was not always so socially-minded .
he began his career as a rapper surrounding himself with the usual luxurious cars and beautiful women .
at that time his rhymes generally concentrated on sex , drugs and his own magnificence .
since then , deluxe has successfully transformed himself into a hip-hop artist known for his contemplative lyrics .
today his music showcases his thoughts on things like national identity , the condition of the german social state and the importance of giving today 's youth better opportunities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crossover program has had a successful start on his new cd " dis wo ich herkomm " -lrb- this is where i come from -rrb- , samy deluxe croons to soft reggae beats : this is our germany this is your germany this is the land where we live this is the new germany … a change in tone deluxe is considered one of the most successful german rappers ever , and he is well aware of his influence on young adults .
the change of tone in his music reflects this awareness .
" the concept for this album was to give people courage and to spur them to think critically about their lives and their surroundings , " the hip-hop artist explained .
born samuel sorge , the son of a sudanese father and german mother , deluxe grew up in hamburg , where he was exposed at an early age to social exclusion and ghettoization .
early in his life he was forced to develop strategies to overcome such barriers .
growing up in a mostly white area , deluxe was keenly aware of his difference from his friends and neighbors .
he consequently surrounded himself with other black german friends , hoping to discover his african roots .
in school he also had many turkish and croatian friends and he later went to the united states .
" i 've come to know many cultures and i feel comfortable when i 'm in a group that 's different from me . "
deluxe also addresses the youth of the ' hartz iv generation ' -lrb- those dependent on the german welfare system -rrb- in his songs .
many of these young adults do not foresee a good future for themselves .
but deluxe feels that the way the german system is organized , with a large middle class , young adults really do have a chance to make something of themselves .
building teams to overcome barriers in order to share his experiences with others , samy deluxe founded the non-profit organization crossover , along with designer julia von dohnanyi and marvin willoughby , a former german national basketball player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making music is one of the crossover methods von dohnanyi lived in the united states for many years and understands how important communication is in breaking down barriers .
“ the more people you know and the more types of people you get to know , the easier it is in life .
if you close yourself off and only have a ' my way is the right way ' attitude , life will be tough , " she commented .
crossover has organized basketball and hip-hop workshops at several secondary schools in hamburg to bring together students of different social backgrounds .
the program teamed up young people from exclusive residential areas with those of socially disadvantaged backgrounds and challenged them to make their own rhymes and beats .
many of the workshops were advertized across germany and attracted youth from all over country , partially due to deluxe 's name .
one of the young adults who participated was 17-year-old tom ulris from aschaffenberg .
he was excited about the sense of community that developed out of teamwork .
" i found it fascinating to learn about the differences between young people from all over germany , " he said .
" some of us came from the east and some from the west , but after an hour , it felt like we were one team , ” tom commented .
integration is a challenge for both sides crossover places a lot of emphasis on integration , regardless of whether the young adults are rich or poor , from eastern or western germany , or they are from immigrant families .
von dohnanyi feels that it is very important for youth to believe in the process of integration .
to encourage this belief , she urges team work in which the same expectations are placed upon everyone .
only when each person does his or her share can the project be successful .
sophie niebergal also believes in the value of cultural diversity in germany .
this is why she decided to do a one-year internship with the crossover organization .
she wants to work with young adults to help them start breaking down the barriers that still divide them .

through his organization crossover , deluxe hopes to bring young adults together to promote better understanding . samy deluxe is not only successful , having sold over one million albums , he also has a voice that resonates with young people , especially between the ages of 15 and 20 .
this hip-hop idol also has a talent for bringing politics and social engagement to the attention of an otherwise disinterested generation through his songs .
messages like " i have a chance to make something of myself ” and " there is a lot we can do to fight off boredom " permeate his lyrics .
deluxe was not always so socially-minded .
he began his career as a rapper surrounding himself with the usual luxurious cars and beautiful women .
at that time his rhymes generally concentrated on sex , drugs and his own magnificence .
since then , deluxe has successfully transformed himself into a hip-hop artist known for his contemplative lyrics .
today his music showcases his thoughts on things like national identity , the condition of the german social state and the importance of giving today 's youth better opportunities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crossover program has had a successful start on his new cd " dis wo ich herkomm " -lrb- this is where i come from -rrb- , samy deluxe croons to soft reggae beats : this is our germany this is your germany this is the land where we live this is the new germany … a change in tone deluxe is considered one of the most successful german rappers ever , and he is well aware of his influence on young adults .
the change of tone in his music reflects this awareness .
" the concept for this album was to give people courage and to spur them to think critically about their lives and their surroundings , " the hip-hop artist explained .
born samuel sorge , the son of a sudanese father and german mother , deluxe grew up in hamburg , where he was exposed at an early age to social exclusion and ghettoization .
early in his life he was forced to develop strategies to overcome such barriers .
growing up in a mostly white area , deluxe was keenly aware of his difference from his friends and neighbors .
he consequently surrounded himself with other black german friends , hoping to discover his african roots .
in school he also had many turkish and croatian friends and he later went to the united states .
" i 've come to know many cultures and i feel comfortable when i 'm in a group that 's different from me . "
deluxe also addresses the youth of the ' hartz iv generation ' -lrb- those dependent on the german welfare system -rrb- in his songs .
many of these young adults do not foresee a good future for themselves .
but deluxe feels that the way the german system is organized , with a large middle class , young adults really do have a chance to make something of themselves .
building teams to overcome barriers in order to share his experiences with others , samy deluxe founded the non-profit organization crossover , along with designer julia von dohnanyi and marvin willoughby , a former german national basketball player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making music is one of the crossover methods von dohnanyi lived in the united states for many years and understands how important communication is in breaking down barriers .
“ the more people you know and the more types of people you get to know , the easier it is in life .
if you close yourself off and only have a ' my way is the right way ' attitude , life will be tough , " she commented .
crossover has organized basketball and hip-hop workshops at several secondary schools in hamburg to bring together students of different social backgrounds .
the program teamed up young people from exclusive residential areas with those of socially disadvantaged backgrounds and challenged them to make their own rhymes and beats .
many of the workshops were advertized across germany and attracted youth from all over country , partially due to deluxe 's name .
one of the young adults who participated was 17-year-old tom ulris from aschaffenberg .
he was excited about the sense of community that developed out of teamwork .
" i found it fascinating to learn about the differences between young people from all over germany , " he said .
" some of us came from the east and some from the west , but after an hour , it felt like we were one team , ” tom commented .
integration is a challenge for both sides crossover places a lot of emphasis on integration , regardless of whether the young adults are rich or poor , from eastern or western germany , or they are from immigrant families .
von dohnanyi feels that it is very important for youth to believe in the process of integration .
to encourage this belief , she urges team work in which the same expectations are placed upon everyone .
only when each person does his or her share can the project be successful .
sophie niebergal also believes in the value of cultural diversity in germany .
this is why she decided to do a one-year internship with the crossover organization .
she wants to work with young adults to help them start breaking down the barriers that still divide them .
as his organization grows in size and popularity among young people , samy deluxe may start to believe that some of the lyrics of his songs are ringing true . … it 's about time that people start to wake up and begin to speak about something other than celebrities , football and the weather , like how we can improve the conditions for our youth and right now because this is our germany this is your germany … author : zoran arbutina / gmb editor : louisa schaefer / bk send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on sunday , chinese premier wen jiabao reflected the close ties between the two pledging $ 10 billion in loans and announcing that tariffs on 95 percent of products from the least-developed african nations would be removed .
china 's foreign minister said on monday that these ties would ultimately help africans " improve their livelihood . "
" china is present in almost every african country , " said denis tull , a researcher with the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" and it 's not just a matter of buying raw materials nor is it part of a grand strategy . "
dominic johnson , africa expert with the berlin-based newspaper tageszeitung told deutsche welle that , " there seems to be a shift away on the chinese side from simply investing in natural resource extraction or buying oil toward investing in african infrastructure . "
a few days ago , china and nigeria signed a contract on building a railway line - a much-needed development as the railway infrastructure in africa 's most populous state dates back to colonial times .
the first ones to benefit from a better transport system in nigeria are the chinese themselves .
chinese companies are keen to develop the nigerian market , as johnson explained : " nigeria has a rapidly growing middle class .
and geographically it is located perfectly to supply the entire west african market .
so it 's a very interesting country for doing business . "
the chinese export mainly basic consumer goods to nigeria - clothes , shoes , but also electronics and motorcycles .
" chinese traders have been very good at settling down in african markets , bringing in lots of goods at low prices and really pushing themselves into the consumer market , " said johnson .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese companies are investing in african infrastructure projects africa has become a busy hub it does n't do any harm that china is an emerging country itself , said johnson , on the contrary : " in fact it strengthens the chinese , because on the political level they can say to the africans : we 're both against the mighty west .
some african leaders feel quite happy about that .
they look at china and say : forty years ago china was as poor as us , look at them now , should n't we be doing the same thing ? "
however , tull only partially agrees with that assessment : " frankly speaking this may contribute to some sympathy , but i do n't think this is substantially influencing the relationship .
i think both sides , the chinese and the african side are very pragmatic in their relationship and i would n't say that there is so much spinning or ideology involved , " he said .
after all the chinese are not the only new players on the african market , as tull explains : " there is an increased presence of other emerging countries like india , like brazil , etc .
this means there is certainly more competition .
africa has become a busy place , politically and economically . "
no room for human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa 's relationship with former colonial powers like germany is still strong it also means that european partners have to share their interests with others , but tull is convinced that africa 's relationship with its former colonial powers will remain a special one : " europe 's relationship with africa has a certain depth , an historical depth , and it certainly has a lot of intensity .
therefore i do n't think that the chinese influence will grow to an extent that there would be no europeans left in africa in 20 years time or so .
the europeans will always have a presence there and will always maintain these networks , contacts and long-standing connections . "
it remains to be seen however how much influence western countries will have in africa in the future .
china presents itself to african states as a partner and not as a donor .
it makes deals without political conditions , but not necessarily without political impact .
johnson says that china tends to support the government of the day , like in sudan : " china is one of the main arm suppliers for the government of sudan .
that has made a difference for the darfur war .
also china stopped the un security council from taking measures against sudan .
so there is certainly political influence there . "
guinea is another example , says tull , " where it has been reported that the government has signed a seven-billion-dollar deal with chinese companies at a time when the new military regime is under immense international pressure over the recent massacre of civilians in the capital of conakry .
that too illustrates that the chinese are really not paying attention at all to human rights . "

on sunday , chinese premier wen jiabao reflected the close ties between the two pledging $ 10 billion in loans and announcing that tariffs on 95 percent of products from the least-developed african nations would be removed .
china 's foreign minister said on monday that these ties would ultimately help africans " improve their livelihood . "
" china is present in almost every african country , " said denis tull , a researcher with the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" and it 's not just a matter of buying raw materials nor is it part of a grand strategy . "
dominic johnson , africa expert with the berlin-based newspaper tageszeitung told deutsche welle that , " there seems to be a shift away on the chinese side from simply investing in natural resource extraction or buying oil toward investing in african infrastructure . "
a few days ago , china and nigeria signed a contract on building a railway line - a much-needed development as the railway infrastructure in africa 's most populous state dates back to colonial times .
the first ones to benefit from a better transport system in nigeria are the chinese themselves .
chinese companies are keen to develop the nigerian market , as johnson explained : " nigeria has a rapidly growing middle class .
and geographically it is located perfectly to supply the entire west african market .
so it 's a very interesting country for doing business . "
the chinese export mainly basic consumer goods to nigeria - clothes , shoes , but also electronics and motorcycles .
" chinese traders have been very good at settling down in african markets , bringing in lots of goods at low prices and really pushing themselves into the consumer market , " said johnson .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese companies are investing in african infrastructure projects africa has become a busy hub it does n't do any harm that china is an emerging country itself , said johnson , on the contrary : " in fact it strengthens the chinese , because on the political level they can say to the africans : we 're both against the mighty west .
some african leaders feel quite happy about that .
they look at china and say : forty years ago china was as poor as us , look at them now , should n't we be doing the same thing ? "
however , tull only partially agrees with that assessment : " frankly speaking this may contribute to some sympathy , but i do n't think this is substantially influencing the relationship .
i think both sides , the chinese and the african side are very pragmatic in their relationship and i would n't say that there is so much spinning or ideology involved , " he said .
after all the chinese are not the only new players on the african market , as tull explains : " there is an increased presence of other emerging countries like india , like brazil , etc .
this means there is certainly more competition .
africa has become a busy place , politically and economically . "
no room for human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa 's relationship with former colonial powers like germany is still strong it also means that european partners have to share their interests with others , but tull is convinced that africa 's relationship with its former colonial powers will remain a special one : " europe 's relationship with africa has a certain depth , an historical depth , and it certainly has a lot of intensity .
therefore i do n't think that the chinese influence will grow to an extent that there would be no europeans left in africa in 20 years time or so .
the europeans will always have a presence there and will always maintain these networks , contacts and long-standing connections . "
it remains to be seen however how much influence western countries will have in africa in the future .
china presents itself to african states as a partner and not as a donor .
it makes deals without political conditions , but not necessarily without political impact .
johnson says that china tends to support the government of the day , like in sudan : " china is one of the main arm suppliers for the government of sudan .
that has made a difference for the darfur war .
also china stopped the un security council from taking measures against sudan .
so there is certainly political influence there . "
guinea is another example , says tull , " where it has been reported that the government has signed a seven-billion-dollar deal with chinese companies at a time when the new military regime is under immense international pressure over the recent massacre of civilians in the capital of conakry .
that too illustrates that the chinese are really not paying attention at all to human rights . "

on sunday , chinese premier wen jiabao reflected the close ties between the two pledging $ 10 billion in loans and announcing that tariffs on 95 percent of products from the least-developed african nations would be removed .
china 's foreign minister said on monday that these ties would ultimately help africans " improve their livelihood . "
" china is present in almost every african country , " said denis tull , a researcher with the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" and it 's not just a matter of buying raw materials nor is it part of a grand strategy . "
dominic johnson , africa expert with the berlin-based newspaper tageszeitung told deutsche welle that , " there seems to be a shift away on the chinese side from simply investing in natural resource extraction or buying oil toward investing in african infrastructure . "
a few days ago , china and nigeria signed a contract on building a railway line - a much-needed development as the railway infrastructure in africa 's most populous state dates back to colonial times .
the first ones to benefit from a better transport system in nigeria are the chinese themselves .
chinese companies are keen to develop the nigerian market , as johnson explained : " nigeria has a rapidly growing middle class .
and geographically it is located perfectly to supply the entire west african market .
so it 's a very interesting country for doing business . "
the chinese export mainly basic consumer goods to nigeria - clothes , shoes , but also electronics and motorcycles .
" chinese traders have been very good at settling down in african markets , bringing in lots of goods at low prices and really pushing themselves into the consumer market , " said johnson .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese companies are investing in african infrastructure projects africa has become a busy hub it does n't do any harm that china is an emerging country itself , said johnson , on the contrary : " in fact it strengthens the chinese , because on the political level they can say to the africans : we 're both against the mighty west .
some african leaders feel quite happy about that .
they look at china and say : forty years ago china was as poor as us , look at them now , should n't we be doing the same thing ? "
however , tull only partially agrees with that assessment : " frankly speaking this may contribute to some sympathy , but i do n't think this is substantially influencing the relationship .
i think both sides , the chinese and the african side are very pragmatic in their relationship and i would n't say that there is so much spinning or ideology involved , " he said .
after all the chinese are not the only new players on the african market , as tull explains : " there is an increased presence of other emerging countries like india , like brazil , etc .
this means there is certainly more competition .
africa has become a busy place , politically and economically . "
no room for human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa 's relationship with former colonial powers like germany is still strong it also means that european partners have to share their interests with others , but tull is convinced that africa 's relationship with its former colonial powers will remain a special one : " europe 's relationship with africa has a certain depth , an historical depth , and it certainly has a lot of intensity .
therefore i do n't think that the chinese influence will grow to an extent that there would be no europeans left in africa in 20 years time or so .
the europeans will always have a presence there and will always maintain these networks , contacts and long-standing connections . "
it remains to be seen however how much influence western countries will have in africa in the future .
china presents itself to african states as a partner and not as a donor .
it makes deals without political conditions , but not necessarily without political impact .
johnson says that china tends to support the government of the day , like in sudan : " china is one of the main arm suppliers for the government of sudan .
that has made a difference for the darfur war .
also china stopped the un security council from taking measures against sudan .
so there is certainly political influence there . "
guinea is another example , says tull , " where it has been reported that the government has signed a seven-billion-dollar deal with chinese companies at a time when the new military regime is under immense international pressure over the recent massacre of civilians in the capital of conakry .
that too illustrates that the chinese are really not paying attention at all to human rights . "

" you are all part of what is an historic moment for us , " she added . fritz schramma , the former mayor of cologne , who is from chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said that the architecture of the mosque was " a symbol of a budding flower , " inviting people in .
the futuristic design is said to include a large dome and two 55-meter minarets .
the construction of the mosque , which is expected to be completed in two years ' time , is set to begin after a long and acrimonious dispute between ditib and non-muslim residents of the city which is home to the cologne cathedral , one of the most renowned cathedrals in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing prokoeln group held a demonstration against the mosque opponents of the mosque say it will spoil cologne 's skyline , by diverting attention from the gothic cathedral .
right-wing extremists have been particularly vocal in their opposition to the construction of the mosque and staged a small protest on saturday .
the heated debate leading up to the ceremony echoes the tensions that emerged in berlin where a mosque was constructed in recent years .
some analysts say it points to the intensifying conflict between a growing muslim community in the country and across western europe .
in the end , ditib struck a compromise , agreeing not to broadcast the call to prayer in order to avoid friction with the non-muslim residents of the neighborhood .
at the ceremony , thomas kufen , integration commissioner of the state of north rhine-westphalia , described the islamic house of worship as a sign that muslims " had arrived " in the german society .
" this mosque will be a piece of jewelry , " he added .
" it has been a long road , " kufen said , referring to the difficult and prolonged discussions over the construction of the mosque .
" it gave rise to hostility and hurt . "
however , he said the fact that the foundation stone had been laid was a sign that xenophobia stands no chance. rb / dpa / epd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some people are facing waiting periods of weeks before vaccination will be available . only two weeks after beginning a national vaccination campaign against h1n1 , the intial skepticism over the vaccine has apparently vanished in germany .
the rise in cases and deaths within europe is thought to be the reason for an apparent swing in public opinion about the dangers posed by swine flu .
in september a study found that 62 percent of germans polled would not get vaccinated .
now , due to high demand and supply shortages there are waiting lists to receive the swine flu vaccine .
in some parts of germany , those wating for vaccinations are facing a delay of several weeks .
the rhineland-palatinate ministry of health reported part of the reason for the wait is that that less vaccine was produced than expected .
they cited production shortfalls with the manufacturer .
the baden-wuerttemberg ministry of social affairs complained of " a lack of management " that led to the shortage of vaccine .
can it be too perfect ?
according to the managing director of pharmacists for schleswig-holstein frank jaschkowski , the problem with the vaccine shortage lay with the stringent quality control standards .
" the quality standards for the vaccine are extremely high , " jaschkowski said .
" so it would n't be released unless it was absolutely flawless . "
all across the country , health officials are reporting a significant increase in those seeking swine flu vaccinations .
federal health minister philipp roesler told the german daily bild on saturday that he wanted to assess the swine flu situation at a health ministers ' conference on wednesday .
" along with my colleagues from the various states ' health ministries , i would like to compare notes about where potential weaknesses in the national vaccination supply scheme may exist , " roesler said. sjt / ap / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some people are facing waiting periods of weeks before vaccination will be available . only two weeks after beginning a national vaccination campaign against h1n1 , the intial skepticism over the vaccine has apparently vanished in germany .
the rise in cases and deaths within europe is thought to be the reason for an apparent swing in public opinion about the dangers posed by swine flu .

now , due to high demand and supply shortages there are waiting lists to receive the swine flu vaccine .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : crunchtime for afghanistan troop increase for afghanistan must be linked to reforms , says expert nato agrees on the need for new strategy in afghanistan opinion : how the west has yet again failed afghanistan can tajikistan and ' aiming low ' be a model for afghanistan ? bundeswehr -pipe- 07.11.2009 debate on germany 's status in afghanistan opens up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's afghanistan mission is widely unpopular in germany germany 's defense minister has called for clarification of germany 's status in afghanistan , after a contoversial airstrike ordered by a german commander raised the question of whether the country is at war . german defense minister , karl-theodor zu guttenberg , told the daily sueddeutsche zeitung that legal security must be established for all german bundeswehr soldiers - in particular those taking part in complicated missions like germany 's participation in the nato isaf mission in afghanistan .
" we ca n't have our soldiers hampered by legal doubts , especially when they are forced to make decisions under extreme time pressure , " guttenberg said .
guttenberg 's comments came after he voiced his support of a controversial airstrike ordered by a german commander in afghanistan in september .
guttenberg backed the decision of colonel georg klein to launch an air attack on two fuel tankers that had been hijacked by taliban militants near a german military base in northern afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's zu guttenberg backs the controversial airstrike according to a nato report , up to 142 people , including several civilians that had gathered around the tankers to siphon fuel after they had stalled , were killed in the strike .
guttenberg acknowledged that civilians were killed in the attack and also that " some procedural errors " were committed .
nonetheless , he put his full support behind colonel klein 's decision , calling it " militarily appropriate . "
criticism from opposition several german politicians have openly disagreed with guttenberg 's backing of the airstrike .
social democrat defense expert rainer arnold told the berlin daily tagesspiegel that guttenberg 's evaluation was " illegitimate and unreasonable . "
" if -lsb- guttenberg -rsb- believes that dropping bombs in afghanistan on large masses of people is alright , then the social democrats can no longer go along with him . "
the defense expert of the green party , omri nouripour , found guttenberg 's justification of the airstrike peculiar , especially considering that guttenberg admitted that mistakes were made .
" this issue should n't be treated as a mere bagatelle . that would make it look like the defense ministry pays no attention to the rules , " nouripour said .
bigger issue at hand the debates caused by the september airstrike have brought up the more large-scale question of whether germany is technically at war in afghanistan .
a court in the eastern state of saxony has passed the klein case on to germany 's top federal prosecution office , which will examine whether it is a matter for international law or german law .
for this to be determined the federal prosecutor must establish whether germany 's participation in the nato isaf mission constitutes an " armed conflict . "
the head of the german military alliance , colonel ulrich kirsch , told the mass-circulated bild zeitung that the german operation in afghanistan constituted war .
bildunterschrift : civilans and militants were among those killed in the airstrike , says nato " the justice ministry has stated explicitly what we are dealing with in afghanistan : a non-international armed conflict .
this is a war . "
former bundeswehr general harald kujat went further , warning of " catastrophic consequences " should germany pursue its investigations of the airstrike and impose penalties on colonel klein .
" every soldier and officer would think twice about assuming any responsibility under such conditions , " he told the daily frankfurter rundschau .
under german constitution , it is illegal for the country to enter a war , except for purposes of defense .
over sixty years following the nazi era , germans remain highly skeptical of military operations .
it was only a decade ago that german troops participated in their first foreign combat mission since the end of wwii .
opinion polls show a majority of germans oppose the engagement in afghanistan and want the over 4,000 troops there to come home. glb / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we ca n't have our soldiers hampered by legal doubts , especially when they are forced to make decisions under extreme time pressure , " guttenberg said .
guttenberg 's comments came after he voiced his support of a controversial airstrike ordered by a german commander in afghanistan in september .
guttenberg backed the decision of colonel georg klein to launch an air attack on two fuel tankers that had been hijacked by taliban militants near a german military base in northern afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's zu guttenberg backs the controversial airstrike according to a nato report , up to 142 people , including several civilians that had gathered around the tankers to siphon fuel after they had stalled , were killed in the strike .

nonetheless , he put his full support behind colonel klein 's decision , calling it " militarily appropriate . "
criticism from opposition several german politicians have openly disagreed with guttenberg 's backing of the airstrike .
social democrat defense expert rainer arnold told the berlin daily tagesspiegel that guttenberg 's evaluation was " illegitimate and unreasonable . "
" if -lsb- guttenberg -rsb- believes that dropping bombs in afghanistan on large masses of people is alright , then the social democrats can no longer go along with him . "
the defense expert of the green party , omri nouripour , found guttenberg 's justification of the airstrike peculiar , especially considering that guttenberg admitted that mistakes were made .
" this issue should n't be treated as a mere bagatelle . that would make it look like the defense ministry pays no attention to the rules , " nouripour said .
bigger issue at hand the debates caused by the september airstrike have brought up the more large-scale question of whether germany is technically at war in afghanistan .
a court in the eastern state of saxony has passed the klein case on to germany 's top federal prosecution office , which will examine whether it is a matter for international law or german law .
for this to be determined the federal prosecutor must establish whether germany 's participation in the nato isaf mission constitutes an " armed conflict . "
the head of the german military alliance , colonel ulrich kirsch , told the mass-circulated bild zeitung that the german operation in afghanistan constituted war .
bildunterschrift : civilans and militants were among those killed in the airstrike , says nato " the justice ministry has stated explicitly what we are dealing with in afghanistan : a non-international armed conflict .
this is a war . "
former bundeswehr general harald kujat went further , warning of " catastrophic consequences " should germany pursue its investigations of the airstrike and impose penalties on colonel klein .
" every soldier and officer would think twice about assuming any responsibility under such conditions , " he told the daily frankfurter rundschau .
under german constitution , it is illegal for the country to enter a war , except for purposes of defense .
over sixty years following the nazi era , germans remain highly skeptical of military operations .
it was only a decade ago that german troops participated in their first foreign combat mission since the end of wwii .

" we ca n't have our soldiers hampered by legal doubts , especially when they are forced to make decisions under extreme time pressure , " guttenberg said .
guttenberg 's comments came after he voiced his support of a controversial airstrike ordered by a german commander in afghanistan in september .
guttenberg backed the decision of colonel georg klein to launch an air attack on two fuel tankers that had been hijacked by taliban militants near a german military base in northern afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's zu guttenberg backs the controversial airstrike according to a nato report , up to 142 people , including several civilians that had gathered around the tankers to siphon fuel after they had stalled , were killed in the strike .
guttenberg acknowledged that civilians were killed in the attack and also that " some procedural errors " were committed .
nonetheless , he put his full support behind colonel klein 's decision , calling it " militarily appropriate . "
criticism from opposition several german politicians have openly disagreed with guttenberg 's backing of the airstrike .
social democrat defense expert rainer arnold told the berlin daily tagesspiegel that guttenberg 's evaluation was " illegitimate and unreasonable . "
" if -lsb- guttenberg -rsb- believes that dropping bombs in afghanistan on large masses of people is alright , then the social democrats can no longer go along with him . "
the defense expert of the green party , omri nouripour , found guttenberg 's justification of the airstrike peculiar , especially considering that guttenberg admitted that mistakes were made .
" this issue should n't be treated as a mere bagatelle . that would make it look like the defense ministry pays no attention to the rules , " nouripour said .
bigger issue at hand the debates caused by the september airstrike have brought up the more large-scale question of whether germany is technically at war in afghanistan .
a court in the eastern state of saxony has passed the klein case on to germany 's top federal prosecution office , which will examine whether it is a matter for international law or german law .
for this to be determined the federal prosecutor must establish whether germany 's participation in the nato isaf mission constitutes an " armed conflict . "
the head of the german military alliance , colonel ulrich kirsch , told the mass-circulated bild zeitung that the german operation in afghanistan constituted war .
bildunterschrift : civilans and militants were among those killed in the airstrike , says nato " the justice ministry has stated explicitly what we are dealing with in afghanistan : a non-international armed conflict .
this is a war . "
former bundeswehr general harald kujat went further , warning of " catastrophic consequences " should germany pursue its investigations of the airstrike and impose penalties on colonel klein .
" every soldier and officer would think twice about assuming any responsibility under such conditions , " he told the daily frankfurter rundschau .
under german constitution , it is illegal for the country to enter a war , except for purposes of defense .
over sixty years following the nazi era , germans remain highly skeptical of military operations .
it was only a decade ago that german troops participated in their first foreign combat mission since the end of wwii .

young students show promising potential , but one aisle remains empty : the iranian group did n't get visas . every year hundreds of inventors from all over the world come to nuremberg 's inventor 's fair iena to show off their latest ideas .
about 800 inventions from 33 countries are on display this year , presenting a wide range of inventions from improved household appliances to high-tech equipment .
according to iena , the number of presented inventions exceeds previous presentations in iena 's 60-year history .
many individual inventors from germany take part in signo -lrb- protection of ideas for commercial usage -rrb- inventor 's clubs .
38 of these locally organized clubs present about 190 ideas on this year 's fair .
young inventors in focus especially young inventors draw attention to their ideas .
many young students are part of inventor 's clubs at their school and professionally introduce their products to trade experts . eleven-year old raphael krauthann from signo invention club " querdenker " -lrb- " lateral thinker " -rrb- presents his idea on how to reach for crutches on the floor with a magnetic device .
he developed his idea when one of his friends was struggling with crutches because they kept falling on the floor .
" it was really annoying , so i said i 'm going to invent something , " explained raphael krauthann .
other kids from the " querdenker " club in ingolstadt also had ideas with great potential .
andreas finkenzeller 's device prevents burning by accident from an electric iron .
the 13-year-old invented a system that stops the electricity flow in an iron if it has not been moved in a certain time period .
and michael stamp , 14 , who had to visit the hospital because fireworks exploded in his hand developed a device that lids the explosive charge in a safe distance by stepping on a handle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : displayed inventions ranged from household appliances to high-tech equipment 20-year-old florian nuber was facing a different kind of problem .
his cat brought dead mice inside his parents ' house , so he grabbed two of his apprenticeship colleges at wodego to find a solution .
florian nuber , christoph seger and sebastian soderer then invented the kitty clap which uses sensors to check the cat 's outlines .
it will only allow the cat to come in if it is not carrying a mouse .
if the cat is transporting a mouse , its figure would be different . antibacterial solutions in times of swine flu and other potential infections , inventions such as spanish inventor juan edilbato rodriguez morales ' automatic hygienic mat come in handy .
first the rotating brush moistened with water and disinfectant cleans the shoe , then the dryer eliminates the remaining water .
this could be used in hospitals , at airports or other places where a lot of people gather to prevent germ spreading .
an antibacterial door handle and antibacterial pens also reduce the chance of infection with germs .
a lot of infections in hospitals are caused by door handles because everyone touches them , said bruno gruber , a professional inventor of 33 years experience .
altogether he has registered 400 patents so far .
the most difficult part , he said , is to find someone who wants to produce and sell a product which starts off as a prototype .
" inventing is easy , marketing is my biggest problem , " said gruber .
problems with patents but inventors are also facing problems with patents .
registering patents can take years , claims gruber .
" it should be accelerated , because it is damaging for the industry .
especially in tough times it is important that new ideas get introduced to the market quickly , but the patent office is understaffed . "
approximately 700 patent examiners are working for the german patent office .
gruber said they need to double the workforce .
the german patent office is currently searching for new patent examiners .
bernd antonius from the german patent office admits they are a little behind with patent applications .
another problem for inventors is the rising annual fee to keep the patent .
if inventors do n't find a company right away , they choose to secure the patent until they can find someone who is willing to produce the product .
otherwise their invention could be used by anyone for free .
registering a patent itself is not so expensive , explained gruber , but needing a specialized patent lawyer for complicated matters is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : space reserved for iranian inventors remained empty no visa for iranians iena is meant to be an exchange for international inventors , but this year one aisle remains almost completely empty .
the president of " the first institute of researchers and inventors in iran , " dr. alireza rastegar , said he did n't get visa appointments for a group of 45 young inventors at the german embassy in tehran even though he applied in time .
" we have been coming to iena for the past five years , and we never had a problem , " said rastegar .
" i am very very angry .
the iranian booths are empty .
this is a very bad position for us and this exhibition . "
rastegar booked 72 square meters -lrb- 775 square feet -rrb- of the fair for young iranian inventors .
he himself could travel to germany because he holds a swiss visa ; the few students who are at the fair got visas through italy or a family invitation from germany , he said .
that 's why babak khodaparast could present his emergency cooling system that can be used to transport a human organ in a cold device .
kambiz shirzadian , who has lived in germany for 30 years , came to represent his nephew 's booth because he did n't get a visa as well .
according to shirzadian , when he asked the german embassy in tehran about the visa application , he was told such an application did n't exist .
lydia zetl , project manager of iena , is surprised that the iranian group did n't get their visa appointments .
" for me it was obvious that they would get their visas , because they are exhibiting for several years now and it has always worked in the past . "
she said she was told that the iranian group was too late in order to get an appointment .
rastegar said he is going to discuss the issue with the iranian ambassador in berlin on monday .
for shirzadian the worst part is the disappointment the young people must feel who were eager to present their ideas and to meet international researchers .

otherwise their invention could be used by anyone for free .
registering a patent itself is not so expensive , explained gruber , but needing a specialized patent lawyer for complicated matters is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : space reserved for iranian inventors remained empty no visa for iranians iena is meant to be an exchange for international inventors , but this year one aisle remains almost completely empty .
the president of " the first institute of researchers and inventors in iran , " dr. alireza rastegar , said he did n't get visa appointments for a group of 45 young inventors at the german embassy in tehran even though he applied in time .
" we have been coming to iena for the past five years , and we never had a problem , " said rastegar .
" i am very very angry .
the iranian booths are empty .
this is a very bad position for us and this exhibition . "
rastegar booked 72 square meters -lrb- 775 square feet -rrb- of the fair for young iranian inventors .
he himself could travel to germany because he holds a swiss visa ; the few students who are at the fair got visas through italy or a family invitation from germany , he said .
that 's why babak khodaparast could present his emergency cooling system that can be used to transport a human organ in a cold device .
kambiz shirzadian , who has lived in germany for 30 years , came to represent his nephew 's booth because he did n't get a visa as well .
according to shirzadian , when he asked the german embassy in tehran about the visa application , he was told such an application did n't exist .
lydia zetl , project manager of iena , is surprised that the iranian group did n't get their visa appointments .
" for me it was obvious that they would get their visas , because they are exhibiting for several years now and it has always worked in the past . "
she said she was told that the iranian group was too late in order to get an appointment .
rastegar said he is going to discuss the issue with the iranian ambassador in berlin on monday .
for shirzadian the worst part is the disappointment the young people must feel who were eager to present their ideas and to meet international researchers .

young students show promising potential , but one aisle remains empty : the iranian group did n't get visas . every year hundreds of inventors from all over the world come to nuremberg 's inventor 's fair iena to show off their latest ideas .
about 800 inventions from 33 countries are on display this year , presenting a wide range of inventions from improved household appliances to high-tech equipment .
according to iena , the number of presented inventions exceeds previous presentations in iena 's 60-year history .
many individual inventors from germany take part in signo -lrb- protection of ideas for commercial usage -rrb- inventor 's clubs .
38 of these locally organized clubs present about 190 ideas on this year 's fair .
young inventors in focus especially young inventors draw attention to their ideas .
many young students are part of inventor 's clubs at their school and professionally introduce their products to trade experts . eleven-year old raphael krauthann from signo invention club " querdenker " -lrb- " lateral thinker " -rrb- presents his idea on how to reach for crutches on the floor with a magnetic device .
he developed his idea when one of his friends was struggling with crutches because they kept falling on the floor .
" it was really annoying , so i said i 'm going to invent something , " explained raphael krauthann .
other kids from the " querdenker " club in ingolstadt also had ideas with great potential .
andreas finkenzeller 's device prevents burning by accident from an electric iron .
the 13-year-old invented a system that stops the electricity flow in an iron if it has not been moved in a certain time period .
and michael stamp , 14 , who had to visit the hospital because fireworks exploded in his hand developed a device that lids the explosive charge in a safe distance by stepping on a handle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : displayed inventions ranged from household appliances to high-tech equipment 20-year-old florian nuber was facing a different kind of problem .
his cat brought dead mice inside his parents ' house , so he grabbed two of his apprenticeship colleges at wodego to find a solution .
florian nuber , christoph seger and sebastian soderer then invented the kitty clap which uses sensors to check the cat 's outlines .
it will only allow the cat to come in if it is not carrying a mouse .
if the cat is transporting a mouse , its figure would be different . antibacterial solutions in times of swine flu and other potential infections , inventions such as spanish inventor juan edilbato rodriguez morales ' automatic hygienic mat come in handy .
first the rotating brush moistened with water and disinfectant cleans the shoe , then the dryer eliminates the remaining water .
this could be used in hospitals , at airports or other places where a lot of people gather to prevent germ spreading .
an antibacterial door handle and antibacterial pens also reduce the chance of infection with germs .
a lot of infections in hospitals are caused by door handles because everyone touches them , said bruno gruber , a professional inventor of 33 years experience .
altogether he has registered 400 patents so far .
the most difficult part , he said , is to find someone who wants to produce and sell a product which starts off as a prototype .
" inventing is easy , marketing is my biggest problem , " said gruber .
problems with patents but inventors are also facing problems with patents .
registering patents can take years , claims gruber .
" it should be accelerated , because it is damaging for the industry .
especially in tough times it is important that new ideas get introduced to the market quickly , but the patent office is understaffed . "
approximately 700 patent examiners are working for the german patent office .
gruber said they need to double the workforce .
the german patent office is currently searching for new patent examiners .
bernd antonius from the german patent office admits they are a little behind with patent applications .
another problem for inventors is the rising annual fee to keep the patent .
if inventors do n't find a company right away , they choose to secure the patent until they can find someone who is willing to produce the product .
otherwise their invention could be used by anyone for free .

mereacre sees to these children .
her organization , funded by donations from abroad , offers sewing and cooking courses for the women .
she said she tries on a small scale to give them a prospect for the future and above all , enable them to live a life with dignity .

" when a woman who comes from complete poverty suddenly lives in a nice hotel , always has a full refrigerator , hot water and nice bedding , that can alter their view for reality , " gorceag said .
in a recent case she treated , she needed two months of convincing to get a woman to see the truth .
but in order to keep women from getting into such a situation in the first place , moldova has to first fight poverty .
this is one of the central challenges for the country 's western-leaning government elected earlier this year .

german sporting goods maker adidas is hoping that the next round of world cup mania , together with changes at its us reebok unit , will help pull sales out of the doldrums . adidas ceo herbert hainer said he is looking to 2010 , when the soccer world cup is to be played in south africa , for a boost in sales .
the company reported a third-quarter revenue drop of 7 percent from a year earlier , as sales in its sports-performance division struggled .
customers were keeping their purse-strings tied as a result of the financial crisis , the company said .
' cautiously optimistic ' despite crisis still , the world 's second-largest sporting goods manufacturer said it was " cautiously optimistic " about 2010 results , with hopes that world cup soccer fever , and a new approach to products at its us reebok unit , would boost sales as early as the current quarter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo hainer will focus on outdoors as well as soccer adidas is betting heavily on world cup , which starts june 11 , to improve its fortunes .
the company expects to outfit 12 of the teams competing for the cup , including germany and spain .
the company , based in herzogenaurach , germany , predicted its soccer products would lead to record sales of more than 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- in 2010 .
" this year , our industry and our group have faced unprecedented challenges , " said hainer said in his third-quarter report , which was released on wednesday .
" however , we have tackled the challenges head on .
we have successfully adapted to our difficult surroundings .
and our drive for operational excellence has meant we have strongly improved our financial position . "
plans to release ' explosion ' of new products as adidas continues to trim costs in the third quarter , hainer says he believes the worst is over for the company - despite ongoing difficult markets in the usa and china : " the mood swings between fear and optimism , " he told reporters in a press conference .
for 2009 , adidas predicted net gains of between 230 and 260 million euros , assuming fourth-quarter improvements tied to the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas unit reebok has been troublesome the company said it will release an " explosion " of new soccer-related products , and it has already begun with a soccer boot designed by former france captain zinedine zidane .
the predator x boot is the 10th version of a series that started in 1994 .
next week adidas will unveil the jersey to be worn by germany 's world cup team .
new focus for outdoor sector further plans for adidas include putting more focus on its outdoor-sporting-goods unit , hainer told online business news source mittelfranken.business.on.
" its true that we have n't focused on that unit in the last 10 years , " hainer said .
" now we are starting to make it a focal point . ... for example , we have renewed our partnership with -lrb- mountain climber -rrb- reinhold messsner , who wore adidas shoes in the himalayas 30 years ago . "

on sunday , chinese premier wen jiabao reflected the close ties between the two pledging $ 10 billion in loans and announcing that tariffs on 95 percent of products from the least-developed african nations would be removed .
china 's foreign minister said on monday that these ties would ultimately help africans " improve their livelihood . "
" china is present in almost every african country , " said denis tull , a researcher with the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" and it 's not just a matter of buying raw materials nor is it part of a grand strategy . "
dominic johnson , africa expert with the berlin-based newspaper tageszeitung told deutsche welle that , " there seems to be a shift away on the chinese side from simply investing in natural resource extraction or buying oil toward investing in african infrastructure . "
a few days ago , china and nigeria signed a contract on building a railway line - a much-needed development as the railway infrastructure in africa 's most populous state dates back to colonial times .
the first ones to benefit from a better transport system in nigeria are the chinese themselves .
chinese companies are keen to develop the nigerian market , as johnson explained : " nigeria has a rapidly growing middle class .
and geographically it is located perfectly to supply the entire west african market .
so it 's a very interesting country for doing business . "
the chinese export mainly basic consumer goods to nigeria - clothes , shoes , but also electronics and motorcycles .
" chinese traders have been very good at settling down in african markets , bringing in lots of goods at low prices and really pushing themselves into the consumer market , " said johnson .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese companies are investing in african infrastructure projects africa has become a busy hub it does n't do any harm that china is an emerging country itself , said johnson , on the contrary : " in fact it strengthens the chinese , because on the political level they can say to the africans : we 're both against the mighty west .
some african leaders feel quite happy about that .
they look at china and say : forty years ago china was as poor as us , look at them now , should n't we be doing the same thing ? "
however , tull only partially agrees with that assessment : " frankly speaking this may contribute to some sympathy , but i do n't think this is substantially influencing the relationship .
i think both sides , the chinese and the african side are very pragmatic in their relationship and i would n't say that there is so much spinning or ideology involved , " he said .
after all the chinese are not the only new players on the african market , as tull explains : " there is an increased presence of other emerging countries like india , like brazil , etc .
this means there is certainly more competition .
africa has become a busy place , politically and economically . "
no room for human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa 's relationship with former colonial powers like germany is still strong it also means that european partners have to share their interests with others , but tull is convinced that africa 's relationship with its former colonial powers will remain a special one : " europe 's relationship with africa has a certain depth , an historical depth , and it certainly has a lot of intensity .
therefore i do n't think that the chinese influence will grow to an extent that there would be no europeans left in africa in 20 years time or so .
the europeans will always have a presence there and will always maintain these networks , contacts and long-standing connections . "
it remains to be seen however how much influence western countries will have in africa in the future .
china presents itself to african states as a partner and not as a donor .
it makes deals without political conditions , but not necessarily without political impact .
johnson says that china tends to support the government of the day , like in sudan : " china is one of the main arm suppliers for the government of sudan .
that has made a difference for the darfur war .
also china stopped the un security council from taking measures against sudan .
so there is certainly political influence there . "
guinea is another example , says tull , " where it has been reported that the government has signed a seven-billion-dollar deal with chinese companies at a time when the new military regime is under immense international pressure over the recent massacre of civilians in the capital of conakry .
that too illustrates that the chinese are really not paying attention at all to human rights . "

increasing parts of the population are leaving in search of a better life .
but many return disillusioned . in soviet times , moldova was thriving .
today , it is one of the poorest countries in europe .
the town of costesti , home to 12,000 people , is in an isolated and bleak region some 35 kilometers south of moldova 's capital chisinau .
the roads are unsurfaced , the homes deserted or run down .
in the local secondary school , 25 soon-to-be graduates are following instructions .
when the teacher asks them who wants to go abroad after they finish school , almost all hands shoot up in the air .
" i want to study and then work abroad if it 's possible , " said 17-year-old docina .
" and i want to travel to other countries , to see how people live there , and learn other languages . "
she said she does n't see any occupational future in her country .
" no , because moldova is a poor country , " docina said .
her classmate christina said she dreams of a career as a designer .
no occupational future these girls do n't know where they 're going to go - maybe to russia , spain , italy or even the united states .
they do n't really know what the work conditions are in those countries .
but they are certain that it must be better than in moldova .
after all , one of their parents is also working abroad .
in most cases , it 's the mothers who earn their money elsewhere .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in costesti face an uncertain future " we telephone regularly and once a year , my mother comes to visit , " many young people report .
they do n't see any future for themselves in their home country .
it 's understandable , considering the current monthly wage of some 140 euros -lrb- $ 206 -rrb- .
also , they all agree that moldova is simply too poor .
the girls said they believe they can only bring forward their country from far away when they emigrate .
these young women are right in their assumption .
migration has developed into a central economic factor for moldova .
last year , emigrants from moldova transferred $ 2 billion to their home country , according to the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- .
this was more than the entire national budget , iom said .
danger of human trafficking one quarter of the country 's four million people has already left moldova .
many children grow up with only one parent .
often , the fathers stay behind , are overtaxed with the situation and drink away their sorrows .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human trafficking is a major problem in moldova single mothers in search of prosperity are particularly easy prey for human traffickers .
though the numbers of victims in the past three years has fallen from 507 to 151 , the problem still exists , said elena mereacre .
the former librarian founded the organization " compasiune " - or " compassion " - in costesti eight years ago .
" we have 12 children here who with their mothers fell into the hands of human traffickers in poland , russia and ukraine , " mereacre said .
" they had to beg on the streets from morning till night and were n't allowed to keep any of the money . "
" when they return here , the children are often emotionally and physically shattered , " mereacre said .
sometimes , women emigrate and then return to their native villages with one or two children - the undesired " by product " of years of prostitution .
the main countries of destination are turkey , russia and saudi arabia .
" they do n't dare to tell their relatives about it because they are ashamed , " mereacre said .
" many relationships end in divorce .
the husbands are mainly concerned with saving face .
they do n't want the entire village to find out that their own family fell victim to human traffickers . "
mereacre sees to these children .
her organization , funded by donations from abroad , offers sewing and cooking courses for the women .
she said she tries on a small scale to give them a prospect for the future and above all , enable them to live a life with dignity .
empathy for human traffickers whether there are in fact less victims of human trafficking is debatable , said martin wintersberger from the eu border assistance mission .
he said he could not rule out a certain glut in this sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gorceag wants to help women find the strength to move forward experts report however that the traffickers themselves have also changed their technique .
though the victims live and work in difficult conditions abroad , they often have more rights than they used to .
they are allowed to send money home and telephone with their relatives .
sometimes , the human trafficker mutates for his victims into an almost nice guy , said lidia gorceag , a psychologist in a counseling center for former sex-trafficking victims .
" when a woman who comes from complete poverty suddenly lives in a nice hotel , always has a full refrigerator , hot water and nice bedding , that can alter their view for reality , " gorceag said .

german sporting goods maker adidas is hoping that the next round of world cup mania , together with changes at its us reebok unit , will help pull sales out of the doldrums . adidas ceo herbert hainer said he is looking to 2010 , when the soccer world cup is to be played in south africa , for a boost in sales .
the company reported a third-quarter revenue drop of 7 percent from a year earlier , as sales in its sports-performance division struggled .
customers were keeping their purse-strings tied as a result of the financial crisis , the company said .
' cautiously optimistic ' despite crisis still , the world 's second-largest sporting goods manufacturer said it was " cautiously optimistic " about 2010 results , with hopes that world cup soccer fever , and a new approach to products at its us reebok unit , would boost sales as early as the current quarter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo hainer will focus on outdoors as well as soccer adidas is betting heavily on world cup , which starts june 11 , to improve its fortunes .
the company expects to outfit 12 of the teams competing for the cup , including germany and spain .
the company , based in herzogenaurach , germany , predicted its soccer products would lead to record sales of more than 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- in 2010 .
" this year , our industry and our group have faced unprecedented challenges , " said hainer said in his third-quarter report , which was released on wednesday .
" however , we have tackled the challenges head on .
we have successfully adapted to our difficult surroundings .
and our drive for operational excellence has meant we have strongly improved our financial position . "
plans to release ' explosion ' of new products as adidas continues to trim costs in the third quarter , hainer says he believes the worst is over for the company - despite ongoing difficult markets in the usa and china : " the mood swings between fear and optimism , " he told reporters in a press conference .
for 2009 , adidas predicted net gains of between 230 and 260 million euros , assuming fourth-quarter improvements tied to the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas unit reebok has been troublesome the company said it will release an " explosion " of new soccer-related products , and it has already begun with a soccer boot designed by former france captain zinedine zidane .

next week adidas will unveil the jersey to be worn by germany 's world cup team .
new focus for outdoor sector further plans for adidas include putting more focus on its outdoor-sporting-goods unit , hainer told online business news source mittelfranken.business.on.
" its true that we have n't focused on that unit in the last 10 years , " hainer said .
" now we are starting to make it a focal point . ... for example , we have renewed our partnership with -lrb- mountain climber -rrb- reinhold messsner , who wore adidas shoes in the himalayas 30 years ago . "

increasing parts of the population are leaving in search of a better life .
but many return disillusioned . in soviet times , moldova was thriving .
today , it is one of the poorest countries in europe .
the town of costesti , home to 12,000 people , is in an isolated and bleak region some 35 kilometers south of moldova 's capital chisinau .
the roads are unsurfaced , the homes deserted or run down .
in the local secondary school , 25 soon-to-be graduates are following instructions .
when the teacher asks them who wants to go abroad after they finish school , almost all hands shoot up in the air .
" i want to study and then work abroad if it 's possible , " said 17-year-old docina .
" and i want to travel to other countries , to see how people live there , and learn other languages . "
she said she does n't see any occupational future in her country .
" no , because moldova is a poor country , " docina said .
her classmate christina said she dreams of a career as a designer .
no occupational future these girls do n't know where they 're going to go - maybe to russia , spain , italy or even the united states .
they do n't really know what the work conditions are in those countries .
but they are certain that it must be better than in moldova .
after all , one of their parents is also working abroad .
in most cases , it 's the mothers who earn their money elsewhere .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in costesti face an uncertain future " we telephone regularly and once a year , my mother comes to visit , " many young people report .
they do n't see any future for themselves in their home country .
it 's understandable , considering the current monthly wage of some 140 euros -lrb- $ 206 -rrb- .
also , they all agree that moldova is simply too poor .
the girls said they believe they can only bring forward their country from far away when they emigrate .
these young women are right in their assumption .
migration has developed into a central economic factor for moldova .
last year , emigrants from moldova transferred $ 2 billion to their home country , according to the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- .
this was more than the entire national budget , iom said .
danger of human trafficking one quarter of the country 's four million people has already left moldova .
many children grow up with only one parent .
often , the fathers stay behind , are overtaxed with the situation and drink away their sorrows .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human trafficking is a major problem in moldova single mothers in search of prosperity are particularly easy prey for human traffickers .
though the numbers of victims in the past three years has fallen from 507 to 151 , the problem still exists , said elena mereacre .
the former librarian founded the organization " compasiune " - or " compassion " - in costesti eight years ago .
" we have 12 children here who with their mothers fell into the hands of human traffickers in poland , russia and ukraine , " mereacre said .
" they had to beg on the streets from morning till night and were n't allowed to keep any of the money . "
" when they return here , the children are often emotionally and physically shattered , " mereacre said .
sometimes , women emigrate and then return to their native villages with one or two children - the undesired " by product " of years of prostitution .
the main countries of destination are turkey , russia and saudi arabia .
" they do n't dare to tell their relatives about it because they are ashamed , " mereacre said .
" many relationships end in divorce .
the husbands are mainly concerned with saving face .
they do n't want the entire village to find out that their own family fell victim to human traffickers . "
mereacre sees to these children .
her organization , funded by donations from abroad , offers sewing and cooking courses for the women .
she said she tries on a small scale to give them a prospect for the future and above all , enable them to live a life with dignity .
empathy for human traffickers whether there are in fact less victims of human trafficking is debatable , said martin wintersberger from the eu border assistance mission .
he said he could not rule out a certain glut in this sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gorceag wants to help women find the strength to move forward experts report however that the traffickers themselves have also changed their technique .
though the victims live and work in difficult conditions abroad , they often have more rights than they used to .
they are allowed to send money home and telephone with their relatives .
sometimes , the human trafficker mutates for his victims into an almost nice guy , said lidia gorceag , a psychologist in a counseling center for former sex-trafficking victims .
" when a woman who comes from complete poverty suddenly lives in a nice hotel , always has a full refrigerator , hot water and nice bedding , that can alter their view for reality , " gorceag said .
in a recent case she treated , she needed two months of convincing to get a woman to see the truth .
but in order to keep women from getting into such a situation in the first place , moldova has to first fight poverty .
this is one of the central challenges for the country 's western-leaning government elected earlier this year .

german sporting goods maker adidas is hoping that the next round of world cup mania , together with changes at its us reebok unit , will help pull sales out of the doldrums . adidas ceo herbert hainer said he is looking to 2010 , when the soccer world cup is to be played in south africa , for a boost in sales .
the company reported a third-quarter revenue drop of 7 percent from a year earlier , as sales in its sports-performance division struggled .
customers were keeping their purse-strings tied as a result of the financial crisis , the company said .
' cautiously optimistic ' despite crisis still , the world 's second-largest sporting goods manufacturer said it was " cautiously optimistic " about 2010 results , with hopes that world cup soccer fever , and a new approach to products at its us reebok unit , would boost sales as early as the current quarter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo hainer will focus on outdoors as well as soccer adidas is betting heavily on world cup , which starts june 11 , to improve its fortunes .
the company expects to outfit 12 of the teams competing for the cup , including germany and spain .
the company , based in herzogenaurach , germany , predicted its soccer products would lead to record sales of more than 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- in 2010 .
" this year , our industry and our group have faced unprecedented challenges , " said hainer said in his third-quarter report , which was released on wednesday .
" however , we have tackled the challenges head on .
we have successfully adapted to our difficult surroundings .
and our drive for operational excellence has meant we have strongly improved our financial position . "
plans to release ' explosion ' of new products as adidas continues to trim costs in the third quarter , hainer says he believes the worst is over for the company - despite ongoing difficult markets in the usa and china : " the mood swings between fear and optimism , " he told reporters in a press conference .
for 2009 , adidas predicted net gains of between 230 and 260 million euros , assuming fourth-quarter improvements tied to the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas unit reebok has been troublesome the company said it will release an " explosion " of new soccer-related products , and it has already begun with a soccer boot designed by former france captain zinedine zidane .
the predator x boot is the 10th version of a series that started in 1994 .
next week adidas will unveil the jersey to be worn by germany 's world cup team .
new focus for outdoor sector further plans for adidas include putting more focus on its outdoor-sporting-goods unit , hainer told online business news source mittelfranken.business.on.
" its true that we have n't focused on that unit in the last 10 years , " hainer said .
" now we are starting to make it a focal point . ... for example , we have renewed our partnership with -lrb- mountain climber -rrb- reinhold messsner , who wore adidas shoes in the himalayas 30 years ago . "
" i strongly believe that adidas will be the athletic outdoor brand of the future , " he added. jen / reuters / dpa editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" you are all part of what is an historic moment for us , " she added . fritz schramma , the former mayor of cologne , who is from chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said that the architecture of the mosque was " a symbol of a budding flower , " inviting people in .
the futuristic design is said to include a large dome and two 55-meter minarets .
the construction of the mosque , which is expected to be completed in two years ' time , is set to begin after a long and acrimonious dispute between ditib and non-muslim residents of the city which is home to the cologne cathedral , one of the most renowned cathedrals in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing prokoeln group held a demonstration against the mosque opponents of the mosque say it will spoil cologne 's skyline , by diverting attention from the gothic cathedral .
right-wing extremists have been particularly vocal in their opposition to the construction of the mosque and staged a small protest on saturday .
the heated debate leading up to the ceremony echoes the tensions that emerged in berlin where a mosque was constructed in recent years .
some analysts say it points to the intensifying conflict between a growing muslim community in the country and across western europe .
in the end , ditib struck a compromise , agreeing not to broadcast the call to prayer in order to avoid friction with the non-muslim residents of the neighborhood .
at the ceremony , thomas kufen , integration commissioner of the state of north rhine-westphalia , described the islamic house of worship as a sign that muslims " had arrived " in the german society .
" this mosque will be a piece of jewelry , " he added .
" it has been a long road , " kufen said , referring to the difficult and prolonged discussions over the construction of the mosque .
" it gave rise to hostility and hurt . "

" we ca n't have our soldiers hampered by legal doubts , especially when they are forced to make decisions under extreme time pressure , " guttenberg said .
guttenberg 's comments came after he voiced his support of a controversial airstrike ordered by a german commander in afghanistan in september .
guttenberg backed the decision of colonel georg klein to launch an air attack on two fuel tankers that had been hijacked by taliban militants near a german military base in northern afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's zu guttenberg backs the controversial airstrike according to a nato report , up to 142 people , including several civilians that had gathered around the tankers to siphon fuel after they had stalled , were killed in the strike .
guttenberg acknowledged that civilians were killed in the attack and also that " some procedural errors " were committed .
nonetheless , he put his full support behind colonel klein 's decision , calling it " militarily appropriate . "
criticism from opposition several german politicians have openly disagreed with guttenberg 's backing of the airstrike .
social democrat defense expert rainer arnold told the berlin daily tagesspiegel that guttenberg 's evaluation was " illegitimate and unreasonable . "
" if -lsb- guttenberg -rsb- believes that dropping bombs in afghanistan on large masses of people is alright , then the social democrats can no longer go along with him . "
the defense expert of the green party , omri nouripour , found guttenberg 's justification of the airstrike peculiar , especially considering that guttenberg admitted that mistakes were made .
" this issue should n't be treated as a mere bagatelle . that would make it look like the defense ministry pays no attention to the rules , " nouripour said .
bigger issue at hand the debates caused by the september airstrike have brought up the more large-scale question of whether germany is technically at war in afghanistan .
a court in the eastern state of saxony has passed the klein case on to germany 's top federal prosecution office , which will examine whether it is a matter for international law or german law .
for this to be determined the federal prosecutor must establish whether germany 's participation in the nato isaf mission constitutes an " armed conflict . "
the head of the german military alliance , colonel ulrich kirsch , told the mass-circulated bild zeitung that the german operation in afghanistan constituted war .
bildunterschrift : civilans and militants were among those killed in the airstrike , says nato " the justice ministry has stated explicitly what we are dealing with in afghanistan : a non-international armed conflict .
this is a war . "
former bundeswehr general harald kujat went further , warning of " catastrophic consequences " should germany pursue its investigations of the airstrike and impose penalties on colonel klein .
" every soldier and officer would think twice about assuming any responsibility under such conditions , " he told the daily frankfurter rundschau .
under german constitution , it is illegal for the country to enter a war , except for purposes of defense .
over sixty years following the nazi era , germans remain highly skeptical of military operations .
it was only a decade ago that german troops participated in their first foreign combat mission since the end of wwii .
opinion polls show a majority of germans oppose the engagement in afghanistan and want the over 4,000 troops there to come home. glb / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bayern grabbed the lead on 31 minutes when defender holger badstuber sent a free kick into the box and van buyten was at hand to tap in after schalke 's kevin kuranyi accidentally headed the ball into the belgian 's path .
the balance was restored just before the break when lukas schmitz floated a free kick into the box and matip , until recently in schalke 's under-19 team , rose above bayern defenders to head home .
the result leaves munich stranded in eighth place with 20 points while schalke are fourth with 22 points .
bayer leverkusen leads the way with 26 points from a 4-0 demolition of eintracht frankfurt on friday .
werder bremen and sv hamburg are on 22 like schalke , ahead of their sunday games against borussia dortmund and in hannover 96 , respectively .

some people are facing waiting periods of weeks before vaccination will be available . only two weeks after beginning a national vaccination campaign against h1n1 , the intial skepticism over the vaccine has apparently vanished in germany .
the rise in cases and deaths within europe is thought to be the reason for an apparent swing in public opinion about the dangers posed by swine flu .
in september a study found that 62 percent of germans polled would not get vaccinated .
now , due to high demand and supply shortages there are waiting lists to receive the swine flu vaccine .
in some parts of germany , those wating for vaccinations are facing a delay of several weeks .
the rhineland-palatinate ministry of health reported part of the reason for the wait is that that less vaccine was produced than expected .
they cited production shortfalls with the manufacturer .
the baden-wuerttemberg ministry of social affairs complained of " a lack of management " that led to the shortage of vaccine .
can it be too perfect ?
according to the managing director of pharmacists for schleswig-holstein frank jaschkowski , the problem with the vaccine shortage lay with the stringent quality control standards .
" the quality standards for the vaccine are extremely high , " jaschkowski said .
" so it would n't be released unless it was absolutely flawless . "
all across the country , health officials are reporting a significant increase in those seeking swine flu vaccinations .
federal health minister philipp roesler told the german daily bild on saturday that he wanted to assess the swine flu situation at a health ministers ' conference on wednesday .
" along with my colleagues from the various states ' health ministries , i would like to compare notes about where potential weaknesses in the national vaccination supply scheme may exist , " roesler said. sjt / ap / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on sunday , chinese premier wen jiabao reflected the close ties between the two pledging $ 10 billion in loans and announcing that tariffs on 95 percent of products from the least-developed african nations would be removed .
china 's foreign minister said on monday that these ties would ultimately help africans " improve their livelihood . "
" china is present in almost every african country , " said denis tull , a researcher with the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" and it 's not just a matter of buying raw materials nor is it part of a grand strategy . "
dominic johnson , africa expert with the berlin-based newspaper tageszeitung told deutsche welle that , " there seems to be a shift away on the chinese side from simply investing in natural resource extraction or buying oil toward investing in african infrastructure . "
a few days ago , china and nigeria signed a contract on building a railway line - a much-needed development as the railway infrastructure in africa 's most populous state dates back to colonial times .
the first ones to benefit from a better transport system in nigeria are the chinese themselves .
chinese companies are keen to develop the nigerian market , as johnson explained : " nigeria has a rapidly growing middle class .
and geographically it is located perfectly to supply the entire west african market .
so it 's a very interesting country for doing business . "
the chinese export mainly basic consumer goods to nigeria - clothes , shoes , but also electronics and motorcycles .
" chinese traders have been very good at settling down in african markets , bringing in lots of goods at low prices and really pushing themselves into the consumer market , " said johnson .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese companies are investing in african infrastructure projects africa has become a busy hub it does n't do any harm that china is an emerging country itself , said johnson , on the contrary : " in fact it strengthens the chinese , because on the political level they can say to the africans : we 're both against the mighty west .
some african leaders feel quite happy about that .
they look at china and say : forty years ago china was as poor as us , look at them now , should n't we be doing the same thing ? "
however , tull only partially agrees with that assessment : " frankly speaking this may contribute to some sympathy , but i do n't think this is substantially influencing the relationship .
i think both sides , the chinese and the african side are very pragmatic in their relationship and i would n't say that there is so much spinning or ideology involved , " he said .
after all the chinese are not the only new players on the african market , as tull explains : " there is an increased presence of other emerging countries like india , like brazil , etc .
this means there is certainly more competition .
africa has become a busy place , politically and economically . "
no room for human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa 's relationship with former colonial powers like germany is still strong it also means that european partners have to share their interests with others , but tull is convinced that africa 's relationship with its former colonial powers will remain a special one : " europe 's relationship with africa has a certain depth , an historical depth , and it certainly has a lot of intensity .
therefore i do n't think that the chinese influence will grow to an extent that there would be no europeans left in africa in 20 years time or so .
the europeans will always have a presence there and will always maintain these networks , contacts and long-standing connections . "
it remains to be seen however how much influence western countries will have in africa in the future .
china presents itself to african states as a partner and not as a donor .
it makes deals without political conditions , but not necessarily without political impact .
johnson says that china tends to support the government of the day , like in sudan : " china is one of the main arm suppliers for the government of sudan .
that has made a difference for the darfur war .
also china stopped the un security council from taking measures against sudan .
so there is certainly political influence there . "
guinea is another example , says tull , " where it has been reported that the government has signed a seven-billion-dollar deal with chinese companies at a time when the new military regime is under immense international pressure over the recent massacre of civilians in the capital of conakry .
that too illustrates that the chinese are really not paying attention at all to human rights . "

in his weekly address , he says that although the shootings showed the " worst of human nature " they had also brought out " the best of america " .
maj nidal malik hasan , a us-born muslim , opened fire at fort hood on thursday , killing 13 people .
the 39-year-old army psychiatrist was shot four times and remains in a coma .
about 30 people were also hurt in the attack , with some still carrying life-threatening injuries .
hundreds of people gathered in a stadium at the fort hood base on friday night for a candlelit vigil .
' selflessness ' mr obama said the shooting was " one of the most devastating ever committed on an american military base " .
analysis adam brookes washington military officers have long expressed concern over the state of psychiatric medicine in the us armed forces .
officers say privately that thousands of young men and women are returning from afghanistan and iraq with psychological problems .
post-traumatic stress disorder can result in debilitating symptoms , ranging from anxiety to depression .
earlier this year , the pentagon committed $ 50m to a study designed to investigate why suicide rates in the military are rising .
officers are overwhelmed by the number of soldiers requiring treatment and they say there 's been pressure to retain psychiatrists inside the military system .
it is quite possible that if and when maj hasan goes on trial for these shootings , military medicine will be on trial , too .
but he added : " we saw soldiers and civilians alike rushing to aid fallen comrades ; tearing off bullet-riddled clothes to treat the injured ; using blouses as tourniquets ; taking down the shooter even as they bore wounds themselves .
mr obama added : " we can not fully know what leads a man to do such a thing .
but what we do know is that our thoughts are with every single one of the men and women who were injured at fort hood . "
amid fears of a possible anti-muslim backlash after the attack , mr obama stressed the multinational diversity in the us armed forces .
" they are americans of every race , faith , and station .
they are christians and muslims , jews and hindus and nonbelievers .
they are descendents of immigrants and immigrants themselves .
they reflect the diversity that makes this america . "
memorial japan 's foreign ministry says mr obama has delayed his visit to the country by a day and will now arrive on friday 13 november .
it is thought the delay is to allow mr obama to attend a memorial service for those killed .
although the details of the memorial have not been finalised , white house spokesman robert gibbs said the timing would not be dictated by the president 's schedule .
major nidal malik hasan born in us to palestinian parents joined the army and trained to be a psychiatrist treated soldiers returning from combat zones described as a devout muslim said to have been unhappy about imminent overseas deployment shock and insecurity at fort hood mardell : no clear motive profile : major nidal malik hasan us media on fort hood shootings fears for muslims in us army investigators are waiting for maj hasan to emerge from his coma but have examined his home and computer records to try to find any clue to the motive of his attack .
reports suggested that he had been increasingly unhappy in the military and that his work at his previous post - walter reed army medical center in washington dc - had been the subject of concern .
his cousin told us media that maj hasan had been opposed to an imminent deployment overseas , describing it as his " worst nightmare " .
he also said that maj hasan had been battling racial harassment because of his " middle eastern ethnicity . "
the manager of his apartment complex told associated press news agency that maj hasan 's car had been badly scratched recently by an army employee who had returned from iraq and objected to maj hasan 's faith .
ap also quoted a former classmate on a maryland university course as saying that maj hasan was a " vociferous opponent " of america fighting conflicts in muslim countries .
maj hasan 's relatives have said they deplore his actions .
cousin nader hasan said : " we are mortified with what has unfolded and there is no justification , whatsoever , for what happened .
" we are all asking why this happened , and the answer is that we simply do not know . "
' privately owned ' the attack began at about 1330 -lrb- 1930 gmt -rrb- on thursday at a personnel and medical centre at fort hood - the largest us military base in the world , home to about 40,000 troops .
shootings at fort hood dealing with stress in the us military timeline : fort hood shootings reaction : us base shootings in pictures : fort hood shootings the commander of the base , lt gen robert cone , told nbc news that , according to eyewitnesses , mr hasan had shouted the arabic phrase " allahu akbar ! "
-lsb- god is great -rsb- before opening fire .
deputy commander at fort hood , col john rossi , later said that more than 100 rounds were fired during the attack .
col rossi also confirmed earlier reports that the two handguns carried by maj hasan were not military arms , but " privately owned weapons " .
he said that the suspect - who had been on a ventilator in a civilian hospital - was transferred on friday by helicopter to the brooke army medical center in san antonio , texas .
there have been no updates on maj hasan 's condition but the army has confirmed he is " unable to converse " .

luis moreno ocampo said two or three cases could come to trial by july next year .
mr ocampo said " speed " was important so kenya could hold its next election in 2012 without the threat of violence .
on thursday , mr ocampo formally requested judges at the hague to open an investigation into the violence .
" everyone is worried about the next election in kenya in 2012 .
that is why i understand the importance of speed , " mr ocampo told reporters in nairobi as he ended a three-day visit .
he indicated that any trials could take place in kenya , or at least in arusha - in tanzania - where suspects involved in the 1994 rwanda genocide have been prosecuted .
after meeting with the chief prosecutor earlier in the week , kenya 's government said it would co-operate with an icc probe .
prominent kenyan politicians , including cabinet ministers , are suspected of being behind the violence .

a power-sharing deal in 2008 - brokered by former un head kofi annan - agreed that a local tribunal would be set up to prosecute those behind the violence .

the 22-year-old son of uup councillor bob stoker is receiving treatment there for the third time since being badly injured while serving with the queen 's royal hussars in afghanistan .
michael suffered a broken pelvis and severe burns to almost a third of his body when a roadside bomb exploded under his vehicle in helmand province last may .
" i ca n't actually remember much about the day of the attack , " he said .
" i can only remember stopping up at a place short of where we were going and that 's about it .
" we were going to shut a camp down .
what i 've been told from other guys was we were driving down the road and unexpectedly , bang , we just went up .
" all i remember is being inside the vehicle and seeing the hot oil burning me and shouting for my mates to get me out .
" they were trying to calm me down and saying they were going to flip the vehicle over and get me out .
" i do get small things coming back , but they 're not in great detail , still really fuzzy .
i have been told that through time , it will come back to me . "
after the attack , michael was airlifted to camp bastion before being moved on to selly oak hospital in birmingham . "
i was just so used to seeing guys getting hurt and losing their legs . "
" when i came round i was confused because one minute i was in afghanistan and the next thing my family are standing around me .
" that 's when i was was told what my injuries were .
" it was really shock , thinking , ' how 's this all happened ? '
because you never expect that it 's going to happen to you .
" it is quite unnerving , it truly is .
" the vehicles we were in , it was always the thing that if you drove over a bomb you were losing your legs , but obviously because it had been modified and people were walking away from the vehicles unscathed .
" i was just so used to seeing guys getting hurt and losing their legs . "
camaraderie after weeks of major surgery and skin grafts at selly oak , michael arrived at headley court where he began on the long road to making a full recovery .
" being in selly oak , you 've got a brilliant support system .
you can all sit and joke about your injuries , obviously you are all going out at nights , going on trips .
" a lot of the guys do make a hell of a recovery even though they 've been really badly hurt .
it 's just one of those things , you just have to get on with it . "
despite sustaining such severe injuries and his father saying that he does not support the war in either iraq or afghanistan , michael said he believes the army is making a difference .
" a lot of the time going through the villages , people would come out and tell us where the ieds -lrb- improvised explosive devices -rrb- are , as long as there 's no taliban sitting watching them , " he said .
" they know helping us is better in the long run than helping the taliban because now they have a lot more freedom to do things that they could n't do with the taliban in control , so it is quite important that we do stay and we do our job properly .
" there are times when you are there when you get really low and you miss home and you think , ' why am i here ? '
" but when you do see small things changing for the good , it does make you proud that you are there and what you are doing , you are happy to be there for what 's happening . "
the speed of michael 's recovery has been driven by his desire to get back with his regiment after christmas .
" that 's been my aim all along - get fully fit and get redeployed out to afghanistan .
" it 's quite easy to say , ' i 've been hurt , i do n't want to go back there , i do n't want to get hurt any more ' .
but there are guys there who have no choice in the matter .
" they have n't got hurt , they 're still going out there , you really just do it for your mates , you just go back and carry on with your job .
" i 've loved my entire time in the army , this is just a small thing that comes with the job , and i will return back to work , fully fit .
" hopefully , i will spend the rest of my career in the job that i 'm doing and i love . "
the full interview with michael stoker can be seen on the politics show on bbc1 northern ireland on 8 november at 1215 gmt .

soldier michael stoker spoke to the politics show 's yvette shapiro the defence medical rehabilitation centre at headley court in london is by now familiar territory to michael stoker .
the 22-year-old son of uup councillor bob stoker is receiving treatment there for the third time since being badly injured while serving with the queen 's royal hussars in afghanistan .
michael suffered a broken pelvis and severe burns to almost a third of his body when a roadside bomb exploded under his vehicle in helmand province last may .
" i ca n't actually remember much about the day of the attack , " he said .
" i can only remember stopping up at a place short of where we were going and that 's about it .
" we were going to shut a camp down .
what i 've been told from other guys was we were driving down the road and unexpectedly , bang , we just went up .
" all i remember is being inside the vehicle and seeing the hot oil burning me and shouting for my mates to get me out .
" they were trying to calm me down and saying they were going to flip the vehicle over and get me out .
" i do get small things coming back , but they 're not in great detail , still really fuzzy .
i have been told that through time , it will come back to me . "
after the attack , michael was airlifted to camp bastion before being moved on to selly oak hospital in birmingham .
i was just so used to seeing guys getting hurt and losing their legs .
" when i came round i was confused because one minute i was in afghanistan and the next thing my family are standing around me .
" that 's when i was was told what my injuries were .
" it was really shock , thinking , ' how 's this all happened ? '
because you never expect that it 's going to happen to you .
" it is quite unnerving , it truly is .
" the vehicles we were in , it was always the thing that if you drove over a bomb you were losing your legs , but obviously because it had been modified and people were walking away from the vehicles unscathed .
" i was just so used to seeing guys getting hurt and losing their legs . "
camaraderie after weeks of major surgery and skin grafts at selly oak , michael arrived at headley court where he began on the long road to making a full recovery .
" being in selly oak , you 've got a brilliant support system .
you can all sit and joke about your injuries , obviously you are all going out at nights , going on trips .
" a lot of the guys do make a hell of a recovery even though they 've been really badly hurt .
it 's just one of those things , you just have to get on with it . "
despite sustaining such severe injuries and his father saying that he does not support the war in either iraq or afghanistan , michael said he believes the army is making a difference .
" a lot of the time going through the villages , people would come out and tell us where the ieds -lrb- improvised explosive devices -rrb- are , as long as there 's no taliban sitting watching them , " he said .
michael said he believes the army is making a difference in afghanistan " they know helping us is better in the long run than helping the taliban because now they have a lot more freedom to do things that they could n't do with the taliban in control , so it is quite important that we do stay and we do our job properly .
" there are times when you are there when you get really low and you miss home and you think , ' why am i here ? '
" but when you do see small things changing for the good , it does make you proud that you are there and what you are doing , you are happy to be there for what 's happening . "
the speed of michael 's recovery has been driven by his desire to get back with his regiment after christmas .

soldier michael stoker spoke to the politics show 's yvette shapiro the defence medical rehabilitation centre at headley court in london is by now familiar territory to michael stoker .
the 22-year-old son of uup councillor bob stoker is receiving treatment there for the third time since being badly injured while serving with the queen 's royal hussars in afghanistan .
michael suffered a broken pelvis and severe burns to almost a third of his body when a roadside bomb exploded under his vehicle in helmand province last may .
" i ca n't actually remember much about the day of the attack , " he said .
" i can only remember stopping up at a place short of where we were going and that 's about it .
" we were going to shut a camp down .
what i 've been told from other guys was we were driving down the road and unexpectedly , bang , we just went up .
" all i remember is being inside the vehicle and seeing the hot oil burning me and shouting for my mates to get me out .
" they were trying to calm me down and saying they were going to flip the vehicle over and get me out .
" i do get small things coming back , but they 're not in great detail , still really fuzzy .
i have been told that through time , it will come back to me . "
after the attack , michael was airlifted to camp bastion before being moved on to selly oak hospital in birmingham .
i was just so used to seeing guys getting hurt and losing their legs .
" when i came round i was confused because one minute i was in afghanistan and the next thing my family are standing around me .
" that 's when i was was told what my injuries were .
" it was really shock , thinking , ' how 's this all happened ? '
because you never expect that it 's going to happen to you .
" it is quite unnerving , it truly is .
" the vehicles we were in , it was always the thing that if you drove over a bomb you were losing your legs , but obviously because it had been modified and people were walking away from the vehicles unscathed .
" i was just so used to seeing guys getting hurt and losing their legs . "
camaraderie after weeks of major surgery and skin grafts at selly oak , michael arrived at headley court where he began on the long road to making a full recovery .
" being in selly oak , you 've got a brilliant support system .
you can all sit and joke about your injuries , obviously you are all going out at nights , going on trips .
" a lot of the guys do make a hell of a recovery even though they 've been really badly hurt .
it 's just one of those things , you just have to get on with it . "
despite sustaining such severe injuries and his father saying that he does not support the war in either iraq or afghanistan , michael said he believes the army is making a difference .
" a lot of the time going through the villages , people would come out and tell us where the ieds -lrb- improvised explosive devices -rrb- are , as long as there 's no taliban sitting watching them , " he said .
michael said he believes the army is making a difference in afghanistan " they know helping us is better in the long run than helping the taliban because now they have a lot more freedom to do things that they could n't do with the taliban in control , so it is quite important that we do stay and we do our job properly .
" there are times when you are there when you get really low and you miss home and you think , ' why am i here ? '
" but when you do see small things changing for the good , it does make you proud that you are there and what you are doing , you are happy to be there for what 's happening . "
the speed of michael 's recovery has been driven by his desire to get back with his regiment after christmas .
" that 's been my aim all along - get fully fit and get redeployed out to afghanistan .
" it 's quite easy to say , ' i 've been hurt , i do n't want to go back there , i do n't want to get hurt any more ' .
but there are guys there who have no choice in the matter .
" they have n't got hurt , they 're still going out there , you really just do it for your mates , you just go back and carry on with your job .
" i 've loved my entire time in the army , this is just a small thing that comes with the job , and i will return back to work , fully fit .
" hopefully , i will spend the rest of my career in the job that i 'm doing and i love . "
the full interview with michael stoker can be seen on the politics show on bbc1 northern ireland on 8 november at 1215 gmt .
