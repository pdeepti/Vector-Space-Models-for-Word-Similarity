but russia expert susan stewart says major hurdles remain . the two-day summit , which began late on thursday in the eastern russian city of khabarovsk , sees eu president vaclav klaus , eu commission president jose manuel barroso and the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana sit down with russian president dmitry medvedev and several cabinet ministers . high on the agenda is the ongoing global economic decline , which has hit both the eu and russia extremely hard . the euro-zone economies contracted by 2.5 percent in the first three months of 2009 , and the world bank forecasts that the russian economy will shrink by 4.5 percent this year - which means in theory the two sides should have plenty of common interests on this issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kremlin is preoccupied with domestic issues but theory is n't necessarily translating into practice . " the economic crisis has been seen by some here in the eu as a chance for intensifying relations with russia but so far that chance has n't materialized , " explained susan stewart , a research fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" that 's because russia has been very concerned with domestic affairs during the crisis . " and mistrust remains . " russian foreign minister -lsb- sergei -rsb- lavrov has recently criticized the eu for taking measures seen as protectionist , including anti-dumping policies , quotas on steel and nuclear materials and agricultural subsidies , " stewart said . energy supplies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spat with ukraine stopped the flow of gas last winter russia and eu leaders are also focusing on the politics of energy - in particular how to avoid future disruptions to natural gas deliveries due to quarrels between russia and its neighbors . last winter , a disagreement between russia and ukraine over prices left some eastern eu member states without gas .
moscow accused kyiv of blocking pipelines leading from russia to the eu via ukraine , while kyiv maintained that the kremlin was responsible for the disruptions . eu leaders hope that future disputes can be resolved without leaving people out in the cold , but the omens are n't all positive . " there 's a certain tension in the air because the eu and ukraine recently reached an agreement on modernization of gas-transit structures in ukraine , and russia would have preferred strongly to have been involved in that , " stewart said . indeed , russia is expected to raise complaints of its own regarding the international transfer of energy within europe . " this is an attempt to restart dialogue about the four or five points in the current signed but never ratified energy charter treaty with the eu that russia feels do n't take the interests of producer countries into sufficient account , " stewart added . caucasus conundrum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : true peace in the caucasus is a long way off one issue on which the eu and russia definitely do not see eye-to-eye is the caucasus .
the eu condemned moscow 's military intervention in the region against georgia last summer , while the kremlin has viewed the bloc 's eastern expansion with continual unease . and the prospects for the summit are n't exactly boosted by the fact that earlier in the week russia briefly walked out of talks in geneva aimed at resolving the conflict between georgia over the two breakaway provinces abkhazia and south ossetia . " the caucasus is the most difficult issue , " stewart confirmed .
" in the best-case scenario , we would have a russian willingness to go forward with the geneva talks with some thinking about how to achieve more genuine stability in the region , " stewart told deutsche welle . but russia is also concerned with wider security issues - in particular a somewhat vague proposal made by medvedev in berlin last year that russia and eu work toward a new overarching security framework . " there have been a lot of requests from the eu to the russian side to make their ideas more concrete and their goals more explicit , " stewart said .
" at first the russians were frustrated by a lack of response from europe , but now that the eu appears willing to talk , the russians have decided to make it one of the summit topics .

in reports published separately on thursday by zdf public television network and the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- newspaper and based on the historians ' findings , kurras had been in the service of the stasi secret police since 1955 and had been charged with spying on the west berlin police .
documents change a chapter in german history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters in munich in 1967 carrying a banner reading " benno ohnesorg - political murder " the documents found in the archives of the birthler agency - the authority which manages files from the former east germany - also contained a message radioed to kurras by the mfs after the fatal shooting of ohnesorg , which read : " destroy all material .
cease work for now .
view events as very regrettable accident . "
ohnesorg was shot to death in west berlin on june 2 , 1967 during a student protest against the shah of iran , who was visiting germany at the time .
his death triggered widespread and violent student protests across west germany and helped fuel sympathies for the militant red army faction and its up-and-coming first generation leaders , andreas baader , ulrike meinhof and gudrun ensslin .
espionage expert mueller-enbergs , told zdf that there were no clues in the stasi files that kurras had been explicitly told to liquidate ohnesorg .
after the shooting , kurras was tried for reckless manslaughter but acquitted due to a lack of evidence .

but russia expert susan stewart says major hurdles remain . the two-day summit , which began late on thursday in the eastern russian city of khabarovsk , sees eu president vaclav klaus , eu commission president jose manuel barroso and the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana sit down with russian president dmitry medvedev and several cabinet ministers . high on the agenda is the ongoing global economic decline , which has hit both the eu and russia extremely hard . the euro-zone economies contracted by 2.5 percent in the first three months of 2009 , and the world bank forecasts that the russian economy will shrink by 4.5 percent this year - which means in theory the two sides should have plenty of common interests on this issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kremlin is preoccupied with domestic issues but theory is n't necessarily translating into practice . " the economic crisis has been seen by some here in the eu as a chance for intensifying relations with russia but so far that chance has n't materialized , " explained susan stewart , a research fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" that 's because russia has been very concerned with domestic affairs during the crisis . " and mistrust remains . " russian foreign minister -lsb- sergei -rsb- lavrov has recently criticized the eu for taking measures seen as protectionist , including anti-dumping policies , quotas on steel and nuclear materials and agricultural subsidies , " stewart said . energy supplies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spat with ukraine stopped the flow of gas last winter russia and eu leaders are also focusing on the politics of energy - in particular how to avoid future disruptions to natural gas deliveries due to quarrels between russia and its neighbors . last winter , a disagreement between russia and ukraine over prices left some eastern eu member states without gas .
moscow accused kyiv of blocking pipelines leading from russia to the eu via ukraine , while kyiv maintained that the kremlin was responsible for the disruptions . eu leaders hope that future disputes can be resolved without leaving people out in the cold , but the omens are n't all positive . " there 's a certain tension in the air because the eu and ukraine recently reached an agreement on modernization of gas-transit structures in ukraine , and russia would have preferred strongly to have been involved in that , " stewart said . indeed , russia is expected to raise complaints of its own regarding the international transfer of energy within europe . " this is an attempt to restart dialogue about the four or five points in the current signed but never ratified energy charter treaty with the eu that russia feels do n't take the interests of producer countries into sufficient account , " stewart added . caucasus conundrum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : true peace in the caucasus is a long way off one issue on which the eu and russia definitely do not see eye-to-eye is the caucasus .
the eu condemned moscow 's military intervention in the region against georgia last summer , while the kremlin has viewed the bloc 's eastern expansion with continual unease . and the prospects for the summit are n't exactly boosted by the fact that earlier in the week russia briefly walked out of talks in geneva aimed at resolving the conflict between georgia over the two breakaway provinces abkhazia and south ossetia . " the caucasus is the most difficult issue , " stewart confirmed .
" in the best-case scenario , we would have a russian willingness to go forward with the geneva talks with some thinking about how to achieve more genuine stability in the region , " stewart told deutsche welle . but russia is also concerned with wider security issues - in particular a somewhat vague proposal made by medvedev in berlin last year that russia and eu work toward a new overarching security framework . " there have been a lot of requests from the eu to the russian side to make their ideas more concrete and their goals more explicit , " stewart said .
" at first the russians were frustrated by a lack of response from europe , but now that the eu appears willing to talk , the russians have decided to make it one of the summit topics . " ideally , stewart thinks , the meeting in khabarovsk could be an opportunity for the two sides to rebuild trust after the significant disagreements of recent years .

those numbers have placed a huge burden on already crowded camps housing thousands of displaced ethnic tamils , aid groups working on the ground say .
andreas lindner , head of the red cross delegation that visited sri lanka , told german news agency dpa the crisis was one of the most " complicated and dramatic worldwide . "
" prisons under the open sky " lindner said many of the refugees were suffering from dehydration and undernourishment , some had gunshot wounds or other injuries and there were thousands of cases of hepatitis a and chicken pox .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid groups say outbreaks of illnesses and a lack of food and water have made life unbearable in refugee camps typhoid too had broken out in some pockets , he said , adding that the last time he witnessed a comparable situation was after the genocide in ruanda in 1994 .
lindner criticized the supply of food to the camps , saying the distribution of drinking water was hugely insufficient .
he also said the government was restricting access to the camps by aid agencies .
aid group caritas internationalis has slammed the government in colombo for failing to improve conditions in the camps .
caritas said the sri lankan military was patrolling camps in the vavuniya region in the northeast of the country and refugees were not allowed to leave or have any contact with the outside world .
its aid workers on the ground had described the camps as " prisons under the open sky , " the group said .
calls for political solution the criticism comes amid fierce international condemnation of colombo 's handling of the crisis .
heavy fighting broke out between government troops and tamil tigers in the last rebel stronghold in the northeast in the past months .
thousands of civilians were reportedly caught in the crossfire .
earlier this week , the european union called for an independent inquiry into alleged human rights abuses by both sides .
the rebels started fighting in the 1970s for a separate state – eelam – for tamils in sri lanka 's north and east , complaining that tamils had been discriminated against by successive majority sinhalese governments .

the german government this week urged colombo to step up efforts to initiate a process of reconciliation with the tamil minority .
development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the government in sri lanka needed to do everything it could to heal the divisions in society and give the tamil population a chance to participate in the political process .
thadshayani sadagopan , a tamil student in bonn who has lived in germany for over 15 years , told deutsche welle that now more than ever , it was necessary to bring the two ethnic groups in sri lanka to the negotiating table .
" the real war only begins now , " sadagopan said , warning that the tamil tiger rebels may have laid down their weapons for now but " maybe in a year or two they could take up arms again " if real peace was not achieved .
" the two groups hate each other so much .
they ca n't really live with each other , " she said .

those numbers have placed a huge burden on already crowded camps housing thousands of displaced ethnic tamils , aid groups working on the ground say .
andreas lindner , head of the red cross delegation that visited sri lanka , told german news agency dpa the crisis was one of the most " complicated and dramatic worldwide . "
" prisons under the open sky " lindner said many of the refugees were suffering from dehydration and undernourishment , some had gunshot wounds or other injuries and there were thousands of cases of hepatitis a and chicken pox .

lindner criticized the supply of food to the camps , saying the distribution of drinking water was hugely insufficient .
he also said the government was restricting access to the camps by aid agencies .
aid group caritas internationalis has slammed the government in colombo for failing to improve conditions in the camps .
caritas said the sri lankan military was patrolling camps in the vavuniya region in the northeast of the country and refugees were not allowed to leave or have any contact with the outside world .
its aid workers on the ground had described the camps as " prisons under the open sky , " the group said .

those numbers have placed a huge burden on already crowded camps housing thousands of displaced ethnic tamils , aid groups working on the ground say .
andreas lindner , head of the red cross delegation that visited sri lanka , told german news agency dpa the crisis was one of the most " complicated and dramatic worldwide . "
" prisons under the open sky " lindner said many of the refugees were suffering from dehydration and undernourishment , some had gunshot wounds or other injuries and there were thousands of cases of hepatitis a and chicken pox .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid groups say outbreaks of illnesses and a lack of food and water have made life unbearable in refugee camps typhoid too had broken out in some pockets , he said , adding that the last time he witnessed a comparable situation was after the genocide in ruanda in 1994 .
lindner criticized the supply of food to the camps , saying the distribution of drinking water was hugely insufficient .
he also said the government was restricting access to the camps by aid agencies .
aid group caritas internationalis has slammed the government in colombo for failing to improve conditions in the camps .
caritas said the sri lankan military was patrolling camps in the vavuniya region in the northeast of the country and refugees were not allowed to leave or have any contact with the outside world .
its aid workers on the ground had described the camps as " prisons under the open sky , " the group said .
calls for political solution the criticism comes amid fierce international condemnation of colombo 's handling of the crisis .
heavy fighting broke out between government troops and tamil tigers in the last rebel stronghold in the northeast in the past months .
thousands of civilians were reportedly caught in the crossfire .
earlier this week , the european union called for an independent inquiry into alleged human rights abuses by both sides .
the rebels started fighting in the 1970s for a separate state – eelam – for tamils in sri lanka 's north and east , complaining that tamils had been discriminated against by successive majority sinhalese governments .
the conflict has killed an estimated 80,000 people , displaced tens of thousands more and put a brake on the island 's growth and economic development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sri lankans in colombo celebrating news of the end of the civil war this week calls are growing louder for a long-term political solution to the conflict in sri lanka and one that takes into account tamil aspirations .
the german government this week urged colombo to step up efforts to initiate a process of reconciliation with the tamil minority .
development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the government in sri lanka needed to do everything it could to heal the divisions in society and give the tamil population a chance to participate in the political process .
thadshayani sadagopan , a tamil student in bonn who has lived in germany for over 15 years , told deutsche welle that now more than ever , it was necessary to bring the two ethnic groups in sri lanka to the negotiating table .
" the real war only begins now , " sadagopan said , warning that the tamil tiger rebels may have laid down their weapons for now but " maybe in a year or two they could take up arms again " if real peace was not achieved .
" the two groups hate each other so much .
they ca n't really live with each other , " she said .
but on thursday , sri lanka 's reconciliation minister , vinayagamoorthi muralitharan , a former rebel commander who was known as col karuna , said elections would be held in areas affected by recent fighting once displaced people have been resettled .
he also promised the polls would address the grievances of the tamil minority. sp / dpa / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court said mills had given false testimony to protect berlusconi and his fininvest holding group .
mills was convicted of taking a 440,000 euro -lrb- $ 600,000 -rrb- bribe in 1998 in exchange for withholding incriminating details about berlusconi 's business dealings .
berlusconi was not prime minister at the time .
the prime minister said he believes the release was deliberately timed to damage his party ahead of european elections in early june .
" with two weeks to go before the elections , the prime minister is the subject of a well-timed political attack , " government spokesman paolo bonaiuti said on a television show .
although berlusconi is immune to prosecution as long as he is prime minister , due to a law he championed last year , some have called for his resignation .
berlusconi has repeatedly accused milan 's " red judges " of having it in for him , after fighting charges of tax fraud , false accounting and illegally financing political parties .
none of the charges have ever stuck .
berlusconi said he would address the issue of the documents in parliament .
these new revelations come amidst a very public breakup with his second wife , veronica lario , who criticized him for originally including several attractive young women with little political experience as candidates for his center-right people of freedom party in eu elections and has suggested that he " cavorts with minors .

mills was convicted of taking a 440,000 euro -lrb- $ 600,000 -rrb- bribe in 1998 in exchange for withholding incriminating details about berlusconi 's business dealings .
berlusconi was not prime minister at the time .
the prime minister said he believes the release was deliberately timed to damage his party ahead of european elections in early june .
" with two weeks to go before the elections , the prime minister is the subject of a well-timed political attack , " government spokesman paolo bonaiuti said on a television show .
although berlusconi is immune to prosecution as long as he is prime minister , due to a law he championed last year , some have called for his resignation .
berlusconi has repeatedly accused milan 's " red judges " of having it in for him , after fighting charges of tax fraud , false accounting and illegally financing political parties .
none of the charges have ever stuck .
berlusconi said he would address the issue of the documents in parliament .
these new revelations come amidst a very public breakup with his second wife , veronica lario , who criticized him for originally including several attractive young women with little political experience as candidates for his center-right people of freedom party in eu elections and has suggested that he " cavorts with minors . "
a recent survey conducted by the newspaper la repubblica found that berlusconi 's approval rating had slipped three points in april to 53 percent. hf / afp / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

shot in english , german and french , " inglourious basterds " also features 45 german actors , including stars daniel bruehl , til schweiger and martin wuttke .
the film received a whopping 7.5 million euros -lrb- $ 10.3 million -rrb- in funding from germany . the film 's executive producer says it 's this kind of support that has made germany a favorite location for international film projects . " these productions are a great springboard for everyone involved in the making of films , from the actors to directors , camera operators , lighting directors and producers – if those positions are filled by local people , " carl woebcken of studio babelsberg said .

" a force to be reckoned with " " antichrist , " acclaimed danish director lars von trier 's latest film debuting at cannes , features willem dafoe and charlotte gainsbourg in a domestic tragedy loaded with graphic sex , torture and mutilation .
the film was shot entirely in forests in the state of north-rhine westphalia in western germany and produced by a german company .
" the difficult thing was to find the forest , and then the logistics .
when you 're filming 40 days in the woods you have to deal with everything from wastewater disposal to power supplies .

in addition , three other films in other categories at cannes are german co-productions .
that is proof enough , some say , of germany capitalizing on its strengths as a global film production and organization hub .

the timing suggests the launch was made with a wider impact in mind . us defense secretary robert gates provided the first official us confirmation that iran had test-fired a missile on wednesday .
gates said the missile had a range of 2,000 to 2,500 kilometers and would therefore be able to hit targets in israel , us bases in the middle east , and parts of central and eastern europe .
the us confirmation came after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad announced that a sejil-2 missile had reached its intended target , without specifying the range of the missile .
he said in a speech in semnan , which lies in north- eastern iran and where he said the missile was launched , that the sejil-2 was more advanced than previous missiles .
while further details are sketchy , this is said to be the longest-range missile iran has ever launched , raising concerns about the sophistication of tehran 's missile program – and its timing .
us-russian scientists this week said in a report that they believe that iran is at least five years away from being able to fire a ballistic missile equipped with a nuclear warhead that can cover long distances launch coincides with three key international developments every time iran launches a missile , " it is in response to a particular event , " andrew brookes , of the international institute of strategic studies think-tank in london told reuters .
this test coincides with three major events .
it comes after the first positive meeting between us president barack obama and prime minister benjamin netanyahu .
netanyahu has said that iran is the " gravest " threat in the middle east .
the us accuses iran of harboring nuclear ambitions and is preparing to make nuclear weapons .
obama has offered direct diplomacy with iran and said he expects a positive response by the end of this year .
israel 's deputy foreign minister , danny ayalon , said on israeli military radio that the latest missile tests has not changed the threat-level for israel , but that " europeans should be concerned " and warned that iran was trying to develop missiles that could eventually reach the us east coast .
test comes amid key us-russia arms talks the missile test was also conducted on the same day that the united states and russia wrapped up the first round of talks to discuss a successor to the 1991 strategic arms reduction treaty , or start .
the landmark cold war-era nuclear disarmament treaty expires in december and any new deal will have far-reaching implications for global security .
moscow insists any new treaty must take missile defense into account .
the us has plans to install parts of a global missile shield in eastern europe to fend off any attacks from iran .
moscow however is not convinced by this explanation .
us president obama will meet with his russian counterpart dmitry medvedev in moscow to discuss this and other key issues at the next round of start talks in july .
missile boost to presidential election campaign last but not least , the missile test comes just weeks ahead of the june 12 presidential elections in iran .
analysts told ap that the launch was likely " intended for domestic consumption ahead of those elections , rather than a message to the us . "

the timing suggests the launch was made with a wider impact in mind . us defense secretary robert gates provided the first official us confirmation that iran had test-fired a missile on wednesday .
gates said the missile had a range of 2,000 to 2,500 kilometers and would therefore be able to hit targets in israel , us bases in the middle east , and parts of central and eastern europe .
the us confirmation came after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad announced that a sejil-2 missile had reached its intended target , without specifying the range of the missile .
he said in a speech in semnan , which lies in north- eastern iran and where he said the missile was launched , that the sejil-2 was more advanced than previous missiles .
while further details are sketchy , this is said to be the longest-range missile iran has ever launched , raising concerns about the sophistication of tehran 's missile program – and its timing .
us-russian scientists this week said in a report that they believe that iran is at least five years away from being able to fire a ballistic missile equipped with a nuclear warhead that can cover long distances launch coincides with three key international developments every time iran launches a missile , " it is in response to a particular event , " andrew brookes , of the international institute of strategic studies think-tank in london told reuters .
this test coincides with three major events .
it comes after the first positive meeting between us president barack obama and prime minister benjamin netanyahu .
netanyahu has said that iran is the " gravest " threat in the middle east .
the us accuses iran of harboring nuclear ambitions and is preparing to make nuclear weapons .
obama has offered direct diplomacy with iran and said he expects a positive response by the end of this year .
israel 's deputy foreign minister , danny ayalon , said on israeli military radio that the latest missile tests has not changed the threat-level for israel , but that " europeans should be concerned " and warned that iran was trying to develop missiles that could eventually reach the us east coast .
test comes amid key us-russia arms talks the missile test was also conducted on the same day that the united states and russia wrapped up the first round of talks to discuss a successor to the 1991 strategic arms reduction treaty , or start .
the landmark cold war-era nuclear disarmament treaty expires in december and any new deal will have far-reaching implications for global security .
moscow insists any new treaty must take missile defense into account .
the us has plans to install parts of a global missile shield in eastern europe to fend off any attacks from iran .
moscow however is not convinced by this explanation .
us president obama will meet with his russian counterpart dmitry medvedev in moscow to discuss this and other key issues at the next round of start talks in july .
missile boost to presidential election campaign last but not least , the missile test comes just weeks ahead of the june 12 presidential elections in iran .
analysts told ap that the launch was likely " intended for domestic consumption ahead of those elections , rather than a message to the us . "
of the three main rivals , iran 's former prime minister , mir-hossein moussavi , is widely considered to be ahmadinejad 's main challenger .
president obama hopes to begin negotiations with tehran after the elections. wl , ap / reuters / afp editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the summit was originally scheduled to take place five months ago but was delayed by china after french president sarkozy met with the exiled tibetan spiritual leader the dalai lama .
disagreement over tibet has persisted , with china unwilling to commit to " freedom of speech and the rights of ethnic minorities , " one of the eu 's demands .
" the most important thing is to stick to the principles of mutual respect and non-interference in each others ' affairs , " wen politely but firmly said at a news conference after the summit .
the eu also failed to get china to agree to put pressure on burma 's junta to begin talks with pro-democracy forces and free opposition leader aung san suu kyi .
china also refused to join europe in condemning north korea 's april 5 missile test .
the two parties could not agree on a common approach to global warming , with the eu hoping china would commit to significantly reducing its carbon dioxide emissions by 2020 and china wanting more help for developing nations to cut their emissions and tougher standards for developed countries .
wen was unable to persuade the eu to lift its arms embargo against china or recognize the country as a market economy , a step that would bring big trade and investment benefits .
china and the eu are scheduled to revisit these divisive issues later in the year , just before a united nations conference to be held in december in copenhagen aimed at producing a global climate deal to succeed the kyoto protocol. hf / ap / dpa / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 21.05.2009 obama seeks support for guantanamo closure after senate rebuke großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama suffered a rare bipartisan defeat in the senate us president barack obama is to deliver a speech on national security after his own democrats joined with senate republicans and voted overwhelmingly to block the closing of the controversial guantanamo bay prison . president obama will seek to regain control of the guantanamo bay discussion thursday with a major address on national security , just a day after a rare bipartisan defeat for the popular president .
the senate voted 90-6 to strip the $ 80 million -lrb- 58 million euros -rrb- obama requested for the closing of the guantanamo bay prison from spending legislation for the wars in iraq and afghanistan .
this sharp rebuke puts obama in a political tight spot at home and abroad and could get in the way of the fulfilment of his promise to close the prison in the first year of his presidency .
obama signed the executive order calling for the closure on january 22 , just days after taking office , proving that he was serious about reversing some of the controversial policies of his predecessor george w. bush .
but now obama has just months to decide what to do with the 240 remaining inmates , many of whom have not been charged .
" we 've made some hasty decisions that are now going to take some time to unwind , " said presidential spokesman robert gibbs .
" and closing guantanamo bay , obviously , is one of those decisions . "
criticism from all sides while obama 's move to close the prison was welcomed internationally , many americans are skittish about having these suspected terrorists in their own states .
fearing a backlash from these voters , members of the senate and house of representatives from both parties have resisted bringing the detainees into the us .
" democrats under no circumstances will move forward without a comprehensive , responsible plan from the president , " said senate majority leader harry reid .
" we will never allow terrorists to be released into the united states . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the inmates have yet to be charged fbi director robert mueller also has concerns about bringing the detainees into the american prison system .
" the concerns we have about individuals who may support terrorism being in the united states run from concerns about providing financing to terrorists , radicalizing others with regard to violent extremism , the potential for individuals undertaking attacks in the united states , " mueller said .
mueller said he hoped obama 's speech would " outline a comprehensive strategy for keeping america safe . "
obama has also come under fire for reversing his position on other related issues .
many obama supporters and civil liberties groups were angered when he announced plans to re-institute bush-era military tribunals for terror suspects and to block the release of photos of prisoner abuse in iraq and afghanistan .
little support from europe obama 's failure to persuade his fellow americans to accept guantanamo inmates into their country could further undermine his administration 's efforts to get allies in europe to take in some of the detainees themselves .
since obama took office , one man has been transferred to britain and another to france , but other european nations have either refused entirely or given conflicting responses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is n't sure former guantanamo bay inmates belong in europe while germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has said germany would consider taking in former inmates , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has repeatedly spoken out against the idea .
the us has pushed germany to take in a group of inmates of china 's uigher minority , a mainly muslim group that beijing considers terrorists .
munich , in the southern german state bavaria , is home to around 500 uighurs , the largest known community in exile .
steinmeier , who is running as the social democrats ' candidate for chancellor this year , told the news magazine der spiegel this week that accepting any large number of uighers would create political tensions with the chinese government. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the senate voted 90-6 to strip the $ 80 million -lrb- 58 million euros -rrb- obama requested for the closing of the guantanamo bay prison from spending legislation for the wars in iraq and afghanistan .
this sharp rebuke puts obama in a political tight spot at home and abroad and could get in the way of the fulfilment of his promise to close the prison in the first year of his presidency .
obama signed the executive order calling for the closure on january 22 , just days after taking office , proving that he was serious about reversing some of the controversial policies of his predecessor george w. bush .
but now obama has just months to decide what to do with the 240 remaining inmates , many of whom have not been charged .
" we 've made some hasty decisions that are now going to take some time to unwind , " said presidential spokesman robert gibbs .
" and closing guantanamo bay , obviously , is one of those decisions . "
criticism from all sides while obama 's move to close the prison was welcomed internationally , many americans are skittish about having these suspected terrorists in their own states .
fearing a backlash from these voters , members of the senate and house of representatives from both parties have resisted bringing the detainees into the us .
" democrats under no circumstances will move forward without a comprehensive , responsible plan from the president , " said senate majority leader harry reid .
" we will never allow terrorists to be released into the united states . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the inmates have yet to be charged fbi director robert mueller also has concerns about bringing the detainees into the american prison system .
" the concerns we have about individuals who may support terrorism being in the united states run from concerns about providing financing to terrorists , radicalizing others with regard to violent extremism , the potential for individuals undertaking attacks in the united states , " mueller said .
mueller said he hoped obama 's speech would " outline a comprehensive strategy for keeping america safe . "
obama has also come under fire for reversing his position on other related issues .
many obama supporters and civil liberties groups were angered when he announced plans to re-institute bush-era military tribunals for terror suspects and to block the release of photos of prisoner abuse in iraq and afghanistan .
little support from europe obama 's failure to persuade his fellow americans to accept guantanamo inmates into their country could further undermine his administration 's efforts to get allies in europe to take in some of the detainees themselves .
since obama took office , one man has been transferred to britain and another to france , but other european nations have either refused entirely or given conflicting responses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is n't sure former guantanamo bay inmates belong in europe while germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has said germany would consider taking in former inmates , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has repeatedly spoken out against the idea .
the us has pushed germany to take in a group of inmates of china 's uigher minority , a mainly muslim group that beijing considers terrorists .
munich , in the southern german state bavaria , is home to around 500 uighurs , the largest known community in exile .
steinmeier , who is running as the social democrats ' candidate for chancellor this year , told the news magazine der spiegel this week that accepting any large number of uighers would create political tensions with the chinese government. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

around 8,400 people applied to be part of europe 's second batch of space explorers . the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- has presented six new astronauts to begin training for missions to the international space station " and beyond . "
the successful candidates are italy 's samantha cristoforetti and luca parmitano , britain 's timothy peake , denmark 's andreas mogensen , france 's thomas pesquet and germany 's alexander gerst .
they were chosen from a pool of 8,413 hopefuls in a europe-wide recruitment drive that began last year .
the six new space travellers are the first new recruits to join the european astronaut corps since 1992 , under the second-ever astronaut selection carried out by the esa .
new generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german alexander gerst is among the lucky half dozen esa director general jean-jacques dordain said the astronauts have been chosen at a " turning point " in the organization 's human space flight activities .
" we are now entering a new phase of utilization of the unique capabilities offered by the iss -lrb- international space station -rrb- and preparation for international exploration of the moon and beyond , " he said .
the new recruits are between 31 and 37 years old , and will join the eight existing members of the european astronaut corps - all of whom are men - in training for upcoming missions .
dordain said that , assuming the iss operational mandate is extended to 2020 , there would be at least seven esa missions to the space station .
he also suggested that a joint mission to the moon with nasa and other international space organizations was a distinct possibility .
" according to nasa plans , a crew will be on the moon by 2020 , which is tomorrow for these young astronauts , " he said .
which is scarier ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : usually esa does unmanned missions , like launching the herschel telescope last week the new recruits seemed more concerned by the media frenzy in paris on wednesday than by the prospect of a life as a space adventurer .
" i am not sure which is scarier , sitting in from of a roomful of journalists , or sitting on top of a rocket one day and blasting off into space , " said andreas mogensen , when asked if he had the jitters after being selected .
the six astronauts will begin 18 months of " basic " training in september. msh / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but russia expert susan stewart says major hurdles remain . the two-day summit , which began late on thursday in the eastern russian city of khabarovsk , sees eu president vaclav klaus , eu commission president jose manuel barroso and the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana sit down with russian president dmitry medvedev and several cabinet ministers . high on the agenda is the ongoing global economic decline , which has hit both the eu and russia extremely hard . the euro-zone economies contracted by 2.5 percent in the first three months of 2009 , and the world bank forecasts that the russian economy will shrink by 4.5 percent this year - which means in theory the two sides should have plenty of common interests on this issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kremlin is preoccupied with domestic issues but theory is n't necessarily translating into practice . " the economic crisis has been seen by some here in the eu as a chance for intensifying relations with russia but so far that chance has n't materialized , " explained susan stewart , a research fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" that 's because russia has been very concerned with domestic affairs during the crisis . " and mistrust remains . " russian foreign minister -lsb- sergei -rsb- lavrov has recently criticized the eu for taking measures seen as protectionist , including anti-dumping policies , quotas on steel and nuclear materials and agricultural subsidies , " stewart said . energy supplies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spat with ukraine stopped the flow of gas last winter russia and eu leaders are also focusing on the politics of energy - in particular how to avoid future disruptions to natural gas deliveries due to quarrels between russia and its neighbors . last winter , a disagreement between russia and ukraine over prices left some eastern eu member states without gas .
moscow accused kyiv of blocking pipelines leading from russia to the eu via ukraine , while kyiv maintained that the kremlin was responsible for the disruptions . eu leaders hope that future disputes can be resolved without leaving people out in the cold , but the omens are n't all positive . " there 's a certain tension in the air because the eu and ukraine recently reached an agreement on modernization of gas-transit structures in ukraine , and russia would have preferred strongly to have been involved in that , " stewart said . indeed , russia is expected to raise complaints of its own regarding the international transfer of energy within europe . " this is an attempt to restart dialogue about the four or five points in the current signed but never ratified energy charter treaty with the eu that russia feels do n't take the interests of producer countries into sufficient account , " stewart added . caucasus conundrum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : true peace in the caucasus is a long way off one issue on which the eu and russia definitely do not see eye-to-eye is the caucasus .
the eu condemned moscow 's military intervention in the region against georgia last summer , while the kremlin has viewed the bloc 's eastern expansion with continual unease . and the prospects for the summit are n't exactly boosted by the fact that earlier in the week russia briefly walked out of talks in geneva aimed at resolving the conflict between georgia over the two breakaway provinces abkhazia and south ossetia . " the caucasus is the most difficult issue , " stewart confirmed .
" in the best-case scenario , we would have a russian willingness to go forward with the geneva talks with some thinking about how to achieve more genuine stability in the region , " stewart told deutsche welle . but russia is also concerned with wider security issues - in particular a somewhat vague proposal made by medvedev in berlin last year that russia and eu work toward a new overarching security framework . " there have been a lot of requests from the eu to the russian side to make their ideas more concrete and their goals more explicit , " stewart said .
" at first the russians were frustrated by a lack of response from europe , but now that the eu appears willing to talk , the russians have decided to make it one of the summit topics .

the senate voted 90-6 to strip the $ 80 million -lrb- 58 million euros -rrb- obama requested for the closing of the guantanamo bay prison from spending legislation for the wars in iraq and afghanistan .
this sharp rebuke puts obama in a political tight spot at home and abroad and could get in the way of the fulfilment of his promise to close the prison in the first year of his presidency .
obama signed the executive order calling for the closure on january 22 , just days after taking office , proving that he was serious about reversing some of the controversial policies of his predecessor george w. bush .
but now obama has just months to decide what to do with the 240 remaining inmates , many of whom have not been charged .
" we 've made some hasty decisions that are now going to take some time to unwind , " said presidential spokesman robert gibbs .
" and closing guantanamo bay , obviously , is one of those decisions . "
criticism from all sides while obama 's move to close the prison was welcomed internationally , many americans are skittish about having these suspected terrorists in their own states .
fearing a backlash from these voters , members of the senate and house of representatives from both parties have resisted bringing the detainees into the us .
" democrats under no circumstances will move forward without a comprehensive , responsible plan from the president , " said senate majority leader harry reid .
" we will never allow terrorists to be released into the united states . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the inmates have yet to be charged fbi director robert mueller also has concerns about bringing the detainees into the american prison system .
" the concerns we have about individuals who may support terrorism being in the united states run from concerns about providing financing to terrorists , radicalizing others with regard to violent extremism , the potential for individuals undertaking attacks in the united states , " mueller said .
mueller said he hoped obama 's speech would " outline a comprehensive strategy for keeping america safe . "
obama has also come under fire for reversing his position on other related issues .
many obama supporters and civil liberties groups were angered when he announced plans to re-institute bush-era military tribunals for terror suspects and to block the release of photos of prisoner abuse in iraq and afghanistan .
little support from europe obama 's failure to persuade his fellow americans to accept guantanamo inmates into their country could further undermine his administration 's efforts to get allies in europe to take in some of the detainees themselves .
since obama took office , one man has been transferred to britain and another to france , but other european nations have either refused entirely or given conflicting responses .

the girls can protect their modesty , however , with full-length bathing suits . a court in the western city of muenster has ruled that muslim girls at elementary schools in germany must attend mixed swimming classes with boys , rejecting a request from the parents of a nine-year-old girl for her to be excused from the lessons .

it also dismissed complaints that the bathing suit hindered swimming because of excessive absorption , endangering their daughter 's life .

the summit was originally scheduled to take place five months ago but was delayed by china after french president sarkozy met with the exiled tibetan spiritual leader the dalai lama .
disagreement over tibet has persisted , with china unwilling to commit to " freedom of speech and the rights of ethnic minorities , " one of the eu 's demands .

china also refused to join europe in condemning north korea 's april 5 missile test .
the two parties could not agree on a common approach to global warming , with the eu hoping china would commit to significantly reducing its carbon dioxide emissions by 2020 and china wanting more help for developing nations to cut their emissions and tougher standards for developed countries .
wen was unable to persuade the eu to lift its arms embargo against china or recognize the country as a market economy , a step that would bring big trade and investment benefits .

the timing suggests the launch was made with a wider impact in mind . us defense secretary robert gates provided the first official us confirmation that iran had test-fired a missile on wednesday .
gates said the missile had a range of 2,000 to 2,500 kilometers and would therefore be able to hit targets in israel , us bases in the middle east , and parts of central and eastern europe .
the us confirmation came after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad announced that a sejil-2 missile had reached its intended target , without specifying the range of the missile .
he said in a speech in semnan , which lies in north- eastern iran and where he said the missile was launched , that the sejil-2 was more advanced than previous missiles .
while further details are sketchy , this is said to be the longest-range missile iran has ever launched , raising concerns about the sophistication of tehran 's missile program – and its timing .
us-russian scientists this week said in a report that they believe that iran is at least five years away from being able to fire a ballistic missile equipped with a nuclear warhead that can cover long distances launch coincides with three key international developments every time iran launches a missile , " it is in response to a particular event , " andrew brookes , of the international institute of strategic studies think-tank in london told reuters .
this test coincides with three major events .
it comes after the first positive meeting between us president barack obama and prime minister benjamin netanyahu .
netanyahu has said that iran is the " gravest " threat in the middle east .
the us accuses iran of harboring nuclear ambitions and is preparing to make nuclear weapons .
obama has offered direct diplomacy with iran and said he expects a positive response by the end of this year .
israel 's deputy foreign minister , danny ayalon , said on israeli military radio that the latest missile tests has not changed the threat-level for israel , but that " europeans should be concerned " and warned that iran was trying to develop missiles that could eventually reach the us east coast .
test comes amid key us-russia arms talks the missile test was also conducted on the same day that the united states and russia wrapped up the first round of talks to discuss a successor to the 1991 strategic arms reduction treaty , or start .
the landmark cold war-era nuclear disarmament treaty expires in december and any new deal will have far-reaching implications for global security .
moscow insists any new treaty must take missile defense into account .
the us has plans to install parts of a global missile shield in eastern europe to fend off any attacks from iran .
moscow however is not convinced by this explanation .
us president obama will meet with his russian counterpart dmitry medvedev in moscow to discuss this and other key issues at the next round of start talks in july .
missile boost to presidential election campaign last but not least , the missile test comes just weeks ahead of the june 12 presidential elections in iran .
analysts told ap that the launch was likely " intended for domestic consumption ahead of those elections , rather than a message to the us . "

the timing suggests the launch was made with a wider impact in mind . us defense secretary robert gates provided the first official us confirmation that iran had test-fired a missile on wednesday .
gates said the missile had a range of 2,000 to 2,500 kilometers and would therefore be able to hit targets in israel , us bases in the middle east , and parts of central and eastern europe .
the us confirmation came after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad announced that a sejil-2 missile had reached its intended target , without specifying the range of the missile .
he said in a speech in semnan , which lies in north- eastern iran and where he said the missile was launched , that the sejil-2 was more advanced than previous missiles .
while further details are sketchy , this is said to be the longest-range missile iran has ever launched , raising concerns about the sophistication of tehran 's missile program – and its timing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 21.05.2009 at cannes , germany plays up co-production skills großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany funded tarantino 's " inglourious basterds , " which stars brad pitt with three co-productions in the competition section at cannes this year , germany is seeking to burnish its credentials as a major global film player and promote itself as a sought-after movie-making destination . where are the german films at cannes ?
it 's a question being asked in the german media as critics look in vain for heavyweight names , such as directors fatih akin -lrb- " head-on " -rrb- and florian von donnersmarck -lrb- " the life of others " -rrb- at the european film industry 's most prestigious and glitzy event .
at a time when german films have tasted nearly unprecedented domestic and international success , with nominations and prizes reaching right up to the gilded oscars , the absence of german film stars at cannes is all the more galling , so the argument goes .
but experts in the film business say looking for a strictly " german " film at cannes is pointless at a time when movie-making has long transcended geographical borders .
" this whole discussion in the media – particularly in the german media – about whether there 's a ' german ' film among the productions is totally obsolete , " christian berg from the media board berlin brandenburg told deutsche welle .
" we live in a globalized world today ; almost all films are produced internationally .
we have to learn to be proud of our german co-productions and represent them as ours . "
nazi slayer film gets big-bucks german funding " co-productions " is indeed the buzzword at cannes now that studios are reeling under the global financial crisis , budgets are being cut and filmmakers and studios are looking for ways to beat the recession .
germany has three star-studded co-productions in the running for the prestigious palme d 'or this year - quentin tarantino 's " inglourious basterds , " lars von trier 's " antichrist " and austrian director michael haneke 's " the white ribbon . "
all three were largely financed by german production companies , some star german actors and one was shot entirely in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : star power - tarantino , second from left , with part of the cast from " inglourious basterds " us director tarantino 's gangster flick and wartime caper , starring brad pitt as the leader of a ruthless gang of nazi slayers , was the most keenly awaited film at cannes on wednesday .

the court said mills had given false testimony to protect berlusconi and his fininvest holding group .
mills was convicted of taking a 440,000 euro -lrb- $ 600,000 -rrb- bribe in 1998 in exchange for withholding incriminating details about berlusconi 's business dealings .
berlusconi was not prime minister at the time .
the prime minister said he believes the release was deliberately timed to damage his party ahead of european elections in early june .
" with two weeks to go before the elections , the prime minister is the subject of a well-timed political attack , " government spokesman paolo bonaiuti said on a television show .
although berlusconi is immune to prosecution as long as he is prime minister , due to a law he championed last year , some have called for his resignation .
berlusconi has repeatedly accused milan 's " red judges " of having it in for him , after fighting charges of tax fraud , false accounting and illegally financing political parties .
none of the charges have ever stuck .
berlusconi said he would address the issue of the documents in parliament .
these new revelations come amidst a very public breakup with his second wife , veronica lario , who criticized him for originally including several attractive young women with little political experience as candidates for his center-right people of freedom party in eu elections and has suggested that he " cavorts with minors .

a recent survey conducted by the newspaper la repubblica found that berlusconi 's approval rating had slipped three points in april to 53 percent. hf / afp / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court said mills had given false testimony to protect berlusconi and his fininvest holding group .
mills was convicted of taking a 440,000 euro -lrb- $ 600,000 -rrb- bribe in 1998 in exchange for withholding incriminating details about berlusconi 's business dealings .
berlusconi was not prime minister at the time .
the prime minister said he believes the release was deliberately timed to damage his party ahead of european elections in early june .
" with two weeks to go before the elections , the prime minister is the subject of a well-timed political attack , " government spokesman paolo bonaiuti said on a television show .
although berlusconi is immune to prosecution as long as he is prime minister , due to a law he championed last year , some have called for his resignation .
berlusconi has repeatedly accused milan 's " red judges " of having it in for him , after fighting charges of tax fraud , false accounting and illegally financing political parties .
none of the charges have ever stuck .
berlusconi said he would address the issue of the documents in parliament .
these new revelations come amidst a very public breakup with his second wife , veronica lario , who criticized him for originally including several attractive young women with little political experience as candidates for his center-right people of freedom party in eu elections and has suggested that he " cavorts with minors . "
a recent survey conducted by the newspaper la repubblica found that berlusconi 's approval rating had slipped three points in april to 53 percent. hf / afp / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

those numbers have placed a huge burden on already crowded camps housing thousands of displaced ethnic tamils , aid groups working on the ground say .
andreas lindner , head of the red cross delegation that visited sri lanka , told german news agency dpa the crisis was one of the most " complicated and dramatic worldwide . "
" prisons under the open sky " lindner said many of the refugees were suffering from dehydration and undernourishment , some had gunshot wounds or other injuries and there were thousands of cases of hepatitis a and chicken pox .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid groups say outbreaks of illnesses and a lack of food and water have made life unbearable in refugee camps typhoid too had broken out in some pockets , he said , adding that the last time he witnessed a comparable situation was after the genocide in ruanda in 1994 .
lindner criticized the supply of food to the camps , saying the distribution of drinking water was hugely insufficient .
he also said the government was restricting access to the camps by aid agencies .
aid group caritas internationalis has slammed the government in colombo for failing to improve conditions in the camps .
caritas said the sri lankan military was patrolling camps in the vavuniya region in the northeast of the country and refugees were not allowed to leave or have any contact with the outside world .
its aid workers on the ground had described the camps as " prisons under the open sky , " the group said .
calls for political solution the criticism comes amid fierce international condemnation of colombo 's handling of the crisis .
heavy fighting broke out between government troops and tamil tigers in the last rebel stronghold in the northeast in the past months .
thousands of civilians were reportedly caught in the crossfire .
earlier this week , the european union called for an independent inquiry into alleged human rights abuses by both sides .
the rebels started fighting in the 1970s for a separate state – eelam – for tamils in sri lanka 's north and east , complaining that tamils had been discriminated against by successive majority sinhalese governments .
the conflict has killed an estimated 80,000 people , displaced tens of thousands more and put a brake on the island 's growth and economic development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sri lankans in colombo celebrating news of the end of the civil war this week calls are growing louder for a long-term political solution to the conflict in sri lanka and one that takes into account tamil aspirations .
the german government this week urged colombo to step up efforts to initiate a process of reconciliation with the tamil minority .
development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the government in sri lanka needed to do everything it could to heal the divisions in society and give the tamil population a chance to participate in the political process .
thadshayani sadagopan , a tamil student in bonn who has lived in germany for over 15 years , told deutsche welle that now more than ever , it was necessary to bring the two ethnic groups in sri lanka to the negotiating table .
" the real war only begins now , " sadagopan said , warning that the tamil tiger rebels may have laid down their weapons for now but " maybe in a year or two they could take up arms again " if real peace was not achieved .
" the two groups hate each other so much .
they ca n't really live with each other , " she said .
but on thursday , sri lanka 's reconciliation minister , vinayagamoorthi muralitharan , a former rebel commander who was known as col karuna , said elections would be held in areas affected by recent fighting once displaced people have been resettled .

those numbers have placed a huge burden on already crowded camps housing thousands of displaced ethnic tamils , aid groups working on the ground say .
andreas lindner , head of the red cross delegation that visited sri lanka , told german news agency dpa the crisis was one of the most " complicated and dramatic worldwide . "
" prisons under the open sky " lindner said many of the refugees were suffering from dehydration and undernourishment , some had gunshot wounds or other injuries and there were thousands of cases of hepatitis a and chicken pox .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid groups say outbreaks of illnesses and a lack of food and water have made life unbearable in refugee camps typhoid too had broken out in some pockets , he said , adding that the last time he witnessed a comparable situation was after the genocide in ruanda in 1994 .
lindner criticized the supply of food to the camps , saying the distribution of drinking water was hugely insufficient .
he also said the government was restricting access to the camps by aid agencies .
aid group caritas internationalis has slammed the government in colombo for failing to improve conditions in the camps .
caritas said the sri lankan military was patrolling camps in the vavuniya region in the northeast of the country and refugees were not allowed to leave or have any contact with the outside world .
its aid workers on the ground had described the camps as " prisons under the open sky , " the group said .
calls for political solution the criticism comes amid fierce international condemnation of colombo 's handling of the crisis .
heavy fighting broke out between government troops and tamil tigers in the last rebel stronghold in the northeast in the past months .
thousands of civilians were reportedly caught in the crossfire .
earlier this week , the european union called for an independent inquiry into alleged human rights abuses by both sides .
the rebels started fighting in the 1970s for a separate state – eelam – for tamils in sri lanka 's north and east , complaining that tamils had been discriminated against by successive majority sinhalese governments .
the conflict has killed an estimated 80,000 people , displaced tens of thousands more and put a brake on the island 's growth and economic development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sri lankans in colombo celebrating news of the end of the civil war this week calls are growing louder for a long-term political solution to the conflict in sri lanka and one that takes into account tamil aspirations .
the german government this week urged colombo to step up efforts to initiate a process of reconciliation with the tamil minority .
development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the government in sri lanka needed to do everything it could to heal the divisions in society and give the tamil population a chance to participate in the political process .
thadshayani sadagopan , a tamil student in bonn who has lived in germany for over 15 years , told deutsche welle that now more than ever , it was necessary to bring the two ethnic groups in sri lanka to the negotiating table .
" the real war only begins now , " sadagopan said , warning that the tamil tiger rebels may have laid down their weapons for now but " maybe in a year or two they could take up arms again " if real peace was not achieved .
" the two groups hate each other so much .
they ca n't really live with each other , " she said .
but on thursday , sri lanka 's reconciliation minister , vinayagamoorthi muralitharan , a former rebel commander who was known as col karuna , said elections would be held in areas affected by recent fighting once displaced people have been resettled .
he also promised the polls would address the grievances of the tamil minority. sp / dpa / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in reports published separately on thursday by zdf public television network and the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- newspaper and based on the historians ' findings , kurras had been in the service of the stasi secret police since 1955 and had been charged with spying on the west berlin police .
documents change a chapter in german history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters in munich in 1967 carrying a banner reading " benno ohnesorg - political murder " the documents found in the archives of the birthler agency - the authority which manages files from the former east germany - also contained a message radioed to kurras by the mfs after the fatal shooting of ohnesorg , which read : " destroy all material .
cease work for now .
view events as very regrettable accident . "
ohnesorg was shot to death in west berlin on june 2 , 1967 during a student protest against the shah of iran , who was visiting germany at the time .
his death triggered widespread and violent student protests across west germany and helped fuel sympathies for the militant red army faction and its up-and-coming first generation leaders , andreas baader , ulrike meinhof and gudrun ensslin .
espionage expert mueller-enbergs , told zdf that there were no clues in the stasi files that kurras had been explicitly told to liquidate ohnesorg .
after the shooting , kurras was tried for reckless manslaughter but acquitted due to a lack of evidence .
the new information raises the question : what would have happened to the german student protest movement of the late 1960s had people known that ohnesorg 's killer had been a spy for communist east germany ? gb / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the senate voted 90-6 to strip the $ 80 million -lrb- 58 million euros -rrb- obama requested for the closing of the guantanamo bay prison from spending legislation for the wars in iraq and afghanistan .
this sharp rebuke puts obama in a political tight spot at home and abroad and could get in the way of the fulfilment of his promise to close the prison in the first year of his presidency .
obama signed the executive order calling for the closure on january 22 , just days after taking office , proving that he was serious about reversing some of the controversial policies of his predecessor george w. bush .
but now obama has just months to decide what to do with the 240 remaining inmates , many of whom have not been charged .
" we 've made some hasty decisions that are now going to take some time to unwind , " said presidential spokesman robert gibbs .
" and closing guantanamo bay , obviously , is one of those decisions . "
criticism from all sides while obama 's move to close the prison was welcomed internationally , many americans are skittish about having these suspected terrorists in their own states .
fearing a backlash from these voters , members of the senate and house of representatives from both parties have resisted bringing the detainees into the us .
" democrats under no circumstances will move forward without a comprehensive , responsible plan from the president , " said senate majority leader harry reid .
" we will never allow terrorists to be released into the united states . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the inmates have yet to be charged fbi director robert mueller also has concerns about bringing the detainees into the american prison system .
" the concerns we have about individuals who may support terrorism being in the united states run from concerns about providing financing to terrorists , radicalizing others with regard to violent extremism , the potential for individuals undertaking attacks in the united states , " mueller said .
mueller said he hoped obama 's speech would " outline a comprehensive strategy for keeping america safe . "
obama has also come under fire for reversing his position on other related issues .
many obama supporters and civil liberties groups were angered when he announced plans to re-institute bush-era military tribunals for terror suspects and to block the release of photos of prisoner abuse in iraq and afghanistan .
little support from europe obama 's failure to persuade his fellow americans to accept guantanamo inmates into their country could further undermine his administration 's efforts to get allies in europe to take in some of the detainees themselves .
since obama took office , one man has been transferred to britain and another to france , but other european nations have either refused entirely or given conflicting responses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is n't sure former guantanamo bay inmates belong in europe while germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has said germany would consider taking in former inmates , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has repeatedly spoken out against the idea .
the us has pushed germany to take in a group of inmates of china 's uigher minority , a mainly muslim group that beijing considers terrorists .
munich , in the southern german state bavaria , is home to around 500 uighurs , the largest known community in exile .
steinmeier , who is running as the social democrats ' candidate for chancellor this year , told the news magazine der spiegel this week that accepting any large number of uighers would create political tensions with the chinese government. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

around 8,400 people applied to be part of europe 's second batch of space explorers . the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- has presented six new astronauts to begin training for missions to the international space station " and beyond . "
the successful candidates are italy 's samantha cristoforetti and luca parmitano , britain 's timothy peake , denmark 's andreas mogensen , france 's thomas pesquet and germany 's alexander gerst .
they were chosen from a pool of 8,413 hopefuls in a europe-wide recruitment drive that began last year .
the six new space travellers are the first new recruits to join the european astronaut corps since 1992 , under the second-ever astronaut selection carried out by the esa .
new generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german alexander gerst is among the lucky half dozen esa director general jean-jacques dordain said the astronauts have been chosen at a " turning point " in the organization 's human space flight activities .
" we are now entering a new phase of utilization of the unique capabilities offered by the iss -lrb- international space station -rrb- and preparation for international exploration of the moon and beyond , " he said .
the new recruits are between 31 and 37 years old , and will join the eight existing members of the european astronaut corps - all of whom are men - in training for upcoming missions .
dordain said that , assuming the iss operational mandate is extended to 2020 , there would be at least seven esa missions to the space station .
he also suggested that a joint mission to the moon with nasa and other international space organizations was a distinct possibility .
" according to nasa plans , a crew will be on the moon by 2020 , which is tomorrow for these young astronauts , " he said .

the senate voted 90-6 to strip the $ 80 million -lrb- 58 million euros -rrb- obama requested for the closing of the guantanamo bay prison from spending legislation for the wars in iraq and afghanistan .
this sharp rebuke puts obama in a political tight spot at home and abroad and could get in the way of the fulfilment of his promise to close the prison in the first year of his presidency .
obama signed the executive order calling for the closure on january 22 , just days after taking office , proving that he was serious about reversing some of the controversial policies of his predecessor george w. bush .
but now obama has just months to decide what to do with the 240 remaining inmates , many of whom have not been charged .
" we 've made some hasty decisions that are now going to take some time to unwind , " said presidential spokesman robert gibbs .
" and closing guantanamo bay , obviously , is one of those decisions . "
criticism from all sides while obama 's move to close the prison was welcomed internationally , many americans are skittish about having these suspected terrorists in their own states .
fearing a backlash from these voters , members of the senate and house of representatives from both parties have resisted bringing the detainees into the us .
" democrats under no circumstances will move forward without a comprehensive , responsible plan from the president , " said senate majority leader harry reid .
" we will never allow terrorists to be released into the united states . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the inmates have yet to be charged fbi director robert mueller also has concerns about bringing the detainees into the american prison system .
" the concerns we have about individuals who may support terrorism being in the united states run from concerns about providing financing to terrorists , radicalizing others with regard to violent extremism , the potential for individuals undertaking attacks in the united states , " mueller said .
mueller said he hoped obama 's speech would " outline a comprehensive strategy for keeping america safe . "
obama has also come under fire for reversing his position on other related issues .
many obama supporters and civil liberties groups were angered when he announced plans to re-institute bush-era military tribunals for terror suspects and to block the release of photos of prisoner abuse in iraq and afghanistan .
little support from europe obama 's failure to persuade his fellow americans to accept guantanamo inmates into their country could further undermine his administration 's efforts to get allies in europe to take in some of the detainees themselves .
since obama took office , one man has been transferred to britain and another to france , but other european nations have either refused entirely or given conflicting responses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is n't sure former guantanamo bay inmates belong in europe while germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has said germany would consider taking in former inmates , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has repeatedly spoken out against the idea .
the us has pushed germany to take in a group of inmates of china 's uigher minority , a mainly muslim group that beijing considers terrorists .
munich , in the southern german state bavaria , is home to around 500 uighurs , the largest known community in exile .

those numbers have placed a huge burden on already crowded camps housing thousands of displaced ethnic tamils , aid groups working on the ground say .
andreas lindner , head of the red cross delegation that visited sri lanka , told german news agency dpa the crisis was one of the most " complicated and dramatic worldwide . "
" prisons under the open sky " lindner said many of the refugees were suffering from dehydration and undernourishment , some had gunshot wounds or other injuries and there were thousands of cases of hepatitis a and chicken pox .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid groups say outbreaks of illnesses and a lack of food and water have made life unbearable in refugee camps typhoid too had broken out in some pockets , he said , adding that the last time he witnessed a comparable situation was after the genocide in ruanda in 1994 .
lindner criticized the supply of food to the camps , saying the distribution of drinking water was hugely insufficient .
he also said the government was restricting access to the camps by aid agencies .
aid group caritas internationalis has slammed the government in colombo for failing to improve conditions in the camps .
caritas said the sri lankan military was patrolling camps in the vavuniya region in the northeast of the country and refugees were not allowed to leave or have any contact with the outside world .
its aid workers on the ground had described the camps as " prisons under the open sky , " the group said .
calls for political solution the criticism comes amid fierce international condemnation of colombo 's handling of the crisis .
heavy fighting broke out between government troops and tamil tigers in the last rebel stronghold in the northeast in the past months .
thousands of civilians were reportedly caught in the crossfire .
earlier this week , the european union called for an independent inquiry into alleged human rights abuses by both sides .
the rebels started fighting in the 1970s for a separate state – eelam – for tamils in sri lanka 's north and east , complaining that tamils had been discriminated against by successive majority sinhalese governments .
the conflict has killed an estimated 80,000 people , displaced tens of thousands more and put a brake on the island 's growth and economic development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sri lankans in colombo celebrating news of the end of the civil war this week calls are growing louder for a long-term political solution to the conflict in sri lanka and one that takes into account tamil aspirations .
the german government this week urged colombo to step up efforts to initiate a process of reconciliation with the tamil minority .
development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the government in sri lanka needed to do everything it could to heal the divisions in society and give the tamil population a chance to participate in the political process .
thadshayani sadagopan , a tamil student in bonn who has lived in germany for over 15 years , told deutsche welle that now more than ever , it was necessary to bring the two ethnic groups in sri lanka to the negotiating table .
" the real war only begins now , " sadagopan said , warning that the tamil tiger rebels may have laid down their weapons for now but " maybe in a year or two they could take up arms again " if real peace was not achieved .
" the two groups hate each other so much .
they ca n't really live with each other , " she said .
but on thursday , sri lanka 's reconciliation minister , vinayagamoorthi muralitharan , a former rebel commander who was known as col karuna , said elections would be held in areas affected by recent fighting once displaced people have been resettled .
he also promised the polls would address the grievances of the tamil minority. sp / dpa / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

those numbers have placed a huge burden on already crowded camps housing thousands of displaced ethnic tamils , aid groups working on the ground say .
andreas lindner , head of the red cross delegation that visited sri lanka , told german news agency dpa the crisis was one of the most " complicated and dramatic worldwide . "
" prisons under the open sky " lindner said many of the refugees were suffering from dehydration and undernourishment , some had gunshot wounds or other injuries and there were thousands of cases of hepatitis a and chicken pox .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid groups say outbreaks of illnesses and a lack of food and water have made life unbearable in refugee camps typhoid too had broken out in some pockets , he said , adding that the last time he witnessed a comparable situation was after the genocide in ruanda in 1994 .
lindner criticized the supply of food to the camps , saying the distribution of drinking water was hugely insufficient .
he also said the government was restricting access to the camps by aid agencies .
aid group caritas internationalis has slammed the government in colombo for failing to improve conditions in the camps .
caritas said the sri lankan military was patrolling camps in the vavuniya region in the northeast of the country and refugees were not allowed to leave or have any contact with the outside world .
its aid workers on the ground had described the camps as " prisons under the open sky , " the group said .
calls for political solution the criticism comes amid fierce international condemnation of colombo 's handling of the crisis .
heavy fighting broke out between government troops and tamil tigers in the last rebel stronghold in the northeast in the past months .
thousands of civilians were reportedly caught in the crossfire .
earlier this week , the european union called for an independent inquiry into alleged human rights abuses by both sides .
the rebels started fighting in the 1970s for a separate state – eelam – for tamils in sri lanka 's north and east , complaining that tamils had been discriminated against by successive majority sinhalese governments .
the conflict has killed an estimated 80,000 people , displaced tens of thousands more and put a brake on the island 's growth and economic development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sri lankans in colombo celebrating news of the end of the civil war this week calls are growing louder for a long-term political solution to the conflict in sri lanka and one that takes into account tamil aspirations .
the german government this week urged colombo to step up efforts to initiate a process of reconciliation with the tamil minority .
development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the government in sri lanka needed to do everything it could to heal the divisions in society and give the tamil population a chance to participate in the political process .
thadshayani sadagopan , a tamil student in bonn who has lived in germany for over 15 years , told deutsche welle that now more than ever , it was necessary to bring the two ethnic groups in sri lanka to the negotiating table .
" the real war only begins now , " sadagopan said , warning that the tamil tiger rebels may have laid down their weapons for now but " maybe in a year or two they could take up arms again " if real peace was not achieved .
" the two groups hate each other so much .
they ca n't really live with each other , " she said .

in reports published separately on thursday by zdf public television network and the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- newspaper and based on the historians ' findings , kurras had been in the service of the stasi secret police since 1955 and had been charged with spying on the west berlin police .
documents change a chapter in german history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters in munich in 1967 carrying a banner reading " benno ohnesorg - political murder " the documents found in the archives of the birthler agency - the authority which manages files from the former east germany - also contained a message radioed to kurras by the mfs after the fatal shooting of ohnesorg , which read : " destroy all material .
cease work for now .
view events as very regrettable accident . "
ohnesorg was shot to death in west berlin on june 2 , 1967 during a student protest against the shah of iran , who was visiting germany at the time .
his death triggered widespread and violent student protests across west germany and helped fuel sympathies for the militant red army faction and its up-and-coming first generation leaders , andreas baader , ulrike meinhof and gudrun ensslin .
espionage expert mueller-enbergs , told zdf that there were no clues in the stasi files that kurras had been explicitly told to liquidate ohnesorg .
after the shooting , kurras was tried for reckless manslaughter but acquitted due to a lack of evidence .

in reports published separately on thursday by zdf public television network and the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- newspaper and based on the historians ' findings , kurras had been in the service of the stasi secret police since 1955 and had been charged with spying on the west berlin police .

ohnesorg was shot to death in west berlin on june 2 , 1967 during a student protest against the shah of iran , who was visiting germany at the time .
his death triggered widespread and violent student protests across west germany and helped fuel sympathies for the militant red army faction and its up-and-coming first generation leaders , andreas baader , ulrike meinhof and gudrun ensslin .
espionage expert mueller-enbergs , told zdf that there were no clues in the stasi files that kurras had been explicitly told to liquidate ohnesorg .

the senate voted 90-6 to strip the $ 80 million -lrb- 58 million euros -rrb- obama requested for the closing of the guantanamo bay prison from spending legislation for the wars in iraq and afghanistan .
this sharp rebuke puts obama in a political tight spot at home and abroad and could get in the way of the fulfilment of his promise to close the prison in the first year of his presidency .
obama signed the executive order calling for the closure on january 22 , just days after taking office , proving that he was serious about reversing some of the controversial policies of his predecessor george w. bush .
but now obama has just months to decide what to do with the 240 remaining inmates , many of whom have not been charged .
" we 've made some hasty decisions that are now going to take some time to unwind , " said presidential spokesman robert gibbs .
" and closing guantanamo bay , obviously , is one of those decisions . "
criticism from all sides while obama 's move to close the prison was welcomed internationally , many americans are skittish about having these suspected terrorists in their own states .
fearing a backlash from these voters , members of the senate and house of representatives from both parties have resisted bringing the detainees into the us .
" democrats under no circumstances will move forward without a comprehensive , responsible plan from the president , " said senate majority leader harry reid .
" we will never allow terrorists to be released into the united states . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the inmates have yet to be charged fbi director robert mueller also has concerns about bringing the detainees into the american prison system .
" the concerns we have about individuals who may support terrorism being in the united states run from concerns about providing financing to terrorists , radicalizing others with regard to violent extremism , the potential for individuals undertaking attacks in the united states , " mueller said .
mueller said he hoped obama 's speech would " outline a comprehensive strategy for keeping america safe . "
obama has also come under fire for reversing his position on other related issues .
many obama supporters and civil liberties groups were angered when he announced plans to re-institute bush-era military tribunals for terror suspects and to block the release of photos of prisoner abuse in iraq and afghanistan .
little support from europe obama 's failure to persuade his fellow americans to accept guantanamo inmates into their country could further undermine his administration 's efforts to get allies in europe to take in some of the detainees themselves .
since obama took office , one man has been transferred to britain and another to france , but other european nations have either refused entirely or given conflicting responses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is n't sure former guantanamo bay inmates belong in europe while germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has said germany would consider taking in former inmates , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has repeatedly spoken out against the idea .
the us has pushed germany to take in a group of inmates of china 's uigher minority , a mainly muslim group that beijing considers terrorists .
munich , in the southern german state bavaria , is home to around 500 uighurs , the largest known community in exile .

the senate voted 90-6 to strip the $ 80 million -lrb- 58 million euros -rrb- obama requested for the closing of the guantanamo bay prison from spending legislation for the wars in iraq and afghanistan .
this sharp rebuke puts obama in a political tight spot at home and abroad and could get in the way of the fulfilment of his promise to close the prison in the first year of his presidency .
obama signed the executive order calling for the closure on january 22 , just days after taking office , proving that he was serious about reversing some of the controversial policies of his predecessor george w. bush .
but now obama has just months to decide what to do with the 240 remaining inmates , many of whom have not been charged .
" we 've made some hasty decisions that are now going to take some time to unwind , " said presidential spokesman robert gibbs .
" and closing guantanamo bay , obviously , is one of those decisions . "
criticism from all sides while obama 's move to close the prison was welcomed internationally , many americans are skittish about having these suspected terrorists in their own states .
fearing a backlash from these voters , members of the senate and house of representatives from both parties have resisted bringing the detainees into the us .
" democrats under no circumstances will move forward without a comprehensive , responsible plan from the president , " said senate majority leader harry reid .
" we will never allow terrorists to be released into the united states . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the inmates have yet to be charged fbi director robert mueller also has concerns about bringing the detainees into the american prison system .
" the concerns we have about individuals who may support terrorism being in the united states run from concerns about providing financing to terrorists , radicalizing others with regard to violent extremism , the potential for individuals undertaking attacks in the united states , " mueller said .
mueller said he hoped obama 's speech would " outline a comprehensive strategy for keeping america safe . "
obama has also come under fire for reversing his position on other related issues .
many obama supporters and civil liberties groups were angered when he announced plans to re-institute bush-era military tribunals for terror suspects and to block the release of photos of prisoner abuse in iraq and afghanistan .
little support from europe obama 's failure to persuade his fellow americans to accept guantanamo inmates into their country could further undermine his administration 's efforts to get allies in europe to take in some of the detainees themselves .
since obama took office , one man has been transferred to britain and another to france , but other european nations have either refused entirely or given conflicting responses .

after wednesday 's deadline for potential bidders , however , a chinese company has now expressed its interest . spiegel online , the web edition of the german weekly der spiegel , cited internal gm documents saying that the canadian auto-parts maker was favored for its technological know-how , which it displayed in developing the all-terrain bmw x3 model .
the magazine said that financial investor rhj international was second on gm 's list and fiat , the italian carmaker , was third .
the us daily detroit news , meanwhile , cited sources close to the matter as saying that gm preferred magna to the other two because opel employees considered the canadian firm less likely to close factories .
gm europe has not confirmed the reports .

the court said mills had given false testimony to protect berlusconi and his fininvest holding group .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 21.05.2009 at cannes , germany plays up co-production skills großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany funded tarantino 's " inglourious basterds , " which stars brad pitt with three co-productions in the competition section at cannes this year , germany is seeking to burnish its credentials as a major global film player and promote itself as a sought-after movie-making destination . where are the german films at cannes ?
it 's a question being asked in the german media as critics look in vain for heavyweight names , such as directors fatih akin -lrb- " head-on " -rrb- and florian von donnersmarck -lrb- " the life of others " -rrb- at the european film industry 's most prestigious and glitzy event .
at a time when german films have tasted nearly unprecedented domestic and international success , with nominations and prizes reaching right up to the gilded oscars , the absence of german film stars at cannes is all the more galling , so the argument goes .
but experts in the film business say looking for a strictly " german " film at cannes is pointless at a time when movie-making has long transcended geographical borders .
" this whole discussion in the media – particularly in the german media – about whether there 's a ' german ' film among the productions is totally obsolete , " christian berg from the media board berlin brandenburg told deutsche welle .
" we live in a globalized world today ; almost all films are produced internationally .
we have to learn to be proud of our german co-productions and represent them as ours . "
nazi slayer film gets big-bucks german funding " co-productions " is indeed the buzzword at cannes now that studios are reeling under the global financial crisis , budgets are being cut and filmmakers and studios are looking for ways to beat the recession .
germany has three star-studded co-productions in the running for the prestigious palme d 'or this year - quentin tarantino 's " inglourious basterds , " lars von trier 's " antichrist " and austrian director michael haneke 's " the white ribbon . "
all three were largely financed by german production companies , some star german actors and one was shot entirely in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : star power - tarantino , second from left , with part of the cast from " inglourious basterds " us director tarantino 's gangster flick and wartime caper , starring brad pitt as the leader of a ruthless gang of nazi slayers , was the most keenly awaited film at cannes on wednesday .
shot in english , german and french , " inglourious basterds " also features 45 german actors , including stars daniel bruehl , til schweiger and martin wuttke .
the film received a whopping 7.5 million euros -lrb- $ 10.3 million -rrb- in funding from germany . the film 's executive producer says it 's this kind of support that has made germany a favorite location for international film projects . " these productions are a great springboard for everyone involved in the making of films , from the actors to directors , camera operators , lighting directors and producers – if those positions are filled by local people , " carl woebcken of studio babelsberg said .
" it 's great for them to be able to use the skills they 've learned working on german productions and it leads to an improvement in the standards of german films , too . "
" a force to be reckoned with " " antichrist , " acclaimed danish director lars von trier 's latest film debuting at cannes , features willem dafoe and charlotte gainsbourg in a domestic tragedy loaded with graphic sex , torture and mutilation .
the film was shot entirely in forests in the state of north-rhine westphalia in western germany and produced by a german company .
" the difficult thing was to find the forest , and then the logistics .
when you 're filming 40 days in the woods you have to deal with everything from wastewater disposal to power supplies .
we had a hundred people .
we had to do all that without damaging the forest , " bettina brokemper who organized the on-location filming told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : director lars von trier , center , with willem dafoe and charlotte gainsbourg " but we found the location , and we had a reputation for doing a precise job .
and lars also has a very precise way of working . "
" the white ribbon , " the only german-language film in the competition at cannes , is a darkly disturbing portrait of a protestant village in northern germany in 1913 . it too was largely bankrolled by a german production company .
in addition , three other films in other categories at cannes are german co-productions .
that is proof enough , some say , of germany capitalizing on its strengths as a global film production and organization hub .
" it really is a reflection of the boom in german films in recent years , " german producer alfred huermer told deutsche welle .
" we are now a serious force to be reckoned with in the whole world as a country for co-productions . " sp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's a question being asked in the german media as critics look in vain for heavyweight names , such as directors fatih akin -lrb- " head-on " -rrb- and florian von donnersmarck -lrb- " the life of others " -rrb- at the european film industry 's most prestigious and glitzy event .
at a time when german films have tasted nearly unprecedented domestic and international success , with nominations and prizes reaching right up to the gilded oscars , the absence of german film stars at cannes is all the more galling , so the argument goes .
but experts in the film business say looking for a strictly " german " film at cannes is pointless at a time when movie-making has long transcended geographical borders .
" this whole discussion in the media – particularly in the german media – about whether there 's a ' german ' film among the productions is totally obsolete , " christian berg from the media board berlin brandenburg told deutsche welle .
" we live in a globalized world today ; almost all films are produced internationally .
we have to learn to be proud of our german co-productions and represent them as ours . "
nazi slayer film gets big-bucks german funding " co-productions " is indeed the buzzword at cannes now that studios are reeling under the global financial crisis , budgets are being cut and filmmakers and studios are looking for ways to beat the recession .
germany has three star-studded co-productions in the running for the prestigious palme d 'or this year - quentin tarantino 's " inglourious basterds , " lars von trier 's " antichrist " and austrian director michael haneke 's " the white ribbon . "
all three were largely financed by german production companies , some star german actors and one was shot entirely in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : star power - tarantino , second from left , with part of the cast from " inglourious basterds " us director tarantino 's gangster flick and wartime caper , starring brad pitt as the leader of a ruthless gang of nazi slayers , was the most keenly awaited film at cannes on wednesday .
shot in english , german and french , " inglourious basterds " also features 45 german actors , including stars daniel bruehl , til schweiger and martin wuttke .
the film received a whopping 7.5 million euros -lrb- $ 10.3 million -rrb- in funding from germany . the film 's executive producer says it 's this kind of support that has made germany a favorite location for international film projects . " these productions are a great springboard for everyone involved in the making of films , from the actors to directors , camera operators , lighting directors and producers – if those positions are filled by local people , " carl woebcken of studio babelsberg said .
" it 's great for them to be able to use the skills they 've learned working on german productions and it leads to an improvement in the standards of german films , too . "
" a force to be reckoned with " " antichrist , " acclaimed danish director lars von trier 's latest film debuting at cannes , features willem dafoe and charlotte gainsbourg in a domestic tragedy loaded with graphic sex , torture and mutilation .
the film was shot entirely in forests in the state of north-rhine westphalia in western germany and produced by a german company .
" the difficult thing was to find the forest , and then the logistics .
when you 're filming 40 days in the woods you have to deal with everything from wastewater disposal to power supplies .
we had a hundred people .
we had to do all that without damaging the forest , " bettina brokemper who organized the on-location filming told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : director lars von trier , center , with willem dafoe and charlotte gainsbourg " but we found the location , and we had a reputation for doing a precise job .
and lars also has a very precise way of working . "
" the white ribbon , " the only german-language film in the competition at cannes , is a darkly disturbing portrait of a protestant village in northern germany in 1913 . it too was largely bankrolled by a german production company .
in addition , three other films in other categories at cannes are german co-productions .
that is proof enough , some say , of germany capitalizing on its strengths as a global film production and organization hub .
" it really is a reflection of the boom in german films in recent years , " german producer alfred huermer told deutsche welle .
" we are now a serious force to be reckoned with in the whole world as a country for co-productions . " sp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the timing suggests the launch was made with a wider impact in mind . us defense secretary robert gates provided the first official us confirmation that iran had test-fired a missile on wednesday .
gates said the missile had a range of 2,000 to 2,500 kilometers and would therefore be able to hit targets in israel , us bases in the middle east , and parts of central and eastern europe .
the us confirmation came after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad announced that a sejil-2 missile had reached its intended target , without specifying the range of the missile .
he said in a speech in semnan , which lies in north- eastern iran and where he said the missile was launched , that the sejil-2 was more advanced than previous missiles .
while further details are sketchy , this is said to be the longest-range missile iran has ever launched , raising concerns about the sophistication of tehran 's missile program – and its timing .
us-russian scientists this week said in a report that they believe that iran is at least five years away from being able to fire a ballistic missile equipped with a nuclear warhead that can cover long distances launch coincides with three key international developments every time iran launches a missile , " it is in response to a particular event , " andrew brookes , of the international institute of strategic studies think-tank in london told reuters .
this test coincides with three major events .
it comes after the first positive meeting between us president barack obama and prime minister benjamin netanyahu .
netanyahu has said that iran is the " gravest " threat in the middle east .
the us accuses iran of harboring nuclear ambitions and is preparing to make nuclear weapons .
obama has offered direct diplomacy with iran and said he expects a positive response by the end of this year .
israel 's deputy foreign minister , danny ayalon , said on israeli military radio that the latest missile tests has not changed the threat-level for israel , but that " europeans should be concerned " and warned that iran was trying to develop missiles that could eventually reach the us east coast .
test comes amid key us-russia arms talks the missile test was also conducted on the same day that the united states and russia wrapped up the first round of talks to discuss a successor to the 1991 strategic arms reduction treaty , or start .
the landmark cold war-era nuclear disarmament treaty expires in december and any new deal will have far-reaching implications for global security .
moscow insists any new treaty must take missile defense into account .
the us has plans to install parts of a global missile shield in eastern europe to fend off any attacks from iran .
moscow however is not convinced by this explanation .
us president obama will meet with his russian counterpart dmitry medvedev in moscow to discuss this and other key issues at the next round of start talks in july .
missile boost to presidential election campaign last but not least , the missile test comes just weeks ahead of the june 12 presidential elections in iran .
analysts told ap that the launch was likely " intended for domestic consumption ahead of those elections , rather than a message to the us . "

the timing suggests the launch was made with a wider impact in mind . us defense secretary robert gates provided the first official us confirmation that iran had test-fired a missile on wednesday .
gates said the missile had a range of 2,000 to 2,500 kilometers and would therefore be able to hit targets in israel , us bases in the middle east , and parts of central and eastern europe .
the us confirmation came after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad announced that a sejil-2 missile had reached its intended target , without specifying the range of the missile .
he said in a speech in semnan , which lies in north- eastern iran and where he said the missile was launched , that the sejil-2 was more advanced than previous missiles .
while further details are sketchy , this is said to be the longest-range missile iran has ever launched , raising concerns about the sophistication of tehran 's missile program – and its timing .
us-russian scientists this week said in a report that they believe that iran is at least five years away from being able to fire a ballistic missile equipped with a nuclear warhead that can cover long distances launch coincides with three key international developments every time iran launches a missile , " it is in response to a particular event , " andrew brookes , of the international institute of strategic studies think-tank in london told reuters .
this test coincides with three major events .
it comes after the first positive meeting between us president barack obama and prime minister benjamin netanyahu .
netanyahu has said that iran is the " gravest " threat in the middle east .
the us accuses iran of harboring nuclear ambitions and is preparing to make nuclear weapons .
obama has offered direct diplomacy with iran and said he expects a positive response by the end of this year .
israel 's deputy foreign minister , danny ayalon , said on israeli military radio that the latest missile tests has not changed the threat-level for israel , but that " europeans should be concerned " and warned that iran was trying to develop missiles that could eventually reach the us east coast .
test comes amid key us-russia arms talks the missile test was also conducted on the same day that the united states and russia wrapped up the first round of talks to discuss a successor to the 1991 strategic arms reduction treaty , or start .
the landmark cold war-era nuclear disarmament treaty expires in december and any new deal will have far-reaching implications for global security .
moscow insists any new treaty must take missile defense into account .
the us has plans to install parts of a global missile shield in eastern europe to fend off any attacks from iran .
moscow however is not convinced by this explanation .
us president obama will meet with his russian counterpart dmitry medvedev in moscow to discuss this and other key issues at the next round of start talks in july .
missile boost to presidential election campaign last but not least , the missile test comes just weeks ahead of the june 12 presidential elections in iran .
analysts told ap that the launch was likely " intended for domestic consumption ahead of those elections , rather than a message to the us . "
of the three main rivals , iran 's former prime minister , mir-hossein moussavi , is widely considered to be ahmadinejad 's main challenger .

the summit was originally scheduled to take place five months ago but was delayed by china after french president sarkozy met with the exiled tibetan spiritual leader the dalai lama .
disagreement over tibet has persisted , with china unwilling to commit to " freedom of speech and the rights of ethnic minorities , " one of the eu 's demands .
" the most important thing is to stick to the principles of mutual respect and non-interference in each others ' affairs , " wen politely but firmly said at a news conference after the summit .
the eu also failed to get china to agree to put pressure on burma 's junta to begin talks with pro-democracy forces and free opposition leader aung san suu kyi .
china also refused to join europe in condemning north korea 's april 5 missile test .
the two parties could not agree on a common approach to global warming , with the eu hoping china would commit to significantly reducing its carbon dioxide emissions by 2020 and china wanting more help for developing nations to cut their emissions and tougher standards for developed countries .
wen was unable to persuade the eu to lift its arms embargo against china or recognize the country as a market economy , a step that would bring big trade and investment benefits .
china and the eu are scheduled to revisit these divisive issues later in the year , just before a united nations conference to be held in december in copenhagen aimed at producing a global climate deal to succeed the kyoto protocol. hf / ap / dpa / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the senate voted 90-6 to strip the $ 80 million -lrb- 58 million euros -rrb- obama requested for the closing of the guantanamo bay prison from spending legislation for the wars in iraq and afghanistan .
this sharp rebuke puts obama in a political tight spot at home and abroad and could get in the way of the fulfilment of his promise to close the prison in the first year of his presidency .
obama signed the executive order calling for the closure on january 22 , just days after taking office , proving that he was serious about reversing some of the controversial policies of his predecessor george w. bush .
but now obama has just months to decide what to do with the 240 remaining inmates , many of whom have not been charged .
" we 've made some hasty decisions that are now going to take some time to unwind , " said presidential spokesman robert gibbs .
" and closing guantanamo bay , obviously , is one of those decisions . "
criticism from all sides while obama 's move to close the prison was welcomed internationally , many americans are skittish about having these suspected terrorists in their own states .
fearing a backlash from these voters , members of the senate and house of representatives from both parties have resisted bringing the detainees into the us .
" democrats under no circumstances will move forward without a comprehensive , responsible plan from the president , " said senate majority leader harry reid .
" we will never allow terrorists to be released into the united states . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the inmates have yet to be charged fbi director robert mueller also has concerns about bringing the detainees into the american prison system .
" the concerns we have about individuals who may support terrorism being in the united states run from concerns about providing financing to terrorists , radicalizing others with regard to violent extremism , the potential for individuals undertaking attacks in the united states , " mueller said .
mueller said he hoped obama 's speech would " outline a comprehensive strategy for keeping america safe . "
obama has also come under fire for reversing his position on other related issues .
many obama supporters and civil liberties groups were angered when he announced plans to re-institute bush-era military tribunals for terror suspects and to block the release of photos of prisoner abuse in iraq and afghanistan .
little support from europe obama 's failure to persuade his fellow americans to accept guantanamo inmates into their country could further undermine his administration 's efforts to get allies in europe to take in some of the detainees themselves .
since obama took office , one man has been transferred to britain and another to france , but other european nations have either refused entirely or given conflicting responses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is n't sure former guantanamo bay inmates belong in europe while germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has said germany would consider taking in former inmates , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has repeatedly spoken out against the idea .
the us has pushed germany to take in a group of inmates of china 's uigher minority , a mainly muslim group that beijing considers terrorists .
munich , in the southern german state bavaria , is home to around 500 uighurs , the largest known community in exile .
steinmeier , who is running as the social democrats ' candidate for chancellor this year , told the news magazine der spiegel this week that accepting any large number of uighers would create political tensions with the chinese government. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the summit was originally scheduled to take place five months ago but was delayed by china after french president sarkozy met with the exiled tibetan spiritual leader the dalai lama .
disagreement over tibet has persisted , with china unwilling to commit to " freedom of speech and the rights of ethnic minorities , " one of the eu 's demands .
" the most important thing is to stick to the principles of mutual respect and non-interference in each others ' affairs , " wen politely but firmly said at a news conference after the summit .
the eu also failed to get china to agree to put pressure on burma 's junta to begin talks with pro-democracy forces and free opposition leader aung san suu kyi .
china also refused to join europe in condemning north korea 's april 5 missile test .
the two parties could not agree on a common approach to global warming , with the eu hoping china would commit to significantly reducing its carbon dioxide emissions by 2020 and china wanting more help for developing nations to cut their emissions and tougher standards for developed countries .
wen was unable to persuade the eu to lift its arms embargo against china or recognize the country as a market economy , a step that would bring big trade and investment benefits .
china and the eu are scheduled to revisit these divisive issues later in the year , just before a united nations conference to be held in december in copenhagen aimed at producing a global climate deal to succeed the kyoto protocol. hf / ap / dpa / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in reports published separately on thursday by zdf public television network and the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- newspaper and based on the historians ' findings , kurras had been in the service of the stasi secret police since 1955 and had been charged with spying on the west berlin police .
documents change a chapter in german history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters in munich in 1967 carrying a banner reading " benno ohnesorg - political murder " the documents found in the archives of the birthler agency - the authority which manages files from the former east germany - also contained a message radioed to kurras by the mfs after the fatal shooting of ohnesorg , which read : " destroy all material .
cease work for now .
view events as very regrettable accident . "
ohnesorg was shot to death in west berlin on june 2 , 1967 during a student protest against the shah of iran , who was visiting germany at the time .
his death triggered widespread and violent student protests across west germany and helped fuel sympathies for the militant red army faction and its up-and-coming first generation leaders , andreas baader , ulrike meinhof and gudrun ensslin .
espionage expert mueller-enbergs , told zdf that there were no clues in the stasi files that kurras had been explicitly told to liquidate ohnesorg .
after the shooting , kurras was tried for reckless manslaughter but acquitted due to a lack of evidence .
the new information raises the question : what would have happened to the german student protest movement of the late 1960s had people known that ohnesorg 's killer had been a spy for communist east germany ? gb / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it said suppliers were also reluctant to supply stock because of the reports surrounding its financial troubles .
jjb added that it was further being hit by the weak trading environment .
the firm said like-for-like sales in the 16 weeks to 17 may were 23 % lower than the same time last year .
jjb has also released its full-year results for the 12 months to 25 january on thursday , reporting that its made a pre-tax loss of £ 189m , compared with a profit of £ 11m the year before .
lower debts the retailer is continuing efforts to restructure is finances through a company voluntary agreement -lrb- cva -rrb- with its landlords and creditors .
the cva was agreed last month and is now due to be implemented on 28 may , baring any legal challenge .
it will mean the firm has to pay less debts on its 140 closed stores .
jjb has already been granted a temporary extension on its loan payments , and has sold off its gym business to raise funds .
its main creditors include barclays , hbos and kaupthing banks .

nick griffin will accompany richard barnbrook , a bnp member of the london assembly , at the event on 21 july , mr barnbrook has said .
all members of the assembly have been invited to the event .
buckingham palace said no invitations had yet been issued for any of this summer 's garden parties .
a palace spokesman said : " the queen does not scrutinise and is not consulted on the list of accompanying guest names as they are official not personal invitations and as such , buckingham palace relies entirely on the nominating organisations .
" where a guest is not judged to be a direct threat to security , as judged by the police , an invitation would be issued . "
' political stunt ' mr barnbrook said he imagined there would be a " to-do and a hoot " over the invite but claimed " these things are going to happen more and more as the party goes forward " .
the bnp is accused by its opponents of stirring up racial hatred .
the party says it is standing up for britain 's " indigenous population " .
it campaigns for the " voluntary resettlement " of non-white british citizens to their country of ethnic origin and preferential treatment in the jobs market for british workers .
mr johnson has urged the chairman of the london assembly to withdraw the invitation news of the royal garden party invite comes two days after mr barnbrook attended the wembley launch of england 's bid to host the 2018 world cup finals .
all elected members of the london assembly were invited to the launch .
prime minister gordon brown and the fa chairman lord triesman spoke at the event , putting an emphasis on diversity .
london mayor boris johnson accused mr barnbrook of turning the buckingham palace garden party into a " political stunt " .
he urged darren johnson , chair of the london assembly , to intervene and withdraw the invitation .
he said : " we can not tolerate any such abuse of the invitation or any potential embarrassment to her majesty .
" i am therefore writing to call on you to inform mr barnbrook - at the earliest opportunity - that he must either bring a guest who will not provoke political controversy , or consider his invitation rescinded . "

" where a guest is not judged to be a direct threat to security , as judged by the police , an invitation would be issued . "
' political stunt ' mr barnbrook said he imagined there would be a " to-do and a hoot " over the invite but claimed " these things are going to happen more and more as the party goes forward " .
the bnp is accused by its opponents of stirring up racial hatred .
the party says it is standing up for britain 's " indigenous population " .
it campaigns for the " voluntary resettlement " of non-white british citizens to their country of ethnic origin and preferential treatment in the jobs market for british workers .
mr johnson has urged the chairman of the london assembly to withdraw the invitation news of the royal garden party invite comes two days after mr barnbrook attended the wembley launch of england 's bid to host the 2018 world cup finals .
all elected members of the london assembly were invited to the launch .
prime minister gordon brown and the fa chairman lord triesman spoke at the event , putting an emphasis on diversity .
london mayor boris johnson accused mr barnbrook of turning the buckingham palace garden party into a " political stunt " .
he urged darren johnson , chair of the london assembly , to intervene and withdraw the invitation .
he said : " we can not tolerate any such abuse of the invitation or any potential embarrassment to her majesty .
" i am therefore writing to call on you to inform mr barnbrook - at the earliest opportunity - that he must either bring a guest who will not provoke political controversy , or consider his invitation rescinded . "
