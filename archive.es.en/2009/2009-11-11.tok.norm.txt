they are also designed to improve the lot of women and increase environmental sustainability .
cambodia is seeing mixed progress as it tries to reach its nine targets .
while infant and child mortality have come down , maternal mortality rates remain high . a baby ’ s cry pierces the afternoon air at a maternity hospital in cambodia ’ s capital phnom penh .
in an important way , that is the sound of success .
cambodia has cut the rate of infants dying before their first birthday from around 95 per 1,000 live births a decade ago to 60 .
the target is 50 per 1,000 live births .
it is one of nine mdg targets that cambodia has signed up to .
dr lo veasnakiry , head of planning at the ministry of health , says progress towards meeting the mdg on child and infant mortality is in part due to the government ’ s commitment to maintaining health sector spending despite the global economic crisis .
it has also made efforts to improve access to child health services , and has received cash and technical assistance from health partners such as unicef , the united nations children ’ s fund .
malalay ahmadzai is the mother and child specialist at unicef .
she credits other factors too : " one has been the strong performance of the national immunisation programme .
second has been the improvement in breastfeeding practices , and that goes back to a lot of community work plus support to the health centres and so on . "
no progress on maternal mortality but with just a few years to go , cambodia could well miss six other mdg targets , including the one on maternal mortality .
a decade ago 460 women died in childbirth in cambodia for every 100,000 births .
the target is 140 and yet the rate has not come down .
why ?
dr lo explains that , to begin with , the target is very ambitious .
" from the global viewpoint , not only cambodia but a lot of countries have not made significant progress in terms of maternal deaths " , he says .
more resources needed a study found that more than half of the women who die in childbirth in cambodia succumb to massive blood loss .
another fifth die from eclampsia , that is high blood pressure .
they require a rapid response - and any delay can result in death .
" the first delay is decision-making in the family whether to seek care or not " , says unicef 's malalay ahmadzai .
" the second is costs , roads and access .
and third is the quality of care . "
cambodia needs more resources and more trained staff , and dr lo says that is starting to happen , but it won ’ t be enough .
that ’ s why he recently proposed that the government revise the target .
shifting the target is a controversial way of reaching it – but as dr lo points out , if cambodia can reach the revised target of 250 deaths per 100,000 births that would still mark a big improvement .

they are also designed to improve the lot of women and increase environmental sustainability .
cambodia is seeing mixed progress as it tries to reach its nine targets .
while infant and child mortality have come down , maternal mortality rates remain high . a baby ’ s cry pierces the afternoon air at a maternity hospital in cambodia ’ s capital phnom penh .
in an important way , that is the sound of success .
cambodia has cut the rate of infants dying before their first birthday from around 95 per 1,000 live births a decade ago to 60 .
the target is 50 per 1,000 live births .
it is one of nine mdg targets that cambodia has signed up to .
dr lo veasnakiry , head of planning at the ministry of health , says progress towards meeting the mdg on child and infant mortality is in part due to the government ’ s commitment to maintaining health sector spending despite the global economic crisis .
it has also made efforts to improve access to child health services , and has received cash and technical assistance from health partners such as unicef , the united nations children ’ s fund .
malalay ahmadzai is the mother and child specialist at unicef .
she credits other factors too : " one has been the strong performance of the national immunisation programme .
second has been the improvement in breastfeeding practices , and that goes back to a lot of community work plus support to the health centres and so on . "
no progress on maternal mortality but with just a few years to go , cambodia could well miss six other mdg targets , including the one on maternal mortality .
a decade ago 460 women died in childbirth in cambodia for every 100,000 births .
the target is 140 and yet the rate has not come down .
why ?
dr lo explains that , to begin with , the target is very ambitious .
" from the global viewpoint , not only cambodia but a lot of countries have not made significant progress in terms of maternal deaths " , he says .
more resources needed a study found that more than half of the women who die in childbirth in cambodia succumb to massive blood loss .
another fifth die from eclampsia , that is high blood pressure .
they require a rapid response - and any delay can result in death .
" the first delay is decision-making in the family whether to seek care or not " , says unicef 's malalay ahmadzai .
" the second is costs , roads and access .
and third is the quality of care . "
cambodia needs more resources and more trained staff , and dr lo says that is starting to happen , but it won ’ t be enough .
that ’ s why he recently proposed that the government revise the target .
shifting the target is a controversial way of reaching it – but as dr lo points out , if cambodia can reach the revised target of 250 deaths per 100,000 births that would still mark a big improvement .

although merkel is not the first german chancellor to attend armistice day events in france , her presence at the annual parade marking germany 's surrender , is unprecedented .
standing in paris 91 years after the end of world war i , angela merkel described the relationship between france and germany as " something special , something unique , " and urged " even closer " co-operation between the two countries .
an example to the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy in paris as their national flags fluttered in the wind , the two leaders vowed that their countries would never again go to war against each other .
merkel said that although the past could not be erased , the power of reconciliation helped to bear the burden of what has gone before .
" we show other countries in the world that it is possible to rise above the pain of the past , " merkel said .
the french president told the crowds that it was not an occasion to celebrate , but to remember .
" we are not commemorating the victory of one people over another but an ordeal that was equally terrible for each side , " sarkozy said .
he said germany and france had a duty to uphold .
" we owe it to the people of europe , to the people of the world , to act together . "
an official date in the calendar ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants to make november 11 a day for germany and france sarkozy has proposed making november 11 - which is already a national holiday in france - an official day of franco-german reconciliation .
in a statement , he said he thought the time had come " to join with angela merkel in paris to jointly commemorate the suffering and to honor the momory of the combatants and celebrate the peace of which they dreamed at the bottom of their trenches . "
but the idea of a joint day of reconciliation has received a mixed response from politicians in both countries .
french defense minister herve morin told the canal + television network that he did not welcome the suggestion . however , werner hoyer , minister of state at the german foreign ministry , described it as an exceptional gesture .
helmut kohl was invited by former french president jacques chirac to attend the 80th anniversary commemoration of the 1918 ceasefire in paris . although he accepted , by the time the day came he was no longer in office .
his successor gerhard schröder declined to attend . tkw / afp / ap / dpa editor : trinity hartman / susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more reserved players like enke are almost ignored in the footballing circus .
dw 's stefan nestler comments . the news of a suicide is shocking - always .
almost involuntarily we ask ourselves : was there really nothing that might have stopped this person taking his own life ?
did he send us any signals of his despair which we failed to notice ?
suddenly confronted by a life that ended too soon , we ask ourselves why .
robert enke was not one of those footballers who sought out every microphone in order to tell the world how important he was .
also , he was not the typical eccentric between the sticks , forever screaming at his defenders , like so many other goalkeepers .
he always seemed reserved and polite , a soft-spoken man .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan nestler in fact , his character was often cited as one of his biggest weaknesses as a keeper .
often the german press would call on enke to put more effort into asserting himself as germany 's number one goalkeeper , to make his own case more passionately and with more vigour in the media .
but that just was n't robert enke 's style .
quieter people like enke are often swamped in the melee that is the soccer circus , where only goals , points , and championships really matter .
to the winner , the spoils .
the loser is lucky to get a sympathetic grimace .
often the common opinion is that someone who earns millions every year for playing sports has nothing to grumble about .
but for robert enke , in both sports and his everyday life , things had not been running smoothly .
at some of the larger foreign clubs that hired him earlier in his career , fc barcelona for example , he spent almost all of his time warming the substitutes ' bench .
and much more recently , once he had finally seemed to establish himself clearly as germany 's number one goalkeeper , an illness stopped him in his tracks .
however the ebbs and flows of his sporting career seem almost banal when compared to what he had endured off the pitch , more specifically the death of his two-year-old daughter in 2006 .
we will never know if that was the catalyst for this tragedy , or whether the process began at another moment in time .
robert enke , the goalkeeper , has been analyzed in painstaking detail for years , however , it seems the wider world failed to even scratch the surface of robert enke , the man .
and now he 's gone .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de consumer affairs -pipe- 11.11.2009 dumpster diving stays on trend in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people see one rotten banana and throw the whole bunch away dumpster diving , once the pastime of squatters or the hard-up , has spawned a slew of nicknames ; freeganism , skipping , containering .
and it ’ s not just about necessity , it 's about ideology . dumpster divers are people who search for things that other people have thrown out that are still useful , can be eaten or recycled , and have value .
dumpster divers will not only pick up discarded items left outside people 's homes , but they will climb into dumpsters or bins at apartment buildings and behind shopping centers .
mostly , the so-called divers go about their scavenging under cover of darkness .
some , though , operate openly .
those who dumpster dive out of conviction consider it immoral in these times of economic crisis and widespread hunger that so much that still has value is thrown away .
according to the worldwatch institute in washington , between 30 and 40 percent of edible goods are discarded by supermarkets .
there are as yet , no official statistics for germany .
one man 's rubbish is another man 's treasure rasol eramouni and joerg bergstedt are two german dumpster divers .
armed with protective gloves and torches they set out for the night 's scavenge .
things to look out for : food where the sell-by date has only just expired , or food that is edible but where the packaging has been damaged .
twenty-eight year-old rasol is from syria , a country , he says , where people hardly throw anything away .
in this case rasol , who is unemployed , has joined the dumpster diving tradition out of financial necessity and says it 's a terrible waste , how much good stuff is being thrown away .
" poor people could live from what is discarded .
saving in these hard times ca n't hurt .
why should i walk past fresh bread or a box of good eggs ? "
hasan asks .
hasan has a family to provide for ; for others , like bergstedt , skipping or freeganism is a political statement .
" in some ways , containering has become pretty cool " " young people put on their che guevara hoodies and go containering for a couple of years , " bergstedt said .
bergstedt is one of the german spokespeople for containering .
he has been doing it for fifteen years .
and has managed to get by without spending a cent on basic living .
aside from his political convictions , bergstedt has an economic agenda .
consumerism is fuelled by supply and demand , he says .
if people such as himself do n't buy certain products , there will be no reason for the big supermarkets to keep ordering them .
in this way , bergstedt says , he can remain true to his convictions .
this , he says , is something that would n't be possible if he had to worry about getting to work every day .
the dumpster-diving movement started in the mid 1990s in the us .
the freegans used it as an expression against waste .
with the movement 's growing popularity , corporations have felt obliged to find a legal framework regulating how to deal with it .
in the us , for example , the foodstore chain 7-eleven has left it up to individual stores to decide whether they allow skipping .
in germany it is mostly considered illegal .
" if people trespass , " says lawyer michael biela-baetje , " then they are acting illegally according to paragraph 123 of the german basic law .
if the bin or skip is in a public space , then i assume that there is nothing illegal about it . "
opening a sealed bin to remove food is also illegal in germany and , if caught , the dumpster diver could be charged with theft , says biela-baetje .
this option is often used by supermarkets , which in many cases seal their bins or keep them in enclosed areas .
the larger german supermarkets , it seems , do not share the view that one man 's rubbish is another man 's treasure .
neither rewe nor the tengelmann group were prepared to comment .

growth expectations for the coming six months have improved for all countries that have adopted the euro , according to a statement released on the institute 's web site by ifo president hans-werner sinn .
ifo 's conclusion is based upon a poll of 265 economic experts , who warned that though growth is returning , current business conditions are still " quite unfavorable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sinn said growth was returning in most of europe " the economic expectations are especially optimistic in italy , germany and the netherlands , " wrote sinn , one of germany 's best-known economists , who added that some caution was still needed for spain and greece .
the economists expected ireland to be the only eurozone country where the economy worsened further in the next six months .
dollar and pound to stay weak those surveyed believed inflation was likely to rise from the 0.7 percent average expected for 2009 , with key interest rates rising to dampen inflationary pressures .
both the us dollar and british pound are expected to remain weak over the next six months , even though the economists believed the currencies to be " clearly undervalued . "
the dollar hit a 15-month low wednesday , trading at $ 1.5029 to the euro while gold set a new record high above $ 1,115 an ounce .

" there are signs of gradual economic revival coupled with low levels of inflation .

european stocks markets rallied wednesday , with london 's ftse index hitting a 2009 high of 5,300.98 points , a 1.22 percent rise from tuesday , after the bank of england said the strength of britain 's economic recovery was " highly uncertain . "

the national player suffered from depression . in a press conference on wednesday , enke 's doctor valentin markser said the soccer star had first come to him in 2003 when he was suffering from a fear of failure on the pitch .
the doctor said he had been treating the goalkeeper for depression since then and confirmed that enke had thought about suicide in the past . the soccer star 's widow , teresa enke , who also attended the press conference , said her husband experienced phases of depression . " i wanted to help him get through it , " she said .
" i tried to be there for him . " but enke always rejected any suggestion that his depression be treated in a hospital .
his widow said he was afraid that in doing so , he would run the risk of losing the couple 's adopted daughter . in his suicide note , enke is said to have apologized to his family and doctors for his decision to take his life and for not having been honest about the severity of his condition . a world cup favorite germany 's national team have called off their saturday match against chile .
" we need to be able to take a moment , " said theo zwanziger , head of the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- at an afternoon press conference .
" there 's no other option , " he said , adding that the decision was made by the dfb management in conjunction with the players . " we thought about playing the game as a farewell to robert , but it is clear it is too soon after this terrible news , " said team manager oliver bierhoff , who was visibly upset during the press conference . zwanziger said the players were already leaving the training complex and would not reconvene until sunday when they would train for next wednesday 's match against the ivory coast . although enke was considered one of the front-runners for the keeper position on the 2010 world cup squad , he was forced to miss the last four games for germany and several matches for hanover due to an intestinal infection and he had not been selected for germany 's friendly matches against chile and the ivory coast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim loew still favored enke for the world cup after sitting out for two months , enke returned to the pitch for hanover on october 31 against cologne .
his last match in the bundesliga came just two days before his death , a 2-2 draw against hamburg . german national coach joachim loew had said it was too early for enke to return to the squad after his illness .
nevertheless , loew had indicated that enke was still his favorite to be germany 's goalkeeper at the world cup finals in south africa next year . the infection , which caused enke to miss key world cup qualifying matches , was not the first personal hardship the goalkeeper faced in his lifetime .
in 2006 he and his wife suffered a personal tragedy with the death of their then two-year-old daughter due to a rare heart condition . german soccer mourns the response from the german soccer community has been both shock and sadness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candles for the goalkeeper " it is a tragedy , " martin kind , president of enke 's bundesliga club hanover 96 , said .
" you expect many things , but not something like that . ” dfb 's zwanziger said he was " stunned and full of sadness . " " we send our deepest sympathies to his wife and family .
robert enke was a wonderful person who had been dealt some tough cards , " he said . fc barcelona , one of enke 's former clubs , held a minute of silence for the german keeper ahead of their spanish cup match against cultural leonesa on tuesday night . in hanover , hundreds of the team 's fans gathered outside the club 's stadium to light candles and leave flowers . " he leaves behind a large hole in our lives , not only in hanover , but for soccer in germany , " said the team 's sports director joerg schmadtke . on wednesday evening , team colleagues and fans gathered for a service of remembrance in hanover .
enke 's funeral will be held on sunday .
during the next bundesliga matches a minute of silence will be held and black armbands will be worn in his honor . hf / tkw / mz / rb / dpa / afp / ap editor : nigel tandy / sh send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they hope to start service next year , but the bahn is trying to put the brakes on its rivals . the latest entrant to the german rail market is the berlin-based locomore , which will start scheduled service between cologne and hamburg next august using rolling stock that it is set to purchase from austria 's national railway .
the company , founded in 2007 by derek ladewig , has the backing of an american investment firm , the railroad development corporation -lrb- rdc -rrb- , reports wirtschaftswoche in its latest issue .
rdc chairman henry posner told the magazine that his company expects the locomore venture to take time before becoming profitable .
" we 're impatient managers , but patient investors , " posner told wirtschaftswoche .
the magazine reports ladewig plans to start a new firm that would run new rail routes between berlin and frankfurt and stuttgart and hamburg and has already applied for permits to operate the new routes starting 2011 .
unlike the cologne-hamburg route , which will feature different levels of service , ladewig said he hoped to apply budget airline ryanair 's one-class , no-frills business model to the new routes .
not the first competitor , and probably not the last bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : db and france 's sncf currently cooperate but sncf now wants to move into germany locomore is one of several firms eager to chip away at deutsche bahn 's dominance .
at the end of october , the french national railway sncf applied to enter the german market and plans to start running two rail lines from the westernmost french city of strasbourg to hamburg in 2011 under its keolis subsidiary .
one line will travel via cologne and hanover and the other will journey via leipzig and berlin instead .
sncf and deutsche bahn have been cooperating since 2007 on a series of high-speed routes between frankfurt , munich and stuttgart and paris .
the growing number of firms looking to challenge deutsche bahn 's long-time dominance comes as europe 's passenger railway markets are set to become deregulated in 2010 due to new european union rules .
some competition in regional markets already exists , with firms such as the french veolia transport providing short-run rail service across germany , as well as a longer route between rostock and leipzig .
access a struggle the challenge for all new entrants on the german market is how to work with deutsche bahn , which will continue to own and operate the infrastructure that locomore and sncf 's trains will run on through its db netz subsidiary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sncf plans to offer regular train service within germany by 2011 deutsche bahn is supposed to allow competitors access to its track network but has denied locomore 's request - against the wishes of german regulators .
the case is now in court , slowing locomore 's plans , which include purchasing an estimated 100 million euros worth of trains .
similar resistance has hit sncf 's rollout of train service in germany , prompting complaints to the european commission in brussels .
ironically , deutsche bahn hopes to expand its train service in france and has encountered similar setbacks in its efforts to gain access to the french market .
peter ramsauer , germany 's new transport minister , said in an interview november 2 that the french moves " could not go on . "
deutsche bahn employees say the entry of new companies into the rail market will hurt service and make train service " dangerous . "
alexander kirchner , who heads the rail workers union transnet said in an interview with the tagesspiegel newspaper that a price war is " unavoidable . "

eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs , joaquin almunia , said he thought the deadline was " fitting and realistic " .
the decision came as no surprise to germany , which is expecting a five percent hole in it budget next year .
earlier this week , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , told almunia that berlin would comply with eu targets , even though that will make it harder to push ahead with a reform of the german tax system .
almunia , who described schaeuble 's agreement as " extremely credible " , said he believed the german finance minister would find a way to harmonize planned tax cuts with the austerity measures necessary to meet the commission 's 2013 eu spending deadline .

spain and france were also set a 2013 deadline , although paris has repeatedly said it is unrealistic .
speaking in brussels on tuesday , french finance minister christine lagarde said that , while 2015 was too late , 2012 was clearly too soon .
" between the two , there is 2013 and 2014 , " lagarde said .
" it is obvious that 2014 already represents a fine effort - i think 2013 will be extremely difficult . "
tailor-made deadlines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recession in britain has forced many businesses to stop trading but 2013 is the date the commission has set for paris .
italy and belgium have until 2012 to get their books in order , while ireland has been granted until 2014 and britain , which has suffered particularly badly as a result of the recession , until 2015 .
the commission 's suggestions have to be accepted by finance ministers , and countries which do not meet the targets risk hefty fines .
greece is now inching closer to that point .
on wednesday , almunia proposed a tougher stance towards athens , which he said had not taken any " effective steps " towards reducing its budget deficit or finding a balance in the greek economy. tkw / ap / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

although merkel is not the first german chancellor to attend armistice day events in france , her presence at the annual parade marking germany 's surrender , is unprecedented .

merkel said that although the past could not be erased , the power of reconciliation helped to bear the burden of what has gone before .
" we show other countries in the world that it is possible to rise above the pain of the past , " merkel said .
the french president told the crowds that it was not an occasion to celebrate , but to remember .
" we are not commemorating the victory of one people over another but an ordeal that was equally terrible for each side , " sarkozy said .
he said germany and france had a duty to uphold .
" we owe it to the people of europe , to the people of the world , to act together . "

in a statement , he said he thought the time had come " to join with angela merkel in paris to jointly commemorate the suffering and to honor the momory of the combatants and celebrate the peace of which they dreamed at the bottom of their trenches . "
but the idea of a joint day of reconciliation has received a mixed response from politicians in both countries .
french defense minister herve morin told the canal + television network that he did not welcome the suggestion . however , werner hoyer , minister of state at the german foreign ministry , described it as an exceptional gesture .

this after supply shortfalls . new health minister philipp roesler said vaccine manufacturer glaxosmithkline -lrb- gsk -rrb- had assured delegates at the emergency flu summit on wednesday , november 11 , that the company was working toward overcoming the shortages the pharmaceuticals giant had pledged to deliver 20 million doses of pandemrix by the end of the year , said roesler .
" these figures already make clear that not everyone can be vaccinated , " he conceded .
" it is now important that not everyone runs to the vaccination points . "
health minister of rhineland-palatinate , malu dreyer , said members of the emergency services would be prioritized .
the chronically will be next in line .
" you do n't have to go out and get vaccinated tomorrow , " said dreyer .
patients sent home earlier this week many germans arriving in doctors ' practices to be vaccinated had to be sent home because of the delivery shortfalls . germany 's state ministers , a representative of the vaccine manufacturer glaxosmithkline -lrb- gsk -rrb- and the heads of two public health institutes were at the summit on wednesday , november 11 , which was convened after reports of shortages in some regions .
after the meeting , thueringen 's health minister said 150,000 adjuvant-free doses of the vaccine would be available for pregnant women in december .
the presence of adjuvants , additives designed to strengthen the active ingredients , in the gsk vaccine have been a cause of concern in germany .
taubert cautioned that there was no cause for hysteria .
she said new supplies of the vaccine would also be delivered in january and february .
ahead of the summit , the state health minister of saxon-anhalt , gerlinde kuppe , called on the pharmaceutical industry to issue reliable figures so that states know how much vaccine they can count on .
" we ca n't accept the vague announcements from week to week that supplies could drop again or they could rise again , " said kuppe .
demand far outstrips supply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the new health minister 's first big challenge up to now , german states have only received around half of the vaccine they were expecting from pharmaceutical company glaxosmithkline -lrb- gsk -rrb- , according to thueringen health ministry 's department head , heinz fracke .
in some areas , the situation is more extreme than others .
the health ministry of germany 's most populous state north rhine-westphalia said it would next week only be receiving 120,000 of the 420,000 doses that it had ordered . roesler told german television on tuesday that he was confident that the required protection could be put in place .
" regional difficulties can arise even in the case of optimum production .
that is why i am appealing for patience , " he said .
" the sector is making an effort and the states are putting on a strong show locally . " gsk spokesman markus hardenblicker said that the guaranteed quotas had been met and that the states were being informed a week in advance of the amount of vaccine that they would be receiving .
he said figures issued in july had been non-binding .
the pharmaceutical company spokesman also said significantly higher levels of supplies of the pandemrix vaccine would be delivered at the end of november and start of december .
however , the company has admitted that there had been initial production difficulties .
germans put skepticism aside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there has been a rise in demand for the flu jab in september a study found that 62 percent of germans polled would not get vaccinated because of concerns about possible side effects . but the demand for vaccination has risen over the last few days after infection rates doubled in one week .
the robert koch institute has now registered more than 40,000 cases and recorded 12 deaths up to november 9 .

this after supply shortfalls . new health minister philipp roesler said vaccine manufacturer glaxosmithkline -lrb- gsk -rrb- had assured delegates at the emergency flu summit on wednesday , november 11 , that the company was working toward overcoming the shortages the pharmaceuticals giant had pledged to deliver 20 million doses of pandemrix by the end of the year , said roesler .
" these figures already make clear that not everyone can be vaccinated , " he conceded .
" it is now important that not everyone runs to the vaccination points . "
health minister of rhineland-palatinate , malu dreyer , said members of the emergency services would be prioritized .
the chronically will be next in line .
" you do n't have to go out and get vaccinated tomorrow , " said dreyer .
patients sent home earlier this week many germans arriving in doctors ' practices to be vaccinated had to be sent home because of the delivery shortfalls . germany 's state ministers , a representative of the vaccine manufacturer glaxosmithkline -lrb- gsk -rrb- and the heads of two public health institutes were at the summit on wednesday , november 11 , which was convened after reports of shortages in some regions .
after the meeting , thueringen 's health minister said 150,000 adjuvant-free doses of the vaccine would be available for pregnant women in december .
the presence of adjuvants , additives designed to strengthen the active ingredients , in the gsk vaccine have been a cause of concern in germany .
taubert cautioned that there was no cause for hysteria .
she said new supplies of the vaccine would also be delivered in january and february .
ahead of the summit , the state health minister of saxon-anhalt , gerlinde kuppe , called on the pharmaceutical industry to issue reliable figures so that states know how much vaccine they can count on .

in some areas , the situation is more extreme than others .
the health ministry of germany 's most populous state north rhine-westphalia said it would next week only be receiving 120,000 of the 420,000 doses that it had ordered . roesler told german television on tuesday that he was confident that the required protection could be put in place .
" regional difficulties can arise even in the case of optimum production .
that is why i am appealing for patience , " he said .
" the sector is making an effort and the states are putting on a strong show locally . " gsk spokesman markus hardenblicker said that the guaranteed quotas had been met and that the states were being informed a week in advance of the amount of vaccine that they would be receiving .
he said figures issued in july had been non-binding .
the pharmaceutical company spokesman also said significantly higher levels of supplies of the pandemrix vaccine would be delivered at the end of november and start of december .
however , the company has admitted that there had been initial production difficulties .
germans put skepticism aside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there has been a rise in demand for the flu jab in september a study found that 62 percent of germans polled would not get vaccinated because of concerns about possible side effects . but the demand for vaccination has risen over the last few days after infection rates doubled in one week .

almost involuntarily we ask ourselves : was there really nothing that might have stopped this person taking his own life ?

robert enke was not one of those footballers who sought out every microphone in order to tell the world how important he was .
also , he was not the typical eccentric between the sticks , forever screaming at his defenders , like so many other goalkeepers .
he always seemed reserved and polite , a soft-spoken man .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan nestler in fact , his character was often cited as one of his biggest weaknesses as a keeper .
often the german press would call on enke to put more effort into asserting himself as germany 's number one goalkeeper , to make his own case more passionately and with more vigour in the media .
but that just was n't robert enke 's style .
quieter people like enke are often swamped in the melee that is the soccer circus , where only goals , points , and championships really matter .

the loser is lucky to get a sympathetic grimace .
often the common opinion is that someone who earns millions every year for playing sports has nothing to grumble about .
but for robert enke , in both sports and his everyday life , things had not been running smoothly .
at some of the larger foreign clubs that hired him earlier in his career , fc barcelona for example , he spent almost all of his time warming the substitutes ' bench .
and much more recently , once he had finally seemed to establish himself clearly as germany 's number one goalkeeper , an illness stopped him in his tracks .
however the ebbs and flows of his sporting career seem almost banal when compared to what he had endured off the pitch , more specifically the death of his two-year-old daughter in 2006 .
we will never know if that was the catalyst for this tragedy , or whether the process began at another moment in time .
robert enke , the goalkeeper , has been analyzed in painstaking detail for years , however , it seems the wider world failed to even scratch the surface of robert enke , the man .

the national player suffered from depression . in a press conference on wednesday , enke 's doctor valentin markser said the soccer star had first come to him in 2003 when he was suffering from a fear of failure on the pitch .
the doctor said he had been treating the goalkeeper for depression since then and confirmed that enke had thought about suicide in the past . the soccer star 's widow , teresa enke , who also attended the press conference , said her husband experienced phases of depression . " i wanted to help him get through it , " she said .
" i tried to be there for him . " but enke always rejected any suggestion that his depression be treated in a hospital .
his widow said he was afraid that in doing so , he would run the risk of losing the couple 's adopted daughter . in his suicide note , enke is said to have apologized to his family and doctors for his decision to take his life and for not having been honest about the severity of his condition . a world cup favorite germany 's national team have called off their saturday match against chile .
" we need to be able to take a moment , " said theo zwanziger , head of the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- at an afternoon press conference .
" there 's no other option , " he said , adding that the decision was made by the dfb management in conjunction with the players . " we thought about playing the game as a farewell to robert , but it is clear it is too soon after this terrible news , " said team manager oliver bierhoff , who was visibly upset during the press conference . zwanziger said the players were already leaving the training complex and would not reconvene until sunday when they would train for next wednesday 's match against the ivory coast . although enke was considered one of the front-runners for the keeper position on the 2010 world cup squad , he was forced to miss the last four games for germany and several matches for hanover due to an intestinal infection and he had not been selected for germany 's friendly matches against chile and the ivory coast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim loew still favored enke for the world cup after sitting out for two months , enke returned to the pitch for hanover on october 31 against cologne .
his last match in the bundesliga came just two days before his death , a 2-2 draw against hamburg . german national coach joachim loew had said it was too early for enke to return to the squad after his illness .
nevertheless , loew had indicated that enke was still his favorite to be germany 's goalkeeper at the world cup finals in south africa next year . the infection , which caused enke to miss key world cup qualifying matches , was not the first personal hardship the goalkeeper faced in his lifetime .
in 2006 he and his wife suffered a personal tragedy with the death of their then two-year-old daughter due to a rare heart condition . german soccer mourns the response from the german soccer community has been both shock and sadness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candles for the goalkeeper " it is a tragedy , " martin kind , president of enke 's bundesliga club hanover 96 , said .
" you expect many things , but not something like that . ” dfb 's zwanziger said he was " stunned and full of sadness . " " we send our deepest sympathies to his wife and family .
robert enke was a wonderful person who had been dealt some tough cards , " he said . fc barcelona , one of enke 's former clubs , held a minute of silence for the german keeper ahead of their spanish cup match against cultural leonesa on tuesday night . in hanover , hundreds of the team 's fans gathered outside the club 's stadium to light candles and leave flowers . " he leaves behind a large hole in our lives , not only in hanover , but for soccer in germany , " said the team 's sports director joerg schmadtke . on wednesday evening , team colleagues and fans gathered for a service of remembrance in hanover .

in 2006 he and his wife suffered a personal tragedy with the death of their then two-year-old daughter due to a rare heart condition . german soccer mourns the response from the german soccer community has been both shock and sadness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candles for the goalkeeper " it is a tragedy , " martin kind , president of enke 's bundesliga club hanover 96 , said .
" you expect many things , but not something like that . ” dfb 's zwanziger said he was " stunned and full of sadness . " " we send our deepest sympathies to his wife and family .
robert enke was a wonderful person who had been dealt some tough cards , " he said . fc barcelona , one of enke 's former clubs , held a minute of silence for the german keeper ahead of their spanish cup match against cultural leonesa on tuesday night . in hanover , hundreds of the team 's fans gathered outside the club 's stadium to light candles and leave flowers . " he leaves behind a large hole in our lives , not only in hanover , but for soccer in germany , " said the team 's sports director joerg schmadtke . on wednesday evening , team colleagues and fans gathered for a service of remembrance in hanover .
enke 's funeral will be held on sunday .

more reserved players like enke are almost ignored in the footballing circus .
dw 's stefan nestler comments . the news of a suicide is shocking - always .
almost involuntarily we ask ourselves : was there really nothing that might have stopped this person taking his own life ?
did he send us any signals of his despair which we failed to notice ?
suddenly confronted by a life that ended too soon , we ask ourselves why .
robert enke was not one of those footballers who sought out every microphone in order to tell the world how important he was .
also , he was not the typical eccentric between the sticks , forever screaming at his defenders , like so many other goalkeepers .
he always seemed reserved and polite , a soft-spoken man .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan nestler in fact , his character was often cited as one of his biggest weaknesses as a keeper .
often the german press would call on enke to put more effort into asserting himself as germany 's number one goalkeeper , to make his own case more passionately and with more vigour in the media .
but that just was n't robert enke 's style .
quieter people like enke are often swamped in the melee that is the soccer circus , where only goals , points , and championships really matter .
to the winner , the spoils .
the loser is lucky to get a sympathetic grimace .
often the common opinion is that someone who earns millions every year for playing sports has nothing to grumble about .
but for robert enke , in both sports and his everyday life , things had not been running smoothly .
at some of the larger foreign clubs that hired him earlier in his career , fc barcelona for example , he spent almost all of his time warming the substitutes ' bench .
and much more recently , once he had finally seemed to establish himself clearly as germany 's number one goalkeeper , an illness stopped him in his tracks .
however the ebbs and flows of his sporting career seem almost banal when compared to what he had endured off the pitch , more specifically the death of his two-year-old daughter in 2006 .
we will never know if that was the catalyst for this tragedy , or whether the process began at another moment in time .
robert enke , the goalkeeper , has been analyzed in painstaking detail for years , however , it seems the wider world failed to even scratch the surface of robert enke , the man .
and now he 's gone .

the national player suffered from depression . in a press conference on wednesday , enke 's doctor valentin markser said the soccer star had first come to him in 2003 when he was suffering from a fear of failure on the pitch .
the doctor said he had been treating the goalkeeper for depression since then and confirmed that enke had thought about suicide in the past . the soccer star 's widow , teresa enke , who also attended the press conference , said her husband experienced phases of depression . " i wanted to help him get through it , " she said .
" i tried to be there for him . " but enke always rejected any suggestion that his depression be treated in a hospital .
his widow said he was afraid that in doing so , he would run the risk of losing the couple 's adopted daughter . in his suicide note , enke is said to have apologized to his family and doctors for his decision to take his life and for not having been honest about the severity of his condition . a world cup favorite germany 's national team have called off their saturday match against chile .
" we need to be able to take a moment , " said theo zwanziger , head of the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- at an afternoon press conference .
" there 's no other option , " he said , adding that the decision was made by the dfb management in conjunction with the players . " we thought about playing the game as a farewell to robert , but it is clear it is too soon after this terrible news , " said team manager oliver bierhoff , who was visibly upset during the press conference . zwanziger said the players were already leaving the training complex and would not reconvene until sunday when they would train for next wednesday 's match against the ivory coast . although enke was considered one of the front-runners for the keeper position on the 2010 world cup squad , he was forced to miss the last four games for germany and several matches for hanover due to an intestinal infection and he had not been selected for germany 's friendly matches against chile and the ivory coast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim loew still favored enke for the world cup after sitting out for two months , enke returned to the pitch for hanover on october 31 against cologne .

they hope to start service next year , but the bahn is trying to put the brakes on its rivals . the latest entrant to the german rail market is the berlin-based locomore , which will start scheduled service between cologne and hamburg next august using rolling stock that it is set to purchase from austria 's national railway .
the company , founded in 2007 by derek ladewig , has the backing of an american investment firm , the railroad development corporation -lrb- rdc -rrb- , reports wirtschaftswoche in its latest issue .
rdc chairman henry posner told the magazine that his company expects the locomore venture to take time before becoming profitable .
" we 're impatient managers , but patient investors , " posner told wirtschaftswoche .
the magazine reports ladewig plans to start a new firm that would run new rail routes between berlin and frankfurt and stuttgart and hamburg and has already applied for permits to operate the new routes starting 2011 .
unlike the cologne-hamburg route , which will feature different levels of service , ladewig said he hoped to apply budget airline ryanair 's one-class , no-frills business model to the new routes .
not the first competitor , and probably not the last bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : db and france 's sncf currently cooperate but sncf now wants to move into germany locomore is one of several firms eager to chip away at deutsche bahn 's dominance .
at the end of october , the french national railway sncf applied to enter the german market and plans to start running two rail lines from the westernmost french city of strasbourg to hamburg in 2011 under its keolis subsidiary .
one line will travel via cologne and hanover and the other will journey via leipzig and berlin instead .
sncf and deutsche bahn have been cooperating since 2007 on a series of high-speed routes between frankfurt , munich and stuttgart and paris .
the growing number of firms looking to challenge deutsche bahn 's long-time dominance comes as europe 's passenger railway markets are set to become deregulated in 2010 due to new european union rules .
some competition in regional markets already exists , with firms such as the french veolia transport providing short-run rail service across germany , as well as a longer route between rostock and leipzig .
access a struggle the challenge for all new entrants on the german market is how to work with deutsche bahn , which will continue to own and operate the infrastructure that locomore and sncf 's trains will run on through its db netz subsidiary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sncf plans to offer regular train service within germany by 2011 deutsche bahn is supposed to allow competitors access to its track network but has denied locomore 's request - against the wishes of german regulators .
the case is now in court , slowing locomore 's plans , which include purchasing an estimated 100 million euros worth of trains .
similar resistance has hit sncf 's rollout of train service in germany , prompting complaints to the european commission in brussels .
ironically , deutsche bahn hopes to expand its train service in france and has encountered similar setbacks in its efforts to gain access to the french market .
peter ramsauer , germany 's new transport minister , said in an interview november 2 that the french moves " could not go on . "
deutsche bahn employees say the entry of new companies into the rail market will hurt service and make train service " dangerous . "
alexander kirchner , who heads the rail workers union transnet said in an interview with the tagesspiegel newspaper that a price war is " unavoidable . "

they hope to start service next year , but the bahn is trying to put the brakes on its rivals . the latest entrant to the german rail market is the berlin-based locomore , which will start scheduled service between cologne and hamburg next august using rolling stock that it is set to purchase from austria 's national railway .
the company , founded in 2007 by derek ladewig , has the backing of an american investment firm , the railroad development corporation -lrb- rdc -rrb- , reports wirtschaftswoche in its latest issue .
rdc chairman henry posner told the magazine that his company expects the locomore venture to take time before becoming profitable .
" we 're impatient managers , but patient investors , " posner told wirtschaftswoche .
the magazine reports ladewig plans to start a new firm that would run new rail routes between berlin and frankfurt and stuttgart and hamburg and has already applied for permits to operate the new routes starting 2011 .
unlike the cologne-hamburg route , which will feature different levels of service , ladewig said he hoped to apply budget airline ryanair 's one-class , no-frills business model to the new routes .

at the end of october , the french national railway sncf applied to enter the german market and plans to start running two rail lines from the westernmost french city of strasbourg to hamburg in 2011 under its keolis subsidiary .
one line will travel via cologne and hanover and the other will journey via leipzig and berlin instead .
sncf and deutsche bahn have been cooperating since 2007 on a series of high-speed routes between frankfurt , munich and stuttgart and paris .
the growing number of firms looking to challenge deutsche bahn 's long-time dominance comes as europe 's passenger railway markets are set to become deregulated in 2010 due to new european union rules .
some competition in regional markets already exists , with firms such as the french veolia transport providing short-run rail service across germany , as well as a longer route between rostock and leipzig .
access a struggle the challenge for all new entrants on the german market is how to work with deutsche bahn , which will continue to own and operate the infrastructure that locomore and sncf 's trains will run on through its db netz subsidiary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sncf plans to offer regular train service within germany by 2011 deutsche bahn is supposed to allow competitors access to its track network but has denied locomore 's request - against the wishes of german regulators .
the case is now in court , slowing locomore 's plans , which include purchasing an estimated 100 million euros worth of trains .
similar resistance has hit sncf 's rollout of train service in germany , prompting complaints to the european commission in brussels .
ironically , deutsche bahn hopes to expand its train service in france and has encountered similar setbacks in its efforts to gain access to the french market .
peter ramsauer , germany 's new transport minister , said in an interview november 2 that the french moves " could not go on . "
deutsche bahn employees say the entry of new companies into the rail market will hurt service and make train service " dangerous . "

although merkel is not the first german chancellor to attend armistice day events in france , her presence at the annual parade marking germany 's surrender , is unprecedented .
standing in paris 91 years after the end of world war i , angela merkel described the relationship between france and germany as " something special , something unique , " and urged " even closer " co-operation between the two countries .
an example to the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy in paris as their national flags fluttered in the wind , the two leaders vowed that their countries would never again go to war against each other .
merkel said that although the past could not be erased , the power of reconciliation helped to bear the burden of what has gone before .
" we show other countries in the world that it is possible to rise above the pain of the past , " merkel said .
the french president told the crowds that it was not an occasion to celebrate , but to remember .
" we are not commemorating the victory of one people over another but an ordeal that was equally terrible for each side , " sarkozy said .
he said germany and france had a duty to uphold .
" we owe it to the people of europe , to the people of the world , to act together . "
an official date in the calendar ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants to make november 11 a day for germany and france sarkozy has proposed making november 11 - which is already a national holiday in france - an official day of franco-german reconciliation .
in a statement , he said he thought the time had come " to join with angela merkel in paris to jointly commemorate the suffering and to honor the momory of the combatants and celebrate the peace of which they dreamed at the bottom of their trenches . "
but the idea of a joint day of reconciliation has received a mixed response from politicians in both countries .
french defense minister herve morin told the canal + television network that he did not welcome the suggestion . however , werner hoyer , minister of state at the german foreign ministry , described it as an exceptional gesture .
helmut kohl was invited by former french president jacques chirac to attend the 80th anniversary commemoration of the 1918 ceasefire in paris . although he accepted , by the time the day came he was no longer in office .

dw 's stefan nestler comments . the news of a suicide is shocking - always .
almost involuntarily we ask ourselves : was there really nothing that might have stopped this person taking his own life ?

suddenly confronted by a life that ended too soon , we ask ourselves why .
robert enke was not one of those footballers who sought out every microphone in order to tell the world how important he was .
also , he was not the typical eccentric between the sticks , forever screaming at his defenders , like so many other goalkeepers .
he always seemed reserved and polite , a soft-spoken man .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan nestler in fact , his character was often cited as one of his biggest weaknesses as a keeper .
often the german press would call on enke to put more effort into asserting himself as germany 's number one goalkeeper , to make his own case more passionately and with more vigour in the media .
but that just was n't robert enke 's style .
quieter people like enke are often swamped in the melee that is the soccer circus , where only goals , points , and championships really matter .
to the winner , the spoils .
the loser is lucky to get a sympathetic grimace .
often the common opinion is that someone who earns millions every year for playing sports has nothing to grumble about .
but for robert enke , in both sports and his everyday life , things had not been running smoothly .
at some of the larger foreign clubs that hired him earlier in his career , fc barcelona for example , he spent almost all of his time warming the substitutes ' bench .
and much more recently , once he had finally seemed to establish himself clearly as germany 's number one goalkeeper , an illness stopped him in his tracks .
however the ebbs and flows of his sporting career seem almost banal when compared to what he had endured off the pitch , more specifically the death of his two-year-old daughter in 2006 .
we will never know if that was the catalyst for this tragedy , or whether the process began at another moment in time .
robert enke , the goalkeeper , has been analyzed in painstaking detail for years , however , it seems the wider world failed to even scratch the surface of robert enke , the man .

and it ’ s not just about necessity , it 's about ideology . dumpster divers are people who search for things that other people have thrown out that are still useful , can be eaten or recycled , and have value .
dumpster divers will not only pick up discarded items left outside people 's homes , but they will climb into dumpsters or bins at apartment buildings and behind shopping centers .
mostly , the so-called divers go about their scavenging under cover of darkness .
some , though , operate openly .
those who dumpster dive out of conviction consider it immoral in these times of economic crisis and widespread hunger that so much that still has value is thrown away .
according to the worldwatch institute in washington , between 30 and 40 percent of edible goods are discarded by supermarkets .
there are as yet , no official statistics for germany .
one man 's rubbish is another man 's treasure rasol eramouni and joerg bergstedt are two german dumpster divers .
armed with protective gloves and torches they set out for the night 's scavenge .
things to look out for : food where the sell-by date has only just expired , or food that is edible but where the packaging has been damaged .
twenty-eight year-old rasol is from syria , a country , he says , where people hardly throw anything away .
in this case rasol , who is unemployed , has joined the dumpster diving tradition out of financial necessity and says it 's a terrible waste , how much good stuff is being thrown away .
" poor people could live from what is discarded .
saving in these hard times ca n't hurt .
why should i walk past fresh bread or a box of good eggs ? "
hasan asks .
hasan has a family to provide for ; for others , like bergstedt , skipping or freeganism is a political statement .
" in some ways , containering has become pretty cool " " young people put on their che guevara hoodies and go containering for a couple of years , " bergstedt said .
bergstedt is one of the german spokespeople for containering .
he has been doing it for fifteen years .
and has managed to get by without spending a cent on basic living .
aside from his political convictions , bergstedt has an economic agenda .
consumerism is fuelled by supply and demand , he says .
if people such as himself do n't buy certain products , there will be no reason for the big supermarkets to keep ordering them .
in this way , bergstedt says , he can remain true to his convictions .
this , he says , is something that would n't be possible if he had to worry about getting to work every day .
the dumpster-diving movement started in the mid 1990s in the us .
the freegans used it as an expression against waste .
with the movement 's growing popularity , corporations have felt obliged to find a legal framework regulating how to deal with it .
in the us , for example , the foodstore chain 7-eleven has left it up to individual stores to decide whether they allow skipping .
in germany it is mostly considered illegal .
" if people trespass , " says lawyer michael biela-baetje , " then they are acting illegally according to paragraph 123 of the german basic law .
if the bin or skip is in a public space , then i assume that there is nothing illegal about it . "
opening a sealed bin to remove food is also illegal in germany and , if caught , the dumpster diver could be charged with theft , says biela-baetje .
this option is often used by supermarkets , which in many cases seal their bins or keep them in enclosed areas .
the larger german supermarkets , it seems , do not share the view that one man 's rubbish is another man 's treasure .
neither rewe nor the tengelmann group were prepared to comment .

" in some ways , containering has become pretty cool " " young people put on their che guevara hoodies and go containering for a couple of years , " bergstedt said .
bergstedt is one of the german spokespeople for containering .
he has been doing it for fifteen years .
and has managed to get by without spending a cent on basic living .
aside from his political convictions , bergstedt has an economic agenda .
consumerism is fuelled by supply and demand , he says .
if people such as himself do n't buy certain products , there will be no reason for the big supermarkets to keep ordering them .
in this way , bergstedt says , he can remain true to his convictions .
this , he says , is something that would n't be possible if he had to worry about getting to work every day .
the dumpster-diving movement started in the mid 1990s in the us .
the freegans used it as an expression against waste .
with the movement 's growing popularity , corporations have felt obliged to find a legal framework regulating how to deal with it .
in the us , for example , the foodstore chain 7-eleven has left it up to individual stores to decide whether they allow skipping .
in germany it is mostly considered illegal .
" if people trespass , " says lawyer michael biela-baetje , " then they are acting illegally according to paragraph 123 of the german basic law .
if the bin or skip is in a public space , then i assume that there is nothing illegal about it . "
opening a sealed bin to remove food is also illegal in germany and , if caught , the dumpster diver could be charged with theft , says biela-baetje .
this option is often used by supermarkets , which in many cases seal their bins or keep them in enclosed areas .
the larger german supermarkets , it seems , do not share the view that one man 's rubbish is another man 's treasure .
neither rewe nor the tengelmann group were prepared to comment .

and it ’ s not just about necessity , it 's about ideology . dumpster divers are people who search for things that other people have thrown out that are still useful , can be eaten or recycled , and have value .
dumpster divers will not only pick up discarded items left outside people 's homes , but they will climb into dumpsters or bins at apartment buildings and behind shopping centers .
mostly , the so-called divers go about their scavenging under cover of darkness .
some , though , operate openly .
those who dumpster dive out of conviction consider it immoral in these times of economic crisis and widespread hunger that so much that still has value is thrown away .
according to the worldwatch institute in washington , between 30 and 40 percent of edible goods are discarded by supermarkets .

things to look out for : food where the sell-by date has only just expired , or food that is edible but where the packaging has been damaged .
twenty-eight year-old rasol is from syria , a country , he says , where people hardly throw anything away .
in this case rasol , who is unemployed , has joined the dumpster diving tradition out of financial necessity and says it 's a terrible waste , how much good stuff is being thrown away .

the national player suffered from depression . in a press conference on wednesday , enke 's doctor valentin markser said the soccer star had first come to him in 2003 when he was suffering from a fear of failure on the pitch .
the doctor said he had been treating the goalkeeper for depression since then and confirmed that enke had thought about suicide in the past . the soccer star 's widow , teresa enke , who also attended the press conference , said her husband experienced phases of depression . " i wanted to help him get through it , " she said .
" i tried to be there for him . " but enke always rejected any suggestion that his depression be treated in a hospital .
his widow said he was afraid that in doing so , he would run the risk of losing the couple 's adopted daughter . in his suicide note , enke is said to have apologized to his family and doctors for his decision to take his life and for not having been honest about the severity of his condition . a world cup favorite germany 's national team have called off their saturday match against chile .
" we need to be able to take a moment , " said theo zwanziger , head of the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- at an afternoon press conference .
" there 's no other option , " he said , adding that the decision was made by the dfb management in conjunction with the players . " we thought about playing the game as a farewell to robert , but it is clear it is too soon after this terrible news , " said team manager oliver bierhoff , who was visibly upset during the press conference . zwanziger said the players were already leaving the training complex and would not reconvene until sunday when they would train for next wednesday 's match against the ivory coast . although enke was considered one of the front-runners for the keeper position on the 2010 world cup squad , he was forced to miss the last four games for germany and several matches for hanover due to an intestinal infection and he had not been selected for germany 's friendly matches against chile and the ivory coast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim loew still favored enke for the world cup after sitting out for two months , enke returned to the pitch for hanover on october 31 against cologne .
his last match in the bundesliga came just two days before his death , a 2-2 draw against hamburg . german national coach joachim loew had said it was too early for enke to return to the squad after his illness .
nevertheless , loew had indicated that enke was still his favorite to be germany 's goalkeeper at the world cup finals in south africa next year . the infection , which caused enke to miss key world cup qualifying matches , was not the first personal hardship the goalkeeper faced in his lifetime .
in 2006 he and his wife suffered a personal tragedy with the death of their then two-year-old daughter due to a rare heart condition . german soccer mourns the response from the german soccer community has been both shock and sadness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candles for the goalkeeper " it is a tragedy , " martin kind , president of enke 's bundesliga club hanover 96 , said .
" you expect many things , but not something like that . ” dfb 's zwanziger said he was " stunned and full of sadness . " " we send our deepest sympathies to his wife and family .
robert enke was a wonderful person who had been dealt some tough cards , " he said . fc barcelona , one of enke 's former clubs , held a minute of silence for the german keeper ahead of their spanish cup match against cultural leonesa on tuesday night . in hanover , hundreds of the team 's fans gathered outside the club 's stadium to light candles and leave flowers . " he leaves behind a large hole in our lives , not only in hanover , but for soccer in germany , " said the team 's sports director joerg schmadtke . on wednesday evening , team colleagues and fans gathered for a service of remembrance in hanover .
enke 's funeral will be held on sunday .
during the next bundesliga matches a minute of silence will be held and black armbands will be worn in his honor . hf / tkw / mz / rb / dpa / afp / ap editor : nigel tandy / sh send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 11.11.2009 eu top jobs in limbo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels is looking for new leaders the european union plans to hold a special summit next week to fill the new posts of eu president and eu foreign policy chief , but so far there is little agreement on who will get the top jobs . sweden , which currently holds the european union 's rotating six-month presidency , said on wednesday that the bloc 's 27 heads of state and government will meet in brussels on november 19 to fill the key new positions created by the ratification of the lisbon reform treaty last month .
however , finding appropriate and acceptable candidates is proving more difficult than expected .
the british government still backs former prime minister tony blair , despite his unpopularity in some quarters over his support for the iraq war .
british foreign secretary david miliband on wednesday categorically denied that he is a candidate to become the eu high representative , the bloc 's spokesman on foreign affairs and defense , after his name began circulating last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british foreign secretary opts for a career at home miliband , speaking at a press conference in london during a visit by the new german foreign minister , guido westerwelle , said he " came to british politics to serve the british people in britain . "
his comments immediately fueled speculation that he was striving for leadership of the labour party and possible future premiership .
british business secretary peter mandelson , a former eu trade commissioner , said he had been approached about the foreign policy job after miliband turned it down , but also said he was " committed to remaining in the british government . "
power struggles marring the selection process the current favorite to become president of the european council is belgium 's center-right prime minister herman van rompuy , who is said to have french and german backing .
but there are some doubts about rompuy in other eu member states , where it is feared he could find himself overshadowed and overwhelmed by berlin and paris .
others would prefer a more forceful foreign policy chief , who would stand up to france and germany , as well as russia , china and the united states .
other names mentioned for the post of president include dutch prime minister peter balkenende , former latvian president vaira vike-freiberga and luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner said on wednesday however that mr. blair was not yet out of the running .
for the foreign affairs job , former italian prime minister massimo d 'alema is considered a strong contender , now that miliband has clearly stated his intention not to take the post .
besides the fact that different member states have been proposing different names , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , representing the eu presidency , said he was finding it especially difficult to strike a balance between the political left and right , and the conflicting visions of the smaller and larger eu countries on what role the politicians would play in brussels .
german foreign minister outlines policy issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foreign minister has been doing the rounds of germany 's allies .
the conflicting visions are a concern that german foreign minister westerwelle touched on during visits to london and earlier to copenhagen .
westerwelle told his danish and british counterparts that he wanted smaller and larger countries to deal with one another at " eye level " .
he also said germany would do everything it could to ensure the success of the international climate summit in copenhagen in december .
westerwelle said , however , that berlin would not be rushed into a decision on boosting its bundeswehr forces in afghanistan .
" before we talk about numbers , we need to agree on a joint strategy , " he said .
the foreign minister spoke at the press conference with miliband in both english and german , after being criticized for not answering a question in english at a meeting with journalists in berlin in september. gb / dpa / afp / ap / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , finding appropriate and acceptable candidates is proving more difficult than expected .
the british government still backs former prime minister tony blair , despite his unpopularity in some quarters over his support for the iraq war .
british foreign secretary david miliband on wednesday categorically denied that he is a candidate to become the eu high representative , the bloc 's spokesman on foreign affairs and defense , after his name began circulating last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british foreign secretary opts for a career at home miliband , speaking at a press conference in london during a visit by the new german foreign minister , guido westerwelle , said he " came to british politics to serve the british people in britain . "
his comments immediately fueled speculation that he was striving for leadership of the labour party and possible future premiership .
british business secretary peter mandelson , a former eu trade commissioner , said he had been approached about the foreign policy job after miliband turned it down , but also said he was " committed to remaining in the british government . "
power struggles marring the selection process the current favorite to become president of the european council is belgium 's center-right prime minister herman van rompuy , who is said to have french and german backing .
but there are some doubts about rompuy in other eu member states , where it is feared he could find himself overshadowed and overwhelmed by berlin and paris .
others would prefer a more forceful foreign policy chief , who would stand up to france and germany , as well as russia , china and the united states .
other names mentioned for the post of president include dutch prime minister peter balkenende , former latvian president vaira vike-freiberga and luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner said on wednesday however that mr. blair was not yet out of the running .
for the foreign affairs job , former italian prime minister massimo d 'alema is considered a strong contender , now that miliband has clearly stated his intention not to take the post .
besides the fact that different member states have been proposing different names , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , representing the eu presidency , said he was finding it especially difficult to strike a balance between the political left and right , and the conflicting visions of the smaller and larger eu countries on what role the politicians would play in brussels .

westerwelle told his danish and british counterparts that he wanted smaller and larger countries to deal with one another at " eye level " .
he also said germany would do everything it could to ensure the success of the international climate summit in copenhagen in december .
westerwelle said , however , that berlin would not be rushed into a decision on boosting its bundeswehr forces in afghanistan .

where was i when the wall came down ?
i never thought in my lifetime i would see this horrible piece of shame come down .
having visited my grandparents in east germany as a teenager and seen for myself what communism is all about , i can not describe the emotions i had on november 9 .
i celebrated the day with two american friends at mcdonalds with a coke .
i will never forget this day as long as i live . - birgit harms , us we were living in new delhi at the time of the fall of the berlin wall .
i had made friends with a staff member of the east german embassy who was caught completely unaware by the sudden end of the existence of the gdr .
we received the usual invitation for the new year 's eve party from the west german embassy but the new friends from the ex-gdr embassy had also invited us .
we followed our hearts and chose to go to the east german embassy to celebrate new year 1990 on the roof of their now redundant diplomatic mission in asia .
the atmosphere was first somewhat low-spirited .
some of the eastern friends had lost their dreams and uncertainty was a dominant feeling .
we listened and drank champagne .
there was happiness and hope mixed with sadness and some fear .
we answered very simple questions , like " can i apply for a job with more than one company ? "
we had to explain the details of ' western freedom . '
what was for us entirely normal and common practice was very new and unusual for them .
we encouraged them to embrace the change but we did not praise the west over the east .
the wounds in their souls were still wide open and healing was yet to begin .
they were good people who lived for what they believed in and we respected that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' i never thought i would see this horrible piece of shame come down . "
the west german embassy had made it very clear they wanted none of them .
there were perhaps good reasons for this but for those affected it was yet another blow on a body that was already in great pain .

i remember the night before , when coming home from the grocery store , you could not get on a subway because they were completely full .
i came back up to the street and found out what was going on .
my german friend bruce schlottow and i made our way from sophie-charlotte platz over to brandenburg gate and watched history unfold in front of us for the next few days .

i was majoring in german , planning to spend a semester abroad in the next year , and my instructor was able to provide us with up to the minute information as she had recently been teaching in east berlin .
for me , this event was monumental and , even from such a distance , the feeling was heady and i was engrossed in watching every moment .
i visited berlin and former east germany for the first time in september 1990 , shortly before reunification .
i was struck by the fact that i had spent most of my day wandering around former east berlin , and only when i crossed at the brandenburger tor , did i realize that east and west were not as obvious as i had thought .

our family emigrated to new zealand after world war ii .
when the berlin wall came down i was sitting in my bedroom watching tv news .
i was overcome with both joy and sadness and i found myself sobbing .
the sadness came because my father had not lived to witness this event , but i was joyful that it had happened .
i could not think who could understand my feelings and emotion as i was alone , but i thought of a lithuanian friend so i phoned him with the good news .
i was glad i found someone who i could share my feelings with ; a person who understood . - katarina broughton , new zealand i had just returned from visiting my family in germany .

it was buzzing this day like a bee hive .
people from all over the world gathered along the wall , hammering and chiseling .
a young frenchman stood next to me and with a big grin , handed me a big piece of its painted section .

where was i when the wall came down ?
i never thought in my lifetime i would see this horrible piece of shame come down .
having visited my grandparents in east germany as a teenager and seen for myself what communism is all about , i can not describe the emotions i had on november 9 .
i celebrated the day with two american friends at mcdonalds with a coke .
i will never forget this day as long as i live . - birgit harms , us we were living in new delhi at the time of the fall of the berlin wall .
i had made friends with a staff member of the east german embassy who was caught completely unaware by the sudden end of the existence of the gdr .
we received the usual invitation for the new year 's eve party from the west german embassy but the new friends from the ex-gdr embassy had also invited us .
we followed our hearts and chose to go to the east german embassy to celebrate new year 1990 on the roof of their now redundant diplomatic mission in asia .
the atmosphere was first somewhat low-spirited .
some of the eastern friends had lost their dreams and uncertainty was a dominant feeling .
we listened and drank champagne .
there was happiness and hope mixed with sadness and some fear .
we answered very simple questions , like " can i apply for a job with more than one company ? "
we had to explain the details of ' western freedom . '
what was for us entirely normal and common practice was very new and unusual for them .
we encouraged them to embrace the change but we did not praise the west over the east .
the wounds in their souls were still wide open and healing was yet to begin .
they were good people who lived for what they believed in and we respected that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' i never thought i would see this horrible piece of shame come down . "
the west german embassy had made it very clear they wanted none of them .
there were perhaps good reasons for this but for those affected it was yet another blow on a body that was already in great pain .
i am sure that all of them did well after the reunification and we feel privileged to have been able to make the sudden and unexpected change a bit easier for them . - dieter & nilima pelz , australia i was assigned to the berlin brigade , office of the commanding general , us army .

where was i when the wall came down ?
i never thought in my lifetime i would see this horrible piece of shame come down .
having visited my grandparents in east germany as a teenager and seen for myself what communism is all about , i can not describe the emotions i had on november 9 .
i celebrated the day with two american friends at mcdonalds with a coke .
i will never forget this day as long as i live . - birgit harms , us we were living in new delhi at the time of the fall of the berlin wall .
i had made friends with a staff member of the east german embassy who was caught completely unaware by the sudden end of the existence of the gdr .
we received the usual invitation for the new year 's eve party from the west german embassy but the new friends from the ex-gdr embassy had also invited us .
we followed our hearts and chose to go to the east german embassy to celebrate new year 1990 on the roof of their now redundant diplomatic mission in asia .
the atmosphere was first somewhat low-spirited .
some of the eastern friends had lost their dreams and uncertainty was a dominant feeling .
we listened and drank champagne .
there was happiness and hope mixed with sadness and some fear .
we answered very simple questions , like " can i apply for a job with more than one company ? "
we had to explain the details of ' western freedom . '
what was for us entirely normal and common practice was very new and unusual for them .
we encouraged them to embrace the change but we did not praise the west over the east .
the wounds in their souls were still wide open and healing was yet to begin .
they were good people who lived for what they believed in and we respected that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' i never thought i would see this horrible piece of shame come down . "
the west german embassy had made it very clear they wanted none of them .
there were perhaps good reasons for this but for those affected it was yet another blow on a body that was already in great pain .
i am sure that all of them did well after the reunification and we feel privileged to have been able to make the sudden and unexpected change a bit easier for them . - dieter & nilima pelz , australia i was assigned to the berlin brigade , office of the commanding general , us army .
i remember the night before , when coming home from the grocery store , you could not get on a subway because they were completely full .
i came back up to the street and found out what was going on .
my german friend bruce schlottow and i made our way from sophie-charlotte platz over to brandenburg gate and watched history unfold in front of us for the next few days .
i can remember smelling the exhaust of the trabbies in the street , seeing how excited everyone was , and how i felt being a part of history .
i have never forgotten that time and i have always considered berlin my home after returning back to dallas , texas . - a. alex arce , us i was an undergraduate student in my advanced german conversation and composition class at a small midwestern liberal arts university .
i was majoring in german , planning to spend a semester abroad in the next year , and my instructor was able to provide us with up to the minute information as she had recently been teaching in east berlin .
for me , this event was monumental and , even from such a distance , the feeling was heady and i was engrossed in watching every moment .
i visited berlin and former east germany for the first time in september 1990 , shortly before reunification .
i was struck by the fact that i had spent most of my day wandering around former east berlin , and only when i crossed at the brandenburger tor , did i realize that east and west were not as obvious as i had thought .
sure , there were landmarks such as the fernsehturm at alexanderplatz and the pieces of wall still standing , but there was also a lot that looked similar and perhaps had already been assimilated by this time . - kathy evenson-mcdermott , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge dominos fell on november 9 2009 , to symbolise the fall of the berlin wall i was born in prague .
my father was slovak , my mother was hungarian .
our family emigrated to new zealand after world war ii .
when the berlin wall came down i was sitting in my bedroom watching tv news .
i was overcome with both joy and sadness and i found myself sobbing .
the sadness came because my father had not lived to witness this event , but i was joyful that it had happened .
i could not think who could understand my feelings and emotion as i was alone , but i thought of a lithuanian friend so i phoned him with the good news .
i was glad i found someone who i could share my feelings with ; a person who understood . - katarina broughton , new zealand i had just returned from visiting my family in germany .
my husband turned on the news and we saw the wall coming down in pieces .
i wished i would have planned my trip to have been there at that time and place . - sabine , us we had come to visit friends in hamburg and drove with them to west berlin , still through east germany at that time .
the excitement was like electricity .
we took a taxi to checkpoint charlie , a place i crossed into east berlin a few times , with sadness and a bitter taste .
it was buzzing this day like a bee hive .
people from all over the world gathered along the wall , hammering and chiseling .
a young frenchman stood next to me and with a big grin , handed me a big piece of its painted section .
i still have it .
people were wandering from east to west and vice versa , some crying , some laughing and hugging each other , complete strangers , yet united in what was at one time an impossible event in our lifetime .
i thought of my father , who went through two world wars together with so many others in his age group .
he would have shed tears too , as i did now .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' checkpoint charlie ... was buzzing this day like a bee hive . "
i returned to the taxi , where we gathered with glasses of champagne .
the first east berliners in their trabants were coming across .
windows rolled down and waving , laughing as we , who stood there , waved back .
i met a couple that had never been to the west .
we embraced each other .
the men were shaking hands and the women were crying .
this terrible division ended and a rebirth began .
the rebirth of a united europe and the end of the ' cold war . ' - isabella miram , us i wept when at long last my " liebes land " was free !
i am not german but since 1942 i have had a love affair with germany .
i do n't know why !
i was only 4 years old !
other than china , on that november 9 the world 's biggest prison - for both east and west - was closed .
november 9 was the greatest day in world history !
alles gute , deutschland - robert mccormick , australia how sad that in her recent speech celebrating the fall of the berlin wall , -lrb- as far as i know -rrb- angela merkel made no mention of the two individuals who , more than anyone else , brought a close to the cold war and the fall of the wall : lady margaret thatcher and president ronald reagan .
reagan and thatcher squarely faced the " evil empire " and refused to be intimidated .
under huge financial pressure , gorbachev was forced to remove all soviet troops from eastern europe .
i was in hungary shortly after the russian army pulled out , and it was obvious to all concerned that it was only a matter of time before the whole communist system fell apart .
the reason the wall came down is that the only thing keeping it up was removed : the red army .
gorbachev did n't tear down the wall , he abandoned it and the freedom-hungry people of germany tore it down . - john roughton , us having visited both west and east germany in 1985 , it was a melancholy experience to visit a divided country , its capital cut in half and its people torn apart by politics .
only four years later , i watched with joy the nation re-unify and put aside its painful past for a new start , at the very heart of an increasingly united europe .
20 years on , from far away australia , i send you my warmest congratulations on this special day and i wish and hope that germany continues to go from strength to strength . - terry papadis , australia i was 9 years old when the wall came down , so the only things i could clearly remember were the happy people from a fellow european nation celebrating their unity and hope for the future .
nevertheless , that was a powerful message for a young person as myself and i 've never forgotten it .
the fall of the wall and subsequent reunification also meant the end of the cold war and the dream of a peaceful european union , as the one we have today .
for me , germany 's unity symbolizes europe 's unity and the fall of the wall is the most convincing proof that you ca n't divide people with ideological barriers for long . - constantine michailidis , greece compiled by stuart tiffen editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

although merkel is not the first german chancellor to attend armistice day events in france , her presence at the annual parade marking germany 's surrender , is unprecedented .
standing in paris 91 years after the end of world war i , angela merkel described the relationship between france and germany as " something special , something unique , " and urged " even closer " co-operation between the two countries .
an example to the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy in paris as their national flags fluttered in the wind , the two leaders vowed that their countries would never again go to war against each other .
merkel said that although the past could not be erased , the power of reconciliation helped to bear the burden of what has gone before .
" we show other countries in the world that it is possible to rise above the pain of the past , " merkel said .
the french president told the crowds that it was not an occasion to celebrate , but to remember .
" we are not commemorating the victory of one people over another but an ordeal that was equally terrible for each side , " sarkozy said .
he said germany and france had a duty to uphold .
" we owe it to the people of europe , to the people of the world , to act together . "
an official date in the calendar ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants to make november 11 a day for germany and france sarkozy has proposed making november 11 - which is already a national holiday in france - an official day of franco-german reconciliation .
in a statement , he said he thought the time had come " to join with angela merkel in paris to jointly commemorate the suffering and to honor the momory of the combatants and celebrate the peace of which they dreamed at the bottom of their trenches . "
but the idea of a joint day of reconciliation has received a mixed response from politicians in both countries .
french defense minister herve morin told the canal + television network that he did not welcome the suggestion . however , werner hoyer , minister of state at the german foreign ministry , described it as an exceptional gesture .
helmut kohl was invited by former french president jacques chirac to attend the 80th anniversary commemoration of the 1918 ceasefire in paris . although he accepted , by the time the day came he was no longer in office .

tests being conducted on sheep have proven successful up to now . researchers at the university hospital in zurich have already succeeded in cultivating the heart valve of a sheep using the creature 's cells . heart surgeon simon hoerstrop hopes to eventually be able to implant in human patients functioning valves grown out of their own stem cells . this means that many heart patients , particularly young people , may one day not have to undergo rounds of painful transplant surgery to replace artificial valves that they have outgrown . research to help children to date , surgeons have used artificial valves made out of synthetic materials or dead animal tissues in order to avoid any chance of the body rejecting the replacement part . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers are testing the new procedure on sheep one big problem however , particularly in the case of children , is that these substitute valves do not grow within the body .
this means young patients must endure new transplant surgery every few years . some children require as many as five of these operations before they reach adulthood . sheep are ideal guinea pigs simon hoerstrop would like to change this . sheep are particularly well suited to test the procedure , according to hoerstrup .
" it is an ideal model because its anatomy is very similar to that of a human , " he said . in addition , sheep organs quickly calcify if they are not working properly , he added .
this means that scientists can spot much more quickly if something is going wrong than they could in human patients . to create a heart valve , hoerstrup extracts cells from an artery in the sheep 's neck .
the cells are then propagated in the laboratory and are deposited on a scaffold .
this template corresponds almost exactly to the shape of a heart valve . this is then put in a bioreactor where the cells continue to grow and attach themselves to the scaffold , which graduallly dissolves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children with heart valve problems will benefit from the new procedure meanwhile , the nutrient solution is kept constantly in movement while the valve is growing .
it simulates the motion of the heart and is intended to train the new component for its future duty in the body .
the whole process takes a mere eight weeks . the valve is then transplanted back into the sheep , whose stem cells were used to grow the bodily component .
this process allows researchers to avoid any chance of rejection . valve replacement in humans foreseeable in the laboratories of the university hospital of zurich about one hundred human valves are already being successfully grown . although heart surgeon simon hoerstrup and his team are already looking forward to the day when they will be able to transplant a living heart valve into a human patient , he cautions that it is still likely to be a few years from now . author : basil honegger / maria lesser -lrb- gmb -rrb- editor : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 11.11.2009 eu leaders to discuss presidential hopefuls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu president will represent all 27 member countries the european union has scheduled a special summit in an effort to select its first ever full-time president and foreign policy representative . european diplomats say that about 10 names have been put forward for the position of president and about the same again for the role of eu high representative , the bloc 's new chief of foreign policy .
sweden , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , will hold a dinner for top diplomats in the belgian capital next week .
the meeting is aimed at helping swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt draw up a list of possible candidates for the two new posts created under the lisbon treaty .
the lisbon treaty , which was finally ratified last week , stipulates that both appointments have to be made by majority vote .
but diplomats believe reinfeldt is likely to try and find consensus candidates .

they are also designed to improve the lot of women and increase environmental sustainability .
cambodia is seeing mixed progress as it tries to reach its nine targets .
while infant and child mortality have come down , maternal mortality rates remain high . a baby ’ s cry pierces the afternoon air at a maternity hospital in cambodia ’ s capital phnom penh .
in an important way , that is the sound of success .
cambodia has cut the rate of infants dying before their first birthday from around 95 per 1,000 live births a decade ago to 60 .
the target is 50 per 1,000 live births .
it is one of nine mdg targets that cambodia has signed up to .
dr lo veasnakiry , head of planning at the ministry of health , says progress towards meeting the mdg on child and infant mortality is in part due to the government ’ s commitment to maintaining health sector spending despite the global economic crisis .
it has also made efforts to improve access to child health services , and has received cash and technical assistance from health partners such as unicef , the united nations children ’ s fund .
malalay ahmadzai is the mother and child specialist at unicef .
she credits other factors too : " one has been the strong performance of the national immunisation programme .
second has been the improvement in breastfeeding practices , and that goes back to a lot of community work plus support to the health centres and so on . "
no progress on maternal mortality but with just a few years to go , cambodia could well miss six other mdg targets , including the one on maternal mortality .
a decade ago 460 women died in childbirth in cambodia for every 100,000 births .
the target is 140 and yet the rate has not come down .
why ?
dr lo explains that , to begin with , the target is very ambitious .
" from the global viewpoint , not only cambodia but a lot of countries have not made significant progress in terms of maternal deaths " , he says .
more resources needed a study found that more than half of the women who die in childbirth in cambodia succumb to massive blood loss .
another fifth die from eclampsia , that is high blood pressure .
they require a rapid response - and any delay can result in death .
" the first delay is decision-making in the family whether to seek care or not " , says unicef 's malalay ahmadzai .
" the second is costs , roads and access .
and third is the quality of care . "
cambodia needs more resources and more trained staff , and dr lo says that is starting to happen , but it won ’ t be enough .
that ’ s why he recently proposed that the government revise the target .
shifting the target is a controversial way of reaching it – but as dr lo points out , if cambodia can reach the revised target of 250 deaths per 100,000 births that would still mark a big improvement .

it has also made efforts to improve access to child health services , and has received cash and technical assistance from health partners such as unicef , the united nations children ’ s fund .
malalay ahmadzai is the mother and child specialist at unicef .
she credits other factors too : " one has been the strong performance of the national immunisation programme .
second has been the improvement in breastfeeding practices , and that goes back to a lot of community work plus support to the health centres and so on . "
no progress on maternal mortality but with just a few years to go , cambodia could well miss six other mdg targets , including the one on maternal mortality .
a decade ago 460 women died in childbirth in cambodia for every 100,000 births .
the target is 140 and yet the rate has not come down .
why ?
dr lo explains that , to begin with , the target is very ambitious .
" from the global viewpoint , not only cambodia but a lot of countries have not made significant progress in terms of maternal deaths " , he says .
more resources needed a study found that more than half of the women who die in childbirth in cambodia succumb to massive blood loss .
another fifth die from eclampsia , that is high blood pressure .
they require a rapid response - and any delay can result in death .
" the first delay is decision-making in the family whether to seek care or not " , says unicef 's malalay ahmadzai .
" the second is costs , roads and access .
and third is the quality of care . "
cambodia needs more resources and more trained staff , and dr lo says that is starting to happen , but it won ’ t be enough .
that ’ s why he recently proposed that the government revise the target .
shifting the target is a controversial way of reaching it – but as dr lo points out , if cambodia can reach the revised target of 250 deaths per 100,000 births that would still mark a big improvement .

eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs , joaquin almunia , said he thought the deadline was " fitting and realistic " .
the decision came as no surprise to germany , which is expecting a five percent hole in it budget next year .
earlier this week , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , told almunia that berlin would comply with eu targets , even though that will make it harder to push ahead with a reform of the german tax system .
almunia , who described schaeuble 's agreement as " extremely credible " , said he believed the german finance minister would find a way to harmonize planned tax cuts with the austerity measures necessary to meet the commission 's 2013 eu spending deadline .

italy and belgium have until 2012 to fall back in line with the three percent rule stipulated under the eu stability and growth packet .
spain and france were also set a 2013 deadline , although paris has repeatedly said it is unrealistic .
speaking in brussels on tuesday , french finance minister christine lagarde said that , while 2015 was too late , 2012 was clearly too soon .
" between the two , there is 2013 and 2014 , " lagarde said .
" it is obvious that 2014 already represents a fine effort - i think 2013 will be extremely difficult . "

italy and belgium have until 2012 to get their books in order , while ireland has been granted until 2014 and britain , which has suffered particularly badly as a result of the recession , until 2015 .
the commission 's suggestions have to be accepted by finance ministers , and countries which do not meet the targets risk hefty fines .
greece is now inching closer to that point .
on wednesday , almunia proposed a tougher stance towards athens , which he said had not taken any " effective steps " towards reducing its budget deficit or finding a balance in the greek economy. tkw / ap / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

although merkel is not the first german chancellor to attend armistice day events in france , her presence at the annual parade marking germany 's surrender , is unprecedented .
standing in paris 91 years after the end of world war i , angela merkel described the relationship between france and germany as " something special , something unique , " and urged " even closer " co-operation between the two countries .
an example to the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy in paris as their national flags fluttered in the wind , the two leaders vowed that their countries would never again go to war against each other .
merkel said that although the past could not be erased , the power of reconciliation helped to bear the burden of what has gone before .
" we show other countries in the world that it is possible to rise above the pain of the past , " merkel said .
the french president told the crowds that it was not an occasion to celebrate , but to remember .
" we are not commemorating the victory of one people over another but an ordeal that was equally terrible for each side , " sarkozy said .
he said germany and france had a duty to uphold .
" we owe it to the people of europe , to the people of the world , to act together . "
an official date in the calendar ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants to make november 11 a day for germany and france sarkozy has proposed making november 11 - which is already a national holiday in france - an official day of franco-german reconciliation .
in a statement , he said he thought the time had come " to join with angela merkel in paris to jointly commemorate the suffering and to honor the momory of the combatants and celebrate the peace of which they dreamed at the bottom of their trenches . "
but the idea of a joint day of reconciliation has received a mixed response from politicians in both countries .
french defense minister herve morin told the canal + television network that he did not welcome the suggestion . however , werner hoyer , minister of state at the german foreign ministry , described it as an exceptional gesture .
helmut kohl was invited by former french president jacques chirac to attend the 80th anniversary commemoration of the 1918 ceasefire in paris . although he accepted , by the time the day came he was no longer in office .

although merkel is not the first german chancellor to attend armistice day events in france , her presence at the annual parade marking germany 's surrender , is unprecedented .
standing in paris 91 years after the end of world war i , angela merkel described the relationship between france and germany as " something special , something unique , " and urged " even closer " co-operation between the two countries .
an example to the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy in paris as their national flags fluttered in the wind , the two leaders vowed that their countries would never again go to war against each other .
merkel said that although the past could not be erased , the power of reconciliation helped to bear the burden of what has gone before .
" we show other countries in the world that it is possible to rise above the pain of the past , " merkel said .
the french president told the crowds that it was not an occasion to celebrate , but to remember .
" we are not commemorating the victory of one people over another but an ordeal that was equally terrible for each side , " sarkozy said .
he said germany and france had a duty to uphold .
" we owe it to the people of europe , to the people of the world , to act together . "
an official date in the calendar ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants to make november 11 a day for germany and france sarkozy has proposed making november 11 - which is already a national holiday in france - an official day of franco-german reconciliation .
in a statement , he said he thought the time had come " to join with angela merkel in paris to jointly commemorate the suffering and to honor the momory of the combatants and celebrate the peace of which they dreamed at the bottom of their trenches . "
but the idea of a joint day of reconciliation has received a mixed response from politicians in both countries .
french defense minister herve morin told the canal + television network that he did not welcome the suggestion . however , werner hoyer , minister of state at the german foreign ministry , described it as an exceptional gesture .

they hope to start service next year , but the bahn is trying to put the brakes on its rivals . the latest entrant to the german rail market is the berlin-based locomore , which will start scheduled service between cologne and hamburg next august using rolling stock that it is set to purchase from austria 's national railway .
the company , founded in 2007 by derek ladewig , has the backing of an american investment firm , the railroad development corporation -lrb- rdc -rrb- , reports wirtschaftswoche in its latest issue .
rdc chairman henry posner told the magazine that his company expects the locomore venture to take time before becoming profitable .
" we 're impatient managers , but patient investors , " posner told wirtschaftswoche .
the magazine reports ladewig plans to start a new firm that would run new rail routes between berlin and frankfurt and stuttgart and hamburg and has already applied for permits to operate the new routes starting 2011 .
unlike the cologne-hamburg route , which will feature different levels of service , ladewig said he hoped to apply budget airline ryanair 's one-class , no-frills business model to the new routes .

at the end of october , the french national railway sncf applied to enter the german market and plans to start running two rail lines from the westernmost french city of strasbourg to hamburg in 2011 under its keolis subsidiary .
one line will travel via cologne and hanover and the other will journey via leipzig and berlin instead .
sncf and deutsche bahn have been cooperating since 2007 on a series of high-speed routes between frankfurt , munich and stuttgart and paris .
the growing number of firms looking to challenge deutsche bahn 's long-time dominance comes as europe 's passenger railway markets are set to become deregulated in 2010 due to new european union rules .
some competition in regional markets already exists , with firms such as the french veolia transport providing short-run rail service across germany , as well as a longer route between rostock and leipzig .
access a struggle the challenge for all new entrants on the german market is how to work with deutsche bahn , which will continue to own and operate the infrastructure that locomore and sncf 's trains will run on through its db netz subsidiary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sncf plans to offer regular train service within germany by 2011 deutsche bahn is supposed to allow competitors access to its track network but has denied locomore 's request - against the wishes of german regulators .
the case is now in court , slowing locomore 's plans , which include purchasing an estimated 100 million euros worth of trains .
similar resistance has hit sncf 's rollout of train service in germany , prompting complaints to the european commission in brussels .
ironically , deutsche bahn hopes to expand its train service in france and has encountered similar setbacks in its efforts to gain access to the french market .
peter ramsauer , germany 's new transport minister , said in an interview november 2 that the french moves " could not go on . "
deutsche bahn employees say the entry of new companies into the rail market will hurt service and make train service " dangerous . "

one line will travel via cologne and hanover and the other will journey via leipzig and berlin instead .
sncf and deutsche bahn have been cooperating since 2007 on a series of high-speed routes between frankfurt , munich and stuttgart and paris .
the growing number of firms looking to challenge deutsche bahn 's long-time dominance comes as europe 's passenger railway markets are set to become deregulated in 2010 due to new european union rules .
some competition in regional markets already exists , with firms such as the french veolia transport providing short-run rail service across germany , as well as a longer route between rostock and leipzig .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sncf plans to offer regular train service within germany by 2011 deutsche bahn is supposed to allow competitors access to its track network but has denied locomore 's request - against the wishes of german regulators .
the case is now in court , slowing locomore 's plans , which include purchasing an estimated 100 million euros worth of trains .
similar resistance has hit sncf 's rollout of train service in germany , prompting complaints to the european commission in brussels .
ironically , deutsche bahn hopes to expand its train service in france and has encountered similar setbacks in its efforts to gain access to the french market .
peter ramsauer , germany 's new transport minister , said in an interview november 2 that the french moves " could not go on . "
deutsche bahn employees say the entry of new companies into the rail market will hurt service and make train service " dangerous . "

however , finding appropriate and acceptable candidates is proving more difficult than expected .
the british government still backs former prime minister tony blair , despite his unpopularity in some quarters over his support for the iraq war .
british foreign secretary david miliband on wednesday categorically denied that he is a candidate to become the eu high representative , the bloc 's spokesman on foreign affairs and defense , after his name began circulating last week .

"
his comments immediately fueled speculation that he was striving for leadership of the labour party and possible future premiership .
british business secretary peter mandelson , a former eu trade commissioner , said he had been approached about the foreign policy job after miliband turned it down , but also said he was " committed to remaining in the british government . "

besides the fact that different member states have been proposing different names , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , representing the eu presidency , said he was finding it especially difficult to strike a balance between the political left and right , and the conflicting visions of the smaller and larger eu countries on what role the politicians would play in brussels .

the british government still backs former prime minister tony blair , despite his unpopularity in some quarters over his support for the iraq war .
british foreign secretary david miliband on wednesday categorically denied that he is a candidate to become the eu high representative , the bloc 's spokesman on foreign affairs and defense , after his name began circulating last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british foreign secretary opts for a career at home miliband , speaking at a press conference in london during a visit by the new german foreign minister , guido westerwelle , said he " came to british politics to serve the british people in britain . "
his comments immediately fueled speculation that he was striving for leadership of the labour party and possible future premiership .
british business secretary peter mandelson , a former eu trade commissioner , said he had been approached about the foreign policy job after miliband turned it down , but also said he was " committed to remaining in the british government . "
power struggles marring the selection process the current favorite to become president of the european council is belgium 's center-right prime minister herman van rompuy , who is said to have french and german backing .
but there are some doubts about rompuy in other eu member states , where it is feared he could find himself overshadowed and overwhelmed by berlin and paris .
others would prefer a more forceful foreign policy chief , who would stand up to france and germany , as well as russia , china and the united states .
other names mentioned for the post of president include dutch prime minister peter balkenende , former latvian president vaira vike-freiberga and luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner said on wednesday however that mr. blair was not yet out of the running .
for the foreign affairs job , former italian prime minister massimo d 'alema is considered a strong contender , now that miliband has clearly stated his intention not to take the post .
besides the fact that different member states have been proposing different names , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , representing the eu presidency , said he was finding it especially difficult to strike a balance between the political left and right , and the conflicting visions of the smaller and larger eu countries on what role the politicians would play in brussels .

westerwelle told his danish and british counterparts that he wanted smaller and larger countries to deal with one another at " eye level " .
he also said germany would do everything it could to ensure the success of the international climate summit in copenhagen in december .
westerwelle said , however , that berlin would not be rushed into a decision on boosting its bundeswehr forces in afghanistan .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
where was i when the wall came down ?
i never thought in my lifetime i would see this horrible piece of shame come down .
having visited my grandparents in east germany as a teenager and seen for myself what communism is all about , i can not describe the emotions i had on november 9 .
i celebrated the day with two american friends at mcdonalds with a coke .
i will never forget this day as long as i live . - birgit harms , us we were living in new delhi at the time of the fall of the berlin wall .
i had made friends with a staff member of the east german embassy who was caught completely unaware by the sudden end of the existence of the gdr .
we received the usual invitation for the new year 's eve party from the west german embassy but the new friends from the ex-gdr embassy had also invited us .
we followed our hearts and chose to go to the east german embassy to celebrate new year 1990 on the roof of their now redundant diplomatic mission in asia .
the atmosphere was first somewhat low-spirited .
some of the eastern friends had lost their dreams and uncertainty was a dominant feeling .
we listened and drank champagne .
there was happiness and hope mixed with sadness and some fear .
we answered very simple questions , like " can i apply for a job with more than one company ? "
we had to explain the details of ' western freedom . '
what was for us entirely normal and common practice was very new and unusual for them .
we encouraged them to embrace the change but we did not praise the west over the east .
the wounds in their souls were still wide open and healing was yet to begin .
they were good people who lived for what they believed in and we respected that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' i never thought i would see this horrible piece of shame come down . "
the west german embassy had made it very clear they wanted none of them .
there were perhaps good reasons for this but for those affected it was yet another blow on a body that was already in great pain .
i am sure that all of them did well after the reunification and we feel privileged to have been able to make the sudden and unexpected change a bit easier for them . - dieter & nilima pelz , australia i was assigned to the berlin brigade , office of the commanding general , us army .
i remember the night before , when coming home from the grocery store , you could not get on a subway because they were completely full .
i came back up to the street and found out what was going on .
my german friend bruce schlottow and i made our way from sophie-charlotte platz over to brandenburg gate and watched history unfold in front of us for the next few days .
i can remember smelling the exhaust of the trabbies in the street , seeing how excited everyone was , and how i felt being a part of history .
i have never forgotten that time and i have always considered berlin my home after returning back to dallas , texas . - a. alex arce , us i was an undergraduate student in my advanced german conversation and composition class at a small midwestern liberal arts university .
i was majoring in german , planning to spend a semester abroad in the next year , and my instructor was able to provide us with up to the minute information as she had recently been teaching in east berlin .
for me , this event was monumental and , even from such a distance , the feeling was heady and i was engrossed in watching every moment .
i visited berlin and former east germany for the first time in september 1990 , shortly before reunification .
i was struck by the fact that i had spent most of my day wandering around former east berlin , and only when i crossed at the brandenburger tor , did i realize that east and west were not as obvious as i had thought .
sure , there were landmarks such as the fernsehturm at alexanderplatz and the pieces of wall still standing , but there was also a lot that looked similar and perhaps had already been assimilated by this time . - kathy evenson-mcdermott , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge dominos fell on november 9 2009 , to symbolise the fall of the berlin wall i was born in prague .
my father was slovak , my mother was hungarian .
our family emigrated to new zealand after world war ii .
when the berlin wall came down i was sitting in my bedroom watching tv news .
i was overcome with both joy and sadness and i found myself sobbing .
the sadness came because my father had not lived to witness this event , but i was joyful that it had happened .

where was i when the wall came down ?
i never thought in my lifetime i would see this horrible piece of shame come down .
having visited my grandparents in east germany as a teenager and seen for myself what communism is all about , i can not describe the emotions i had on november 9 .
i celebrated the day with two american friends at mcdonalds with a coke .
i will never forget this day as long as i live . - birgit harms , us we were living in new delhi at the time of the fall of the berlin wall .
i had made friends with a staff member of the east german embassy who was caught completely unaware by the sudden end of the existence of the gdr .
we received the usual invitation for the new year 's eve party from the west german embassy but the new friends from the ex-gdr embassy had also invited us .
we followed our hearts and chose to go to the east german embassy to celebrate new year 1990 on the roof of their now redundant diplomatic mission in asia .
the atmosphere was first somewhat low-spirited .
some of the eastern friends had lost their dreams and uncertainty was a dominant feeling .
we listened and drank champagne .
there was happiness and hope mixed with sadness and some fear .
we answered very simple questions , like " can i apply for a job with more than one company ? "
we had to explain the details of ' western freedom . '
what was for us entirely normal and common practice was very new and unusual for them .
we encouraged them to embrace the change but we did not praise the west over the east .
the wounds in their souls were still wide open and healing was yet to begin .
they were good people who lived for what they believed in and we respected that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' i never thought i would see this horrible piece of shame come down . "
the west german embassy had made it very clear they wanted none of them .
there were perhaps good reasons for this but for those affected it was yet another blow on a body that was already in great pain .
i am sure that all of them did well after the reunification and we feel privileged to have been able to make the sudden and unexpected change a bit easier for them . - dieter & nilima pelz , australia i was assigned to the berlin brigade , office of the commanding general , us army .
i remember the night before , when coming home from the grocery store , you could not get on a subway because they were completely full .
i came back up to the street and found out what was going on .
my german friend bruce schlottow and i made our way from sophie-charlotte platz over to brandenburg gate and watched history unfold in front of us for the next few days .
i can remember smelling the exhaust of the trabbies in the street , seeing how excited everyone was , and how i felt being a part of history .
i have never forgotten that time and i have always considered berlin my home after returning back to dallas , texas . - a. alex arce , us i was an undergraduate student in my advanced german conversation and composition class at a small midwestern liberal arts university .
i was majoring in german , planning to spend a semester abroad in the next year , and my instructor was able to provide us with up to the minute information as she had recently been teaching in east berlin .
for me , this event was monumental and , even from such a distance , the feeling was heady and i was engrossed in watching every moment .
i visited berlin and former east germany for the first time in september 1990 , shortly before reunification .
i was struck by the fact that i had spent most of my day wandering around former east berlin , and only when i crossed at the brandenburger tor , did i realize that east and west were not as obvious as i had thought .
sure , there were landmarks such as the fernsehturm at alexanderplatz and the pieces of wall still standing , but there was also a lot that looked similar and perhaps had already been assimilated by this time . - kathy evenson-mcdermott , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge dominos fell on november 9 2009 , to symbolise the fall of the berlin wall i was born in prague .

when the berlin wall came down i was sitting in my bedroom watching tv news .

and it ’ s not just about necessity , it 's about ideology . dumpster divers are people who search for things that other people have thrown out that are still useful , can be eaten or recycled , and have value .
dumpster divers will not only pick up discarded items left outside people 's homes , but they will climb into dumpsters or bins at apartment buildings and behind shopping centers .
mostly , the so-called divers go about their scavenging under cover of darkness .
some , though , operate openly .
those who dumpster dive out of conviction consider it immoral in these times of economic crisis and widespread hunger that so much that still has value is thrown away .
according to the worldwatch institute in washington , between 30 and 40 percent of edible goods are discarded by supermarkets .
there are as yet , no official statistics for germany .
one man 's rubbish is another man 's treasure rasol eramouni and joerg bergstedt are two german dumpster divers .
armed with protective gloves and torches they set out for the night 's scavenge .
things to look out for : food where the sell-by date has only just expired , or food that is edible but where the packaging has been damaged .
twenty-eight year-old rasol is from syria , a country , he says , where people hardly throw anything away .
in this case rasol , who is unemployed , has joined the dumpster diving tradition out of financial necessity and says it 's a terrible waste , how much good stuff is being thrown away .
" poor people could live from what is discarded .
saving in these hard times ca n't hurt .
why should i walk past fresh bread or a box of good eggs ? "
hasan asks .
hasan has a family to provide for ; for others , like bergstedt , skipping or freeganism is a political statement .
" in some ways , containering has become pretty cool " " young people put on their che guevara hoodies and go containering for a couple of years , " bergstedt said .
bergstedt is one of the german spokespeople for containering .
he has been doing it for fifteen years .
and has managed to get by without spending a cent on basic living .
aside from his political convictions , bergstedt has an economic agenda .
consumerism is fuelled by supply and demand , he says .
if people such as himself do n't buy certain products , there will be no reason for the big supermarkets to keep ordering them .
in this way , bergstedt says , he can remain true to his convictions .
this , he says , is something that would n't be possible if he had to worry about getting to work every day .
the dumpster-diving movement started in the mid 1990s in the us .
the freegans used it as an expression against waste .
with the movement 's growing popularity , corporations have felt obliged to find a legal framework regulating how to deal with it .
in the us , for example , the foodstore chain 7-eleven has left it up to individual stores to decide whether they allow skipping .
in germany it is mostly considered illegal .
" if people trespass , " says lawyer michael biela-baetje , " then they are acting illegally according to paragraph 123 of the german basic law .
if the bin or skip is in a public space , then i assume that there is nothing illegal about it . "
opening a sealed bin to remove food is also illegal in germany and , if caught , the dumpster diver could be charged with theft , says biela-baetje .
this option is often used by supermarkets , which in many cases seal their bins or keep them in enclosed areas .
the larger german supermarkets , it seems , do not share the view that one man 's rubbish is another man 's treasure .
neither rewe nor the tengelmann group were prepared to comment .

where was i when the wall came down ?
i never thought in my lifetime i would see this horrible piece of shame come down .
having visited my grandparents in east germany as a teenager and seen for myself what communism is all about , i can not describe the emotions i had on november 9 .
i celebrated the day with two american friends at mcdonalds with a coke .
i will never forget this day as long as i live . - birgit harms , us we were living in new delhi at the time of the fall of the berlin wall .
i had made friends with a staff member of the east german embassy who was caught completely unaware by the sudden end of the existence of the gdr .
we received the usual invitation for the new year 's eve party from the west german embassy but the new friends from the ex-gdr embassy had also invited us .
we followed our hearts and chose to go to the east german embassy to celebrate new year 1990 on the roof of their now redundant diplomatic mission in asia .
the atmosphere was first somewhat low-spirited .
some of the eastern friends had lost their dreams and uncertainty was a dominant feeling .
we listened and drank champagne .
there was happiness and hope mixed with sadness and some fear .
we answered very simple questions , like " can i apply for a job with more than one company ? "
we had to explain the details of ' western freedom . '
what was for us entirely normal and common practice was very new and unusual for them .
we encouraged them to embrace the change but we did not praise the west over the east .
the wounds in their souls were still wide open and healing was yet to begin .
they were good people who lived for what they believed in and we respected that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' i never thought i would see this horrible piece of shame come down . "
the west german embassy had made it very clear they wanted none of them .
there were perhaps good reasons for this but for those affected it was yet another blow on a body that was already in great pain .
i am sure that all of them did well after the reunification and we feel privileged to have been able to make the sudden and unexpected change a bit easier for them . - dieter & nilima pelz , australia i was assigned to the berlin brigade , office of the commanding general , us army .
i remember the night before , when coming home from the grocery store , you could not get on a subway because they were completely full .
i came back up to the street and found out what was going on .
my german friend bruce schlottow and i made our way from sophie-charlotte platz over to brandenburg gate and watched history unfold in front of us for the next few days .
i can remember smelling the exhaust of the trabbies in the street , seeing how excited everyone was , and how i felt being a part of history .
i have never forgotten that time and i have always considered berlin my home after returning back to dallas , texas . - a. alex arce , us i was an undergraduate student in my advanced german conversation and composition class at a small midwestern liberal arts university .
i was majoring in german , planning to spend a semester abroad in the next year , and my instructor was able to provide us with up to the minute information as she had recently been teaching in east berlin .
for me , this event was monumental and , even from such a distance , the feeling was heady and i was engrossed in watching every moment .
i visited berlin and former east germany for the first time in september 1990 , shortly before reunification .
i was struck by the fact that i had spent most of my day wandering around former east berlin , and only when i crossed at the brandenburger tor , did i realize that east and west were not as obvious as i had thought .
sure , there were landmarks such as the fernsehturm at alexanderplatz and the pieces of wall still standing , but there was also a lot that looked similar and perhaps had already been assimilated by this time . - kathy evenson-mcdermott , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge dominos fell on november 9 2009 , to symbolise the fall of the berlin wall i was born in prague .
my father was slovak , my mother was hungarian .
our family emigrated to new zealand after world war ii .
when the berlin wall came down i was sitting in my bedroom watching tv news .
i was overcome with both joy and sadness and i found myself sobbing .
the sadness came because my father had not lived to witness this event , but i was joyful that it had happened .
i could not think who could understand my feelings and emotion as i was alone , but i thought of a lithuanian friend so i phoned him with the good news .
i was glad i found someone who i could share my feelings with ; a person who understood . - katarina broughton , new zealand i had just returned from visiting my family in germany .
my husband turned on the news and we saw the wall coming down in pieces .
i wished i would have planned my trip to have been there at that time and place . - sabine , us we had come to visit friends in hamburg and drove with them to west berlin , still through east germany at that time .
the excitement was like electricity .
we took a taxi to checkpoint charlie , a place i crossed into east berlin a few times , with sadness and a bitter taste .
it was buzzing this day like a bee hive .
people from all over the world gathered along the wall , hammering and chiseling .
a young frenchman stood next to me and with a big grin , handed me a big piece of its painted section .
i still have it .
people were wandering from east to west and vice versa , some crying , some laughing and hugging each other , complete strangers , yet united in what was at one time an impossible event in our lifetime .
i thought of my father , who went through two world wars together with so many others in his age group .
he would have shed tears too , as i did now .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' checkpoint charlie ... was buzzing this day like a bee hive . "
i returned to the taxi , where we gathered with glasses of champagne .
the first east berliners in their trabants were coming across .
windows rolled down and waving , laughing as we , who stood there , waved back .
i met a couple that had never been to the west .
we embraced each other .
the men were shaking hands and the women were crying .
this terrible division ended and a rebirth began .
the rebirth of a united europe and the end of the ' cold war . ' - isabella miram , us i wept when at long last my " liebes land " was free !
i am not german but since 1942 i have had a love affair with germany .
i do n't know why !
i was only 4 years old !
other than china , on that november 9 the world 's biggest prison - for both east and west - was closed .
november 9 was the greatest day in world history !
alles gute , deutschland - robert mccormick , australia how sad that in her recent speech celebrating the fall of the berlin wall , -lrb- as far as i know -rrb- angela merkel made no mention of the two individuals who , more than anyone else , brought a close to the cold war and the fall of the wall : lady margaret thatcher and president ronald reagan .
reagan and thatcher squarely faced the " evil empire " and refused to be intimidated .
under huge financial pressure , gorbachev was forced to remove all soviet troops from eastern europe .
i was in hungary shortly after the russian army pulled out , and it was obvious to all concerned that it was only a matter of time before the whole communist system fell apart .
the reason the wall came down is that the only thing keeping it up was removed : the red army .
gorbachev did n't tear down the wall , he abandoned it and the freedom-hungry people of germany tore it down . - john roughton , us having visited both west and east germany in 1985 , it was a melancholy experience to visit a divided country , its capital cut in half and its people torn apart by politics .
only four years later , i watched with joy the nation re-unify and put aside its painful past for a new start , at the very heart of an increasingly united europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 11.11.2009 brussels puts berlin on strict financial diet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now is not the time for europe to be flash with its cash the european commission has ordered berlin to tighten its public purse strings and get its accounts back in shape within the next four years . the commission decision , which was announced on wednesday , means eight eu countries including germany and france will have until 2013 to bring their spending back under control and reduce their budget deficits to within three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs , joaquin almunia , said he thought the deadline was " fitting and realistic " .
the decision came as no surprise to germany , which is expecting a five percent hole in it budget next year .
earlier this week , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , told almunia that berlin would comply with eu targets , even though that will make it harder to push ahead with a reform of the german tax system .
almunia , who described schaeuble 's agreement as " extremely credible " , said he believed the german finance minister would find a way to harmonize planned tax cuts with the austerity measures necessary to meet the commission 's 2013 eu spending deadline .
french malcontent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister christine lagarde wants more time germany is not the only country to be told by brussels to put a lid on its outgoings .
italy and belgium have until 2012 to fall back in line with the three percent rule stipulated under the eu stability and growth packet .
spain and france were also set a 2013 deadline , although paris has repeatedly said it is unrealistic .
speaking in brussels on tuesday , french finance minister christine lagarde said that , while 2015 was too late , 2012 was clearly too soon .
" between the two , there is 2013 and 2014 , " lagarde said .
" it is obvious that 2014 already represents a fine effort - i think 2013 will be extremely difficult . "
tailor-made deadlines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recession in britain has forced many businesses to stop trading but 2013 is the date the commission has set for paris .
italy and belgium have until 2012 to get their books in order , while ireland has been granted until 2014 and britain , which has suffered particularly badly as a result of the recession , until 2015 .
the commission 's suggestions have to be accepted by finance ministers , and countries which do not meet the targets risk hefty fines .
greece is now inching closer to that point .
on wednesday , almunia proposed a tougher stance towards athens , which he said had not taken any " effective steps " towards reducing its budget deficit or finding a balance in the greek economy. tkw / ap / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and it ’ s not just about necessity , it 's about ideology . dumpster divers are people who search for things that other people have thrown out that are still useful , can be eaten or recycled , and have value .
dumpster divers will not only pick up discarded items left outside people 's homes , but they will climb into dumpsters or bins at apartment buildings and behind shopping centers .
mostly , the so-called divers go about their scavenging under cover of darkness .
some , though , operate openly .
those who dumpster dive out of conviction consider it immoral in these times of economic crisis and widespread hunger that so much that still has value is thrown away .
according to the worldwatch institute in washington , between 30 and 40 percent of edible goods are discarded by supermarkets .
there are as yet , no official statistics for germany .
one man 's rubbish is another man 's treasure rasol eramouni and joerg bergstedt are two german dumpster divers .
armed with protective gloves and torches they set out for the night 's scavenge .
things to look out for : food where the sell-by date has only just expired , or food that is edible but where the packaging has been damaged .
twenty-eight year-old rasol is from syria , a country , he says , where people hardly throw anything away .
in this case rasol , who is unemployed , has joined the dumpster diving tradition out of financial necessity and says it 's a terrible waste , how much good stuff is being thrown away .
" poor people could live from what is discarded .
saving in these hard times ca n't hurt .
why should i walk past fresh bread or a box of good eggs ? "
hasan asks .
hasan has a family to provide for ; for others , like bergstedt , skipping or freeganism is a political statement .
" in some ways , containering has become pretty cool " " young people put on their che guevara hoodies and go containering for a couple of years , " bergstedt said .
bergstedt is one of the german spokespeople for containering .
he has been doing it for fifteen years .
and has managed to get by without spending a cent on basic living .
aside from his political convictions , bergstedt has an economic agenda .
consumerism is fuelled by supply and demand , he says .
if people such as himself do n't buy certain products , there will be no reason for the big supermarkets to keep ordering them .
in this way , bergstedt says , he can remain true to his convictions .
this , he says , is something that would n't be possible if he had to worry about getting to work every day .
the dumpster-diving movement started in the mid 1990s in the us .
the freegans used it as an expression against waste .
with the movement 's growing popularity , corporations have felt obliged to find a legal framework regulating how to deal with it .
in the us , for example , the foodstore chain 7-eleven has left it up to individual stores to decide whether they allow skipping .
in germany it is mostly considered illegal .
" if people trespass , " says lawyer michael biela-baetje , " then they are acting illegally according to paragraph 123 of the german basic law .
if the bin or skip is in a public space , then i assume that there is nothing illegal about it . "
opening a sealed bin to remove food is also illegal in germany and , if caught , the dumpster diver could be charged with theft , says biela-baetje .
this option is often used by supermarkets , which in many cases seal their bins or keep them in enclosed areas .
the larger german supermarkets , it seems , do not share the view that one man 's rubbish is another man 's treasure .
neither rewe nor the tengelmann group were prepared to comment .

and it ’ s not just about necessity , it 's about ideology . dumpster divers are people who search for things that other people have thrown out that are still useful , can be eaten or recycled , and have value .
dumpster divers will not only pick up discarded items left outside people 's homes , but they will climb into dumpsters or bins at apartment buildings and behind shopping centers .
mostly , the so-called divers go about their scavenging under cover of darkness .
some , though , operate openly .
those who dumpster dive out of conviction consider it immoral in these times of economic crisis and widespread hunger that so much that still has value is thrown away .
according to the worldwatch institute in washington , between 30 and 40 percent of edible goods are discarded by supermarkets .
there are as yet , no official statistics for germany .
one man 's rubbish is another man 's treasure rasol eramouni and joerg bergstedt are two german dumpster divers .
armed with protective gloves and torches they set out for the night 's scavenge .
things to look out for : food where the sell-by date has only just expired , or food that is edible but where the packaging has been damaged .
twenty-eight year-old rasol is from syria , a country , he says , where people hardly throw anything away .
in this case rasol , who is unemployed , has joined the dumpster diving tradition out of financial necessity and says it 's a terrible waste , how much good stuff is being thrown away .
" poor people could live from what is discarded .
saving in these hard times ca n't hurt .
why should i walk past fresh bread or a box of good eggs ? "
hasan asks .
hasan has a family to provide for ; for others , like bergstedt , skipping or freeganism is a political statement .
" in some ways , containering has become pretty cool " " young people put on their che guevara hoodies and go containering for a couple of years , " bergstedt said .
bergstedt is one of the german spokespeople for containering .
he has been doing it for fifteen years .
and has managed to get by without spending a cent on basic living .
aside from his political convictions , bergstedt has an economic agenda .
consumerism is fuelled by supply and demand , he says .
if people such as himself do n't buy certain products , there will be no reason for the big supermarkets to keep ordering them .
in this way , bergstedt says , he can remain true to his convictions .
this , he says , is something that would n't be possible if he had to worry about getting to work every day .
the dumpster-diving movement started in the mid 1990s in the us .
the freegans used it as an expression against waste .
with the movement 's growing popularity , corporations have felt obliged to find a legal framework regulating how to deal with it .
in the us , for example , the foodstore chain 7-eleven has left it up to individual stores to decide whether they allow skipping .
in germany it is mostly considered illegal .
" if people trespass , " says lawyer michael biela-baetje , " then they are acting illegally according to paragraph 123 of the german basic law .
if the bin or skip is in a public space , then i assume that there is nothing illegal about it . "
opening a sealed bin to remove food is also illegal in germany and , if caught , the dumpster diver could be charged with theft , says biela-baetje .
this option is often used by supermarkets , which in many cases seal their bins or keep them in enclosed areas .
the larger german supermarkets , it seems , do not share the view that one man 's rubbish is another man 's treasure .
neither rewe nor the tengelmann group were prepared to comment .

this after supply shortfalls . new health minister philipp roesler said vaccine manufacturer glaxosmithkline -lrb- gsk -rrb- had assured delegates at the emergency flu summit on wednesday , november 11 , that the company was working toward overcoming the shortages the pharmaceuticals giant had pledged to deliver 20 million doses of pandemrix by the end of the year , said roesler .
" these figures already make clear that not everyone can be vaccinated , " he conceded .
" it is now important that not everyone runs to the vaccination points . "
health minister of rhineland-palatinate , malu dreyer , said members of the emergency services would be prioritized .
the chronically will be next in line .
" you do n't have to go out and get vaccinated tomorrow , " said dreyer .
patients sent home earlier this week many germans arriving in doctors ' practices to be vaccinated had to be sent home because of the delivery shortfalls . germany 's state ministers , a representative of the vaccine manufacturer glaxosmithkline -lrb- gsk -rrb- and the heads of two public health institutes were at the summit on wednesday , november 11 , which was convened after reports of shortages in some regions .
after the meeting , thueringen 's health minister said 150,000 adjuvant-free doses of the vaccine would be available for pregnant women in december .
the presence of adjuvants , additives designed to strengthen the active ingredients , in the gsk vaccine have been a cause of concern in germany .
taubert cautioned that there was no cause for hysteria .
she said new supplies of the vaccine would also be delivered in january and february .
ahead of the summit , the state health minister of saxon-anhalt , gerlinde kuppe , called on the pharmaceutical industry to issue reliable figures so that states know how much vaccine they can count on .
" we ca n't accept the vague announcements from week to week that supplies could drop again or they could rise again , " said kuppe .
demand far outstrips supply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the new health minister 's first big challenge up to now , german states have only received around half of the vaccine they were expecting from pharmaceutical company glaxosmithkline -lrb- gsk -rrb- , according to thueringen health ministry 's department head , heinz fracke .
in some areas , the situation is more extreme than others .
the health ministry of germany 's most populous state north rhine-westphalia said it would next week only be receiving 120,000 of the 420,000 doses that it had ordered . roesler told german television on tuesday that he was confident that the required protection could be put in place .
" regional difficulties can arise even in the case of optimum production .
that is why i am appealing for patience , " he said .
" the sector is making an effort and the states are putting on a strong show locally . " gsk spokesman markus hardenblicker said that the guaranteed quotas had been met and that the states were being informed a week in advance of the amount of vaccine that they would be receiving .
he said figures issued in july had been non-binding .
the pharmaceutical company spokesman also said significantly higher levels of supplies of the pandemrix vaccine would be delivered at the end of november and start of december .
however , the company has admitted that there had been initial production difficulties .
germans put skepticism aside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there has been a rise in demand for the flu jab in september a study found that 62 percent of germans polled would not get vaccinated because of concerns about possible side effects . but the demand for vaccination has risen over the last few days after infection rates doubled in one week .
the robert koch institute has now registered more than 40,000 cases and recorded 12 deaths up to november 9 .
the deaths of a 33-year-old woman in aachen and a 33-year-old man in munich from the h1n1 virus were reported in the media on tuesday .
a spokesman of the bavarian federation of pharmacists , thomas metz , said that there had been a leap in interest in vaccination .

this after supply shortfalls . new health minister philipp roesler said vaccine manufacturer glaxosmithkline -lrb- gsk -rrb- had assured delegates at the emergency flu summit on wednesday , november 11 , that the company was working toward overcoming the shortages the pharmaceuticals giant had pledged to deliver 20 million doses of pandemrix by the end of the year , said roesler .
" these figures already make clear that not everyone can be vaccinated , " he conceded .
" it is now important that not everyone runs to the vaccination points . "
health minister of rhineland-palatinate , malu dreyer , said members of the emergency services would be prioritized .
the chronically will be next in line .
" you do n't have to go out and get vaccinated tomorrow , " said dreyer .
patients sent home earlier this week many germans arriving in doctors ' practices to be vaccinated had to be sent home because of the delivery shortfalls . germany 's state ministers , a representative of the vaccine manufacturer glaxosmithkline -lrb- gsk -rrb- and the heads of two public health institutes were at the summit on wednesday , november 11 , which was convened after reports of shortages in some regions .
after the meeting , thueringen 's health minister said 150,000 adjuvant-free doses of the vaccine would be available for pregnant women in december .
the presence of adjuvants , additives designed to strengthen the active ingredients , in the gsk vaccine have been a cause of concern in germany .
taubert cautioned that there was no cause for hysteria .
she said new supplies of the vaccine would also be delivered in january and february .
ahead of the summit , the state health minister of saxon-anhalt , gerlinde kuppe , called on the pharmaceutical industry to issue reliable figures so that states know how much vaccine they can count on .
" we ca n't accept the vague announcements from week to week that supplies could drop again or they could rise again , " said kuppe .
demand far outstrips supply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the new health minister 's first big challenge up to now , german states have only received around half of the vaccine they were expecting from pharmaceutical company glaxosmithkline -lrb- gsk -rrb- , according to thueringen health ministry 's department head , heinz fracke .
in some areas , the situation is more extreme than others .
the health ministry of germany 's most populous state north rhine-westphalia said it would next week only be receiving 120,000 of the 420,000 doses that it had ordered . roesler told german television on tuesday that he was confident that the required protection could be put in place .
" regional difficulties can arise even in the case of optimum production .
that is why i am appealing for patience , " he said .
" the sector is making an effort and the states are putting on a strong show locally . " gsk spokesman markus hardenblicker said that the guaranteed quotas had been met and that the states were being informed a week in advance of the amount of vaccine that they would be receiving .
he said figures issued in july had been non-binding .
the pharmaceutical company spokesman also said significantly higher levels of supplies of the pandemrix vaccine would be delivered at the end of november and start of december .
however , the company has admitted that there had been initial production difficulties .
germans put skepticism aside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there has been a rise in demand for the flu jab in september a study found that 62 percent of germans polled would not get vaccinated because of concerns about possible side effects . but the demand for vaccination has risen over the last few days after infection rates doubled in one week .
the robert koch institute has now registered more than 40,000 cases and recorded 12 deaths up to november 9 .
the deaths of a 33-year-old woman in aachen and a 33-year-old man in munich from the h1n1 virus were reported in the media on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de consumer affairs -pipe- 11.11.2009 dumpster diving stays on trend in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people see one rotten banana and throw the whole bunch away dumpster diving , once the pastime of squatters or the hard-up , has spawned a slew of nicknames ; freeganism , skipping , containering .
and it ’ s not just about necessity , it 's about ideology . dumpster divers are people who search for things that other people have thrown out that are still useful , can be eaten or recycled , and have value .
dumpster divers will not only pick up discarded items left outside people 's homes , but they will climb into dumpsters or bins at apartment buildings and behind shopping centers .
mostly , the so-called divers go about their scavenging under cover of darkness .
some , though , operate openly .
those who dumpster dive out of conviction consider it immoral in these times of economic crisis and widespread hunger that so much that still has value is thrown away .
according to the worldwatch institute in washington , between 30 and 40 percent of edible goods are discarded by supermarkets .
there are as yet , no official statistics for germany .
one man 's rubbish is another man 's treasure rasol eramouni and joerg bergstedt are two german dumpster divers .
armed with protective gloves and torches they set out for the night 's scavenge .
things to look out for : food where the sell-by date has only just expired , or food that is edible but where the packaging has been damaged .
twenty-eight year-old rasol is from syria , a country , he says , where people hardly throw anything away .
in this case rasol , who is unemployed , has joined the dumpster diving tradition out of financial necessity and says it 's a terrible waste , how much good stuff is being thrown away .
" poor people could live from what is discarded .
saving in these hard times ca n't hurt .
why should i walk past fresh bread or a box of good eggs ? "
hasan asks .
hasan has a family to provide for ; for others , like bergstedt , skipping or freeganism is a political statement .
" in some ways , containering has become pretty cool " " young people put on their che guevara hoodies and go containering for a couple of years , " bergstedt said .
bergstedt is one of the german spokespeople for containering .
he has been doing it for fifteen years .
and has managed to get by without spending a cent on basic living .
aside from his political convictions , bergstedt has an economic agenda .
consumerism is fuelled by supply and demand , he says .
if people such as himself do n't buy certain products , there will be no reason for the big supermarkets to keep ordering them .
in this way , bergstedt says , he can remain true to his convictions .
this , he says , is something that would n't be possible if he had to worry about getting to work every day .
the dumpster-diving movement started in the mid 1990s in the us .
the freegans used it as an expression against waste .
with the movement 's growing popularity , corporations have felt obliged to find a legal framework regulating how to deal with it .
in the us , for example , the foodstore chain 7-eleven has left it up to individual stores to decide whether they allow skipping .
in germany it is mostly considered illegal .
" if people trespass , " says lawyer michael biela-baetje , " then they are acting illegally according to paragraph 123 of the german basic law .
if the bin or skip is in a public space , then i assume that there is nothing illegal about it . "
opening a sealed bin to remove food is also illegal in germany and , if caught , the dumpster diver could be charged with theft , says biela-baetje .
this option is often used by supermarkets , which in many cases seal their bins or keep them in enclosed areas .
the larger german supermarkets , it seems , do not share the view that one man 's rubbish is another man 's treasure .
neither rewe nor the tengelmann group were prepared to comment .

this after supply shortfalls . new health minister philipp roesler said vaccine manufacturer glaxosmithkline -lrb- gsk -rrb- had assured delegates at the emergency flu summit on wednesday , november 11 , that the company was working toward overcoming the shortages the pharmaceuticals giant had pledged to deliver 20 million doses of pandemrix by the end of the year , said roesler .
" these figures already make clear that not everyone can be vaccinated , " he conceded .
" it is now important that not everyone runs to the vaccination points . "
health minister of rhineland-palatinate , malu dreyer , said members of the emergency services would be prioritized .
the chronically will be next in line .
" you do n't have to go out and get vaccinated tomorrow , " said dreyer .
patients sent home earlier this week many germans arriving in doctors ' practices to be vaccinated had to be sent home because of the delivery shortfalls . germany 's state ministers , a representative of the vaccine manufacturer glaxosmithkline -lrb- gsk -rrb- and the heads of two public health institutes were at the summit on wednesday , november 11 , which was convened after reports of shortages in some regions .
after the meeting , thueringen 's health minister said 150,000 adjuvant-free doses of the vaccine would be available for pregnant women in december .
the presence of adjuvants , additives designed to strengthen the active ingredients , in the gsk vaccine have been a cause of concern in germany .
taubert cautioned that there was no cause for hysteria .
she said new supplies of the vaccine would also be delivered in january and february .
ahead of the summit , the state health minister of saxon-anhalt , gerlinde kuppe , called on the pharmaceutical industry to issue reliable figures so that states know how much vaccine they can count on .
" we ca n't accept the vague announcements from week to week that supplies could drop again or they could rise again , " said kuppe .
demand far outstrips supply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the new health minister 's first big challenge up to now , german states have only received around half of the vaccine they were expecting from pharmaceutical company glaxosmithkline -lrb- gsk -rrb- , according to thueringen health ministry 's department head , heinz fracke .
in some areas , the situation is more extreme than others .
the health ministry of germany 's most populous state north rhine-westphalia said it would next week only be receiving 120,000 of the 420,000 doses that it had ordered . roesler told german television on tuesday that he was confident that the required protection could be put in place .
" regional difficulties can arise even in the case of optimum production .
that is why i am appealing for patience , " he said .
" the sector is making an effort and the states are putting on a strong show locally . " gsk spokesman markus hardenblicker said that the guaranteed quotas had been met and that the states were being informed a week in advance of the amount of vaccine that they would be receiving .
he said figures issued in july had been non-binding .
the pharmaceutical company spokesman also said significantly higher levels of supplies of the pandemrix vaccine would be delivered at the end of november and start of december .
however , the company has admitted that there had been initial production difficulties .
germans put skepticism aside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there has been a rise in demand for the flu jab in september a study found that 62 percent of germans polled would not get vaccinated because of concerns about possible side effects . but the demand for vaccination has risen over the last few days after infection rates doubled in one week .
the robert koch institute has now registered more than 40,000 cases and recorded 12 deaths up to november 9 .
the deaths of a 33-year-old woman in aachen and a 33-year-old man in munich from the h1n1 virus were reported in the media on tuesday .
a spokesman of the bavarian federation of pharmacists , thomas metz , said that there had been a leap in interest in vaccination .

" these figures already make clear that not everyone can be vaccinated , " he conceded .
" it is now important that not everyone runs to the vaccination points . "
health minister of rhineland-palatinate , malu dreyer , said members of the emergency services would be prioritized .
the chronically will be next in line .

after the meeting , thueringen 's health minister said 150,000 adjuvant-free doses of the vaccine would be available for pregnant women in december .
the presence of adjuvants , additives designed to strengthen the active ingredients , in the gsk vaccine have been a cause of concern in germany .
taubert cautioned that there was no cause for hysteria .
she said new supplies of the vaccine would also be delivered in january and february .
ahead of the summit , the state health minister of saxon-anhalt , gerlinde kuppe , called on the pharmaceutical industry to issue reliable figures so that states know how much vaccine they can count on .

the health ministry of germany 's most populous state north rhine-westphalia said it would next week only be receiving 120,000 of the 420,000 doses that it had ordered . roesler told german television on tuesday that he was confident that the required protection could be put in place .
" regional difficulties can arise even in the case of optimum production .
that is why i am appealing for patience , " he said .
" the sector is making an effort and the states are putting on a strong show locally . " gsk spokesman markus hardenblicker said that the guaranteed quotas had been met and that the states were being informed a week in advance of the amount of vaccine that they would be receiving .
he said figures issued in july had been non-binding .
the pharmaceutical company spokesman also said significantly higher levels of supplies of the pandemrix vaccine would be delivered at the end of november and start of december .

they hope to start service next year , but the bahn is trying to put the brakes on its rivals . the latest entrant to the german rail market is the berlin-based locomore , which will start scheduled service between cologne and hamburg next august using rolling stock that it is set to purchase from austria 's national railway .
the company , founded in 2007 by derek ladewig , has the backing of an american investment firm , the railroad development corporation -lrb- rdc -rrb- , reports wirtschaftswoche in its latest issue .
rdc chairman henry posner told the magazine that his company expects the locomore venture to take time before becoming profitable .
" we 're impatient managers , but patient investors , " posner told wirtschaftswoche .
the magazine reports ladewig plans to start a new firm that would run new rail routes between berlin and frankfurt and stuttgart and hamburg and has already applied for permits to operate the new routes starting 2011 .
unlike the cologne-hamburg route , which will feature different levels of service , ladewig said he hoped to apply budget airline ryanair 's one-class , no-frills business model to the new routes .
not the first competitor , and probably not the last bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : db and france 's sncf currently cooperate but sncf now wants to move into germany locomore is one of several firms eager to chip away at deutsche bahn 's dominance .
at the end of october , the french national railway sncf applied to enter the german market and plans to start running two rail lines from the westernmost french city of strasbourg to hamburg in 2011 under its keolis subsidiary .
one line will travel via cologne and hanover and the other will journey via leipzig and berlin instead .
sncf and deutsche bahn have been cooperating since 2007 on a series of high-speed routes between frankfurt , munich and stuttgart and paris .
the growing number of firms looking to challenge deutsche bahn 's long-time dominance comes as europe 's passenger railway markets are set to become deregulated in 2010 due to new european union rules .
some competition in regional markets already exists , with firms such as the french veolia transport providing short-run rail service across germany , as well as a longer route between rostock and leipzig .
access a struggle the challenge for all new entrants on the german market is how to work with deutsche bahn , which will continue to own and operate the infrastructure that locomore and sncf 's trains will run on through its db netz subsidiary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sncf plans to offer regular train service within germany by 2011 deutsche bahn is supposed to allow competitors access to its track network but has denied locomore 's request - against the wishes of german regulators .
the case is now in court , slowing locomore 's plans , which include purchasing an estimated 100 million euros worth of trains .
similar resistance has hit sncf 's rollout of train service in germany , prompting complaints to the european commission in brussels .
ironically , deutsche bahn hopes to expand its train service in france and has encountered similar setbacks in its efforts to gain access to the french market .
peter ramsauer , germany 's new transport minister , said in an interview november 2 that the french moves " could not go on . "
deutsche bahn employees say the entry of new companies into the rail market will hurt service and make train service " dangerous . "
alexander kirchner , who heads the rail workers union transnet said in an interview with the tagesspiegel newspaper that a price war is " unavoidable . "

dw-world.de france 's sncf takes on deutsche bahn on home turf german national rail deutsche bahn is getting ready for a " bloody battle " with its french counterpart , sncf .
this after reports that the paris-based company was intending to compete with db on several inter-city routes .
-lrb- 30.10.2009 -rrb- german government postpones deutsche bahn share listing berlin was hoping to generate billions of euros from the sale of its national railway , but now with the international financial crisis perhaps it 's better if they wait for a better time .

and it ’ s not just about necessity , it 's about ideology . dumpster divers are people who search for things that other people have thrown out that are still useful , can be eaten or recycled , and have value .
dumpster divers will not only pick up discarded items left outside people 's homes , but they will climb into dumpsters or bins at apartment buildings and behind shopping centers .
mostly , the so-called divers go about their scavenging under cover of darkness .
some , though , operate openly .
those who dumpster dive out of conviction consider it immoral in these times of economic crisis and widespread hunger that so much that still has value is thrown away .
according to the worldwatch institute in washington , between 30 and 40 percent of edible goods are discarded by supermarkets .
there are as yet , no official statistics for germany .

twenty-eight year-old rasol is from syria , a country , he says , where people hardly throw anything away .
in this case rasol , who is unemployed , has joined the dumpster diving tradition out of financial necessity and says it 's a terrible waste , how much good stuff is being thrown away .

" in some ways , containering has become pretty cool " " young people put on their che guevara hoodies and go containering for a couple of years , " bergstedt said .
bergstedt is one of the german spokespeople for containering .
he has been doing it for fifteen years .
and has managed to get by without spending a cent on basic living .
aside from his political convictions , bergstedt has an economic agenda .
consumerism is fuelled by supply and demand , he says .
if people such as himself do n't buy certain products , there will be no reason for the big supermarkets to keep ordering them .
in this way , bergstedt says , he can remain true to his convictions .
this , he says , is something that would n't be possible if he had to worry about getting to work every day .
the dumpster-diving movement started in the mid 1990s in the us .
the freegans used it as an expression against waste .
with the movement 's growing popularity , corporations have felt obliged to find a legal framework regulating how to deal with it .
in the us , for example , the foodstore chain 7-eleven has left it up to individual stores to decide whether they allow skipping .
in germany it is mostly considered illegal .
" if people trespass , " says lawyer michael biela-baetje , " then they are acting illegally according to paragraph 123 of the german basic law .
if the bin or skip is in a public space , then i assume that there is nothing illegal about it . "
opening a sealed bin to remove food is also illegal in germany and , if caught , the dumpster diver could be charged with theft , says biela-baetje .
this option is often used by supermarkets , which in many cases seal their bins or keep them in enclosed areas .
the larger german supermarkets , it seems , do not share the view that one man 's rubbish is another man 's treasure .

and it ’ s not just about necessity , it 's about ideology . dumpster divers are people who search for things that other people have thrown out that are still useful , can be eaten or recycled , and have value .
dumpster divers will not only pick up discarded items left outside people 's homes , but they will climb into dumpsters or bins at apartment buildings and behind shopping centers .
mostly , the so-called divers go about their scavenging under cover of darkness .
some , though , operate openly .
those who dumpster dive out of conviction consider it immoral in these times of economic crisis and widespread hunger that so much that still has value is thrown away .
according to the worldwatch institute in washington , between 30 and 40 percent of edible goods are discarded by supermarkets .
there are as yet , no official statistics for germany .
one man 's rubbish is another man 's treasure rasol eramouni and joerg bergstedt are two german dumpster divers .
armed with protective gloves and torches they set out for the night 's scavenge .
things to look out for : food where the sell-by date has only just expired , or food that is edible but where the packaging has been damaged .
twenty-eight year-old rasol is from syria , a country , he says , where people hardly throw anything away .
in this case rasol , who is unemployed , has joined the dumpster diving tradition out of financial necessity and says it 's a terrible waste , how much good stuff is being thrown away .
" poor people could live from what is discarded .
saving in these hard times ca n't hurt .
why should i walk past fresh bread or a box of good eggs ? "
hasan asks .
hasan has a family to provide for ; for others , like bergstedt , skipping or freeganism is a political statement .
" in some ways , containering has become pretty cool " " young people put on their che guevara hoodies and go containering for a couple of years , " bergstedt said .
bergstedt is one of the german spokespeople for containering .
he has been doing it for fifteen years .
and has managed to get by without spending a cent on basic living .
aside from his political convictions , bergstedt has an economic agenda .
consumerism is fuelled by supply and demand , he says .
if people such as himself do n't buy certain products , there will be no reason for the big supermarkets to keep ordering them .
in this way , bergstedt says , he can remain true to his convictions .
this , he says , is something that would n't be possible if he had to worry about getting to work every day .
the dumpster-diving movement started in the mid 1990s in the us .
the freegans used it as an expression against waste .
with the movement 's growing popularity , corporations have felt obliged to find a legal framework regulating how to deal with it .
in the us , for example , the foodstore chain 7-eleven has left it up to individual stores to decide whether they allow skipping .
in germany it is mostly considered illegal .
" if people trespass , " says lawyer michael biela-baetje , " then they are acting illegally according to paragraph 123 of the german basic law .
if the bin or skip is in a public space , then i assume that there is nothing illegal about it . "
opening a sealed bin to remove food is also illegal in germany and , if caught , the dumpster diver could be charged with theft , says biela-baetje .
this option is often used by supermarkets , which in many cases seal their bins or keep them in enclosed areas .
the larger german supermarkets , it seems , do not share the view that one man 's rubbish is another man 's treasure .
neither rewe nor the tengelmann group were prepared to comment .

tests being conducted on sheep have proven successful up to now . researchers at the university hospital in zurich have already succeeded in cultivating the heart valve of a sheep using the creature 's cells . heart surgeon simon hoerstrop hopes to eventually be able to implant in human patients functioning valves grown out of their own stem cells . this means that many heart patients , particularly young people , may one day not have to undergo rounds of painful transplant surgery to replace artificial valves that they have outgrown . research to help children to date , surgeons have used artificial valves made out of synthetic materials or dead animal tissues in order to avoid any chance of the body rejecting the replacement part . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers are testing the new procedure on sheep one big problem however , particularly in the case of children , is that these substitute valves do not grow within the body .
this means young patients must endure new transplant surgery every few years . some children require as many as five of these operations before they reach adulthood . sheep are ideal guinea pigs simon hoerstrop would like to change this . sheep are particularly well suited to test the procedure , according to hoerstrup .
" it is an ideal model because its anatomy is very similar to that of a human , " he said . in addition , sheep organs quickly calcify if they are not working properly , he added .
this means that scientists can spot much more quickly if something is going wrong than they could in human patients . to create a heart valve , hoerstrup extracts cells from an artery in the sheep 's neck .
the cells are then propagated in the laboratory and are deposited on a scaffold .
this template corresponds almost exactly to the shape of a heart valve . this is then put in a bioreactor where the cells continue to grow and attach themselves to the scaffold , which graduallly dissolves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children with heart valve problems will benefit from the new procedure meanwhile , the nutrient solution is kept constantly in movement while the valve is growing .
it simulates the motion of the heart and is intended to train the new component for its future duty in the body .
the whole process takes a mere eight weeks . the valve is then transplanted back into the sheep , whose stem cells were used to grow the bodily component .
this process allows researchers to avoid any chance of rejection . valve replacement in humans foreseeable in the laboratories of the university hospital of zurich about one hundred human valves are already being successfully grown . although heart surgeon simon hoerstrup and his team are already looking forward to the day when they will be able to transplant a living heart valve into a human patient , he cautions that it is still likely to be a few years from now . author : basil honegger / maria lesser -lrb- gmb -rrb- editor : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

where was i when the wall came down ?
i never thought in my lifetime i would see this horrible piece of shame come down .
having visited my grandparents in east germany as a teenager and seen for myself what communism is all about , i can not describe the emotions i had on november 9 .
i celebrated the day with two american friends at mcdonalds with a coke .
i will never forget this day as long as i live . - birgit harms , us we were living in new delhi at the time of the fall of the berlin wall .
i had made friends with a staff member of the east german embassy who was caught completely unaware by the sudden end of the existence of the gdr .
we received the usual invitation for the new year 's eve party from the west german embassy but the new friends from the ex-gdr embassy had also invited us .
we followed our hearts and chose to go to the east german embassy to celebrate new year 1990 on the roof of their now redundant diplomatic mission in asia .
the atmosphere was first somewhat low-spirited .
some of the eastern friends had lost their dreams and uncertainty was a dominant feeling .
we listened and drank champagne .
there was happiness and hope mixed with sadness and some fear .
we answered very simple questions , like " can i apply for a job with more than one company ? "
we had to explain the details of ' western freedom . '
what was for us entirely normal and common practice was very new and unusual for them .
we encouraged them to embrace the change but we did not praise the west over the east .
the wounds in their souls were still wide open and healing was yet to begin .
they were good people who lived for what they believed in and we respected that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' i never thought i would see this horrible piece of shame come down . "
the west german embassy had made it very clear they wanted none of them .
there were perhaps good reasons for this but for those affected it was yet another blow on a body that was already in great pain .
i am sure that all of them did well after the reunification and we feel privileged to have been able to make the sudden and unexpected change a bit easier for them . - dieter & nilima pelz , australia i was assigned to the berlin brigade , office of the commanding general , us army .
i remember the night before , when coming home from the grocery store , you could not get on a subway because they were completely full .
i came back up to the street and found out what was going on .
my german friend bruce schlottow and i made our way from sophie-charlotte platz over to brandenburg gate and watched history unfold in front of us for the next few days .
i can remember smelling the exhaust of the trabbies in the street , seeing how excited everyone was , and how i felt being a part of history .
i have never forgotten that time and i have always considered berlin my home after returning back to dallas , texas . - a. alex arce , us i was an undergraduate student in my advanced german conversation and composition class at a small midwestern liberal arts university .
i was majoring in german , planning to spend a semester abroad in the next year , and my instructor was able to provide us with up to the minute information as she had recently been teaching in east berlin .
for me , this event was monumental and , even from such a distance , the feeling was heady and i was engrossed in watching every moment .
i visited berlin and former east germany for the first time in september 1990 , shortly before reunification .
i was struck by the fact that i had spent most of my day wandering around former east berlin , and only when i crossed at the brandenburger tor , did i realize that east and west were not as obvious as i had thought .
sure , there were landmarks such as the fernsehturm at alexanderplatz and the pieces of wall still standing , but there was also a lot that looked similar and perhaps had already been assimilated by this time . - kathy evenson-mcdermott , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge dominos fell on november 9 2009 , to symbolise the fall of the berlin wall i was born in prague .
my father was slovak , my mother was hungarian .
our family emigrated to new zealand after world war ii .
when the berlin wall came down i was sitting in my bedroom watching tv news .
i was overcome with both joy and sadness and i found myself sobbing .
the sadness came because my father had not lived to witness this event , but i was joyful that it had happened .
i could not think who could understand my feelings and emotion as i was alone , but i thought of a lithuanian friend so i phoned him with the good news .
i was glad i found someone who i could share my feelings with ; a person who understood . - katarina broughton , new zealand i had just returned from visiting my family in germany .
my husband turned on the news and we saw the wall coming down in pieces .
i wished i would have planned my trip to have been there at that time and place . - sabine , us we had come to visit friends in hamburg and drove with them to west berlin , still through east germany at that time .
the excitement was like electricity .
we took a taxi to checkpoint charlie , a place i crossed into east berlin a few times , with sadness and a bitter taste .
it was buzzing this day like a bee hive .
people from all over the world gathered along the wall , hammering and chiseling .
a young frenchman stood next to me and with a big grin , handed me a big piece of its painted section .
i still have it .
people were wandering from east to west and vice versa , some crying , some laughing and hugging each other , complete strangers , yet united in what was at one time an impossible event in our lifetime .
i thought of my father , who went through two world wars together with so many others in his age group .
he would have shed tears too , as i did now .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' checkpoint charlie ... was buzzing this day like a bee hive . "
i returned to the taxi , where we gathered with glasses of champagne .
the first east berliners in their trabants were coming across .
windows rolled down and waving , laughing as we , who stood there , waved back .
i met a couple that had never been to the west .
we embraced each other .
the men were shaking hands and the women were crying .
this terrible division ended and a rebirth began .
the rebirth of a united europe and the end of the ' cold war . ' - isabella miram , us i wept when at long last my " liebes land " was free !
i am not german but since 1942 i have had a love affair with germany .
i do n't know why !
i was only 4 years old !
other than china , on that november 9 the world 's biggest prison - for both east and west - was closed .
november 9 was the greatest day in world history !
alles gute , deutschland - robert mccormick , australia how sad that in her recent speech celebrating the fall of the berlin wall , -lrb- as far as i know -rrb- angela merkel made no mention of the two individuals who , more than anyone else , brought a close to the cold war and the fall of the wall : lady margaret thatcher and president ronald reagan .
reagan and thatcher squarely faced the " evil empire " and refused to be intimidated .
under huge financial pressure , gorbachev was forced to remove all soviet troops from eastern europe .
i was in hungary shortly after the russian army pulled out , and it was obvious to all concerned that it was only a matter of time before the whole communist system fell apart .
the reason the wall came down is that the only thing keeping it up was removed : the red army .
gorbachev did n't tear down the wall , he abandoned it and the freedom-hungry people of germany tore it down . - john roughton , us having visited both west and east germany in 1985 , it was a melancholy experience to visit a divided country , its capital cut in half and its people torn apart by politics .
only four years later , i watched with joy the nation re-unify and put aside its painful past for a new start , at the very heart of an increasingly united europe .
20 years on , from far away australia , i send you my warmest congratulations on this special day and i wish and hope that germany continues to go from strength to strength . - terry papadis , australia i was 9 years old when the wall came down , so the only things i could clearly remember were the happy people from a fellow european nation celebrating their unity and hope for the future .
nevertheless , that was a powerful message for a young person as myself and i 've never forgotten it .
the fall of the wall and subsequent reunification also meant the end of the cold war and the dream of a peaceful european union , as the one we have today .
for me , germany 's unity symbolizes europe 's unity and the fall of the wall is the most convincing proof that you ca n't divide people with ideological barriers for long . - constantine michailidis , greece compiled by stuart tiffen editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

where was i when the wall came down ?
i never thought in my lifetime i would see this horrible piece of shame come down .
having visited my grandparents in east germany as a teenager and seen for myself what communism is all about , i can not describe the emotions i had on november 9 .
i celebrated the day with two american friends at mcdonalds with a coke .
i will never forget this day as long as i live . - birgit harms , us we were living in new delhi at the time of the fall of the berlin wall .
i had made friends with a staff member of the east german embassy who was caught completely unaware by the sudden end of the existence of the gdr .
we received the usual invitation for the new year 's eve party from the west german embassy but the new friends from the ex-gdr embassy had also invited us .
we followed our hearts and chose to go to the east german embassy to celebrate new year 1990 on the roof of their now redundant diplomatic mission in asia .
the atmosphere was first somewhat low-spirited .
some of the eastern friends had lost their dreams and uncertainty was a dominant feeling .
we listened and drank champagne .
there was happiness and hope mixed with sadness and some fear .
we answered very simple questions , like " can i apply for a job with more than one company ? "
we had to explain the details of ' western freedom . '
what was for us entirely normal and common practice was very new and unusual for them .
we encouraged them to embrace the change but we did not praise the west over the east .
the wounds in their souls were still wide open and healing was yet to begin .
they were good people who lived for what they believed in and we respected that .

they hope to start service next year , but the bahn is trying to put the brakes on its rivals . the latest entrant to the german rail market is the berlin-based locomore , which will start scheduled service between cologne and hamburg next august using rolling stock that it is set to purchase from austria 's national railway .
the company , founded in 2007 by derek ladewig , has the backing of an american investment firm , the railroad development corporation -lrb- rdc -rrb- , reports wirtschaftswoche in its latest issue .
rdc chairman henry posner told the magazine that his company expects the locomore venture to take time before becoming profitable .
" we 're impatient managers , but patient investors , " posner told wirtschaftswoche .
the magazine reports ladewig plans to start a new firm that would run new rail routes between berlin and frankfurt and stuttgart and hamburg and has already applied for permits to operate the new routes starting 2011 .
unlike the cologne-hamburg route , which will feature different levels of service , ladewig said he hoped to apply budget airline ryanair 's one-class , no-frills business model to the new routes .
not the first competitor , and probably not the last bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : db and france 's sncf currently cooperate but sncf now wants to move into germany locomore is one of several firms eager to chip away at deutsche bahn 's dominance .
at the end of october , the french national railway sncf applied to enter the german market and plans to start running two rail lines from the westernmost french city of strasbourg to hamburg in 2011 under its keolis subsidiary .
one line will travel via cologne and hanover and the other will journey via leipzig and berlin instead .
sncf and deutsche bahn have been cooperating since 2007 on a series of high-speed routes between frankfurt , munich and stuttgart and paris .
the growing number of firms looking to challenge deutsche bahn 's long-time dominance comes as europe 's passenger railway markets are set to become deregulated in 2010 due to new european union rules .
some competition in regional markets already exists , with firms such as the french veolia transport providing short-run rail service across germany , as well as a longer route between rostock and leipzig .
access a struggle the challenge for all new entrants on the german market is how to work with deutsche bahn , which will continue to own and operate the infrastructure that locomore and sncf 's trains will run on through its db netz subsidiary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sncf plans to offer regular train service within germany by 2011 deutsche bahn is supposed to allow competitors access to its track network but has denied locomore 's request - against the wishes of german regulators .
the case is now in court , slowing locomore 's plans , which include purchasing an estimated 100 million euros worth of trains .
similar resistance has hit sncf 's rollout of train service in germany , prompting complaints to the european commission in brussels .
ironically , deutsche bahn hopes to expand its train service in france and has encountered similar setbacks in its efforts to gain access to the french market .
peter ramsauer , germany 's new transport minister , said in an interview november 2 that the french moves " could not go on . "
deutsche bahn employees say the entry of new companies into the rail market will hurt service and make train service " dangerous . "
alexander kirchner , who heads the rail workers union transnet said in an interview with the tagesspiegel newspaper that a price war is " unavoidable . "

they hope to start service next year , but the bahn is trying to put the brakes on its rivals . the latest entrant to the german rail market is the berlin-based locomore , which will start scheduled service between cologne and hamburg next august using rolling stock that it is set to purchase from austria 's national railway .
the company , founded in 2007 by derek ladewig , has the backing of an american investment firm , the railroad development corporation -lrb- rdc -rrb- , reports wirtschaftswoche in its latest issue .
rdc chairman henry posner told the magazine that his company expects the locomore venture to take time before becoming profitable .
" we 're impatient managers , but patient investors , " posner told wirtschaftswoche .
the magazine reports ladewig plans to start a new firm that would run new rail routes between berlin and frankfurt and stuttgart and hamburg and has already applied for permits to operate the new routes starting 2011 .
unlike the cologne-hamburg route , which will feature different levels of service , ladewig said he hoped to apply budget airline ryanair 's one-class , no-frills business model to the new routes .

at the end of october , the french national railway sncf applied to enter the german market and plans to start running two rail lines from the westernmost french city of strasbourg to hamburg in 2011 under its keolis subsidiary .
one line will travel via cologne and hanover and the other will journey via leipzig and berlin instead .
sncf and deutsche bahn have been cooperating since 2007 on a series of high-speed routes between frankfurt , munich and stuttgart and paris .
the growing number of firms looking to challenge deutsche bahn 's long-time dominance comes as europe 's passenger railway markets are set to become deregulated in 2010 due to new european union rules .
some competition in regional markets already exists , with firms such as the french veolia transport providing short-run rail service across germany , as well as a longer route between rostock and leipzig .
access a struggle the challenge for all new entrants on the german market is how to work with deutsche bahn , which will continue to own and operate the infrastructure that locomore and sncf 's trains will run on through its db netz subsidiary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sncf plans to offer regular train service within germany by 2011 deutsche bahn is supposed to allow competitors access to its track network but has denied locomore 's request - against the wishes of german regulators .
the case is now in court , slowing locomore 's plans , which include purchasing an estimated 100 million euros worth of trains .
similar resistance has hit sncf 's rollout of train service in germany , prompting complaints to the european commission in brussels .
ironically , deutsche bahn hopes to expand its train service in france and has encountered similar setbacks in its efforts to gain access to the french market .
peter ramsauer , germany 's new transport minister , said in an interview november 2 that the french moves " could not go on . "

although merkel is not the first german chancellor to attend armistice day events in france , her presence at the annual parade marking germany 's surrender , is unprecedented .
standing in paris 91 years after the end of world war i , angela merkel described the relationship between france and germany as " something special , something unique , " and urged " even closer " co-operation between the two countries .
an example to the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy in paris as their national flags fluttered in the wind , the two leaders vowed that their countries would never again go to war against each other .
merkel said that although the past could not be erased , the power of reconciliation helped to bear the burden of what has gone before .
" we show other countries in the world that it is possible to rise above the pain of the past , " merkel said .
the french president told the crowds that it was not an occasion to celebrate , but to remember .
" we are not commemorating the victory of one people over another but an ordeal that was equally terrible for each side , " sarkozy said .
he said germany and france had a duty to uphold .
" we owe it to the people of europe , to the people of the world , to act together . "
an official date in the calendar ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants to make november 11 a day for germany and france sarkozy has proposed making november 11 - which is already a national holiday in france - an official day of franco-german reconciliation .
in a statement , he said he thought the time had come " to join with angela merkel in paris to jointly commemorate the suffering and to honor the momory of the combatants and celebrate the peace of which they dreamed at the bottom of their trenches . "
but the idea of a joint day of reconciliation has received a mixed response from politicians in both countries .
french defense minister herve morin told the canal + television network that he did not welcome the suggestion . however , werner hoyer , minister of state at the german foreign ministry , described it as an exceptional gesture .
helmut kohl was invited by former french president jacques chirac to attend the 80th anniversary commemoration of the 1918 ceasefire in paris . although he accepted , by the time the day came he was no longer in office .

however , finding appropriate and acceptable candidates is proving more difficult than expected .
the british government still backs former prime minister tony blair , despite his unpopularity in some quarters over his support for the iraq war .
british foreign secretary david miliband on wednesday categorically denied that he is a candidate to become the eu high representative , the bloc 's spokesman on foreign affairs and defense , after his name began circulating last week .

"
his comments immediately fueled speculation that he was striving for leadership of the labour party and possible future premiership .
british business secretary peter mandelson , a former eu trade commissioner , said he had been approached about the foreign policy job after miliband turned it down , but also said he was " committed to remaining in the british government . "
power struggles marring the selection process the current favorite to become president of the european council is belgium 's center-right prime minister herman van rompuy , who is said to have french and german backing .
but there are some doubts about rompuy in other eu member states , where it is feared he could find himself overshadowed and overwhelmed by berlin and paris .
others would prefer a more forceful foreign policy chief , who would stand up to france and germany , as well as russia , china and the united states .
other names mentioned for the post of president include dutch prime minister peter balkenende , former latvian president vaira vike-freiberga and luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner said on wednesday however that mr. blair was not yet out of the running .
for the foreign affairs job , former italian prime minister massimo d 'alema is considered a strong contender , now that miliband has clearly stated his intention not to take the post .
besides the fact that different member states have been proposing different names , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , representing the eu presidency , said he was finding it especially difficult to strike a balance between the political left and right , and the conflicting visions of the smaller and larger eu countries on what role the politicians would play in brussels .

westerwelle told his danish and british counterparts that he wanted smaller and larger countries to deal with one another at " eye level " .
he also said germany would do everything it could to ensure the success of the international climate summit in copenhagen in december .
westerwelle said , however , that berlin would not be rushed into a decision on boosting its bundeswehr forces in afghanistan .

however , finding appropriate and acceptable candidates is proving more difficult than expected .
the british government still backs former prime minister tony blair , despite his unpopularity in some quarters over his support for the iraq war .
british foreign secretary david miliband on wednesday categorically denied that he is a candidate to become the eu high representative , the bloc 's spokesman on foreign affairs and defense , after his name began circulating last week .

"
his comments immediately fueled speculation that he was striving for leadership of the labour party and possible future premiership .
british business secretary peter mandelson , a former eu trade commissioner , said he had been approached about the foreign policy job after miliband turned it down , but also said he was " committed to remaining in the british government . "
power struggles marring the selection process the current favorite to become president of the european council is belgium 's center-right prime minister herman van rompuy , who is said to have french and german backing .

others would prefer a more forceful foreign policy chief , who would stand up to france and germany , as well as russia , china and the united states .

french foreign minister bernard kouchner said on wednesday however that mr. blair was not yet out of the running .
for the foreign affairs job , former italian prime minister massimo d 'alema is considered a strong contender , now that miliband has clearly stated his intention not to take the post .
besides the fact that different member states have been proposing different names , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , representing the eu presidency , said he was finding it especially difficult to strike a balance between the political left and right , and the conflicting visions of the smaller and larger eu countries on what role the politicians would play in brussels .

eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs , joaquin almunia , said he thought the deadline was " fitting and realistic " .
the decision came as no surprise to germany , which is expecting a five percent hole in it budget next year .
earlier this week , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , told almunia that berlin would comply with eu targets , even though that will make it harder to push ahead with a reform of the german tax system .

the commission 's suggestions have to be accepted by finance ministers , and countries which do not meet the targets risk hefty fines .
greece is now inching closer to that point .
on wednesday , almunia proposed a tougher stance towards athens , which he said had not taken any " effective steps " towards reducing its budget deficit or finding a balance in the greek economy. tkw / ap / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this after supply shortfalls . new health minister philipp roesler said vaccine manufacturer glaxosmithkline -lrb- gsk -rrb- had assured delegates at the emergency flu summit on wednesday , november 11 , that the company was working toward overcoming the shortages the pharmaceuticals giant had pledged to deliver 20 million doses of pandemrix by the end of the year , said roesler .
" these figures already make clear that not everyone can be vaccinated , " he conceded .
" it is now important that not everyone runs to the vaccination points . "
health minister of rhineland-palatinate , malu dreyer , said members of the emergency services would be prioritized .
the chronically will be next in line .
" you do n't have to go out and get vaccinated tomorrow , " said dreyer .
patients sent home earlier this week many germans arriving in doctors ' practices to be vaccinated had to be sent home because of the delivery shortfalls . germany 's state ministers , a representative of the vaccine manufacturer glaxosmithkline -lrb- gsk -rrb- and the heads of two public health institutes were at the summit on wednesday , november 11 , which was convened after reports of shortages in some regions .
after the meeting , thueringen 's health minister said 150,000 adjuvant-free doses of the vaccine would be available for pregnant women in december .
the presence of adjuvants , additives designed to strengthen the active ingredients , in the gsk vaccine have been a cause of concern in germany .
taubert cautioned that there was no cause for hysteria .
she said new supplies of the vaccine would also be delivered in january and february .
ahead of the summit , the state health minister of saxon-anhalt , gerlinde kuppe , called on the pharmaceutical industry to issue reliable figures so that states know how much vaccine they can count on .
" we ca n't accept the vague announcements from week to week that supplies could drop again or they could rise again , " said kuppe .
demand far outstrips supply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the new health minister 's first big challenge up to now , german states have only received around half of the vaccine they were expecting from pharmaceutical company glaxosmithkline -lrb- gsk -rrb- , according to thueringen health ministry 's department head , heinz fracke .
in some areas , the situation is more extreme than others .
the health ministry of germany 's most populous state north rhine-westphalia said it would next week only be receiving 120,000 of the 420,000 doses that it had ordered . roesler told german television on tuesday that he was confident that the required protection could be put in place .
" regional difficulties can arise even in the case of optimum production .
that is why i am appealing for patience , " he said .
" the sector is making an effort and the states are putting on a strong show locally . " gsk spokesman markus hardenblicker said that the guaranteed quotas had been met and that the states were being informed a week in advance of the amount of vaccine that they would be receiving .
he said figures issued in july had been non-binding .
the pharmaceutical company spokesman also said significantly higher levels of supplies of the pandemrix vaccine would be delivered at the end of november and start of december .
however , the company has admitted that there had been initial production difficulties .
germans put skepticism aside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there has been a rise in demand for the flu jab in september a study found that 62 percent of germans polled would not get vaccinated because of concerns about possible side effects . but the demand for vaccination has risen over the last few days after infection rates doubled in one week .
the robert koch institute has now registered more than 40,000 cases and recorded 12 deaths up to november 9 .
the deaths of a 33-year-old woman in aachen and a 33-year-old man in munich from the h1n1 virus were reported in the media on tuesday .
a spokesman of the bavarian federation of pharmacists , thomas metz , said that there had been a leap in interest in vaccination .

demand far outstrips supply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the new health minister 's first big challenge up to now , german states have only received around half of the vaccine they were expecting from pharmaceutical company glaxosmithkline -lrb- gsk -rrb- , according to thueringen health ministry 's department head , heinz fracke .
in some areas , the situation is more extreme than others .
the health ministry of germany 's most populous state north rhine-westphalia said it would next week only be receiving 120,000 of the 420,000 doses that it had ordered . roesler told german television on tuesday that he was confident that the required protection could be put in place .
" regional difficulties can arise even in the case of optimum production .
that is why i am appealing for patience , " he said .
" the sector is making an effort and the states are putting on a strong show locally . " gsk spokesman markus hardenblicker said that the guaranteed quotas had been met and that the states were being informed a week in advance of the amount of vaccine that they would be receiving .
he said figures issued in july had been non-binding .
the pharmaceutical company spokesman also said significantly higher levels of supplies of the pandemrix vaccine would be delivered at the end of november and start of december .
however , the company has admitted that there had been initial production difficulties .
germans put skepticism aside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there has been a rise in demand for the flu jab in september a study found that 62 percent of germans polled would not get vaccinated because of concerns about possible side effects . but the demand for vaccination has risen over the last few days after infection rates doubled in one week .
the robert koch institute has now registered more than 40,000 cases and recorded 12 deaths up to november 9 .
the deaths of a 33-year-old woman in aachen and a 33-year-old man in munich from the h1n1 virus were reported in the media on tuesday .
a spokesman of the bavarian federation of pharmacists , thomas metz , said that there had been a leap in interest in vaccination .
" it is as if someone has flicked a switch , " he said . jg / ap / reuters / dpa editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and it ’ s not just about necessity , it 's about ideology . dumpster divers are people who search for things that other people have thrown out that are still useful , can be eaten or recycled , and have value .
dumpster divers will not only pick up discarded items left outside people 's homes , but they will climb into dumpsters or bins at apartment buildings and behind shopping centers .
mostly , the so-called divers go about their scavenging under cover of darkness .
some , though , operate openly .
those who dumpster dive out of conviction consider it immoral in these times of economic crisis and widespread hunger that so much that still has value is thrown away .
according to the worldwatch institute in washington , between 30 and 40 percent of edible goods are discarded by supermarkets .
there are as yet , no official statistics for germany .
one man 's rubbish is another man 's treasure rasol eramouni and joerg bergstedt are two german dumpster divers .
armed with protective gloves and torches they set out for the night 's scavenge .
things to look out for : food where the sell-by date has only just expired , or food that is edible but where the packaging has been damaged .
twenty-eight year-old rasol is from syria , a country , he says , where people hardly throw anything away .
in this case rasol , who is unemployed , has joined the dumpster diving tradition out of financial necessity and says it 's a terrible waste , how much good stuff is being thrown away .
" poor people could live from what is discarded .
saving in these hard times ca n't hurt .
why should i walk past fresh bread or a box of good eggs ? "
hasan asks .
hasan has a family to provide for ; for others , like bergstedt , skipping or freeganism is a political statement .
" in some ways , containering has become pretty cool " " young people put on their che guevara hoodies and go containering for a couple of years , " bergstedt said .
bergstedt is one of the german spokespeople for containering .
he has been doing it for fifteen years .
and has managed to get by without spending a cent on basic living .
aside from his political convictions , bergstedt has an economic agenda .
consumerism is fuelled by supply and demand , he says .
if people such as himself do n't buy certain products , there will be no reason for the big supermarkets to keep ordering them .
in this way , bergstedt says , he can remain true to his convictions .
this , he says , is something that would n't be possible if he had to worry about getting to work every day .
the dumpster-diving movement started in the mid 1990s in the us .
the freegans used it as an expression against waste .
with the movement 's growing popularity , corporations have felt obliged to find a legal framework regulating how to deal with it .
in the us , for example , the foodstore chain 7-eleven has left it up to individual stores to decide whether they allow skipping .
in germany it is mostly considered illegal .
" if people trespass , " says lawyer michael biela-baetje , " then they are acting illegally according to paragraph 123 of the german basic law .
if the bin or skip is in a public space , then i assume that there is nothing illegal about it . "
opening a sealed bin to remove food is also illegal in germany and , if caught , the dumpster diver could be charged with theft , says biela-baetje .
this option is often used by supermarkets , which in many cases seal their bins or keep them in enclosed areas .
the larger german supermarkets , it seems , do not share the view that one man 's rubbish is another man 's treasure .
neither rewe nor the tengelmann group were prepared to comment .

and it ’ s not just about necessity , it 's about ideology . dumpster divers are people who search for things that other people have thrown out that are still useful , can be eaten or recycled , and have value .
dumpster divers will not only pick up discarded items left outside people 's homes , but they will climb into dumpsters or bins at apartment buildings and behind shopping centers .
mostly , the so-called divers go about their scavenging under cover of darkness .
some , though , operate openly .
those who dumpster dive out of conviction consider it immoral in these times of economic crisis and widespread hunger that so much that still has value is thrown away .
according to the worldwatch institute in washington , between 30 and 40 percent of edible goods are discarded by supermarkets .
there are as yet , no official statistics for germany .
one man 's rubbish is another man 's treasure rasol eramouni and joerg bergstedt are two german dumpster divers .
armed with protective gloves and torches they set out for the night 's scavenge .
things to look out for : food where the sell-by date has only just expired , or food that is edible but where the packaging has been damaged .
twenty-eight year-old rasol is from syria , a country , he says , where people hardly throw anything away .
in this case rasol , who is unemployed , has joined the dumpster diving tradition out of financial necessity and says it 's a terrible waste , how much good stuff is being thrown away .
" poor people could live from what is discarded .
saving in these hard times ca n't hurt .
why should i walk past fresh bread or a box of good eggs ? "
hasan asks .
hasan has a family to provide for ; for others , like bergstedt , skipping or freeganism is a political statement .
" in some ways , containering has become pretty cool " " young people put on their che guevara hoodies and go containering for a couple of years , " bergstedt said .
bergstedt is one of the german spokespeople for containering .
he has been doing it for fifteen years .
and has managed to get by without spending a cent on basic living .
aside from his political convictions , bergstedt has an economic agenda .
consumerism is fuelled by supply and demand , he says .
if people such as himself do n't buy certain products , there will be no reason for the big supermarkets to keep ordering them .
in this way , bergstedt says , he can remain true to his convictions .
this , he says , is something that would n't be possible if he had to worry about getting to work every day .
the dumpster-diving movement started in the mid 1990s in the us .
the freegans used it as an expression against waste .
with the movement 's growing popularity , corporations have felt obliged to find a legal framework regulating how to deal with it .
in the us , for example , the foodstore chain 7-eleven has left it up to individual stores to decide whether they allow skipping .
in germany it is mostly considered illegal .
" if people trespass , " says lawyer michael biela-baetje , " then they are acting illegally according to paragraph 123 of the german basic law .
if the bin or skip is in a public space , then i assume that there is nothing illegal about it . "
opening a sealed bin to remove food is also illegal in germany and , if caught , the dumpster diver could be charged with theft , says biela-baetje .
this option is often used by supermarkets , which in many cases seal their bins or keep them in enclosed areas .
the larger german supermarkets , it seems , do not share the view that one man 's rubbish is another man 's treasure .
neither rewe nor the tengelmann group were prepared to comment .

however , finding appropriate and acceptable candidates is proving more difficult than expected .
the british government still backs former prime minister tony blair , despite his unpopularity in some quarters over his support for the iraq war .
british foreign secretary david miliband on wednesday categorically denied that he is a candidate to become the eu high representative , the bloc 's spokesman on foreign affairs and defense , after his name began circulating last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british foreign secretary opts for a career at home miliband , speaking at a press conference in london during a visit by the new german foreign minister , guido westerwelle , said he " came to british politics to serve the british people in britain . "
his comments immediately fueled speculation that he was striving for leadership of the labour party and possible future premiership .
british business secretary peter mandelson , a former eu trade commissioner , said he had been approached about the foreign policy job after miliband turned it down , but also said he was " committed to remaining in the british government . "
power struggles marring the selection process the current favorite to become president of the european council is belgium 's center-right prime minister herman van rompuy , who is said to have french and german backing .
but there are some doubts about rompuy in other eu member states , where it is feared he could find himself overshadowed and overwhelmed by berlin and paris .
others would prefer a more forceful foreign policy chief , who would stand up to france and germany , as well as russia , china and the united states .
other names mentioned for the post of president include dutch prime minister peter balkenende , former latvian president vaira vike-freiberga and luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner said on wednesday however that mr. blair was not yet out of the running .
for the foreign affairs job , former italian prime minister massimo d 'alema is considered a strong contender , now that miliband has clearly stated his intention not to take the post .
besides the fact that different member states have been proposing different names , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , representing the eu presidency , said he was finding it especially difficult to strike a balance between the political left and right , and the conflicting visions of the smaller and larger eu countries on what role the politicians would play in brussels .
german foreign minister outlines policy issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foreign minister has been doing the rounds of germany 's allies .
the conflicting visions are a concern that german foreign minister westerwelle touched on during visits to london and earlier to copenhagen .
westerwelle told his danish and british counterparts that he wanted smaller and larger countries to deal with one another at " eye level " .
he also said germany would do everything it could to ensure the success of the international climate summit in copenhagen in december .
westerwelle said , however , that berlin would not be rushed into a decision on boosting its bundeswehr forces in afghanistan .
" before we talk about numbers , we need to agree on a joint strategy , " he said .
the foreign minister spoke at the press conference with miliband in both english and german , after being criticized for not answering a question in english at a meeting with journalists in berlin in september. gb / dpa / afp / ap / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the national player suffered from depression . in a press conference on wednesday , enke 's doctor valentin markser said the soccer star had first come to him in 2003 when he was suffering from a fear of failure on the pitch .
the doctor said he had been treating the goalkeeper for depression since then and confirmed that enke had thought about suicide in the past . the soccer star 's widow , teresa enke , who also attended the press conference , said her husband experienced phases of depression . " i wanted to help him get through it , " she said .
" i tried to be there for him . " but enke always rejected any suggestion that his depression be treated in a hospital .
his widow said he was afraid that in doing so , he would run the risk of losing the couple 's adopted daughter . in his suicide note , enke is said to have apologized to his family and doctors for his decision to take his life and for not having been honest about the severity of his condition . a world cup favorite germany 's national team have called off their saturday match against chile .
" we need to be able to take a moment , " said theo zwanziger , head of the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- at an afternoon press conference .
" there 's no other option , " he said , adding that the decision was made by the dfb management in conjunction with the players . " we thought about playing the game as a farewell to robert , but it is clear it is too soon after this terrible news , " said team manager oliver bierhoff , who was visibly upset during the press conference . zwanziger said the players were already leaving the training complex and would not reconvene until sunday when they would train for next wednesday 's match against the ivory coast . although enke was considered one of the front-runners for the keeper position on the 2010 world cup squad , he was forced to miss the last four games for germany and several matches for hanover due to an intestinal infection and he had not been selected for germany 's friendly matches against chile and the ivory coast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim loew still favored enke for the world cup after sitting out for two months , enke returned to the pitch for hanover on october 31 against cologne .
his last match in the bundesliga came just two days before his death , a 2-2 draw against hamburg . german national coach joachim loew had said it was too early for enke to return to the squad after his illness .
nevertheless , loew had indicated that enke was still his favorite to be germany 's goalkeeper at the world cup finals in south africa next year . the infection , which caused enke to miss key world cup qualifying matches , was not the first personal hardship the goalkeeper faced in his lifetime .
in 2006 he and his wife suffered a personal tragedy with the death of their then two-year-old daughter due to a rare heart condition . german soccer mourns the response from the german soccer community has been both shock and sadness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candles for the goalkeeper " it is a tragedy , " martin kind , president of enke 's bundesliga club hanover 96 , said .
" you expect many things , but not something like that . ” dfb 's zwanziger said he was " stunned and full of sadness . " " we send our deepest sympathies to his wife and family .
robert enke was a wonderful person who had been dealt some tough cards , " he said . fc barcelona , one of enke 's former clubs , held a minute of silence for the german keeper ahead of their spanish cup match against cultural leonesa on tuesday night . in hanover , hundreds of the team 's fans gathered outside the club 's stadium to light candles and leave flowers . " he leaves behind a large hole in our lives , not only in hanover , but for soccer in germany , " said the team 's sports director joerg schmadtke . on wednesday evening , team colleagues and fans gathered for a service of remembrance in hanover .
enke 's funeral will be held on sunday .

the national player suffered from depression . in a press conference on wednesday , enke 's doctor valentin markser said the soccer star had first come to him in 2003 when he was suffering from a fear of failure on the pitch .
the doctor said he had been treating the goalkeeper for depression since then and confirmed that enke had thought about suicide in the past . the soccer star 's widow , teresa enke , who also attended the press conference , said her husband experienced phases of depression . " i wanted to help him get through it , " she said .
" i tried to be there for him . " but enke always rejected any suggestion that his depression be treated in a hospital .
his widow said he was afraid that in doing so , he would run the risk of losing the couple 's adopted daughter . in his suicide note , enke is said to have apologized to his family and doctors for his decision to take his life and for not having been honest about the severity of his condition . a world cup favorite germany 's national team have called off their saturday match against chile .
" we need to be able to take a moment , " said theo zwanziger , head of the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- at an afternoon press conference .
" there 's no other option , " he said , adding that the decision was made by the dfb management in conjunction with the players . " we thought about playing the game as a farewell to robert , but it is clear it is too soon after this terrible news , " said team manager oliver bierhoff , who was visibly upset during the press conference . zwanziger said the players were already leaving the training complex and would not reconvene until sunday when they would train for next wednesday 's match against the ivory coast . although enke was considered one of the front-runners for the keeper position on the 2010 world cup squad , he was forced to miss the last four games for germany and several matches for hanover due to an intestinal infection and he had not been selected for germany 's friendly matches against chile and the ivory coast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim loew still favored enke for the world cup after sitting out for two months , enke returned to the pitch for hanover on october 31 against cologne .
his last match in the bundesliga came just two days before his death , a 2-2 draw against hamburg . german national coach joachim loew had said it was too early for enke to return to the squad after his illness .
nevertheless , loew had indicated that enke was still his favorite to be germany 's goalkeeper at the world cup finals in south africa next year . the infection , which caused enke to miss key world cup qualifying matches , was not the first personal hardship the goalkeeper faced in his lifetime .
in 2006 he and his wife suffered a personal tragedy with the death of their then two-year-old daughter due to a rare heart condition . german soccer mourns the response from the german soccer community has been both shock and sadness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candles for the goalkeeper " it is a tragedy , " martin kind , president of enke 's bundesliga club hanover 96 , said .
" you expect many things , but not something like that . ” dfb 's zwanziger said he was " stunned and full of sadness . " " we send our deepest sympathies to his wife and family .
robert enke was a wonderful person who had been dealt some tough cards , " he said . fc barcelona , one of enke 's former clubs , held a minute of silence for the german keeper ahead of their spanish cup match against cultural leonesa on tuesday night . in hanover , hundreds of the team 's fans gathered outside the club 's stadium to light candles and leave flowers . " he leaves behind a large hole in our lives , not only in hanover , but for soccer in germany , " said the team 's sports director joerg schmadtke . on wednesday evening , team colleagues and fans gathered for a service of remembrance in hanover .
enke 's funeral will be held on sunday .
during the next bundesliga matches a minute of silence will be held and black armbands will be worn in his honor . hf / tkw / mz / rb / dpa / afp / ap editor : nigel tandy / sh send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , finding appropriate and acceptable candidates is proving more difficult than expected .
the british government still backs former prime minister tony blair , despite his unpopularity in some quarters over his support for the iraq war .
british foreign secretary david miliband on wednesday categorically denied that he is a candidate to become the eu high representative , the bloc 's spokesman on foreign affairs and defense , after his name began circulating last week .

"
his comments immediately fueled speculation that he was striving for leadership of the labour party and possible future premiership .
british business secretary peter mandelson , a former eu trade commissioner , said he had been approached about the foreign policy job after miliband turned it down , but also said he was " committed to remaining in the british government . "
power struggles marring the selection process the current favorite to become president of the european council is belgium 's center-right prime minister herman van rompuy , who is said to have french and german backing .
but there are some doubts about rompuy in other eu member states , where it is feared he could find himself overshadowed and overwhelmed by berlin and paris .
others would prefer a more forceful foreign policy chief , who would stand up to france and germany , as well as russia , china and the united states .
other names mentioned for the post of president include dutch prime minister peter balkenende , former latvian president vaira vike-freiberga and luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner said on wednesday however that mr. blair was not yet out of the running .
for the foreign affairs job , former italian prime minister massimo d 'alema is considered a strong contender , now that miliband has clearly stated his intention not to take the post .
besides the fact that different member states have been proposing different names , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , representing the eu presidency , said he was finding it especially difficult to strike a balance between the political left and right , and the conflicting visions of the smaller and larger eu countries on what role the politicians would play in brussels .

westerwelle told his danish and british counterparts that he wanted smaller and larger countries to deal with one another at " eye level " .
he also said germany would do everything it could to ensure the success of the international climate summit in copenhagen in december .
westerwelle said , however , that berlin would not be rushed into a decision on boosting its bundeswehr forces in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de players -pipe- 11.11.2009 opinion : robert enke , a soft-spoken man großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the apparent suicide of german national soccer goalkeeper robert enke is a tragedy - and it begs many questions .
more reserved players like enke are almost ignored in the footballing circus .
dw 's stefan nestler comments . the news of a suicide is shocking - always .
almost involuntarily we ask ourselves : was there really nothing that might have stopped this person taking his own life ?
did he send us any signals of his despair which we failed to notice ?
suddenly confronted by a life that ended too soon , we ask ourselves why .
robert enke was not one of those footballers who sought out every microphone in order to tell the world how important he was .
also , he was not the typical eccentric between the sticks , forever screaming at his defenders , like so many other goalkeepers .
he always seemed reserved and polite , a soft-spoken man .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan nestler in fact , his character was often cited as one of his biggest weaknesses as a keeper .
often the german press would call on enke to put more effort into asserting himself as germany 's number one goalkeeper , to make his own case more passionately and with more vigour in the media .
but that just was n't robert enke 's style .
quieter people like enke are often swamped in the melee that is the soccer circus , where only goals , points , and championships really matter .
to the winner , the spoils .
the loser is lucky to get a sympathetic grimace .
often the common opinion is that someone who earns millions every year for playing sports has nothing to grumble about .
but for robert enke , in both sports and his everyday life , things had not been running smoothly .
at some of the larger foreign clubs that hired him earlier in his career , fc barcelona for example , he spent almost all of his time warming the substitutes ' bench .
and much more recently , once he had finally seemed to establish himself clearly as germany 's number one goalkeeper , an illness stopped him in his tracks .
however the ebbs and flows of his sporting career seem almost banal when compared to what he had endured off the pitch , more specifically the death of his two-year-old daughter in 2006 .
we will never know if that was the catalyst for this tragedy , or whether the process began at another moment in time .
robert enke , the goalkeeper , has been analyzed in painstaking detail for years , however , it seems the wider world failed to even scratch the surface of robert enke , the man .
and now he 's gone .

this after supply shortfalls . new health minister philipp roesler said vaccine manufacturer glaxosmithkline -lrb- gsk -rrb- had assured delegates at the emergency flu summit on wednesday , november 11 , that the company was working toward overcoming the shortages the pharmaceuticals giant had pledged to deliver 20 million doses of pandemrix by the end of the year , said roesler .
" these figures already make clear that not everyone can be vaccinated , " he conceded .
" it is now important that not everyone runs to the vaccination points . "
health minister of rhineland-palatinate , malu dreyer , said members of the emergency services would be prioritized .
the chronically will be next in line .
" you do n't have to go out and get vaccinated tomorrow , " said dreyer .
patients sent home earlier this week many germans arriving in doctors ' practices to be vaccinated had to be sent home because of the delivery shortfalls . germany 's state ministers , a representative of the vaccine manufacturer glaxosmithkline -lrb- gsk -rrb- and the heads of two public health institutes were at the summit on wednesday , november 11 , which was convened after reports of shortages in some regions .
after the meeting , thueringen 's health minister said 150,000 adjuvant-free doses of the vaccine would be available for pregnant women in december .

tests being conducted on sheep have proven successful up to now . researchers at the university hospital in zurich have already succeeded in cultivating the heart valve of a sheep using the creature 's cells . heart surgeon simon hoerstrop hopes to eventually be able to implant in human patients functioning valves grown out of their own stem cells . this means that many heart patients , particularly young people , may one day not have to undergo rounds of painful transplant surgery to replace artificial valves that they have outgrown . research to help children to date , surgeons have used artificial valves made out of synthetic materials or dead animal tissues in order to avoid any chance of the body rejecting the replacement part . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers are testing the new procedure on sheep one big problem however , particularly in the case of children , is that these substitute valves do not grow within the body .

" it is an ideal model because its anatomy is very similar to that of a human , " he said . in addition , sheep organs quickly calcify if they are not working properly , he added .
this means that scientists can spot much more quickly if something is going wrong than they could in human patients . to create a heart valve , hoerstrup extracts cells from an artery in the sheep 's neck .

the whole process takes a mere eight weeks . the valve is then transplanted back into the sheep , whose stem cells were used to grow the bodily component .
this process allows researchers to avoid any chance of rejection . valve replacement in humans foreseeable in the laboratories of the university hospital of zurich about one hundred human valves are already being successfully grown . although heart surgeon simon hoerstrup and his team are already looking forward to the day when they will be able to transplant a living heart valve into a human patient , he cautions that it is still likely to be a few years from now . author : basil honegger / maria lesser -lrb- gmb -rrb- editor : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tests being conducted on sheep have proven successful up to now . researchers at the university hospital in zurich have already succeeded in cultivating the heart valve of a sheep using the creature 's cells . heart surgeon simon hoerstrop hopes to eventually be able to implant in human patients functioning valves grown out of their own stem cells . this means that many heart patients , particularly young people , may one day not have to undergo rounds of painful transplant surgery to replace artificial valves that they have outgrown . research to help children to date , surgeons have used artificial valves made out of synthetic materials or dead animal tissues in order to avoid any chance of the body rejecting the replacement part . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers are testing the new procedure on sheep one big problem however , particularly in the case of children , is that these substitute valves do not grow within the body .
this means young patients must endure new transplant surgery every few years . some children require as many as five of these operations before they reach adulthood . sheep are ideal guinea pigs simon hoerstrop would like to change this . sheep are particularly well suited to test the procedure , according to hoerstrup .
" it is an ideal model because its anatomy is very similar to that of a human , " he said . in addition , sheep organs quickly calcify if they are not working properly , he added .
this means that scientists can spot much more quickly if something is going wrong than they could in human patients . to create a heart valve , hoerstrup extracts cells from an artery in the sheep 's neck .
the cells are then propagated in the laboratory and are deposited on a scaffold .

the whole process takes a mere eight weeks . the valve is then transplanted back into the sheep , whose stem cells were used to grow the bodily component .
this process allows researchers to avoid any chance of rejection . valve replacement in humans foreseeable in the laboratories of the university hospital of zurich about one hundred human valves are already being successfully grown . although heart surgeon simon hoerstrup and his team are already looking forward to the day when they will be able to transplant a living heart valve into a human patient , he cautions that it is still likely to be a few years from now . author : basil honegger / maria lesser -lrb- gmb -rrb- editor : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they hope to start service next year , but the bahn is trying to put the brakes on its rivals . the latest entrant to the german rail market is the berlin-based locomore , which will start scheduled service between cologne and hamburg next august using rolling stock that it is set to purchase from austria 's national railway .
the company , founded in 2007 by derek ladewig , has the backing of an american investment firm , the railroad development corporation -lrb- rdc -rrb- , reports wirtschaftswoche in its latest issue .
rdc chairman henry posner told the magazine that his company expects the locomore venture to take time before becoming profitable .
" we 're impatient managers , but patient investors , " posner told wirtschaftswoche .
the magazine reports ladewig plans to start a new firm that would run new rail routes between berlin and frankfurt and stuttgart and hamburg and has already applied for permits to operate the new routes starting 2011 .
unlike the cologne-hamburg route , which will feature different levels of service , ladewig said he hoped to apply budget airline ryanair 's one-class , no-frills business model to the new routes .

at the end of october , the french national railway sncf applied to enter the german market and plans to start running two rail lines from the westernmost french city of strasbourg to hamburg in 2011 under its keolis subsidiary .
one line will travel via cologne and hanover and the other will journey via leipzig and berlin instead .
sncf and deutsche bahn have been cooperating since 2007 on a series of high-speed routes between frankfurt , munich and stuttgart and paris .
the growing number of firms looking to challenge deutsche bahn 's long-time dominance comes as europe 's passenger railway markets are set to become deregulated in 2010 due to new european union rules .
some competition in regional markets already exists , with firms such as the french veolia transport providing short-run rail service across germany , as well as a longer route between rostock and leipzig .
access a struggle the challenge for all new entrants on the german market is how to work with deutsche bahn , which will continue to own and operate the infrastructure that locomore and sncf 's trains will run on through its db netz subsidiary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sncf plans to offer regular train service within germany by 2011 deutsche bahn is supposed to allow competitors access to its track network but has denied locomore 's request - against the wishes of german regulators .
the case is now in court , slowing locomore 's plans , which include purchasing an estimated 100 million euros worth of trains .
similar resistance has hit sncf 's rollout of train service in germany , prompting complaints to the european commission in brussels .
ironically , deutsche bahn hopes to expand its train service in france and has encountered similar setbacks in its efforts to gain access to the french market .
peter ramsauer , germany 's new transport minister , said in an interview november 2 that the french moves " could not go on . "

they hope to start service next year , but the bahn is trying to put the brakes on its rivals . the latest entrant to the german rail market is the berlin-based locomore , which will start scheduled service between cologne and hamburg next august using rolling stock that it is set to purchase from austria 's national railway .
the company , founded in 2007 by derek ladewig , has the backing of an american investment firm , the railroad development corporation -lrb- rdc -rrb- , reports wirtschaftswoche in its latest issue .
rdc chairman henry posner told the magazine that his company expects the locomore venture to take time before becoming profitable .
" we 're impatient managers , but patient investors , " posner told wirtschaftswoche .
the magazine reports ladewig plans to start a new firm that would run new rail routes between berlin and frankfurt and stuttgart and hamburg and has already applied for permits to operate the new routes starting 2011 .
unlike the cologne-hamburg route , which will feature different levels of service , ladewig said he hoped to apply budget airline ryanair 's one-class , no-frills business model to the new routes .

at the end of october , the french national railway sncf applied to enter the german market and plans to start running two rail lines from the westernmost french city of strasbourg to hamburg in 2011 under its keolis subsidiary .
one line will travel via cologne and hanover and the other will journey via leipzig and berlin instead .
sncf and deutsche bahn have been cooperating since 2007 on a series of high-speed routes between frankfurt , munich and stuttgart and paris .
the growing number of firms looking to challenge deutsche bahn 's long-time dominance comes as europe 's passenger railway markets are set to become deregulated in 2010 due to new european union rules .
some competition in regional markets already exists , with firms such as the french veolia transport providing short-run rail service across germany , as well as a longer route between rostock and leipzig .
access a struggle the challenge for all new entrants on the german market is how to work with deutsche bahn , which will continue to own and operate the infrastructure that locomore and sncf 's trains will run on through its db netz subsidiary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sncf plans to offer regular train service within germany by 2011 deutsche bahn is supposed to allow competitors access to its track network but has denied locomore 's request - against the wishes of german regulators .
the case is now in court , slowing locomore 's plans , which include purchasing an estimated 100 million euros worth of trains .
similar resistance has hit sncf 's rollout of train service in germany , prompting complaints to the european commission in brussels .
ironically , deutsche bahn hopes to expand its train service in france and has encountered similar setbacks in its efforts to gain access to the french market .
peter ramsauer , germany 's new transport minister , said in an interview november 2 that the french moves " could not go on . "
deutsche bahn employees say the entry of new companies into the rail market will hurt service and make train service " dangerous . "

eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs , joaquin almunia , said he thought the deadline was " fitting and realistic " .
the decision came as no surprise to germany , which is expecting a five percent hole in it budget next year .
earlier this week , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , told almunia that berlin would comply with eu targets , even though that will make it harder to push ahead with a reform of the german tax system .
almunia , who described schaeuble 's agreement as " extremely credible " , said he believed the german finance minister would find a way to harmonize planned tax cuts with the austerity measures necessary to meet the commission 's 2013 eu spending deadline .

where was i when the wall came down ?
i never thought in my lifetime i would see this horrible piece of shame come down .
having visited my grandparents in east germany as a teenager and seen for myself what communism is all about , i can not describe the emotions i had on november 9 .
i celebrated the day with two american friends at mcdonalds with a coke .
i will never forget this day as long as i live . - birgit harms , us we were living in new delhi at the time of the fall of the berlin wall .
i had made friends with a staff member of the east german embassy who was caught completely unaware by the sudden end of the existence of the gdr .
we received the usual invitation for the new year 's eve party from the west german embassy but the new friends from the ex-gdr embassy had also invited us .
we followed our hearts and chose to go to the east german embassy to celebrate new year 1990 on the roof of their now redundant diplomatic mission in asia .
the atmosphere was first somewhat low-spirited .
some of the eastern friends had lost their dreams and uncertainty was a dominant feeling .
we listened and drank champagne .
there was happiness and hope mixed with sadness and some fear .
we answered very simple questions , like " can i apply for a job with more than one company ? "
we had to explain the details of ' western freedom . '
what was for us entirely normal and common practice was very new and unusual for them .
we encouraged them to embrace the change but we did not praise the west over the east .
the wounds in their souls were still wide open and healing was yet to begin .
they were good people who lived for what they believed in and we respected that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' i never thought i would see this horrible piece of shame come down . "
the west german embassy had made it very clear they wanted none of them .
there were perhaps good reasons for this but for those affected it was yet another blow on a body that was already in great pain .
i am sure that all of them did well after the reunification and we feel privileged to have been able to make the sudden and unexpected change a bit easier for them . - dieter & nilima pelz , australia i was assigned to the berlin brigade , office of the commanding general , us army .
i remember the night before , when coming home from the grocery store , you could not get on a subway because they were completely full .
i came back up to the street and found out what was going on .
my german friend bruce schlottow and i made our way from sophie-charlotte platz over to brandenburg gate and watched history unfold in front of us for the next few days .
i can remember smelling the exhaust of the trabbies in the street , seeing how excited everyone was , and how i felt being a part of history .
i have never forgotten that time and i have always considered berlin my home after returning back to dallas , texas . - a. alex arce , us i was an undergraduate student in my advanced german conversation and composition class at a small midwestern liberal arts university .
i was majoring in german , planning to spend a semester abroad in the next year , and my instructor was able to provide us with up to the minute information as she had recently been teaching in east berlin .
for me , this event was monumental and , even from such a distance , the feeling was heady and i was engrossed in watching every moment .
i visited berlin and former east germany for the first time in september 1990 , shortly before reunification .
i was struck by the fact that i had spent most of my day wandering around former east berlin , and only when i crossed at the brandenburger tor , did i realize that east and west were not as obvious as i had thought .
sure , there were landmarks such as the fernsehturm at alexanderplatz and the pieces of wall still standing , but there was also a lot that looked similar and perhaps had already been assimilated by this time . - kathy evenson-mcdermott , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge dominos fell on november 9 2009 , to symbolise the fall of the berlin wall i was born in prague .
my father was slovak , my mother was hungarian .
our family emigrated to new zealand after world war ii .
when the berlin wall came down i was sitting in my bedroom watching tv news .
i was overcome with both joy and sadness and i found myself sobbing .
the sadness came because my father had not lived to witness this event , but i was joyful that it had happened .
i could not think who could understand my feelings and emotion as i was alone , but i thought of a lithuanian friend so i phoned him with the good news .
i was glad i found someone who i could share my feelings with ; a person who understood . - katarina broughton , new zealand i had just returned from visiting my family in germany .
my husband turned on the news and we saw the wall coming down in pieces .
i wished i would have planned my trip to have been there at that time and place . - sabine , us we had come to visit friends in hamburg and drove with them to west berlin , still through east germany at that time .
the excitement was like electricity .
we took a taxi to checkpoint charlie , a place i crossed into east berlin a few times , with sadness and a bitter taste .
it was buzzing this day like a bee hive .
people from all over the world gathered along the wall , hammering and chiseling .
a young frenchman stood next to me and with a big grin , handed me a big piece of its painted section .
i still have it .
people were wandering from east to west and vice versa , some crying , some laughing and hugging each other , complete strangers , yet united in what was at one time an impossible event in our lifetime .
i thought of my father , who went through two world wars together with so many others in his age group .
he would have shed tears too , as i did now .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' checkpoint charlie ... was buzzing this day like a bee hive . "
i returned to the taxi , where we gathered with glasses of champagne .
the first east berliners in their trabants were coming across .
windows rolled down and waving , laughing as we , who stood there , waved back .
i met a couple that had never been to the west .
we embraced each other .
the men were shaking hands and the women were crying .
this terrible division ended and a rebirth began .
the rebirth of a united europe and the end of the ' cold war . ' - isabella miram , us i wept when at long last my " liebes land " was free !
i am not german but since 1942 i have had a love affair with germany .
i do n't know why !
i was only 4 years old !
other than china , on that november 9 the world 's biggest prison - for both east and west - was closed .
november 9 was the greatest day in world history !
alles gute , deutschland - robert mccormick , australia how sad that in her recent speech celebrating the fall of the berlin wall , -lrb- as far as i know -rrb- angela merkel made no mention of the two individuals who , more than anyone else , brought a close to the cold war and the fall of the wall : lady margaret thatcher and president ronald reagan .
reagan and thatcher squarely faced the " evil empire " and refused to be intimidated .
under huge financial pressure , gorbachev was forced to remove all soviet troops from eastern europe .
i was in hungary shortly after the russian army pulled out , and it was obvious to all concerned that it was only a matter of time before the whole communist system fell apart .
the reason the wall came down is that the only thing keeping it up was removed : the red army .
gorbachev did n't tear down the wall , he abandoned it and the freedom-hungry people of germany tore it down . - john roughton , us having visited both west and east germany in 1985 , it was a melancholy experience to visit a divided country , its capital cut in half and its people torn apart by politics .
only four years later , i watched with joy the nation re-unify and put aside its painful past for a new start , at the very heart of an increasingly united europe .
20 years on , from far away australia , i send you my warmest congratulations on this special day and i wish and hope that germany continues to go from strength to strength . - terry papadis , australia i was 9 years old when the wall came down , so the only things i could clearly remember were the happy people from a fellow european nation celebrating their unity and hope for the future .
nevertheless , that was a powerful message for a young person as myself and i 've never forgotten it .
the fall of the wall and subsequent reunification also meant the end of the cold war and the dream of a peaceful european union , as the one we have today .
for me , germany 's unity symbolizes europe 's unity and the fall of the wall is the most convincing proof that you ca n't divide people with ideological barriers for long . - constantine michailidis , greece compiled by stuart tiffen editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

where was i when the wall came down ?
i never thought in my lifetime i would see this horrible piece of shame come down .
having visited my grandparents in east germany as a teenager and seen for myself what communism is all about , i can not describe the emotions i had on november 9 .
i celebrated the day with two american friends at mcdonalds with a coke .
i will never forget this day as long as i live . - birgit harms , us we were living in new delhi at the time of the fall of the berlin wall .
i had made friends with a staff member of the east german embassy who was caught completely unaware by the sudden end of the existence of the gdr .
we received the usual invitation for the new year 's eve party from the west german embassy but the new friends from the ex-gdr embassy had also invited us .
we followed our hearts and chose to go to the east german embassy to celebrate new year 1990 on the roof of their now redundant diplomatic mission in asia .
the atmosphere was first somewhat low-spirited .
some of the eastern friends had lost their dreams and uncertainty was a dominant feeling .
we listened and drank champagne .
there was happiness and hope mixed with sadness and some fear .
we answered very simple questions , like " can i apply for a job with more than one company ? "
we had to explain the details of ' western freedom . '
what was for us entirely normal and common practice was very new and unusual for them .
we encouraged them to embrace the change but we did not praise the west over the east .
the wounds in their souls were still wide open and healing was yet to begin .
they were good people who lived for what they believed in and we respected that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' i never thought i would see this horrible piece of shame come down . "
the west german embassy had made it very clear they wanted none of them .
there were perhaps good reasons for this but for those affected it was yet another blow on a body that was already in great pain .
i am sure that all of them did well after the reunification and we feel privileged to have been able to make the sudden and unexpected change a bit easier for them . - dieter & nilima pelz , australia i was assigned to the berlin brigade , office of the commanding general , us army .
i remember the night before , when coming home from the grocery store , you could not get on a subway because they were completely full .
i came back up to the street and found out what was going on .
my german friend bruce schlottow and i made our way from sophie-charlotte platz over to brandenburg gate and watched history unfold in front of us for the next few days .
i can remember smelling the exhaust of the trabbies in the street , seeing how excited everyone was , and how i felt being a part of history .
i have never forgotten that time and i have always considered berlin my home after returning back to dallas , texas . - a. alex arce , us i was an undergraduate student in my advanced german conversation and composition class at a small midwestern liberal arts university .
i was majoring in german , planning to spend a semester abroad in the next year , and my instructor was able to provide us with up to the minute information as she had recently been teaching in east berlin .
for me , this event was monumental and , even from such a distance , the feeling was heady and i was engrossed in watching every moment .
i visited berlin and former east germany for the first time in september 1990 , shortly before reunification .
i was struck by the fact that i had spent most of my day wandering around former east berlin , and only when i crossed at the brandenburger tor , did i realize that east and west were not as obvious as i had thought .
sure , there were landmarks such as the fernsehturm at alexanderplatz and the pieces of wall still standing , but there was also a lot that looked similar and perhaps had already been assimilated by this time . - kathy evenson-mcdermott , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge dominos fell on november 9 2009 , to symbolise the fall of the berlin wall i was born in prague .
my father was slovak , my mother was hungarian .
our family emigrated to new zealand after world war ii .
when the berlin wall came down i was sitting in my bedroom watching tv news .
i was overcome with both joy and sadness and i found myself sobbing .
the sadness came because my father had not lived to witness this event , but i was joyful that it had happened .
i could not think who could understand my feelings and emotion as i was alone , but i thought of a lithuanian friend so i phoned him with the good news .
i was glad i found someone who i could share my feelings with ; a person who understood . - katarina broughton , new zealand i had just returned from visiting my family in germany .
my husband turned on the news and we saw the wall coming down in pieces .
i wished i would have planned my trip to have been there at that time and place . - sabine , us we had come to visit friends in hamburg and drove with them to west berlin , still through east germany at that time .
the excitement was like electricity .
we took a taxi to checkpoint charlie , a place i crossed into east berlin a few times , with sadness and a bitter taste .
it was buzzing this day like a bee hive .
people from all over the world gathered along the wall , hammering and chiseling .
a young frenchman stood next to me and with a big grin , handed me a big piece of its painted section .
i still have it .
people were wandering from east to west and vice versa , some crying , some laughing and hugging each other , complete strangers , yet united in what was at one time an impossible event in our lifetime .
i thought of my father , who went through two world wars together with so many others in his age group .
he would have shed tears too , as i did now .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' checkpoint charlie ... was buzzing this day like a bee hive . "
i returned to the taxi , where we gathered with glasses of champagne .
the first east berliners in their trabants were coming across .
windows rolled down and waving , laughing as we , who stood there , waved back .
i met a couple that had never been to the west .
we embraced each other .
the men were shaking hands and the women were crying .
this terrible division ended and a rebirth began .
the rebirth of a united europe and the end of the ' cold war . ' - isabella miram , us i wept when at long last my " liebes land " was free !
i am not german but since 1942 i have had a love affair with germany .

where was i when the wall came down ?
i never thought in my lifetime i would see this horrible piece of shame come down .
having visited my grandparents in east germany as a teenager and seen for myself what communism is all about , i can not describe the emotions i had on november 9 .
i celebrated the day with two american friends at mcdonalds with a coke .
i will never forget this day as long as i live . - birgit harms , us we were living in new delhi at the time of the fall of the berlin wall .
i had made friends with a staff member of the east german embassy who was caught completely unaware by the sudden end of the existence of the gdr .
we received the usual invitation for the new year 's eve party from the west german embassy but the new friends from the ex-gdr embassy had also invited us .
we followed our hearts and chose to go to the east german embassy to celebrate new year 1990 on the roof of their now redundant diplomatic mission in asia .
the atmosphere was first somewhat low-spirited .
some of the eastern friends had lost their dreams and uncertainty was a dominant feeling .
we listened and drank champagne .
there was happiness and hope mixed with sadness and some fear .
we answered very simple questions , like " can i apply for a job with more than one company ? "
we had to explain the details of ' western freedom . '
what was for us entirely normal and common practice was very new and unusual for them .
we encouraged them to embrace the change but we did not praise the west over the east .
the wounds in their souls were still wide open and healing was yet to begin .
they were good people who lived for what they believed in and we respected that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' i never thought i would see this horrible piece of shame come down . "
the west german embassy had made it very clear they wanted none of them .
there were perhaps good reasons for this but for those affected it was yet another blow on a body that was already in great pain .
i am sure that all of them did well after the reunification and we feel privileged to have been able to make the sudden and unexpected change a bit easier for them . - dieter & nilima pelz , australia i was assigned to the berlin brigade , office of the commanding general , us army .
i remember the night before , when coming home from the grocery store , you could not get on a subway because they were completely full .
i came back up to the street and found out what was going on .
my german friend bruce schlottow and i made our way from sophie-charlotte platz over to brandenburg gate and watched history unfold in front of us for the next few days .
i can remember smelling the exhaust of the trabbies in the street , seeing how excited everyone was , and how i felt being a part of history .
i have never forgotten that time and i have always considered berlin my home after returning back to dallas , texas . - a. alex arce , us i was an undergraduate student in my advanced german conversation and composition class at a small midwestern liberal arts university .
i was majoring in german , planning to spend a semester abroad in the next year , and my instructor was able to provide us with up to the minute information as she had recently been teaching in east berlin .
for me , this event was monumental and , even from such a distance , the feeling was heady and i was engrossed in watching every moment .
i visited berlin and former east germany for the first time in september 1990 , shortly before reunification .
i was struck by the fact that i had spent most of my day wandering around former east berlin , and only when i crossed at the brandenburger tor , did i realize that east and west were not as obvious as i had thought .
sure , there were landmarks such as the fernsehturm at alexanderplatz and the pieces of wall still standing , but there was also a lot that looked similar and perhaps had already been assimilated by this time . - kathy evenson-mcdermott , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge dominos fell on november 9 2009 , to symbolise the fall of the berlin wall i was born in prague .
my father was slovak , my mother was hungarian .
our family emigrated to new zealand after world war ii .
when the berlin wall came down i was sitting in my bedroom watching tv news .
i was overcome with both joy and sadness and i found myself sobbing .
the sadness came because my father had not lived to witness this event , but i was joyful that it had happened .
i could not think who could understand my feelings and emotion as i was alone , but i thought of a lithuanian friend so i phoned him with the good news .
i was glad i found someone who i could share my feelings with ; a person who understood . - katarina broughton , new zealand i had just returned from visiting my family in germany .
my husband turned on the news and we saw the wall coming down in pieces .
i wished i would have planned my trip to have been there at that time and place . - sabine , us we had come to visit friends in hamburg and drove with them to west berlin , still through east germany at that time .
the excitement was like electricity .
we took a taxi to checkpoint charlie , a place i crossed into east berlin a few times , with sadness and a bitter taste .
it was buzzing this day like a bee hive .
people from all over the world gathered along the wall , hammering and chiseling .
a young frenchman stood next to me and with a big grin , handed me a big piece of its painted section .
i still have it .
people were wandering from east to west and vice versa , some crying , some laughing and hugging each other , complete strangers , yet united in what was at one time an impossible event in our lifetime .
i thought of my father , who went through two world wars together with so many others in his age group .

and it ’ s not just about necessity , it 's about ideology . dumpster divers are people who search for things that other people have thrown out that are still useful , can be eaten or recycled , and have value .
dumpster divers will not only pick up discarded items left outside people 's homes , but they will climb into dumpsters or bins at apartment buildings and behind shopping centers .
mostly , the so-called divers go about their scavenging under cover of darkness .
some , though , operate openly .
those who dumpster dive out of conviction consider it immoral in these times of economic crisis and widespread hunger that so much that still has value is thrown away .
according to the worldwatch institute in washington , between 30 and 40 percent of edible goods are discarded by supermarkets .
there are as yet , no official statistics for germany .
one man 's rubbish is another man 's treasure rasol eramouni and joerg bergstedt are two german dumpster divers .
armed with protective gloves and torches they set out for the night 's scavenge .
things to look out for : food where the sell-by date has only just expired , or food that is edible but where the packaging has been damaged .
twenty-eight year-old rasol is from syria , a country , he says , where people hardly throw anything away .
in this case rasol , who is unemployed , has joined the dumpster diving tradition out of financial necessity and says it 's a terrible waste , how much good stuff is being thrown away .
" poor people could live from what is discarded .
saving in these hard times ca n't hurt .
why should i walk past fresh bread or a box of good eggs ? "
hasan asks .
hasan has a family to provide for ; for others , like bergstedt , skipping or freeganism is a political statement .
" in some ways , containering has become pretty cool " " young people put on their che guevara hoodies and go containering for a couple of years , " bergstedt said .
bergstedt is one of the german spokespeople for containering .
he has been doing it for fifteen years .
and has managed to get by without spending a cent on basic living .
aside from his political convictions , bergstedt has an economic agenda .
consumerism is fuelled by supply and demand , he says .
if people such as himself do n't buy certain products , there will be no reason for the big supermarkets to keep ordering them .
in this way , bergstedt says , he can remain true to his convictions .
this , he says , is something that would n't be possible if he had to worry about getting to work every day .
the dumpster-diving movement started in the mid 1990s in the us .
the freegans used it as an expression against waste .
with the movement 's growing popularity , corporations have felt obliged to find a legal framework regulating how to deal with it .
in the us , for example , the foodstore chain 7-eleven has left it up to individual stores to decide whether they allow skipping .
in germany it is mostly considered illegal .
" if people trespass , " says lawyer michael biela-baetje , " then they are acting illegally according to paragraph 123 of the german basic law .
if the bin or skip is in a public space , then i assume that there is nothing illegal about it . "
opening a sealed bin to remove food is also illegal in germany and , if caught , the dumpster diver could be charged with theft , says biela-baetje .
this option is often used by supermarkets , which in many cases seal their bins or keep them in enclosed areas .
the larger german supermarkets , it seems , do not share the view that one man 's rubbish is another man 's treasure .
neither rewe nor the tengelmann group were prepared to comment .

tests being conducted on sheep have proven successful up to now . researchers at the university hospital in zurich have already succeeded in cultivating the heart valve of a sheep using the creature 's cells . heart surgeon simon hoerstrop hopes to eventually be able to implant in human patients functioning valves grown out of their own stem cells . this means that many heart patients , particularly young people , may one day not have to undergo rounds of painful transplant surgery to replace artificial valves that they have outgrown . research to help children to date , surgeons have used artificial valves made out of synthetic materials or dead animal tissues in order to avoid any chance of the body rejecting the replacement part . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers are testing the new procedure on sheep one big problem however , particularly in the case of children , is that these substitute valves do not grow within the body .
this means young patients must endure new transplant surgery every few years . some children require as many as five of these operations before they reach adulthood . sheep are ideal guinea pigs simon hoerstrop would like to change this . sheep are particularly well suited to test the procedure , according to hoerstrup .
" it is an ideal model because its anatomy is very similar to that of a human , " he said . in addition , sheep organs quickly calcify if they are not working properly , he added .
this means that scientists can spot much more quickly if something is going wrong than they could in human patients . to create a heart valve , hoerstrup extracts cells from an artery in the sheep 's neck .
the cells are then propagated in the laboratory and are deposited on a scaffold .
this template corresponds almost exactly to the shape of a heart valve . this is then put in a bioreactor where the cells continue to grow and attach themselves to the scaffold , which graduallly dissolves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children with heart valve problems will benefit from the new procedure meanwhile , the nutrient solution is kept constantly in movement while the valve is growing .
it simulates the motion of the heart and is intended to train the new component for its future duty in the body .
the whole process takes a mere eight weeks . the valve is then transplanted back into the sheep , whose stem cells were used to grow the bodily component .
this process allows researchers to avoid any chance of rejection . valve replacement in humans foreseeable in the laboratories of the university hospital of zurich about one hundred human valves are already being successfully grown . although heart surgeon simon hoerstrup and his team are already looking forward to the day when they will be able to transplant a living heart valve into a human patient , he cautions that it is still likely to be a few years from now . author : basil honegger / maria lesser -lrb- gmb -rrb- editor : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , finding appropriate and acceptable candidates is proving more difficult than expected .
the british government still backs former prime minister tony blair , despite his unpopularity in some quarters over his support for the iraq war .
british foreign secretary david miliband on wednesday categorically denied that he is a candidate to become the eu high representative , the bloc 's spokesman on foreign affairs and defense , after his name began circulating last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british foreign secretary opts for a career at home miliband , speaking at a press conference in london during a visit by the new german foreign minister , guido westerwelle , said he " came to british politics to serve the british people in britain . "
his comments immediately fueled speculation that he was striving for leadership of the labour party and possible future premiership .
british business secretary peter mandelson , a former eu trade commissioner , said he had been approached about the foreign policy job after miliband turned it down , but also said he was " committed to remaining in the british government . "
power struggles marring the selection process the current favorite to become president of the european council is belgium 's center-right prime minister herman van rompuy , who is said to have french and german backing .
but there are some doubts about rompuy in other eu member states , where it is feared he could find himself overshadowed and overwhelmed by berlin and paris .
others would prefer a more forceful foreign policy chief , who would stand up to france and germany , as well as russia , china and the united states .
other names mentioned for the post of president include dutch prime minister peter balkenende , former latvian president vaira vike-freiberga and luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner said on wednesday however that mr. blair was not yet out of the running .
for the foreign affairs job , former italian prime minister massimo d 'alema is considered a strong contender , now that miliband has clearly stated his intention not to take the post .
besides the fact that different member states have been proposing different names , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , representing the eu presidency , said he was finding it especially difficult to strike a balance between the political left and right , and the conflicting visions of the smaller and larger eu countries on what role the politicians would play in brussels .

westerwelle told his danish and british counterparts that he wanted smaller and larger countries to deal with one another at " eye level " .
he also said germany would do everything it could to ensure the success of the international climate summit in copenhagen in december .
westerwelle said , however , that berlin would not be rushed into a decision on boosting its bundeswehr forces in afghanistan .

however , finding appropriate and acceptable candidates is proving more difficult than expected .
the british government still backs former prime minister tony blair , despite his unpopularity in some quarters over his support for the iraq war .
british foreign secretary david miliband on wednesday categorically denied that he is a candidate to become the eu high representative , the bloc 's spokesman on foreign affairs and defense , after his name began circulating last week .

besides the fact that different member states have been proposing different names , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , representing the eu presidency , said he was finding it especially difficult to strike a balance between the political left and right , and the conflicting visions of the smaller and larger eu countries on what role the politicians would play in brussels .

the national player suffered from depression . in a press conference on wednesday , enke 's doctor valentin markser said the soccer star had first come to him in 2003 when he was suffering from a fear of failure on the pitch .
the doctor said he had been treating the goalkeeper for depression since then and confirmed that enke had thought about suicide in the past . the soccer star 's widow , teresa enke , who also attended the press conference , said her husband experienced phases of depression . " i wanted to help him get through it , " she said .
" i tried to be there for him . " but enke always rejected any suggestion that his depression be treated in a hospital .
his widow said he was afraid that in doing so , he would run the risk of losing the couple 's adopted daughter . in his suicide note , enke is said to have apologized to his family and doctors for his decision to take his life and for not having been honest about the severity of his condition . a world cup favorite germany 's national team have called off their saturday match against chile .
" we need to be able to take a moment , " said theo zwanziger , head of the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- at an afternoon press conference .
" there 's no other option , " he said , adding that the decision was made by the dfb management in conjunction with the players . " we thought about playing the game as a farewell to robert , but it is clear it is too soon after this terrible news , " said team manager oliver bierhoff , who was visibly upset during the press conference . zwanziger said the players were already leaving the training complex and would not reconvene until sunday when they would train for next wednesday 's match against the ivory coast . although enke was considered one of the front-runners for the keeper position on the 2010 world cup squad , he was forced to miss the last four games for germany and several matches for hanover due to an intestinal infection and he had not been selected for germany 's friendly matches against chile and the ivory coast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim loew still favored enke for the world cup after sitting out for two months , enke returned to the pitch for hanover on october 31 against cologne .
his last match in the bundesliga came just two days before his death , a 2-2 draw against hamburg . german national coach joachim loew had said it was too early for enke to return to the squad after his illness .
nevertheless , loew had indicated that enke was still his favorite to be germany 's goalkeeper at the world cup finals in south africa next year . the infection , which caused enke to miss key world cup qualifying matches , was not the first personal hardship the goalkeeper faced in his lifetime .
in 2006 he and his wife suffered a personal tragedy with the death of their then two-year-old daughter due to a rare heart condition . german soccer mourns the response from the german soccer community has been both shock and sadness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candles for the goalkeeper " it is a tragedy , " martin kind , president of enke 's bundesliga club hanover 96 , said .
" you expect many things , but not something like that . ” dfb 's zwanziger said he was " stunned and full of sadness . " " we send our deepest sympathies to his wife and family .
robert enke was a wonderful person who had been dealt some tough cards , " he said . fc barcelona , one of enke 's former clubs , held a minute of silence for the german keeper ahead of their spanish cup match against cultural leonesa on tuesday night . in hanover , hundreds of the team 's fans gathered outside the club 's stadium to light candles and leave flowers . " he leaves behind a large hole in our lives , not only in hanover , but for soccer in germany , " said the team 's sports director joerg schmadtke . on wednesday evening , team colleagues and fans gathered for a service of remembrance in hanover .
enke 's funeral will be held on sunday .
during the next bundesliga matches a minute of silence will be held and black armbands will be worn in his honor . hf / tkw / mz / rb / dpa / afp / ap editor : nigel tandy / sh send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the national player suffered from depression . in a press conference on wednesday , enke 's doctor valentin markser said the soccer star had first come to him in 2003 when he was suffering from a fear of failure on the pitch .
the doctor said he had been treating the goalkeeper for depression since then and confirmed that enke had thought about suicide in the past . the soccer star 's widow , teresa enke , who also attended the press conference , said her husband experienced phases of depression . " i wanted to help him get through it , " she said .
" i tried to be there for him . " but enke always rejected any suggestion that his depression be treated in a hospital .
his widow said he was afraid that in doing so , he would run the risk of losing the couple 's adopted daughter . in his suicide note , enke is said to have apologized to his family and doctors for his decision to take his life and for not having been honest about the severity of his condition . a world cup favorite germany 's national team have called off their saturday match against chile .
" we need to be able to take a moment , " said theo zwanziger , head of the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- at an afternoon press conference .
" there 's no other option , " he said , adding that the decision was made by the dfb management in conjunction with the players . " we thought about playing the game as a farewell to robert , but it is clear it is too soon after this terrible news , " said team manager oliver bierhoff , who was visibly upset during the press conference . zwanziger said the players were already leaving the training complex and would not reconvene until sunday when they would train for next wednesday 's match against the ivory coast . although enke was considered one of the front-runners for the keeper position on the 2010 world cup squad , he was forced to miss the last four games for germany and several matches for hanover due to an intestinal infection and he had not been selected for germany 's friendly matches against chile and the ivory coast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim loew still favored enke for the world cup after sitting out for two months , enke returned to the pitch for hanover on october 31 against cologne .
his last match in the bundesliga came just two days before his death , a 2-2 draw against hamburg . german national coach joachim loew had said it was too early for enke to return to the squad after his illness .
nevertheless , loew had indicated that enke was still his favorite to be germany 's goalkeeper at the world cup finals in south africa next year . the infection , which caused enke to miss key world cup qualifying matches , was not the first personal hardship the goalkeeper faced in his lifetime .
in 2006 he and his wife suffered a personal tragedy with the death of their then two-year-old daughter due to a rare heart condition . german soccer mourns the response from the german soccer community has been both shock and sadness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candles for the goalkeeper " it is a tragedy , " martin kind , president of enke 's bundesliga club hanover 96 , said .
" you expect many things , but not something like that . ” dfb 's zwanziger said he was " stunned and full of sadness . " " we send our deepest sympathies to his wife and family .
robert enke was a wonderful person who had been dealt some tough cards , " he said . fc barcelona , one of enke 's former clubs , held a minute of silence for the german keeper ahead of their spanish cup match against cultural leonesa on tuesday night . in hanover , hundreds of the team 's fans gathered outside the club 's stadium to light candles and leave flowers . " he leaves behind a large hole in our lives , not only in hanover , but for soccer in germany , " said the team 's sports director joerg schmadtke . on wednesday evening , team colleagues and fans gathered for a service of remembrance in hanover .
enke 's funeral will be held on sunday .
during the next bundesliga matches a minute of silence will be held and black armbands will be worn in his honor . hf / tkw / mz / rb / dpa / afp / ap editor : nigel tandy / sh send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i celebrated the day with two american friends at mcdonalds with a coke .
i will never forget this day as long as i live . - birgit harms , us we were living in new delhi at the time of the fall of the berlin wall .
i had made friends with a staff member of the east german embassy who was caught completely unaware by the sudden end of the existence of the gdr .
we received the usual invitation for the new year 's eve party from the west german embassy but the new friends from the ex-gdr embassy had also invited us .
we followed our hearts and chose to go to the east german embassy to celebrate new year 1990 on the roof of their now redundant diplomatic mission in asia .
the atmosphere was first somewhat low-spirited .
some of the eastern friends had lost their dreams and uncertainty was a dominant feeling .
we listened and drank champagne .
there was happiness and hope mixed with sadness and some fear .
we answered very simple questions , like " can i apply for a job with more than one company ? "
we had to explain the details of ' western freedom . '
what was for us entirely normal and common practice was very new and unusual for them .
we encouraged them to embrace the change but we did not praise the west over the east .
the wounds in their souls were still wide open and healing was yet to begin .
they were good people who lived for what they believed in and we respected that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' i never thought i would see this horrible piece of shame come down . "
the west german embassy had made it very clear they wanted none of them .
there were perhaps good reasons for this but for those affected it was yet another blow on a body that was already in great pain .
i am sure that all of them did well after the reunification and we feel privileged to have been able to make the sudden and unexpected change a bit easier for them . - dieter & nilima pelz , australia i was assigned to the berlin brigade , office of the commanding general , us army .
i remember the night before , when coming home from the grocery store , you could not get on a subway because they were completely full .
i came back up to the street and found out what was going on .
my german friend bruce schlottow and i made our way from sophie-charlotte platz over to brandenburg gate and watched history unfold in front of us for the next few days .
i can remember smelling the exhaust of the trabbies in the street , seeing how excited everyone was , and how i felt being a part of history .
i have never forgotten that time and i have always considered berlin my home after returning back to dallas , texas . - a. alex arce , us i was an undergraduate student in my advanced german conversation and composition class at a small midwestern liberal arts university .
i was majoring in german , planning to spend a semester abroad in the next year , and my instructor was able to provide us with up to the minute information as she had recently been teaching in east berlin .
for me , this event was monumental and , even from such a distance , the feeling was heady and i was engrossed in watching every moment .
i visited berlin and former east germany for the first time in september 1990 , shortly before reunification .
i was struck by the fact that i had spent most of my day wandering around former east berlin , and only when i crossed at the brandenburger tor , did i realize that east and west were not as obvious as i had thought .
sure , there were landmarks such as the fernsehturm at alexanderplatz and the pieces of wall still standing , but there was also a lot that looked similar and perhaps had already been assimilated by this time . - kathy evenson-mcdermott , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge dominos fell on november 9 2009 , to symbolise the fall of the berlin wall i was born in prague .
my father was slovak , my mother was hungarian .
our family emigrated to new zealand after world war ii .
when the berlin wall came down i was sitting in my bedroom watching tv news .
i was overcome with both joy and sadness and i found myself sobbing .
the sadness came because my father had not lived to witness this event , but i was joyful that it had happened .
i could not think who could understand my feelings and emotion as i was alone , but i thought of a lithuanian friend so i phoned him with the good news .
i was glad i found someone who i could share my feelings with ; a person who understood . - katarina broughton , new zealand i had just returned from visiting my family in germany .
my husband turned on the news and we saw the wall coming down in pieces .
i wished i would have planned my trip to have been there at that time and place . - sabine , us we had come to visit friends in hamburg and drove with them to west berlin , still through east germany at that time .
the excitement was like electricity .
we took a taxi to checkpoint charlie , a place i crossed into east berlin a few times , with sadness and a bitter taste .
it was buzzing this day like a bee hive .
people from all over the world gathered along the wall , hammering and chiseling .
a young frenchman stood next to me and with a big grin , handed me a big piece of its painted section .
i still have it .
people were wandering from east to west and vice versa , some crying , some laughing and hugging each other , complete strangers , yet united in what was at one time an impossible event in our lifetime .
i thought of my father , who went through two world wars together with so many others in his age group .
he would have shed tears too , as i did now .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' checkpoint charlie ... was buzzing this day like a bee hive . "
i returned to the taxi , where we gathered with glasses of champagne .
the first east berliners in their trabants were coming across .
windows rolled down and waving , laughing as we , who stood there , waved back .
i met a couple that had never been to the west .
we embraced each other .
the men were shaking hands and the women were crying .
this terrible division ended and a rebirth began .
the rebirth of a united europe and the end of the ' cold war . ' - isabella miram , us i wept when at long last my " liebes land " was free !
i am not german but since 1942 i have had a love affair with germany .
i do n't know why !
i was only 4 years old !
other than china , on that november 9 the world 's biggest prison - for both east and west - was closed .
november 9 was the greatest day in world history !
alles gute , deutschland - robert mccormick , australia how sad that in her recent speech celebrating the fall of the berlin wall , -lrb- as far as i know -rrb- angela merkel made no mention of the two individuals who , more than anyone else , brought a close to the cold war and the fall of the wall : lady margaret thatcher and president ronald reagan .
reagan and thatcher squarely faced the " evil empire " and refused to be intimidated .
under huge financial pressure , gorbachev was forced to remove all soviet troops from eastern europe .
i was in hungary shortly after the russian army pulled out , and it was obvious to all concerned that it was only a matter of time before the whole communist system fell apart .
the reason the wall came down is that the only thing keeping it up was removed : the red army .
gorbachev did n't tear down the wall , he abandoned it and the freedom-hungry people of germany tore it down . - john roughton , us having visited both west and east germany in 1985 , it was a melancholy experience to visit a divided country , its capital cut in half and its people torn apart by politics .
only four years later , i watched with joy the nation re-unify and put aside its painful past for a new start , at the very heart of an increasingly united europe .
20 years on , from far away australia , i send you my warmest congratulations on this special day and i wish and hope that germany continues to go from strength to strength . - terry papadis , australia i was 9 years old when the wall came down , so the only things i could clearly remember were the happy people from a fellow european nation celebrating their unity and hope for the future .
nevertheless , that was a powerful message for a young person as myself and i 've never forgotten it .
the fall of the wall and subsequent reunification also meant the end of the cold war and the dream of a peaceful european union , as the one we have today .
for me , germany 's unity symbolizes europe 's unity and the fall of the wall is the most convincing proof that you ca n't divide people with ideological barriers for long . - constantine michailidis , greece compiled by stuart tiffen editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

where was i when the wall came down ?
i never thought in my lifetime i would see this horrible piece of shame come down .
having visited my grandparents in east germany as a teenager and seen for myself what communism is all about , i can not describe the emotions i had on november 9 .
i celebrated the day with two american friends at mcdonalds with a coke .
i will never forget this day as long as i live . - birgit harms , us we were living in new delhi at the time of the fall of the berlin wall .
i had made friends with a staff member of the east german embassy who was caught completely unaware by the sudden end of the existence of the gdr .
we received the usual invitation for the new year 's eve party from the west german embassy but the new friends from the ex-gdr embassy had also invited us .
we followed our hearts and chose to go to the east german embassy to celebrate new year 1990 on the roof of their now redundant diplomatic mission in asia .
the atmosphere was first somewhat low-spirited .
some of the eastern friends had lost their dreams and uncertainty was a dominant feeling .
we listened and drank champagne .
there was happiness and hope mixed with sadness and some fear .
we answered very simple questions , like " can i apply for a job with more than one company ? "
we had to explain the details of ' western freedom . '
what was for us entirely normal and common practice was very new and unusual for them .
we encouraged them to embrace the change but we did not praise the west over the east .
the wounds in their souls were still wide open and healing was yet to begin .
they were good people who lived for what they believed in and we respected that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' i never thought i would see this horrible piece of shame come down . "
the west german embassy had made it very clear they wanted none of them .
there were perhaps good reasons for this but for those affected it was yet another blow on a body that was already in great pain .
i am sure that all of them did well after the reunification and we feel privileged to have been able to make the sudden and unexpected change a bit easier for them . - dieter & nilima pelz , australia i was assigned to the berlin brigade , office of the commanding general , us army .
i remember the night before , when coming home from the grocery store , you could not get on a subway because they were completely full .
i came back up to the street and found out what was going on .
my german friend bruce schlottow and i made our way from sophie-charlotte platz over to brandenburg gate and watched history unfold in front of us for the next few days .
i can remember smelling the exhaust of the trabbies in the street , seeing how excited everyone was , and how i felt being a part of history .
i have never forgotten that time and i have always considered berlin my home after returning back to dallas , texas . - a. alex arce , us i was an undergraduate student in my advanced german conversation and composition class at a small midwestern liberal arts university .
i was majoring in german , planning to spend a semester abroad in the next year , and my instructor was able to provide us with up to the minute information as she had recently been teaching in east berlin .
for me , this event was monumental and , even from such a distance , the feeling was heady and i was engrossed in watching every moment .
i visited berlin and former east germany for the first time in september 1990 , shortly before reunification .
i was struck by the fact that i had spent most of my day wandering around former east berlin , and only when i crossed at the brandenburger tor , did i realize that east and west were not as obvious as i had thought .
sure , there were landmarks such as the fernsehturm at alexanderplatz and the pieces of wall still standing , but there was also a lot that looked similar and perhaps had already been assimilated by this time . - kathy evenson-mcdermott , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge dominos fell on november 9 2009 , to symbolise the fall of the berlin wall i was born in prague .
my father was slovak , my mother was hungarian .
our family emigrated to new zealand after world war ii .
when the berlin wall came down i was sitting in my bedroom watching tv news .
i was overcome with both joy and sadness and i found myself sobbing .
the sadness came because my father had not lived to witness this event , but i was joyful that it had happened .
i could not think who could understand my feelings and emotion as i was alone , but i thought of a lithuanian friend so i phoned him with the good news .
i was glad i found someone who i could share my feelings with ; a person who understood . - katarina broughton , new zealand i had just returned from visiting my family in germany .
my husband turned on the news and we saw the wall coming down in pieces .
i wished i would have planned my trip to have been there at that time and place . - sabine , us we had come to visit friends in hamburg and drove with them to west berlin , still through east germany at that time .
the excitement was like electricity .
we took a taxi to checkpoint charlie , a place i crossed into east berlin a few times , with sadness and a bitter taste .
it was buzzing this day like a bee hive .
people from all over the world gathered along the wall , hammering and chiseling .
a young frenchman stood next to me and with a big grin , handed me a big piece of its painted section .
i still have it .
people were wandering from east to west and vice versa , some crying , some laughing and hugging each other , complete strangers , yet united in what was at one time an impossible event in our lifetime .
i thought of my father , who went through two world wars together with so many others in his age group .
he would have shed tears too , as i did now .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' checkpoint charlie ... was buzzing this day like a bee hive . "
i returned to the taxi , where we gathered with glasses of champagne .
the first east berliners in their trabants were coming across .
windows rolled down and waving , laughing as we , who stood there , waved back .
i met a couple that had never been to the west .
we embraced each other .
the men were shaking hands and the women were crying .
this terrible division ended and a rebirth began .
the rebirth of a united europe and the end of the ' cold war . ' - isabella miram , us i wept when at long last my " liebes land " was free !
i am not german but since 1942 i have had a love affair with germany .
i do n't know why !
i was only 4 years old !
other than china , on that november 9 the world 's biggest prison - for both east and west - was closed .
november 9 was the greatest day in world history !
alles gute , deutschland - robert mccormick , australia how sad that in her recent speech celebrating the fall of the berlin wall , -lrb- as far as i know -rrb- angela merkel made no mention of the two individuals who , more than anyone else , brought a close to the cold war and the fall of the wall : lady margaret thatcher and president ronald reagan .
reagan and thatcher squarely faced the " evil empire " and refused to be intimidated .
under huge financial pressure , gorbachev was forced to remove all soviet troops from eastern europe .
i was in hungary shortly after the russian army pulled out , and it was obvious to all concerned that it was only a matter of time before the whole communist system fell apart .
the reason the wall came down is that the only thing keeping it up was removed : the red army .
gorbachev did n't tear down the wall , he abandoned it and the freedom-hungry people of germany tore it down . - john roughton , us having visited both west and east germany in 1985 , it was a melancholy experience to visit a divided country , its capital cut in half and its people torn apart by politics .
only four years later , i watched with joy the nation re-unify and put aside its painful past for a new start , at the very heart of an increasingly united europe .
20 years on , from far away australia , i send you my warmest congratulations on this special day and i wish and hope that germany continues to go from strength to strength . - terry papadis , australia i was 9 years old when the wall came down , so the only things i could clearly remember were the happy people from a fellow european nation celebrating their unity and hope for the future .
nevertheless , that was a powerful message for a young person as myself and i 've never forgotten it .
the fall of the wall and subsequent reunification also meant the end of the cold war and the dream of a peaceful european union , as the one we have today .
for me , germany 's unity symbolizes europe 's unity and the fall of the wall is the most convincing proof that you ca n't divide people with ideological barriers for long . - constantine michailidis , greece compiled by stuart tiffen editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

where was i when the wall came down ?
i never thought in my lifetime i would see this horrible piece of shame come down .
having visited my grandparents in east germany as a teenager and seen for myself what communism is all about , i can not describe the emotions i had on november 9 .
i celebrated the day with two american friends at mcdonalds with a coke .
i will never forget this day as long as i live . - birgit harms , us we were living in new delhi at the time of the fall of the berlin wall .
i had made friends with a staff member of the east german embassy who was caught completely unaware by the sudden end of the existence of the gdr .
we received the usual invitation for the new year 's eve party from the west german embassy but the new friends from the ex-gdr embassy had also invited us .
we followed our hearts and chose to go to the east german embassy to celebrate new year 1990 on the roof of their now redundant diplomatic mission in asia .
the atmosphere was first somewhat low-spirited .
some of the eastern friends had lost their dreams and uncertainty was a dominant feeling .
we listened and drank champagne .
there was happiness and hope mixed with sadness and some fear .
we answered very simple questions , like " can i apply for a job with more than one company ? "
we had to explain the details of ' western freedom . '
what was for us entirely normal and common practice was very new and unusual for them .
we encouraged them to embrace the change but we did not praise the west over the east .
the wounds in their souls were still wide open and healing was yet to begin .
they were good people who lived for what they believed in and we respected that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' i never thought i would see this horrible piece of shame come down . "
the west german embassy had made it very clear they wanted none of them .
there were perhaps good reasons for this but for those affected it was yet another blow on a body that was already in great pain .
i am sure that all of them did well after the reunification and we feel privileged to have been able to make the sudden and unexpected change a bit easier for them . - dieter & nilima pelz , australia i was assigned to the berlin brigade , office of the commanding general , us army .
i remember the night before , when coming home from the grocery store , you could not get on a subway because they were completely full .
i came back up to the street and found out what was going on .
my german friend bruce schlottow and i made our way from sophie-charlotte platz over to brandenburg gate and watched history unfold in front of us for the next few days .
i can remember smelling the exhaust of the trabbies in the street , seeing how excited everyone was , and how i felt being a part of history .
i have never forgotten that time and i have always considered berlin my home after returning back to dallas , texas . - a. alex arce , us i was an undergraduate student in my advanced german conversation and composition class at a small midwestern liberal arts university .
i was majoring in german , planning to spend a semester abroad in the next year , and my instructor was able to provide us with up to the minute information as she had recently been teaching in east berlin .
for me , this event was monumental and , even from such a distance , the feeling was heady and i was engrossed in watching every moment .
i visited berlin and former east germany for the first time in september 1990 , shortly before reunification .
i was struck by the fact that i had spent most of my day wandering around former east berlin , and only when i crossed at the brandenburger tor , did i realize that east and west were not as obvious as i had thought .
sure , there were landmarks such as the fernsehturm at alexanderplatz and the pieces of wall still standing , but there was also a lot that looked similar and perhaps had already been assimilated by this time . - kathy evenson-mcdermott , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge dominos fell on november 9 2009 , to symbolise the fall of the berlin wall i was born in prague .
my father was slovak , my mother was hungarian .
our family emigrated to new zealand after world war ii .
when the berlin wall came down i was sitting in my bedroom watching tv news .
i was overcome with both joy and sadness and i found myself sobbing .
the sadness came because my father had not lived to witness this event , but i was joyful that it had happened .
i could not think who could understand my feelings and emotion as i was alone , but i thought of a lithuanian friend so i phoned him with the good news .
i was glad i found someone who i could share my feelings with ; a person who understood . - katarina broughton , new zealand i had just returned from visiting my family in germany .
my husband turned on the news and we saw the wall coming down in pieces .
i wished i would have planned my trip to have been there at that time and place . - sabine , us we had come to visit friends in hamburg and drove with them to west berlin , still through east germany at that time .
the excitement was like electricity .
we took a taxi to checkpoint charlie , a place i crossed into east berlin a few times , with sadness and a bitter taste .
it was buzzing this day like a bee hive .
people from all over the world gathered along the wall , hammering and chiseling .
a young frenchman stood next to me and with a big grin , handed me a big piece of its painted section .
i still have it .
people were wandering from east to west and vice versa , some crying , some laughing and hugging each other , complete strangers , yet united in what was at one time an impossible event in our lifetime .
i thought of my father , who went through two world wars together with so many others in his age group .
he would have shed tears too , as i did now .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' checkpoint charlie ... was buzzing this day like a bee hive . "
i returned to the taxi , where we gathered with glasses of champagne .
the first east berliners in their trabants were coming across .
windows rolled down and waving , laughing as we , who stood there , waved back .
i met a couple that had never been to the west .
we embraced each other .
the men were shaking hands and the women were crying .
this terrible division ended and a rebirth began .
the rebirth of a united europe and the end of the ' cold war . ' - isabella miram , us i wept when at long last my " liebes land " was free !
i am not german but since 1942 i have had a love affair with germany .
i do n't know why !
i was only 4 years old !
other than china , on that november 9 the world 's biggest prison - for both east and west - was closed .
november 9 was the greatest day in world history !
alles gute , deutschland - robert mccormick , australia how sad that in her recent speech celebrating the fall of the berlin wall , -lrb- as far as i know -rrb- angela merkel made no mention of the two individuals who , more than anyone else , brought a close to the cold war and the fall of the wall : lady margaret thatcher and president ronald reagan .
reagan and thatcher squarely faced the " evil empire " and refused to be intimidated .
under huge financial pressure , gorbachev was forced to remove all soviet troops from eastern europe .
i was in hungary shortly after the russian army pulled out , and it was obvious to all concerned that it was only a matter of time before the whole communist system fell apart .
the reason the wall came down is that the only thing keeping it up was removed : the red army .
gorbachev did n't tear down the wall , he abandoned it and the freedom-hungry people of germany tore it down . - john roughton , us having visited both west and east germany in 1985 , it was a melancholy experience to visit a divided country , its capital cut in half and its people torn apart by politics .
only four years later , i watched with joy the nation re-unify and put aside its painful past for a new start , at the very heart of an increasingly united europe .
20 years on , from far away australia , i send you my warmest congratulations on this special day and i wish and hope that germany continues to go from strength to strength . - terry papadis , australia i was 9 years old when the wall came down , so the only things i could clearly remember were the happy people from a fellow european nation celebrating their unity and hope for the future .

they hope to start service next year , but the bahn is trying to put the brakes on its rivals . the latest entrant to the german rail market is the berlin-based locomore , which will start scheduled service between cologne and hamburg next august using rolling stock that it is set to purchase from austria 's national railway .
the company , founded in 2007 by derek ladewig , has the backing of an american investment firm , the railroad development corporation -lrb- rdc -rrb- , reports wirtschaftswoche in its latest issue .
rdc chairman henry posner told the magazine that his company expects the locomore venture to take time before becoming profitable .
" we 're impatient managers , but patient investors , " posner told wirtschaftswoche .
the magazine reports ladewig plans to start a new firm that would run new rail routes between berlin and frankfurt and stuttgart and hamburg and has already applied for permits to operate the new routes starting 2011 .

at the end of october , the french national railway sncf applied to enter the german market and plans to start running two rail lines from the westernmost french city of strasbourg to hamburg in 2011 under its keolis subsidiary .
one line will travel via cologne and hanover and the other will journey via leipzig and berlin instead .
sncf and deutsche bahn have been cooperating since 2007 on a series of high-speed routes between frankfurt , munich and stuttgart and paris .
the growing number of firms looking to challenge deutsche bahn 's long-time dominance comes as europe 's passenger railway markets are set to become deregulated in 2010 due to new european union rules .
some competition in regional markets already exists , with firms such as the french veolia transport providing short-run rail service across germany , as well as a longer route between rostock and leipzig .

similar resistance has hit sncf 's rollout of train service in germany , prompting complaints to the european commission in brussels .
ironically , deutsche bahn hopes to expand its train service in france and has encountered similar setbacks in its efforts to gain access to the french market .

they hope to start service next year , but the bahn is trying to put the brakes on its rivals . the latest entrant to the german rail market is the berlin-based locomore , which will start scheduled service between cologne and hamburg next august using rolling stock that it is set to purchase from austria 's national railway .
the company , founded in 2007 by derek ladewig , has the backing of an american investment firm , the railroad development corporation -lrb- rdc -rrb- , reports wirtschaftswoche in its latest issue .
rdc chairman henry posner told the magazine that his company expects the locomore venture to take time before becoming profitable .
" we 're impatient managers , but patient investors , " posner told wirtschaftswoche .
the magazine reports ladewig plans to start a new firm that would run new rail routes between berlin and frankfurt and stuttgart and hamburg and has already applied for permits to operate the new routes starting 2011 .

one line will travel via cologne and hanover and the other will journey via leipzig and berlin instead .
sncf and deutsche bahn have been cooperating since 2007 on a series of high-speed routes between frankfurt , munich and stuttgart and paris .
the growing number of firms looking to challenge deutsche bahn 's long-time dominance comes as europe 's passenger railway markets are set to become deregulated in 2010 due to new european union rules .
some competition in regional markets already exists , with firms such as the french veolia transport providing short-run rail service across germany , as well as a longer route between rostock and leipzig .
access a struggle the challenge for all new entrants on the german market is how to work with deutsche bahn , which will continue to own and operate the infrastructure that locomore and sncf 's trains will run on through its db netz subsidiary .

they hope to start service next year , but the bahn is trying to put the brakes on its rivals . the latest entrant to the german rail market is the berlin-based locomore , which will start scheduled service between cologne and hamburg next august using rolling stock that it is set to purchase from austria 's national railway .
the company , founded in 2007 by derek ladewig , has the backing of an american investment firm , the railroad development corporation -lrb- rdc -rrb- , reports wirtschaftswoche in its latest issue .
rdc chairman henry posner told the magazine that his company expects the locomore venture to take time before becoming profitable .
" we 're impatient managers , but patient investors , " posner told wirtschaftswoche .
the magazine reports ladewig plans to start a new firm that would run new rail routes between berlin and frankfurt and stuttgart and hamburg and has already applied for permits to operate the new routes starting 2011 .
unlike the cologne-hamburg route , which will feature different levels of service , ladewig said he hoped to apply budget airline ryanair 's one-class , no-frills business model to the new routes .
not the first competitor , and probably not the last bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : db and france 's sncf currently cooperate but sncf now wants to move into germany locomore is one of several firms eager to chip away at deutsche bahn 's dominance .
at the end of october , the french national railway sncf applied to enter the german market and plans to start running two rail lines from the westernmost french city of strasbourg to hamburg in 2011 under its keolis subsidiary .
one line will travel via cologne and hanover and the other will journey via leipzig and berlin instead .
sncf and deutsche bahn have been cooperating since 2007 on a series of high-speed routes between frankfurt , munich and stuttgart and paris .
the growing number of firms looking to challenge deutsche bahn 's long-time dominance comes as europe 's passenger railway markets are set to become deregulated in 2010 due to new european union rules .
some competition in regional markets already exists , with firms such as the french veolia transport providing short-run rail service across germany , as well as a longer route between rostock and leipzig .
access a struggle the challenge for all new entrants on the german market is how to work with deutsche bahn , which will continue to own and operate the infrastructure that locomore and sncf 's trains will run on through its db netz subsidiary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sncf plans to offer regular train service within germany by 2011 deutsche bahn is supposed to allow competitors access to its track network but has denied locomore 's request - against the wishes of german regulators .
the case is now in court , slowing locomore 's plans , which include purchasing an estimated 100 million euros worth of trains .
similar resistance has hit sncf 's rollout of train service in germany , prompting complaints to the european commission in brussels .
ironically , deutsche bahn hopes to expand its train service in france and has encountered similar setbacks in its efforts to gain access to the french market .
peter ramsauer , germany 's new transport minister , said in an interview november 2 that the french moves " could not go on . "
deutsche bahn employees say the entry of new companies into the rail market will hurt service and make train service " dangerous . "
alexander kirchner , who heads the rail workers union transnet said in an interview with the tagesspiegel newspaper that a price war is " unavoidable . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de players -pipe- 11.11.2009 opinion : robert enke , a soft-spoken man großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the apparent suicide of german national soccer goalkeeper robert enke is a tragedy - and it begs many questions .
more reserved players like enke are almost ignored in the footballing circus .
dw 's stefan nestler comments . the news of a suicide is shocking - always .
almost involuntarily we ask ourselves : was there really nothing that might have stopped this person taking his own life ?
did he send us any signals of his despair which we failed to notice ?
suddenly confronted by a life that ended too soon , we ask ourselves why .
robert enke was not one of those footballers who sought out every microphone in order to tell the world how important he was .
also , he was not the typical eccentric between the sticks , forever screaming at his defenders , like so many other goalkeepers .
he always seemed reserved and polite , a soft-spoken man .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan nestler in fact , his character was often cited as one of his biggest weaknesses as a keeper .
often the german press would call on enke to put more effort into asserting himself as germany 's number one goalkeeper , to make his own case more passionately and with more vigour in the media .
but that just was n't robert enke 's style .
quieter people like enke are often swamped in the melee that is the soccer circus , where only goals , points , and championships really matter .
to the winner , the spoils .
the loser is lucky to get a sympathetic grimace .
often the common opinion is that someone who earns millions every year for playing sports has nothing to grumble about .
but for robert enke , in both sports and his everyday life , things had not been running smoothly .
at some of the larger foreign clubs that hired him earlier in his career , fc barcelona for example , he spent almost all of his time warming the substitutes ' bench .
and much more recently , once he had finally seemed to establish himself clearly as germany 's number one goalkeeper , an illness stopped him in his tracks .
however the ebbs and flows of his sporting career seem almost banal when compared to what he had endured off the pitch , more specifically the death of his two-year-old daughter in 2006 .
we will never know if that was the catalyst for this tragedy , or whether the process began at another moment in time .
robert enke , the goalkeeper , has been analyzed in painstaking detail for years , however , it seems the wider world failed to even scratch the surface of robert enke , the man .
and now he 's gone .

tests being conducted on sheep have proven successful up to now . researchers at the university hospital in zurich have already succeeded in cultivating the heart valve of a sheep using the creature 's cells . heart surgeon simon hoerstrop hopes to eventually be able to implant in human patients functioning valves grown out of their own stem cells . this means that many heart patients , particularly young people , may one day not have to undergo rounds of painful transplant surgery to replace artificial valves that they have outgrown . research to help children to date , surgeons have used artificial valves made out of synthetic materials or dead animal tissues in order to avoid any chance of the body rejecting the replacement part . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers are testing the new procedure on sheep one big problem however , particularly in the case of children , is that these substitute valves do not grow within the body .

" it is an ideal model because its anatomy is very similar to that of a human , " he said . in addition , sheep organs quickly calcify if they are not working properly , he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 11.11.2009 new health minister warns there will not be enough swine flu vaccine for all großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough doctors have been able to get their hands on the vaccine just days after health officials tried to convince skeptical germans of the merits of a swine flu jab , germany 's health minister has warned that not everyone should rush to get vaccinated .
this after supply shortfalls . new health minister philipp roesler said vaccine manufacturer glaxosmithkline -lrb- gsk -rrb- had assured delegates at the emergency flu summit on wednesday , november 11 , that the company was working toward overcoming the shortages the pharmaceuticals giant had pledged to deliver 20 million doses of pandemrix by the end of the year , said roesler .
" these figures already make clear that not everyone can be vaccinated , " he conceded .
" it is now important that not everyone runs to the vaccination points . "
health minister of rhineland-palatinate , malu dreyer , said members of the emergency services would be prioritized .
the chronically will be next in line .
" you do n't have to go out and get vaccinated tomorrow , " said dreyer .
patients sent home earlier this week many germans arriving in doctors ' practices to be vaccinated had to be sent home because of the delivery shortfalls . germany 's state ministers , a representative of the vaccine manufacturer glaxosmithkline -lrb- gsk -rrb- and the heads of two public health institutes were at the summit on wednesday , november 11 , which was convened after reports of shortages in some regions .
after the meeting , thueringen 's health minister said 150,000 adjuvant-free doses of the vaccine would be available for pregnant women in december .
the presence of adjuvants , additives designed to strengthen the active ingredients , in the gsk vaccine have been a cause of concern in germany .
taubert cautioned that there was no cause for hysteria .
she said new supplies of the vaccine would also be delivered in january and february .
ahead of the summit , the state health minister of saxon-anhalt , gerlinde kuppe , called on the pharmaceutical industry to issue reliable figures so that states know how much vaccine they can count on .
" we ca n't accept the vague announcements from week to week that supplies could drop again or they could rise again , " said kuppe .

this after supply shortfalls . new health minister philipp roesler said vaccine manufacturer glaxosmithkline -lrb- gsk -rrb- had assured delegates at the emergency flu summit on wednesday , november 11 , that the company was working toward overcoming the shortages the pharmaceuticals giant had pledged to deliver 20 million doses of pandemrix by the end of the year , said roesler .
" these figures already make clear that not everyone can be vaccinated , " he conceded .
" it is now important that not everyone runs to the vaccination points . "
health minister of rhineland-palatinate , malu dreyer , said members of the emergency services would be prioritized .
the chronically will be next in line .
" you do n't have to go out and get vaccinated tomorrow , " said dreyer .

after the meeting , thueringen 's health minister said 150,000 adjuvant-free doses of the vaccine would be available for pregnant women in december .
the presence of adjuvants , additives designed to strengthen the active ingredients , in the gsk vaccine have been a cause of concern in germany .
taubert cautioned that there was no cause for hysteria .
she said new supplies of the vaccine would also be delivered in january and february .
ahead of the summit , the state health minister of saxon-anhalt , gerlinde kuppe , called on the pharmaceutical industry to issue reliable figures so that states know how much vaccine they can count on .

tests being conducted on sheep have proven successful up to now . researchers at the university hospital in zurich have already succeeded in cultivating the heart valve of a sheep using the creature 's cells . heart surgeon simon hoerstrop hopes to eventually be able to implant in human patients functioning valves grown out of their own stem cells . this means that many heart patients , particularly young people , may one day not have to undergo rounds of painful transplant surgery to replace artificial valves that they have outgrown . research to help children to date , surgeons have used artificial valves made out of synthetic materials or dead animal tissues in order to avoid any chance of the body rejecting the replacement part . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers are testing the new procedure on sheep one big problem however , particularly in the case of children , is that these substitute valves do not grow within the body .
this means young patients must endure new transplant surgery every few years . some children require as many as five of these operations before they reach adulthood . sheep are ideal guinea pigs simon hoerstrop would like to change this . sheep are particularly well suited to test the procedure , according to hoerstrup .
" it is an ideal model because its anatomy is very similar to that of a human , " he said . in addition , sheep organs quickly calcify if they are not working properly , he added .
this means that scientists can spot much more quickly if something is going wrong than they could in human patients . to create a heart valve , hoerstrup extracts cells from an artery in the sheep 's neck .

the whole process takes a mere eight weeks . the valve is then transplanted back into the sheep , whose stem cells were used to grow the bodily component .
this process allows researchers to avoid any chance of rejection . valve replacement in humans foreseeable in the laboratories of the university hospital of zurich about one hundred human valves are already being successfully grown . although heart surgeon simon hoerstrup and his team are already looking forward to the day when they will be able to transplant a living heart valve into a human patient , he cautions that it is still likely to be a few years from now . author : basil honegger / maria lesser -lrb- gmb -rrb- editor : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tests being conducted on sheep have proven successful up to now . researchers at the university hospital in zurich have already succeeded in cultivating the heart valve of a sheep using the creature 's cells . heart surgeon simon hoerstrop hopes to eventually be able to implant in human patients functioning valves grown out of their own stem cells . this means that many heart patients , particularly young people , may one day not have to undergo rounds of painful transplant surgery to replace artificial valves that they have outgrown . research to help children to date , surgeons have used artificial valves made out of synthetic materials or dead animal tissues in order to avoid any chance of the body rejecting the replacement part . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers are testing the new procedure on sheep one big problem however , particularly in the case of children , is that these substitute valves do not grow within the body .
this means young patients must endure new transplant surgery every few years . some children require as many as five of these operations before they reach adulthood . sheep are ideal guinea pigs simon hoerstrop would like to change this . sheep are particularly well suited to test the procedure , according to hoerstrup .
" it is an ideal model because its anatomy is very similar to that of a human , " he said . in addition , sheep organs quickly calcify if they are not working properly , he added .
this means that scientists can spot much more quickly if something is going wrong than they could in human patients . to create a heart valve , hoerstrup extracts cells from an artery in the sheep 's neck .
the cells are then propagated in the laboratory and are deposited on a scaffold .

the whole process takes a mere eight weeks . the valve is then transplanted back into the sheep , whose stem cells were used to grow the bodily component .
this process allows researchers to avoid any chance of rejection . valve replacement in humans foreseeable in the laboratories of the university hospital of zurich about one hundred human valves are already being successfully grown . although heart surgeon simon hoerstrup and his team are already looking forward to the day when they will be able to transplant a living heart valve into a human patient , he cautions that it is still likely to be a few years from now . author : basil honegger / maria lesser -lrb- gmb -rrb- editor : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de players -pipe- 11.11.2009 opinion : robert enke , a soft-spoken man großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the apparent suicide of german national soccer goalkeeper robert enke is a tragedy - and it begs many questions .
more reserved players like enke are almost ignored in the footballing circus .
dw 's stefan nestler comments . the news of a suicide is shocking - always .
almost involuntarily we ask ourselves : was there really nothing that might have stopped this person taking his own life ?
did he send us any signals of his despair which we failed to notice ?
suddenly confronted by a life that ended too soon , we ask ourselves why .
robert enke was not one of those footballers who sought out every microphone in order to tell the world how important he was .
also , he was not the typical eccentric between the sticks , forever screaming at his defenders , like so many other goalkeepers .
he always seemed reserved and polite , a soft-spoken man .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan nestler in fact , his character was often cited as one of his biggest weaknesses as a keeper .
often the german press would call on enke to put more effort into asserting himself as germany 's number one goalkeeper , to make his own case more passionately and with more vigour in the media .
but that just was n't robert enke 's style .
quieter people like enke are often swamped in the melee that is the soccer circus , where only goals , points , and championships really matter .
to the winner , the spoils .
the loser is lucky to get a sympathetic grimace .
often the common opinion is that someone who earns millions every year for playing sports has nothing to grumble about .
but for robert enke , in both sports and his everyday life , things had not been running smoothly .
at some of the larger foreign clubs that hired him earlier in his career , fc barcelona for example , he spent almost all of his time warming the substitutes ' bench .
and much more recently , once he had finally seemed to establish himself clearly as germany 's number one goalkeeper , an illness stopped him in his tracks .
however the ebbs and flows of his sporting career seem almost banal when compared to what he had endured off the pitch , more specifically the death of his two-year-old daughter in 2006 .
we will never know if that was the catalyst for this tragedy , or whether the process began at another moment in time .
robert enke , the goalkeeper , has been analyzed in painstaking detail for years , however , it seems the wider world failed to even scratch the surface of robert enke , the man .
and now he 's gone .

" these figures already make clear that not everyone can be vaccinated , " he conceded .
" it is now important that not everyone runs to the vaccination points . "
health minister of rhineland-palatinate , malu dreyer , said members of the emergency services would be prioritized .
the chronically will be next in line .
" you do n't have to go out and get vaccinated tomorrow , " said dreyer .
patients sent home earlier this week many germans arriving in doctors ' practices to be vaccinated had to be sent home because of the delivery shortfalls . germany 's state ministers , a representative of the vaccine manufacturer glaxosmithkline -lrb- gsk -rrb- and the heads of two public health institutes were at the summit on wednesday , november 11 , which was convened after reports of shortages in some regions .
after the meeting , thueringen 's health minister said 150,000 adjuvant-free doses of the vaccine would be available for pregnant women in december .
the presence of adjuvants , additives designed to strengthen the active ingredients , in the gsk vaccine have been a cause of concern in germany .
taubert cautioned that there was no cause for hysteria .
she said new supplies of the vaccine would also be delivered in january and february .
ahead of the summit , the state health minister of saxon-anhalt , gerlinde kuppe , called on the pharmaceutical industry to issue reliable figures so that states know how much vaccine they can count on .
" we ca n't accept the vague announcements from week to week that supplies could drop again or they could rise again , " said kuppe .

in some areas , the situation is more extreme than others .
the health ministry of germany 's most populous state north rhine-westphalia said it would next week only be receiving 120,000 of the 420,000 doses that it had ordered . roesler told german television on tuesday that he was confident that the required protection could be put in place .
" regional difficulties can arise even in the case of optimum production .
that is why i am appealing for patience , " he said .
" the sector is making an effort and the states are putting on a strong show locally . " gsk spokesman markus hardenblicker said that the guaranteed quotas had been met and that the states were being informed a week in advance of the amount of vaccine that they would be receiving .
he said figures issued in july had been non-binding .
the pharmaceutical company spokesman also said significantly higher levels of supplies of the pandemrix vaccine would be delivered at the end of november and start of december .
however , the company has admitted that there had been initial production difficulties .
germans put skepticism aside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there has been a rise in demand for the flu jab in september a study found that 62 percent of germans polled would not get vaccinated because of concerns about possible side effects . but the demand for vaccination has risen over the last few days after infection rates doubled in one week .

this after supply shortfalls . new health minister philipp roesler said vaccine manufacturer glaxosmithkline -lrb- gsk -rrb- had assured delegates at the emergency flu summit on wednesday , november 11 , that the company was working toward overcoming the shortages the pharmaceuticals giant had pledged to deliver 20 million doses of pandemrix by the end of the year , said roesler .
" these figures already make clear that not everyone can be vaccinated , " he conceded .
" it is now important that not everyone runs to the vaccination points . "
health minister of rhineland-palatinate , malu dreyer , said members of the emergency services would be prioritized .
the chronically will be next in line .
" you do n't have to go out and get vaccinated tomorrow , " said dreyer .
patients sent home earlier this week many germans arriving in doctors ' practices to be vaccinated had to be sent home because of the delivery shortfalls . germany 's state ministers , a representative of the vaccine manufacturer glaxosmithkline -lrb- gsk -rrb- and the heads of two public health institutes were at the summit on wednesday , november 11 , which was convened after reports of shortages in some regions .
after the meeting , thueringen 's health minister said 150,000 adjuvant-free doses of the vaccine would be available for pregnant women in december .
the presence of adjuvants , additives designed to strengthen the active ingredients , in the gsk vaccine have been a cause of concern in germany .
taubert cautioned that there was no cause for hysteria .
she said new supplies of the vaccine would also be delivered in january and february .
ahead of the summit , the state health minister of saxon-anhalt , gerlinde kuppe , called on the pharmaceutical industry to issue reliable figures so that states know how much vaccine they can count on .
" we ca n't accept the vague announcements from week to week that supplies could drop again or they could rise again , " said kuppe .

in some areas , the situation is more extreme than others .
the health ministry of germany 's most populous state north rhine-westphalia said it would next week only be receiving 120,000 of the 420,000 doses that it had ordered . roesler told german television on tuesday that he was confident that the required protection could be put in place .
" regional difficulties can arise even in the case of optimum production .
that is why i am appealing for patience , " he said .
" the sector is making an effort and the states are putting on a strong show locally . " gsk spokesman markus hardenblicker said that the guaranteed quotas had been met and that the states were being informed a week in advance of the amount of vaccine that they would be receiving .
he said figures issued in july had been non-binding .
the pharmaceutical company spokesman also said significantly higher levels of supplies of the pandemrix vaccine would be delivered at the end of november and start of december .
however , the company has admitted that there had been initial production difficulties .
germans put skepticism aside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there has been a rise in demand for the flu jab in september a study found that 62 percent of germans polled would not get vaccinated because of concerns about possible side effects . but the demand for vaccination has risen over the last few days after infection rates doubled in one week .
the robert koch institute has now registered more than 40,000 cases and recorded 12 deaths up to november 9 .
the deaths of a 33-year-old woman in aachen and a 33-year-old man in munich from the h1n1 virus were reported in the media on tuesday .

this means that scientists can spot much more quickly if something is going wrong than they could in human patients . to create a heart valve , hoerstrup extracts cells from an artery in the sheep 's neck .

although merkel is not the first german chancellor to attend armistice day events in france , her presence at the annual parade marking germany 's surrender , is unprecedented .
standing in paris 91 years after the end of world war i , angela merkel described the relationship between france and germany as " something special , something unique , " and urged " even closer " co-operation between the two countries .
an example to the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy in paris as their national flags fluttered in the wind , the two leaders vowed that their countries would never again go to war against each other .
merkel said that although the past could not be erased , the power of reconciliation helped to bear the burden of what has gone before .
" we show other countries in the world that it is possible to rise above the pain of the past , " merkel said .
the french president told the crowds that it was not an occasion to celebrate , but to remember .
" we are not commemorating the victory of one people over another but an ordeal that was equally terrible for each side , " sarkozy said .
he said germany and france had a duty to uphold .
" we owe it to the people of europe , to the people of the world , to act together . "
an official date in the calendar ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants to make november 11 a day for germany and france sarkozy has proposed making november 11 - which is already a national holiday in france - an official day of franco-german reconciliation .
in a statement , he said he thought the time had come " to join with angela merkel in paris to jointly commemorate the suffering and to honor the momory of the combatants and celebrate the peace of which they dreamed at the bottom of their trenches . "
but the idea of a joint day of reconciliation has received a mixed response from politicians in both countries .
french defense minister herve morin told the canal + television network that he did not welcome the suggestion . however , werner hoyer , minister of state at the german foreign ministry , described it as an exceptional gesture .
helmut kohl was invited by former french president jacques chirac to attend the 80th anniversary commemoration of the 1918 ceasefire in paris . although he accepted , by the time the day came he was no longer in office .

tests being conducted on sheep have proven successful up to now . researchers at the university hospital in zurich have already succeeded in cultivating the heart valve of a sheep using the creature 's cells . heart surgeon simon hoerstrop hopes to eventually be able to implant in human patients functioning valves grown out of their own stem cells . this means that many heart patients , particularly young people , may one day not have to undergo rounds of painful transplant surgery to replace artificial valves that they have outgrown . research to help children to date , surgeons have used artificial valves made out of synthetic materials or dead animal tissues in order to avoid any chance of the body rejecting the replacement part . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers are testing the new procedure on sheep one big problem however , particularly in the case of children , is that these substitute valves do not grow within the body .
this means young patients must endure new transplant surgery every few years . some children require as many as five of these operations before they reach adulthood . sheep are ideal guinea pigs simon hoerstrop would like to change this . sheep are particularly well suited to test the procedure , according to hoerstrup .
" it is an ideal model because its anatomy is very similar to that of a human , " he said . in addition , sheep organs quickly calcify if they are not working properly , he added .
this means that scientists can spot much more quickly if something is going wrong than they could in human patients . to create a heart valve , hoerstrup extracts cells from an artery in the sheep 's neck .
the cells are then propagated in the laboratory and are deposited on a scaffold .
this template corresponds almost exactly to the shape of a heart valve . this is then put in a bioreactor where the cells continue to grow and attach themselves to the scaffold , which graduallly dissolves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children with heart valve problems will benefit from the new procedure meanwhile , the nutrient solution is kept constantly in movement while the valve is growing .
it simulates the motion of the heart and is intended to train the new component for its future duty in the body .
the whole process takes a mere eight weeks . the valve is then transplanted back into the sheep , whose stem cells were used to grow the bodily component .
this process allows researchers to avoid any chance of rejection . valve replacement in humans foreseeable in the laboratories of the university hospital of zurich about one hundred human valves are already being successfully grown . although heart surgeon simon hoerstrup and his team are already looking forward to the day when they will be able to transplant a living heart valve into a human patient , he cautions that it is still likely to be a few years from now . author : basil honegger / maria lesser -lrb- gmb -rrb- editor : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 11.11.2009 eu top jobs in limbo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels is looking for new leaders the european union plans to hold a special summit next week to fill the new posts of eu president and eu foreign policy chief , but so far there is little agreement on who will get the top jobs . sweden , which currently holds the european union 's rotating six-month presidency , said on wednesday that the bloc 's 27 heads of state and government will meet in brussels on november 19 to fill the key new positions created by the ratification of the lisbon reform treaty last month .
however , finding appropriate and acceptable candidates is proving more difficult than expected .
the british government still backs former prime minister tony blair , despite his unpopularity in some quarters over his support for the iraq war .
british foreign secretary david miliband on wednesday categorically denied that he is a candidate to become the eu high representative , the bloc 's spokesman on foreign affairs and defense , after his name began circulating last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british foreign secretary opts for a career at home miliband , speaking at a press conference in london during a visit by the new german foreign minister , guido westerwelle , said he " came to british politics to serve the british people in britain . "
his comments immediately fueled speculation that he was striving for leadership of the labour party and possible future premiership .
british business secretary peter mandelson , a former eu trade commissioner , said he had been approached about the foreign policy job after miliband turned it down , but also said he was " committed to remaining in the british government . "
power struggles marring the selection process the current favorite to become president of the european council is belgium 's center-right prime minister herman van rompuy , who is said to have french and german backing .
but there are some doubts about rompuy in other eu member states , where it is feared he could find himself overshadowed and overwhelmed by berlin and paris .
others would prefer a more forceful foreign policy chief , who would stand up to france and germany , as well as russia , china and the united states .
other names mentioned for the post of president include dutch prime minister peter balkenende , former latvian president vaira vike-freiberga and luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner said on wednesday however that mr. blair was not yet out of the running .
for the foreign affairs job , former italian prime minister massimo d 'alema is considered a strong contender , now that miliband has clearly stated his intention not to take the post .
besides the fact that different member states have been proposing different names , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , representing the eu presidency , said he was finding it especially difficult to strike a balance between the political left and right , and the conflicting visions of the smaller and larger eu countries on what role the politicians would play in brussels .
german foreign minister outlines policy issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foreign minister has been doing the rounds of germany 's allies .
the conflicting visions are a concern that german foreign minister westerwelle touched on during visits to london and earlier to copenhagen .
westerwelle told his danish and british counterparts that he wanted smaller and larger countries to deal with one another at " eye level " .
he also said germany would do everything it could to ensure the success of the international climate summit in copenhagen in december .
westerwelle said , however , that berlin would not be rushed into a decision on boosting its bundeswehr forces in afghanistan .
" before we talk about numbers , we need to agree on a joint strategy , " he said .
the foreign minister spoke at the press conference with miliband in both english and german , after being criticized for not answering a question in english at a meeting with journalists in berlin in september. gb / dpa / afp / ap / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , finding appropriate and acceptable candidates is proving more difficult than expected .
the british government still backs former prime minister tony blair , despite his unpopularity in some quarters over his support for the iraq war .
british foreign secretary david miliband on wednesday categorically denied that he is a candidate to become the eu high representative , the bloc 's spokesman on foreign affairs and defense , after his name began circulating last week .

"
his comments immediately fueled speculation that he was striving for leadership of the labour party and possible future premiership .
british business secretary peter mandelson , a former eu trade commissioner , said he had been approached about the foreign policy job after miliband turned it down , but also said he was " committed to remaining in the british government . "
power struggles marring the selection process the current favorite to become president of the european council is belgium 's center-right prime minister herman van rompuy , who is said to have french and german backing .
but there are some doubts about rompuy in other eu member states , where it is feared he could find himself overshadowed and overwhelmed by berlin and paris .
others would prefer a more forceful foreign policy chief , who would stand up to france and germany , as well as russia , china and the united states .
other names mentioned for the post of president include dutch prime minister peter balkenende , former latvian president vaira vike-freiberga and luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner said on wednesday however that mr. blair was not yet out of the running .
for the foreign affairs job , former italian prime minister massimo d 'alema is considered a strong contender , now that miliband has clearly stated his intention not to take the post .
besides the fact that different member states have been proposing different names , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , representing the eu presidency , said he was finding it especially difficult to strike a balance between the political left and right , and the conflicting visions of the smaller and larger eu countries on what role the politicians would play in brussels .

westerwelle told his danish and british counterparts that he wanted smaller and larger countries to deal with one another at " eye level " .
he also said germany would do everything it could to ensure the success of the international climate summit in copenhagen in december .
westerwelle said , however , that berlin would not be rushed into a decision on boosting its bundeswehr forces in afghanistan .

french foreign minister bernard kouchner said on wednesday however that mr. blair was not yet out of the running .
for the foreign affairs job , former italian prime minister massimo d 'alema is considered a strong contender , now that miliband has clearly stated his intention not to take the post .
besides the fact that different member states have been proposing different names , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , representing the eu presidency , said he was finding it especially difficult to strike a balance between the political left and right , and the conflicting visions of the smaller and larger eu countries on what role the politicians would play in brussels .
german foreign minister outlines policy issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foreign minister has been doing the rounds of germany 's allies .
the conflicting visions are a concern that german foreign minister westerwelle touched on during visits to london and earlier to copenhagen .
westerwelle told his danish and british counterparts that he wanted smaller and larger countries to deal with one another at " eye level " .
he also said germany would do everything it could to ensure the success of the international climate summit in copenhagen in december .
westerwelle said , however , that berlin would not be rushed into a decision on boosting its bundeswehr forces in afghanistan .
" before we talk about numbers , we need to agree on a joint strategy , " he said .
the foreign minister spoke at the press conference with miliband in both english and german , after being criticized for not answering a question in english at a meeting with journalists in berlin in september. gb / dpa / afp / ap / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they hope to start service next year , but the bahn is trying to put the brakes on its rivals . the latest entrant to the german rail market is the berlin-based locomore , which will start scheduled service between cologne and hamburg next august using rolling stock that it is set to purchase from austria 's national railway .
the company , founded in 2007 by derek ladewig , has the backing of an american investment firm , the railroad development corporation -lrb- rdc -rrb- , reports wirtschaftswoche in its latest issue .
rdc chairman henry posner told the magazine that his company expects the locomore venture to take time before becoming profitable .
" we 're impatient managers , but patient investors , " posner told wirtschaftswoche .
the magazine reports ladewig plans to start a new firm that would run new rail routes between berlin and frankfurt and stuttgart and hamburg and has already applied for permits to operate the new routes starting 2011 .
unlike the cologne-hamburg route , which will feature different levels of service , ladewig said he hoped to apply budget airline ryanair 's one-class , no-frills business model to the new routes .
not the first competitor , and probably not the last bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : db and france 's sncf currently cooperate but sncf now wants to move into germany locomore is one of several firms eager to chip away at deutsche bahn 's dominance .
at the end of october , the french national railway sncf applied to enter the german market and plans to start running two rail lines from the westernmost french city of strasbourg to hamburg in 2011 under its keolis subsidiary .
one line will travel via cologne and hanover and the other will journey via leipzig and berlin instead .
sncf and deutsche bahn have been cooperating since 2007 on a series of high-speed routes between frankfurt , munich and stuttgart and paris .
the growing number of firms looking to challenge deutsche bahn 's long-time dominance comes as europe 's passenger railway markets are set to become deregulated in 2010 due to new european union rules .
some competition in regional markets already exists , with firms such as the french veolia transport providing short-run rail service across germany , as well as a longer route between rostock and leipzig .
access a struggle the challenge for all new entrants on the german market is how to work with deutsche bahn , which will continue to own and operate the infrastructure that locomore and sncf 's trains will run on through its db netz subsidiary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sncf plans to offer regular train service within germany by 2011 deutsche bahn is supposed to allow competitors access to its track network but has denied locomore 's request - against the wishes of german regulators .
the case is now in court , slowing locomore 's plans , which include purchasing an estimated 100 million euros worth of trains .
similar resistance has hit sncf 's rollout of train service in germany , prompting complaints to the european commission in brussels .
ironically , deutsche bahn hopes to expand its train service in france and has encountered similar setbacks in its efforts to gain access to the french market .
peter ramsauer , germany 's new transport minister , said in an interview november 2 that the french moves " could not go on . "
deutsche bahn employees say the entry of new companies into the rail market will hurt service and make train service " dangerous . "
alexander kirchner , who heads the rail workers union transnet said in an interview with the tagesspiegel newspaper that a price war is " unavoidable . "

they hope to start service next year , but the bahn is trying to put the brakes on its rivals . the latest entrant to the german rail market is the berlin-based locomore , which will start scheduled service between cologne and hamburg next august using rolling stock that it is set to purchase from austria 's national railway .
the company , founded in 2007 by derek ladewig , has the backing of an american investment firm , the railroad development corporation -lrb- rdc -rrb- , reports wirtschaftswoche in its latest issue .
rdc chairman henry posner told the magazine that his company expects the locomore venture to take time before becoming profitable .
" we 're impatient managers , but patient investors , " posner told wirtschaftswoche .
the magazine reports ladewig plans to start a new firm that would run new rail routes between berlin and frankfurt and stuttgart and hamburg and has already applied for permits to operate the new routes starting 2011 .
unlike the cologne-hamburg route , which will feature different levels of service , ladewig said he hoped to apply budget airline ryanair 's one-class , no-frills business model to the new routes .
not the first competitor , and probably not the last bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : db and france 's sncf currently cooperate but sncf now wants to move into germany locomore is one of several firms eager to chip away at deutsche bahn 's dominance .
at the end of october , the french national railway sncf applied to enter the german market and plans to start running two rail lines from the westernmost french city of strasbourg to hamburg in 2011 under its keolis subsidiary .
one line will travel via cologne and hanover and the other will journey via leipzig and berlin instead .
sncf and deutsche bahn have been cooperating since 2007 on a series of high-speed routes between frankfurt , munich and stuttgart and paris .
the growing number of firms looking to challenge deutsche bahn 's long-time dominance comes as europe 's passenger railway markets are set to become deregulated in 2010 due to new european union rules .
some competition in regional markets already exists , with firms such as the french veolia transport providing short-run rail service across germany , as well as a longer route between rostock and leipzig .
access a struggle the challenge for all new entrants on the german market is how to work with deutsche bahn , which will continue to own and operate the infrastructure that locomore and sncf 's trains will run on through its db netz subsidiary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sncf plans to offer regular train service within germany by 2011 deutsche bahn is supposed to allow competitors access to its track network but has denied locomore 's request - against the wishes of german regulators .
the case is now in court , slowing locomore 's plans , which include purchasing an estimated 100 million euros worth of trains .
similar resistance has hit sncf 's rollout of train service in germany , prompting complaints to the european commission in brussels .
ironically , deutsche bahn hopes to expand its train service in france and has encountered similar setbacks in its efforts to gain access to the french market .
peter ramsauer , germany 's new transport minister , said in an interview november 2 that the french moves " could not go on . "
deutsche bahn employees say the entry of new companies into the rail market will hurt service and make train service " dangerous . "
alexander kirchner , who heads the rail workers union transnet said in an interview with the tagesspiegel newspaper that a price war is " unavoidable . "

dw-world.de france 's sncf takes on deutsche bahn on home turf german national rail deutsche bahn is getting ready for a " bloody battle " with its french counterpart , sncf .
this after reports that the paris-based company was intending to compete with db on several inter-city routes .

the national player suffered from depression . in a press conference on wednesday , enke 's doctor valentin markser said the soccer star had first come to him in 2003 when he was suffering from a fear of failure on the pitch .
the doctor said he had been treating the goalkeeper for depression since then and confirmed that enke had thought about suicide in the past . the soccer star 's widow , teresa enke , who also attended the press conference , said her husband experienced phases of depression . " i wanted to help him get through it , " she said .
" i tried to be there for him . " but enke always rejected any suggestion that his depression be treated in a hospital .
his widow said he was afraid that in doing so , he would run the risk of losing the couple 's adopted daughter . in his suicide note , enke is said to have apologized to his family and doctors for his decision to take his life and for not having been honest about the severity of his condition . a world cup favorite germany 's national team have called off their saturday match against chile .
" we need to be able to take a moment , " said theo zwanziger , head of the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- at an afternoon press conference .
" there 's no other option , " he said , adding that the decision was made by the dfb management in conjunction with the players . " we thought about playing the game as a farewell to robert , but it is clear it is too soon after this terrible news , " said team manager oliver bierhoff , who was visibly upset during the press conference . zwanziger said the players were already leaving the training complex and would not reconvene until sunday when they would train for next wednesday 's match against the ivory coast . although enke was considered one of the front-runners for the keeper position on the 2010 world cup squad , he was forced to miss the last four games for germany and several matches for hanover due to an intestinal infection and he had not been selected for germany 's friendly matches against chile and the ivory coast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim loew still favored enke for the world cup after sitting out for two months , enke returned to the pitch for hanover on october 31 against cologne .

nevertheless , loew had indicated that enke was still his favorite to be germany 's goalkeeper at the world cup finals in south africa next year . the infection , which caused enke to miss key world cup qualifying matches , was not the first personal hardship the goalkeeper faced in his lifetime .
in 2006 he and his wife suffered a personal tragedy with the death of their then two-year-old daughter due to a rare heart condition . german soccer mourns the response from the german soccer community has been both shock and sadness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candles for the goalkeeper " it is a tragedy , " martin kind , president of enke 's bundesliga club hanover 96 , said .
" you expect many things , but not something like that . ” dfb 's zwanziger said he was " stunned and full of sadness . " " we send our deepest sympathies to his wife and family .
robert enke was a wonderful person who had been dealt some tough cards , " he said . fc barcelona , one of enke 's former clubs , held a minute of silence for the german keeper ahead of their spanish cup match against cultural leonesa on tuesday night . in hanover , hundreds of the team 's fans gathered outside the club 's stadium to light candles and leave flowers . " he leaves behind a large hole in our lives , not only in hanover , but for soccer in germany , " said the team 's sports director joerg schmadtke . on wednesday evening , team colleagues and fans gathered for a service of remembrance in hanover .

the national player suffered from depression . in a press conference on wednesday , enke 's doctor valentin markser said the soccer star had first come to him in 2003 when he was suffering from a fear of failure on the pitch .
the doctor said he had been treating the goalkeeper for depression since then and confirmed that enke had thought about suicide in the past . the soccer star 's widow , teresa enke , who also attended the press conference , said her husband experienced phases of depression . " i wanted to help him get through it , " she said .
" i tried to be there for him . " but enke always rejected any suggestion that his depression be treated in a hospital .
his widow said he was afraid that in doing so , he would run the risk of losing the couple 's adopted daughter . in his suicide note , enke is said to have apologized to his family and doctors for his decision to take his life and for not having been honest about the severity of his condition . a world cup favorite germany 's national team have called off their saturday match against chile .
" we need to be able to take a moment , " said theo zwanziger , head of the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- at an afternoon press conference .
" there 's no other option , " he said , adding that the decision was made by the dfb management in conjunction with the players . " we thought about playing the game as a farewell to robert , but it is clear it is too soon after this terrible news , " said team manager oliver bierhoff , who was visibly upset during the press conference . zwanziger said the players were already leaving the training complex and would not reconvene until sunday when they would train for next wednesday 's match against the ivory coast . although enke was considered one of the front-runners for the keeper position on the 2010 world cup squad , he was forced to miss the last four games for germany and several matches for hanover due to an intestinal infection and he had not been selected for germany 's friendly matches against chile and the ivory coast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim loew still favored enke for the world cup after sitting out for two months , enke returned to the pitch for hanover on october 31 against cologne .
his last match in the bundesliga came just two days before his death , a 2-2 draw against hamburg . german national coach joachim loew had said it was too early for enke to return to the squad after his illness .
nevertheless , loew had indicated that enke was still his favorite to be germany 's goalkeeper at the world cup finals in south africa next year . the infection , which caused enke to miss key world cup qualifying matches , was not the first personal hardship the goalkeeper faced in his lifetime .
in 2006 he and his wife suffered a personal tragedy with the death of their then two-year-old daughter due to a rare heart condition . german soccer mourns the response from the german soccer community has been both shock and sadness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candles for the goalkeeper " it is a tragedy , " martin kind , president of enke 's bundesliga club hanover 96 , said .

and it ’ s not just about necessity , it 's about ideology . dumpster divers are people who search for things that other people have thrown out that are still useful , can be eaten or recycled , and have value .
dumpster divers will not only pick up discarded items left outside people 's homes , but they will climb into dumpsters or bins at apartment buildings and behind shopping centers .
mostly , the so-called divers go about their scavenging under cover of darkness .
some , though , operate openly .
those who dumpster dive out of conviction consider it immoral in these times of economic crisis and widespread hunger that so much that still has value is thrown away .
according to the worldwatch institute in washington , between 30 and 40 percent of edible goods are discarded by supermarkets .
there are as yet , no official statistics for germany .

things to look out for : food where the sell-by date has only just expired , or food that is edible but where the packaging has been damaged .
twenty-eight year-old rasol is from syria , a country , he says , where people hardly throw anything away .
in this case rasol , who is unemployed , has joined the dumpster diving tradition out of financial necessity and says it 's a terrible waste , how much good stuff is being thrown away .
" poor people could live from what is discarded .
saving in these hard times ca n't hurt .
why should i walk past fresh bread or a box of good eggs ? "
hasan asks .
hasan has a family to provide for ; for others , like bergstedt , skipping or freeganism is a political statement .
" in some ways , containering has become pretty cool " " young people put on their che guevara hoodies and go containering for a couple of years , " bergstedt said .
bergstedt is one of the german spokespeople for containering .
he has been doing it for fifteen years .
and has managed to get by without spending a cent on basic living .
aside from his political convictions , bergstedt has an economic agenda .
consumerism is fuelled by supply and demand , he says .
if people such as himself do n't buy certain products , there will be no reason for the big supermarkets to keep ordering them .
in this way , bergstedt says , he can remain true to his convictions .
this , he says , is something that would n't be possible if he had to worry about getting to work every day .
the dumpster-diving movement started in the mid 1990s in the us .
the freegans used it as an expression against waste .
with the movement 's growing popularity , corporations have felt obliged to find a legal framework regulating how to deal with it .
in the us , for example , the foodstore chain 7-eleven has left it up to individual stores to decide whether they allow skipping .
in germany it is mostly considered illegal .
" if people trespass , " says lawyer michael biela-baetje , " then they are acting illegally according to paragraph 123 of the german basic law .
if the bin or skip is in a public space , then i assume that there is nothing illegal about it . "
opening a sealed bin to remove food is also illegal in germany and , if caught , the dumpster diver could be charged with theft , says biela-baetje .
this option is often used by supermarkets , which in many cases seal their bins or keep them in enclosed areas .
the larger german supermarkets , it seems , do not share the view that one man 's rubbish is another man 's treasure .
neither rewe nor the tengelmann group were prepared to comment .

" in some ways , containering has become pretty cool " " young people put on their che guevara hoodies and go containering for a couple of years , " bergstedt said .
bergstedt is one of the german spokespeople for containering .
he has been doing it for fifteen years .
and has managed to get by without spending a cent on basic living .
aside from his political convictions , bergstedt has an economic agenda .
consumerism is fuelled by supply and demand , he says .
if people such as himself do n't buy certain products , there will be no reason for the big supermarkets to keep ordering them .
in this way , bergstedt says , he can remain true to his convictions .
this , he says , is something that would n't be possible if he had to worry about getting to work every day .
the dumpster-diving movement started in the mid 1990s in the us .
the freegans used it as an expression against waste .
with the movement 's growing popularity , corporations have felt obliged to find a legal framework regulating how to deal with it .
in the us , for example , the foodstore chain 7-eleven has left it up to individual stores to decide whether they allow skipping .
in germany it is mostly considered illegal .
" if people trespass , " says lawyer michael biela-baetje , " then they are acting illegally according to paragraph 123 of the german basic law .
if the bin or skip is in a public space , then i assume that there is nothing illegal about it . "
opening a sealed bin to remove food is also illegal in germany and , if caught , the dumpster diver could be charged with theft , says biela-baetje .
this option is often used by supermarkets , which in many cases seal their bins or keep them in enclosed areas .
the larger german supermarkets , it seems , do not share the view that one man 's rubbish is another man 's treasure .
neither rewe nor the tengelmann group were prepared to comment .

growth expectations for the coming six months have improved for all countries that have adopted the euro , according to a statement released on the institute 's web site by ifo president hans-werner sinn .
ifo 's conclusion is based upon a poll of 265 economic experts , who warned that though growth is returning , current business conditions are still " quite unfavorable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sinn said growth was returning in most of europe " the economic expectations are especially optimistic in italy , germany and the netherlands , " wrote sinn , one of germany 's best-known economists , who added that some caution was still needed for spain and greece .
the economists expected ireland to be the only eurozone country where the economy worsened further in the next six months .
dollar and pound to stay weak those surveyed believed inflation was likely to rise from the 0.7 percent average expected for 2009 , with key interest rates rising to dampen inflationary pressures .
both the us dollar and british pound are expected to remain weak over the next six months , even though the economists believed the currencies to be " clearly undervalued . "
the dollar hit a 15-month low wednesday , trading at $ 1.5029 to the euro while gold set a new record high above $ 1,115 an ounce .
european markets rally the ifo report 's conclusions were backed by strong earnings data from across germany and europe on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unicredit profits fell less than expected italy 's unicredit , the biggest lender in central and eastern europe , posted a fall in third-quarter net profit , but beat analysts ' forecast with the help of a surge in trading income .
the dutch financial services giant ing , meanwhile , posted a third-quarter that was in line with pre-announced results .
" there are signs of gradual economic revival coupled with low levels of inflation .
it is just a favourable environment for risky assets and risk taking , " said jeremy batstone-carr , head of research at charles stanley .
european stocks markets rallied wednesday , with london 's ftse index hitting a 2009 high of 5,300.98 points , a 1.22 percent rise from tuesday , after the bank of england said the strength of britain 's economic recovery was " highly uncertain . "
traders interpreted the bank 's message to mean that interest rates will likely stay very low for some time .

where was i when the wall came down ?
i never thought in my lifetime i would see this horrible piece of shame come down .
having visited my grandparents in east germany as a teenager and seen for myself what communism is all about , i can not describe the emotions i had on november 9 .
i celebrated the day with two american friends at mcdonalds with a coke .
i will never forget this day as long as i live . - birgit harms , us we were living in new delhi at the time of the fall of the berlin wall .
i had made friends with a staff member of the east german embassy who was caught completely unaware by the sudden end of the existence of the gdr .
we received the usual invitation for the new year 's eve party from the west german embassy but the new friends from the ex-gdr embassy had also invited us .
we followed our hearts and chose to go to the east german embassy to celebrate new year 1990 on the roof of their now redundant diplomatic mission in asia .
the atmosphere was first somewhat low-spirited .
some of the eastern friends had lost their dreams and uncertainty was a dominant feeling .
we listened and drank champagne .
there was happiness and hope mixed with sadness and some fear .
we answered very simple questions , like " can i apply for a job with more than one company ? "
we had to explain the details of ' western freedom . '
what was for us entirely normal and common practice was very new and unusual for them .
we encouraged them to embrace the change but we did not praise the west over the east .
the wounds in their souls were still wide open and healing was yet to begin .
they were good people who lived for what they believed in and we respected that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' i never thought i would see this horrible piece of shame come down . "
the west german embassy had made it very clear they wanted none of them .
there were perhaps good reasons for this but for those affected it was yet another blow on a body that was already in great pain .
i am sure that all of them did well after the reunification and we feel privileged to have been able to make the sudden and unexpected change a bit easier for them . - dieter & nilima pelz , australia i was assigned to the berlin brigade , office of the commanding general , us army .
i remember the night before , when coming home from the grocery store , you could not get on a subway because they were completely full .
i came back up to the street and found out what was going on .
my german friend bruce schlottow and i made our way from sophie-charlotte platz over to brandenburg gate and watched history unfold in front of us for the next few days .
i can remember smelling the exhaust of the trabbies in the street , seeing how excited everyone was , and how i felt being a part of history .
i have never forgotten that time and i have always considered berlin my home after returning back to dallas , texas . - a. alex arce , us i was an undergraduate student in my advanced german conversation and composition class at a small midwestern liberal arts university .
i was majoring in german , planning to spend a semester abroad in the next year , and my instructor was able to provide us with up to the minute information as she had recently been teaching in east berlin .
for me , this event was monumental and , even from such a distance , the feeling was heady and i was engrossed in watching every moment .
i visited berlin and former east germany for the first time in september 1990 , shortly before reunification .
i was struck by the fact that i had spent most of my day wandering around former east berlin , and only when i crossed at the brandenburger tor , did i realize that east and west were not as obvious as i had thought .
sure , there were landmarks such as the fernsehturm at alexanderplatz and the pieces of wall still standing , but there was also a lot that looked similar and perhaps had already been assimilated by this time . - kathy evenson-mcdermott , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge dominos fell on november 9 2009 , to symbolise the fall of the berlin wall i was born in prague .
my father was slovak , my mother was hungarian .
our family emigrated to new zealand after world war ii .
when the berlin wall came down i was sitting in my bedroom watching tv news .
i was overcome with both joy and sadness and i found myself sobbing .
the sadness came because my father had not lived to witness this event , but i was joyful that it had happened .
i could not think who could understand my feelings and emotion as i was alone , but i thought of a lithuanian friend so i phoned him with the good news .
i was glad i found someone who i could share my feelings with ; a person who understood . - katarina broughton , new zealand i had just returned from visiting my family in germany .
my husband turned on the news and we saw the wall coming down in pieces .
i wished i would have planned my trip to have been there at that time and place . - sabine , us we had come to visit friends in hamburg and drove with them to west berlin , still through east germany at that time .
the excitement was like electricity .
we took a taxi to checkpoint charlie , a place i crossed into east berlin a few times , with sadness and a bitter taste .
it was buzzing this day like a bee hive .
people from all over the world gathered along the wall , hammering and chiseling .
a young frenchman stood next to me and with a big grin , handed me a big piece of its painted section .
i still have it .
people were wandering from east to west and vice versa , some crying , some laughing and hugging each other , complete strangers , yet united in what was at one time an impossible event in our lifetime .
i thought of my father , who went through two world wars together with so many others in his age group .
he would have shed tears too , as i did now .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' checkpoint charlie ... was buzzing this day like a bee hive . "
i returned to the taxi , where we gathered with glasses of champagne .
the first east berliners in their trabants were coming across .
windows rolled down and waving , laughing as we , who stood there , waved back .
i met a couple that had never been to the west .
we embraced each other .
the men were shaking hands and the women were crying .
this terrible division ended and a rebirth began .
the rebirth of a united europe and the end of the ' cold war . ' - isabella miram , us i wept when at long last my " liebes land " was free !
i am not german but since 1942 i have had a love affair with germany .
i do n't know why !
i was only 4 years old !
other than china , on that november 9 the world 's biggest prison - for both east and west - was closed .
november 9 was the greatest day in world history !
alles gute , deutschland - robert mccormick , australia how sad that in her recent speech celebrating the fall of the berlin wall , -lrb- as far as i know -rrb- angela merkel made no mention of the two individuals who , more than anyone else , brought a close to the cold war and the fall of the wall : lady margaret thatcher and president ronald reagan .
reagan and thatcher squarely faced the " evil empire " and refused to be intimidated .
under huge financial pressure , gorbachev was forced to remove all soviet troops from eastern europe .
i was in hungary shortly after the russian army pulled out , and it was obvious to all concerned that it was only a matter of time before the whole communist system fell apart .
the reason the wall came down is that the only thing keeping it up was removed : the red army .
gorbachev did n't tear down the wall , he abandoned it and the freedom-hungry people of germany tore it down . - john roughton , us having visited both west and east germany in 1985 , it was a melancholy experience to visit a divided country , its capital cut in half and its people torn apart by politics .
only four years later , i watched with joy the nation re-unify and put aside its painful past for a new start , at the very heart of an increasingly united europe .
20 years on , from far away australia , i send you my warmest congratulations on this special day and i wish and hope that germany continues to go from strength to strength . - terry papadis , australia i was 9 years old when the wall came down , so the only things i could clearly remember were the happy people from a fellow european nation celebrating their unity and hope for the future .
nevertheless , that was a powerful message for a young person as myself and i 've never forgotten it .
the fall of the wall and subsequent reunification also meant the end of the cold war and the dream of a peaceful european union , as the one we have today .
for me , germany 's unity symbolizes europe 's unity and the fall of the wall is the most convincing proof that you ca n't divide people with ideological barriers for long . - constantine michailidis , greece compiled by stuart tiffen editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

we followed our hearts and chose to go to the east german embassy to celebrate new year 1990 on the roof of their now redundant diplomatic mission in asia .
the atmosphere was first somewhat low-spirited .
some of the eastern friends had lost their dreams and uncertainty was a dominant feeling .
we listened and drank champagne .
there was happiness and hope mixed with sadness and some fear .
we answered very simple questions , like " can i apply for a job with more than one company ? "
we had to explain the details of ' western freedom . '
what was for us entirely normal and common practice was very new and unusual for them .
we encouraged them to embrace the change but we did not praise the west over the east .
the wounds in their souls were still wide open and healing was yet to begin .
they were good people who lived for what they believed in and we respected that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' i never thought i would see this horrible piece of shame come down . "
the west german embassy had made it very clear they wanted none of them .
there were perhaps good reasons for this but for those affected it was yet another blow on a body that was already in great pain .
i am sure that all of them did well after the reunification and we feel privileged to have been able to make the sudden and unexpected change a bit easier for them . - dieter & nilima pelz , australia i was assigned to the berlin brigade , office of the commanding general , us army .
i remember the night before , when coming home from the grocery store , you could not get on a subway because they were completely full .
i came back up to the street and found out what was going on .
my german friend bruce schlottow and i made our way from sophie-charlotte platz over to brandenburg gate and watched history unfold in front of us for the next few days .
i can remember smelling the exhaust of the trabbies in the street , seeing how excited everyone was , and how i felt being a part of history .
i have never forgotten that time and i have always considered berlin my home after returning back to dallas , texas . - a. alex arce , us i was an undergraduate student in my advanced german conversation and composition class at a small midwestern liberal arts university .
i was majoring in german , planning to spend a semester abroad in the next year , and my instructor was able to provide us with up to the minute information as she had recently been teaching in east berlin .
for me , this event was monumental and , even from such a distance , the feeling was heady and i was engrossed in watching every moment .
i visited berlin and former east germany for the first time in september 1990 , shortly before reunification .
i was struck by the fact that i had spent most of my day wandering around former east berlin , and only when i crossed at the brandenburger tor , did i realize that east and west were not as obvious as i had thought .
sure , there were landmarks such as the fernsehturm at alexanderplatz and the pieces of wall still standing , but there was also a lot that looked similar and perhaps had already been assimilated by this time . - kathy evenson-mcdermott , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge dominos fell on november 9 2009 , to symbolise the fall of the berlin wall i was born in prague .
my father was slovak , my mother was hungarian .
our family emigrated to new zealand after world war ii .
when the berlin wall came down i was sitting in my bedroom watching tv news .
i was overcome with both joy and sadness and i found myself sobbing .
the sadness came because my father had not lived to witness this event , but i was joyful that it had happened .
i could not think who could understand my feelings and emotion as i was alone , but i thought of a lithuanian friend so i phoned him with the good news .
i was glad i found someone who i could share my feelings with ; a person who understood . - katarina broughton , new zealand i had just returned from visiting my family in germany .
my husband turned on the news and we saw the wall coming down in pieces .
i wished i would have planned my trip to have been there at that time and place . - sabine , us we had come to visit friends in hamburg and drove with them to west berlin , still through east germany at that time .
the excitement was like electricity .
we took a taxi to checkpoint charlie , a place i crossed into east berlin a few times , with sadness and a bitter taste .
it was buzzing this day like a bee hive .
people from all over the world gathered along the wall , hammering and chiseling .
a young frenchman stood next to me and with a big grin , handed me a big piece of its painted section .
i still have it .
people were wandering from east to west and vice versa , some crying , some laughing and hugging each other , complete strangers , yet united in what was at one time an impossible event in our lifetime .
i thought of my father , who went through two world wars together with so many others in his age group .
he would have shed tears too , as i did now .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' checkpoint charlie ... was buzzing this day like a bee hive . "
i returned to the taxi , where we gathered with glasses of champagne .
the first east berliners in their trabants were coming across .
windows rolled down and waving , laughing as we , who stood there , waved back .
i met a couple that had never been to the west .
we embraced each other .
the men were shaking hands and the women were crying .
this terrible division ended and a rebirth began .

reagan and thatcher squarely faced the " evil empire " and refused to be intimidated .
under huge financial pressure , gorbachev was forced to remove all soviet troops from eastern europe .
i was in hungary shortly after the russian army pulled out , and it was obvious to all concerned that it was only a matter of time before the whole communist system fell apart .
the reason the wall came down is that the only thing keeping it up was removed : the red army .
gorbachev did n't tear down the wall , he abandoned it and the freedom-hungry people of germany tore it down . - john roughton , us having visited both west and east germany in 1985 , it was a melancholy experience to visit a divided country , its capital cut in half and its people torn apart by politics .
only four years later , i watched with joy the nation re-unify and put aside its painful past for a new start , at the very heart of an increasingly united europe .
20 years on , from far away australia , i send you my warmest congratulations on this special day and i wish and hope that germany continues to go from strength to strength . - terry papadis , australia i was 9 years old when the wall came down , so the only things i could clearly remember were the happy people from a fellow european nation celebrating their unity and hope for the future .
nevertheless , that was a powerful message for a young person as myself and i 've never forgotten it .
the fall of the wall and subsequent reunification also meant the end of the cold war and the dream of a peaceful european union , as the one we have today .

where was i when the wall came down ?
i never thought in my lifetime i would see this horrible piece of shame come down .
having visited my grandparents in east germany as a teenager and seen for myself what communism is all about , i can not describe the emotions i had on november 9 .
i celebrated the day with two american friends at mcdonalds with a coke .
i will never forget this day as long as i live . - birgit harms , us we were living in new delhi at the time of the fall of the berlin wall .
i had made friends with a staff member of the east german embassy who was caught completely unaware by the sudden end of the existence of the gdr .
we received the usual invitation for the new year 's eve party from the west german embassy but the new friends from the ex-gdr embassy had also invited us .
we followed our hearts and chose to go to the east german embassy to celebrate new year 1990 on the roof of their now redundant diplomatic mission in asia .
the atmosphere was first somewhat low-spirited .
some of the eastern friends had lost their dreams and uncertainty was a dominant feeling .
we listened and drank champagne .
there was happiness and hope mixed with sadness and some fear .
we answered very simple questions , like " can i apply for a job with more than one company ? "
we had to explain the details of ' western freedom . '
what was for us entirely normal and common practice was very new and unusual for them .
we encouraged them to embrace the change but we did not praise the west over the east .
the wounds in their souls were still wide open and healing was yet to begin .
they were good people who lived for what they believed in and we respected that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' i never thought i would see this horrible piece of shame come down . "
the west german embassy had made it very clear they wanted none of them .
there were perhaps good reasons for this but for those affected it was yet another blow on a body that was already in great pain .
i am sure that all of them did well after the reunification and we feel privileged to have been able to make the sudden and unexpected change a bit easier for them . - dieter & nilima pelz , australia i was assigned to the berlin brigade , office of the commanding general , us army .
i remember the night before , when coming home from the grocery store , you could not get on a subway because they were completely full .
i came back up to the street and found out what was going on .
my german friend bruce schlottow and i made our way from sophie-charlotte platz over to brandenburg gate and watched history unfold in front of us for the next few days .
i can remember smelling the exhaust of the trabbies in the street , seeing how excited everyone was , and how i felt being a part of history .
i have never forgotten that time and i have always considered berlin my home after returning back to dallas , texas . - a. alex arce , us i was an undergraduate student in my advanced german conversation and composition class at a small midwestern liberal arts university .
i was majoring in german , planning to spend a semester abroad in the next year , and my instructor was able to provide us with up to the minute information as she had recently been teaching in east berlin .
for me , this event was monumental and , even from such a distance , the feeling was heady and i was engrossed in watching every moment .
i visited berlin and former east germany for the first time in september 1990 , shortly before reunification .
i was struck by the fact that i had spent most of my day wandering around former east berlin , and only when i crossed at the brandenburger tor , did i realize that east and west were not as obvious as i had thought .
sure , there were landmarks such as the fernsehturm at alexanderplatz and the pieces of wall still standing , but there was also a lot that looked similar and perhaps had already been assimilated by this time . - kathy evenson-mcdermott , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge dominos fell on november 9 2009 , to symbolise the fall of the berlin wall i was born in prague .
my father was slovak , my mother was hungarian .
our family emigrated to new zealand after world war ii .
when the berlin wall came down i was sitting in my bedroom watching tv news .
i was overcome with both joy and sadness and i found myself sobbing .
the sadness came because my father had not lived to witness this event , but i was joyful that it had happened .
i could not think who could understand my feelings and emotion as i was alone , but i thought of a lithuanian friend so i phoned him with the good news .
i was glad i found someone who i could share my feelings with ; a person who understood . - katarina broughton , new zealand i had just returned from visiting my family in germany .
my husband turned on the news and we saw the wall coming down in pieces .
i wished i would have planned my trip to have been there at that time and place . - sabine , us we had come to visit friends in hamburg and drove with them to west berlin , still through east germany at that time .
the excitement was like electricity .
we took a taxi to checkpoint charlie , a place i crossed into east berlin a few times , with sadness and a bitter taste .
it was buzzing this day like a bee hive .
people from all over the world gathered along the wall , hammering and chiseling .
a young frenchman stood next to me and with a big grin , handed me a big piece of its painted section .
i still have it .
people were wandering from east to west and vice versa , some crying , some laughing and hugging each other , complete strangers , yet united in what was at one time an impossible event in our lifetime .
i thought of my father , who went through two world wars together with so many others in his age group .
he would have shed tears too , as i did now .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' checkpoint charlie ... was buzzing this day like a bee hive . "
i returned to the taxi , where we gathered with glasses of champagne .
the first east berliners in their trabants were coming across .
windows rolled down and waving , laughing as we , who stood there , waved back .
i met a couple that had never been to the west .
we embraced each other .
the men were shaking hands and the women were crying .
this terrible division ended and a rebirth began .
the rebirth of a united europe and the end of the ' cold war . ' - isabella miram , us i wept when at long last my " liebes land " was free !
i am not german but since 1942 i have had a love affair with germany .
i do n't know why !
i was only 4 years old !
other than china , on that november 9 the world 's biggest prison - for both east and west - was closed .
november 9 was the greatest day in world history !
alles gute , deutschland - robert mccormick , australia how sad that in her recent speech celebrating the fall of the berlin wall , -lrb- as far as i know -rrb- angela merkel made no mention of the two individuals who , more than anyone else , brought a close to the cold war and the fall of the wall : lady margaret thatcher and president ronald reagan .
reagan and thatcher squarely faced the " evil empire " and refused to be intimidated .
under huge financial pressure , gorbachev was forced to remove all soviet troops from eastern europe .
i was in hungary shortly after the russian army pulled out , and it was obvious to all concerned that it was only a matter of time before the whole communist system fell apart .
the reason the wall came down is that the only thing keeping it up was removed : the red army .
gorbachev did n't tear down the wall , he abandoned it and the freedom-hungry people of germany tore it down . - john roughton , us having visited both west and east germany in 1985 , it was a melancholy experience to visit a divided country , its capital cut in half and its people torn apart by politics .
only four years later , i watched with joy the nation re-unify and put aside its painful past for a new start , at the very heart of an increasingly united europe .
20 years on , from far away australia , i send you my warmest congratulations on this special day and i wish and hope that germany continues to go from strength to strength . - terry papadis , australia i was 9 years old when the wall came down , so the only things i could clearly remember were the happy people from a fellow european nation celebrating their unity and hope for the future .
nevertheless , that was a powerful message for a young person as myself and i 've never forgotten it .
the fall of the wall and subsequent reunification also meant the end of the cold war and the dream of a peaceful european union , as the one we have today .
for me , germany 's unity symbolizes europe 's unity and the fall of the wall is the most convincing proof that you ca n't divide people with ideological barriers for long . - constantine michailidis , greece compiled by stuart tiffen editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sweden , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , will hold a dinner for top diplomats in the belgian capital next week .
the meeting is aimed at helping swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt draw up a list of possible candidates for the two new posts created under the lisbon treaty .
the lisbon treaty , which was finally ratified last week , stipulates that both appointments have to be made by majority vote .
but diplomats believe reinfeldt is likely to try and find consensus candidates .
" my prime minister is going to start a second round of consultations and hopefully we will be able to present the candidates next thursday , " reinfeldt 's spokeswoman , robert alenius , told the afp news agency .
there has been much speculation about who is on the list .
the frontrunners for the post of president are believed to be the prime ministers of belgium and the netherlands , herman van rompuy and jan peter balkenende. tkw / dpa / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more reserved players like enke are almost ignored in the footballing circus .
dw 's stefan nestler comments . the news of a suicide is shocking - always .
almost involuntarily we ask ourselves : was there really nothing that might have stopped this person taking his own life ?
did he send us any signals of his despair which we failed to notice ?
suddenly confronted by a life that ended too soon , we ask ourselves why .
robert enke was not one of those footballers who sought out every microphone in order to tell the world how important he was .
also , he was not the typical eccentric between the sticks , forever screaming at his defenders , like so many other goalkeepers .
he always seemed reserved and polite , a soft-spoken man .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan nestler in fact , his character was often cited as one of his biggest weaknesses as a keeper .
often the german press would call on enke to put more effort into asserting himself as germany 's number one goalkeeper , to make his own case more passionately and with more vigour in the media .
but that just was n't robert enke 's style .
quieter people like enke are often swamped in the melee that is the soccer circus , where only goals , points , and championships really matter .
to the winner , the spoils .
the loser is lucky to get a sympathetic grimace .
often the common opinion is that someone who earns millions every year for playing sports has nothing to grumble about .
but for robert enke , in both sports and his everyday life , things had not been running smoothly .
at some of the larger foreign clubs that hired him earlier in his career , fc barcelona for example , he spent almost all of his time warming the substitutes ' bench .
and much more recently , once he had finally seemed to establish himself clearly as germany 's number one goalkeeper , an illness stopped him in his tracks .
however the ebbs and flows of his sporting career seem almost banal when compared to what he had endured off the pitch , more specifically the death of his two-year-old daughter in 2006 .
we will never know if that was the catalyst for this tragedy , or whether the process began at another moment in time .
robert enke , the goalkeeper , has been analyzed in painstaking detail for years , however , it seems the wider world failed to even scratch the surface of robert enke , the man .
and now he 's gone .

they are also designed to improve the lot of women and increase environmental sustainability .
cambodia is seeing mixed progress as it tries to reach its nine targets .
while infant and child mortality have come down , maternal mortality rates remain high . a baby ’ s cry pierces the afternoon air at a maternity hospital in cambodia ’ s capital phnom penh .
in an important way , that is the sound of success .
cambodia has cut the rate of infants dying before their first birthday from around 95 per 1,000 live births a decade ago to 60 .
the target is 50 per 1,000 live births .
it is one of nine mdg targets that cambodia has signed up to .
dr lo veasnakiry , head of planning at the ministry of health , says progress towards meeting the mdg on child and infant mortality is in part due to the government ’ s commitment to maintaining health sector spending despite the global economic crisis .
it has also made efforts to improve access to child health services , and has received cash and technical assistance from health partners such as unicef , the united nations children ’ s fund .
malalay ahmadzai is the mother and child specialist at unicef .
she credits other factors too : " one has been the strong performance of the national immunisation programme .
second has been the improvement in breastfeeding practices , and that goes back to a lot of community work plus support to the health centres and so on . "
no progress on maternal mortality but with just a few years to go , cambodia could well miss six other mdg targets , including the one on maternal mortality .
a decade ago 460 women died in childbirth in cambodia for every 100,000 births .
the target is 140 and yet the rate has not come down .
why ?
dr lo explains that , to begin with , the target is very ambitious .
" from the global viewpoint , not only cambodia but a lot of countries have not made significant progress in terms of maternal deaths " , he says .
more resources needed a study found that more than half of the women who die in childbirth in cambodia succumb to massive blood loss .
another fifth die from eclampsia , that is high blood pressure .
they require a rapid response - and any delay can result in death .
" the first delay is decision-making in the family whether to seek care or not " , says unicef 's malalay ahmadzai .
" the second is costs , roads and access .
and third is the quality of care . "
cambodia needs more resources and more trained staff , and dr lo says that is starting to happen , but it won ’ t be enough .
that ’ s why he recently proposed that the government revise the target .
shifting the target is a controversial way of reaching it – but as dr lo points out , if cambodia can reach the revised target of 250 deaths per 100,000 births that would still mark a big improvement .

cambodia has cut the rate of infants dying before their first birthday from around 95 per 1,000 live births a decade ago to 60 .
the target is 50 per 1,000 live births .
it is one of nine mdg targets that cambodia has signed up to .
dr lo veasnakiry , head of planning at the ministry of health , says progress towards meeting the mdg on child and infant mortality is in part due to the government ’ s commitment to maintaining health sector spending despite the global economic crisis .
it has also made efforts to improve access to child health services , and has received cash and technical assistance from health partners such as unicef , the united nations children ’ s fund .
malalay ahmadzai is the mother and child specialist at unicef .
she credits other factors too : " one has been the strong performance of the national immunisation programme .
second has been the improvement in breastfeeding practices , and that goes back to a lot of community work plus support to the health centres and so on . "
no progress on maternal mortality but with just a few years to go , cambodia could well miss six other mdg targets , including the one on maternal mortality .
a decade ago 460 women died in childbirth in cambodia for every 100,000 births .
the target is 140 and yet the rate has not come down .
why ?
dr lo explains that , to begin with , the target is very ambitious .
" from the global viewpoint , not only cambodia but a lot of countries have not made significant progress in terms of maternal deaths " , he says .
more resources needed a study found that more than half of the women who die in childbirth in cambodia succumb to massive blood loss .
another fifth die from eclampsia , that is high blood pressure .
they require a rapid response - and any delay can result in death .
" the first delay is decision-making in the family whether to seek care or not " , says unicef 's malalay ahmadzai .
" the second is costs , roads and access .
and third is the quality of care . "
cambodia needs more resources and more trained staff , and dr lo says that is starting to happen , but it won ’ t be enough .
that ’ s why he recently proposed that the government revise the target .
shifting the target is a controversial way of reaching it – but as dr lo points out , if cambodia can reach the revised target of 250 deaths per 100,000 births that would still mark a big improvement .

they are also designed to improve the lot of women and increase environmental sustainability .
cambodia is seeing mixed progress as it tries to reach its nine targets .
while infant and child mortality have come down , maternal mortality rates remain high . a baby ’ s cry pierces the afternoon air at a maternity hospital in cambodia ’ s capital phnom penh .
in an important way , that is the sound of success .
cambodia has cut the rate of infants dying before their first birthday from around 95 per 1,000 live births a decade ago to 60 .
the target is 50 per 1,000 live births .
it is one of nine mdg targets that cambodia has signed up to .
dr lo veasnakiry , head of planning at the ministry of health , says progress towards meeting the mdg on child and infant mortality is in part due to the government ’ s commitment to maintaining health sector spending despite the global economic crisis .
it has also made efforts to improve access to child health services , and has received cash and technical assistance from health partners such as unicef , the united nations children ’ s fund .
malalay ahmadzai is the mother and child specialist at unicef .
she credits other factors too : " one has been the strong performance of the national immunisation programme .
second has been the improvement in breastfeeding practices , and that goes back to a lot of community work plus support to the health centres and so on . "
no progress on maternal mortality but with just a few years to go , cambodia could well miss six other mdg targets , including the one on maternal mortality .
a decade ago 460 women died in childbirth in cambodia for every 100,000 births .
the target is 140 and yet the rate has not come down .
why ?
dr lo explains that , to begin with , the target is very ambitious .
" from the global viewpoint , not only cambodia but a lot of countries have not made significant progress in terms of maternal deaths " , he says .
more resources needed a study found that more than half of the women who die in childbirth in cambodia succumb to massive blood loss .
another fifth die from eclampsia , that is high blood pressure .
they require a rapid response - and any delay can result in death .
" the first delay is decision-making in the family whether to seek care or not " , says unicef 's malalay ahmadzai .
" the second is costs , roads and access .
and third is the quality of care . "
cambodia needs more resources and more trained staff , and dr lo says that is starting to happen , but it won ’ t be enough .
that ’ s why he recently proposed that the government revise the target .
shifting the target is a controversial way of reaching it – but as dr lo points out , if cambodia can reach the revised target of 250 deaths per 100,000 births that would still mark a big improvement .

they are also designed to improve the lot of women and increase environmental sustainability .
cambodia is seeing mixed progress as it tries to reach its nine targets .
while infant and child mortality have come down , maternal mortality rates remain high . a baby ’ s cry pierces the afternoon air at a maternity hospital in cambodia ’ s capital phnom penh .
in an important way , that is the sound of success .
cambodia has cut the rate of infants dying before their first birthday from around 95 per 1,000 live births a decade ago to 60 .
the target is 50 per 1,000 live births .
it is one of nine mdg targets that cambodia has signed up to .
dr lo veasnakiry , head of planning at the ministry of health , says progress towards meeting the mdg on child and infant mortality is in part due to the government ’ s commitment to maintaining health sector spending despite the global economic crisis .
it has also made efforts to improve access to child health services , and has received cash and technical assistance from health partners such as unicef , the united nations children ’ s fund .
malalay ahmadzai is the mother and child specialist at unicef .
she credits other factors too : " one has been the strong performance of the national immunisation programme .
second has been the improvement in breastfeeding practices , and that goes back to a lot of community work plus support to the health centres and so on . "
no progress on maternal mortality but with just a few years to go , cambodia could well miss six other mdg targets , including the one on maternal mortality .
a decade ago 460 women died in childbirth in cambodia for every 100,000 births .
the target is 140 and yet the rate has not come down .
why ?
dr lo explains that , to begin with , the target is very ambitious .
" from the global viewpoint , not only cambodia but a lot of countries have not made significant progress in terms of maternal deaths " , he says .
more resources needed a study found that more than half of the women who die in childbirth in cambodia succumb to massive blood loss .
another fifth die from eclampsia , that is high blood pressure .
they require a rapid response - and any delay can result in death .
" the first delay is decision-making in the family whether to seek care or not " , says unicef 's malalay ahmadzai .
" the second is costs , roads and access .
and third is the quality of care . "
cambodia needs more resources and more trained staff , and dr lo says that is starting to happen , but it won ’ t be enough .
that ’ s why he recently proposed that the government revise the target .
shifting the target is a controversial way of reaching it – but as dr lo points out , if cambodia can reach the revised target of 250 deaths per 100,000 births that would still mark a big improvement .

another fifth die from eclampsia , that is high blood pressure .
they require a rapid response - and any delay can result in death .
" the first delay is decision-making in the family whether to seek care or not " , says unicef 's malalay ahmadzai .
" the second is costs , roads and access .
and third is the quality of care . "
cambodia needs more resources and more trained staff , and dr lo says that is starting to happen , but it won ’ t be enough .
that ’ s why he recently proposed that the government revise the target .
shifting the target is a controversial way of reaching it – but as dr lo points out , if cambodia can reach the revised target of 250 deaths per 100,000 births that would still mark a big improvement .

the national player suffered from depression . in a press conference on wednesday , enke 's doctor valentin markser said the soccer star had first come to him in 2003 when he was suffering from a fear of failure on the pitch .
the doctor said he had been treating the goalkeeper for depression since then and confirmed that enke had thought about suicide in the past . the soccer star 's widow , teresa enke , who also attended the press conference , said her husband experienced phases of depression . " i wanted to help him get through it , " she said .
" i tried to be there for him . " but enke always rejected any suggestion that his depression be treated in a hospital .
his widow said he was afraid that in doing so , he would run the risk of losing the couple 's adopted daughter . in his suicide note , enke is said to have apologized to his family and doctors for his decision to take his life and for not having been honest about the severity of his condition . a world cup favorite germany 's national team have called off their saturday match against chile .
" we need to be able to take a moment , " said theo zwanziger , head of the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- at an afternoon press conference .
" there 's no other option , " he said , adding that the decision was made by the dfb management in conjunction with the players . " we thought about playing the game as a farewell to robert , but it is clear it is too soon after this terrible news , " said team manager oliver bierhoff , who was visibly upset during the press conference . zwanziger said the players were already leaving the training complex and would not reconvene until sunday when they would train for next wednesday 's match against the ivory coast . although enke was considered one of the front-runners for the keeper position on the 2010 world cup squad , he was forced to miss the last four games for germany and several matches for hanover due to an intestinal infection and he had not been selected for germany 's friendly matches against chile and the ivory coast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim loew still favored enke for the world cup after sitting out for two months , enke returned to the pitch for hanover on october 31 against cologne .
his last match in the bundesliga came just two days before his death , a 2-2 draw against hamburg . german national coach joachim loew had said it was too early for enke to return to the squad after his illness .
nevertheless , loew had indicated that enke was still his favorite to be germany 's goalkeeper at the world cup finals in south africa next year . the infection , which caused enke to miss key world cup qualifying matches , was not the first personal hardship the goalkeeper faced in his lifetime .
in 2006 he and his wife suffered a personal tragedy with the death of their then two-year-old daughter due to a rare heart condition . german soccer mourns the response from the german soccer community has been both shock and sadness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candles for the goalkeeper " it is a tragedy , " martin kind , president of enke 's bundesliga club hanover 96 , said .
" you expect many things , but not something like that . ” dfb 's zwanziger said he was " stunned and full of sadness . " " we send our deepest sympathies to his wife and family .
robert enke was a wonderful person who had been dealt some tough cards , " he said . fc barcelona , one of enke 's former clubs , held a minute of silence for the german keeper ahead of their spanish cup match against cultural leonesa on tuesday night . in hanover , hundreds of the team 's fans gathered outside the club 's stadium to light candles and leave flowers . " he leaves behind a large hole in our lives , not only in hanover , but for soccer in germany , " said the team 's sports director joerg schmadtke . on wednesday evening , team colleagues and fans gathered for a service of remembrance in hanover .
enke 's funeral will be held on sunday .
during the next bundesliga matches a minute of silence will be held and black armbands will be worn in his honor . hf / tkw / mz / rb / dpa / afp / ap editor : nigel tandy / sh send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 11.11.2009 germany in mourning over suicide of top goalkeeper großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soccer world was shocked by news of enke 's death germany is stunned by the suicide of top goalkeeper robert enke .
the national player suffered from depression . in a press conference on wednesday , enke 's doctor valentin markser said the soccer star had first come to him in 2003 when he was suffering from a fear of failure on the pitch .
the doctor said he had been treating the goalkeeper for depression since then and confirmed that enke had thought about suicide in the past . the soccer star 's widow , teresa enke , who also attended the press conference , said her husband experienced phases of depression . " i wanted to help him get through it , " she said .
" i tried to be there for him . " but enke always rejected any suggestion that his depression be treated in a hospital .
his widow said he was afraid that in doing so , he would run the risk of losing the couple 's adopted daughter . in his suicide note , enke is said to have apologized to his family and doctors for his decision to take his life and for not having been honest about the severity of his condition . a world cup favorite germany 's national team have called off their saturday match against chile .
" we need to be able to take a moment , " said theo zwanziger , head of the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- at an afternoon press conference .
" there 's no other option , " he said , adding that the decision was made by the dfb management in conjunction with the players . " we thought about playing the game as a farewell to robert , but it is clear it is too soon after this terrible news , " said team manager oliver bierhoff , who was visibly upset during the press conference . zwanziger said the players were already leaving the training complex and would not reconvene until sunday when they would train for next wednesday 's match against the ivory coast . although enke was considered one of the front-runners for the keeper position on the 2010 world cup squad , he was forced to miss the last four games for germany and several matches for hanover due to an intestinal infection and he had not been selected for germany 's friendly matches against chile and the ivory coast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim loew still favored enke for the world cup after sitting out for two months , enke returned to the pitch for hanover on october 31 against cologne .
his last match in the bundesliga came just two days before his death , a 2-2 draw against hamburg . german national coach joachim loew had said it was too early for enke to return to the squad after his illness .
nevertheless , loew had indicated that enke was still his favorite to be germany 's goalkeeper at the world cup finals in south africa next year . the infection , which caused enke to miss key world cup qualifying matches , was not the first personal hardship the goalkeeper faced in his lifetime .
in 2006 he and his wife suffered a personal tragedy with the death of their then two-year-old daughter due to a rare heart condition . german soccer mourns the response from the german soccer community has been both shock and sadness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candles for the goalkeeper " it is a tragedy , " martin kind , president of enke 's bundesliga club hanover 96 , said .
" you expect many things , but not something like that . ” dfb 's zwanziger said he was " stunned and full of sadness . " " we send our deepest sympathies to his wife and family .
robert enke was a wonderful person who had been dealt some tough cards , " he said . fc barcelona , one of enke 's former clubs , held a minute of silence for the german keeper ahead of their spanish cup match against cultural leonesa on tuesday night . in hanover , hundreds of the team 's fans gathered outside the club 's stadium to light candles and leave flowers . " he leaves behind a large hole in our lives , not only in hanover , but for soccer in germany , " said the team 's sports director joerg schmadtke . on wednesday evening , team colleagues and fans gathered for a service of remembrance in hanover .
enke 's funeral will be held on sunday .
during the next bundesliga matches a minute of silence will be held and black armbands will be worn in his honor . hf / tkw / mz / rb / dpa / afp / ap editor : nigel tandy / sh send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

almost involuntarily we ask ourselves : was there really nothing that might have stopped this person taking his own life ?
did he send us any signals of his despair which we failed to notice ?
suddenly confronted by a life that ended too soon , we ask ourselves why .
robert enke was not one of those footballers who sought out every microphone in order to tell the world how important he was .
also , he was not the typical eccentric between the sticks , forever screaming at his defenders , like so many other goalkeepers .
he always seemed reserved and polite , a soft-spoken man .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan nestler in fact , his character was often cited as one of his biggest weaknesses as a keeper .
often the german press would call on enke to put more effort into asserting himself as germany 's number one goalkeeper , to make his own case more passionately and with more vigour in the media .
but that just was n't robert enke 's style .
quieter people like enke are often swamped in the melee that is the soccer circus , where only goals , points , and championships really matter .
to the winner , the spoils .
the loser is lucky to get a sympathetic grimace .
often the common opinion is that someone who earns millions every year for playing sports has nothing to grumble about .
but for robert enke , in both sports and his everyday life , things had not been running smoothly .
at some of the larger foreign clubs that hired him earlier in his career , fc barcelona for example , he spent almost all of his time warming the substitutes ' bench .
and much more recently , once he had finally seemed to establish himself clearly as germany 's number one goalkeeper , an illness stopped him in his tracks .
however the ebbs and flows of his sporting career seem almost banal when compared to what he had endured off the pitch , more specifically the death of his two-year-old daughter in 2006 .
we will never know if that was the catalyst for this tragedy , or whether the process began at another moment in time .
robert enke , the goalkeeper , has been analyzed in painstaking detail for years , however , it seems the wider world failed to even scratch the surface of robert enke , the man .
and now he 's gone .

robert enke was not one of those footballers who sought out every microphone in order to tell the world how important he was .

he always seemed reserved and polite , a soft-spoken man .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan nestler in fact , his character was often cited as one of his biggest weaknesses as a keeper .
often the german press would call on enke to put more effort into asserting himself as germany 's number one goalkeeper , to make his own case more passionately and with more vigour in the media .
but that just was n't robert enke 's style .
quieter people like enke are often swamped in the melee that is the soccer circus , where only goals , points , and championships really matter .
to the winner , the spoils .
the loser is lucky to get a sympathetic grimace .
often the common opinion is that someone who earns millions every year for playing sports has nothing to grumble about .

at some of the larger foreign clubs that hired him earlier in his career , fc barcelona for example , he spent almost all of his time warming the substitutes ' bench .
and much more recently , once he had finally seemed to establish himself clearly as germany 's number one goalkeeper , an illness stopped him in his tracks .
however the ebbs and flows of his sporting career seem almost banal when compared to what he had endured off the pitch , more specifically the death of his two-year-old daughter in 2006 .
we will never know if that was the catalyst for this tragedy , or whether the process began at another moment in time .
robert enke , the goalkeeper , has been analyzed in painstaking detail for years , however , it seems the wider world failed to even scratch the surface of robert enke , the man .

the national player suffered from depression . in a press conference on wednesday , enke 's doctor valentin markser said the soccer star had first come to him in 2003 when he was suffering from a fear of failure on the pitch .
the doctor said he had been treating the goalkeeper for depression since then and confirmed that enke had thought about suicide in the past . the soccer star 's widow , teresa enke , who also attended the press conference , said her husband experienced phases of depression . " i wanted to help him get through it , " she said .
" i tried to be there for him . " but enke always rejected any suggestion that his depression be treated in a hospital .
his widow said he was afraid that in doing so , he would run the risk of losing the couple 's adopted daughter . in his suicide note , enke is said to have apologized to his family and doctors for his decision to take his life and for not having been honest about the severity of his condition . a world cup favorite germany 's national team have called off their saturday match against chile .
" we need to be able to take a moment , " said theo zwanziger , head of the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- at an afternoon press conference .
" there 's no other option , " he said , adding that the decision was made by the dfb management in conjunction with the players . " we thought about playing the game as a farewell to robert , but it is clear it is too soon after this terrible news , " said team manager oliver bierhoff , who was visibly upset during the press conference . zwanziger said the players were already leaving the training complex and would not reconvene until sunday when they would train for next wednesday 's match against the ivory coast . although enke was considered one of the front-runners for the keeper position on the 2010 world cup squad , he was forced to miss the last four games for germany and several matches for hanover due to an intestinal infection and he had not been selected for germany 's friendly matches against chile and the ivory coast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim loew still favored enke for the world cup after sitting out for two months , enke returned to the pitch for hanover on october 31 against cologne .
his last match in the bundesliga came just two days before his death , a 2-2 draw against hamburg . german national coach joachim loew had said it was too early for enke to return to the squad after his illness .
nevertheless , loew had indicated that enke was still his favorite to be germany 's goalkeeper at the world cup finals in south africa next year . the infection , which caused enke to miss key world cup qualifying matches , was not the first personal hardship the goalkeeper faced in his lifetime .
in 2006 he and his wife suffered a personal tragedy with the death of their then two-year-old daughter due to a rare heart condition . german soccer mourns the response from the german soccer community has been both shock and sadness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candles for the goalkeeper " it is a tragedy , " martin kind , president of enke 's bundesliga club hanover 96 , said .
" you expect many things , but not something like that . ” dfb 's zwanziger said he was " stunned and full of sadness . " " we send our deepest sympathies to his wife and family .
robert enke was a wonderful person who had been dealt some tough cards , " he said . fc barcelona , one of enke 's former clubs , held a minute of silence for the german keeper ahead of their spanish cup match against cultural leonesa on tuesday night . in hanover , hundreds of the team 's fans gathered outside the club 's stadium to light candles and leave flowers . " he leaves behind a large hole in our lives , not only in hanover , but for soccer in germany , " said the team 's sports director joerg schmadtke . on wednesday evening , team colleagues and fans gathered for a service of remembrance in hanover .
enke 's funeral will be held on sunday .

more reserved players like enke are almost ignored in the footballing circus .
dw 's stefan nestler comments . the news of a suicide is shocking - always .
almost involuntarily we ask ourselves : was there really nothing that might have stopped this person taking his own life ?
did he send us any signals of his despair which we failed to notice ?
suddenly confronted by a life that ended too soon , we ask ourselves why .
robert enke was not one of those footballers who sought out every microphone in order to tell the world how important he was .
also , he was not the typical eccentric between the sticks , forever screaming at his defenders , like so many other goalkeepers .
he always seemed reserved and polite , a soft-spoken man .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan nestler in fact , his character was often cited as one of his biggest weaknesses as a keeper .
often the german press would call on enke to put more effort into asserting himself as germany 's number one goalkeeper , to make his own case more passionately and with more vigour in the media .
but that just was n't robert enke 's style .
quieter people like enke are often swamped in the melee that is the soccer circus , where only goals , points , and championships really matter .
to the winner , the spoils .
the loser is lucky to get a sympathetic grimace .
often the common opinion is that someone who earns millions every year for playing sports has nothing to grumble about .
but for robert enke , in both sports and his everyday life , things had not been running smoothly .
at some of the larger foreign clubs that hired him earlier in his career , fc barcelona for example , he spent almost all of his time warming the substitutes ' bench .
and much more recently , once he had finally seemed to establish himself clearly as germany 's number one goalkeeper , an illness stopped him in his tracks .
however the ebbs and flows of his sporting career seem almost banal when compared to what he had endured off the pitch , more specifically the death of his two-year-old daughter in 2006 .
we will never know if that was the catalyst for this tragedy , or whether the process began at another moment in time .
robert enke , the goalkeeper , has been analyzed in painstaking detail for years , however , it seems the wider world failed to even scratch the surface of robert enke , the man .
and now he 's gone .

more reserved players like enke are almost ignored in the footballing circus .
dw 's stefan nestler comments . the news of a suicide is shocking - always .
almost involuntarily we ask ourselves : was there really nothing that might have stopped this person taking his own life ?
did he send us any signals of his despair which we failed to notice ?
suddenly confronted by a life that ended too soon , we ask ourselves why .
robert enke was not one of those footballers who sought out every microphone in order to tell the world how important he was .
also , he was not the typical eccentric between the sticks , forever screaming at his defenders , like so many other goalkeepers .
he always seemed reserved and polite , a soft-spoken man .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan nestler in fact , his character was often cited as one of his biggest weaknesses as a keeper .
often the german press would call on enke to put more effort into asserting himself as germany 's number one goalkeeper , to make his own case more passionately and with more vigour in the media .
but that just was n't robert enke 's style .
quieter people like enke are often swamped in the melee that is the soccer circus , where only goals , points , and championships really matter .
to the winner , the spoils .
the loser is lucky to get a sympathetic grimace .
often the common opinion is that someone who earns millions every year for playing sports has nothing to grumble about .
but for robert enke , in both sports and his everyday life , things had not been running smoothly .
at some of the larger foreign clubs that hired him earlier in his career , fc barcelona for example , he spent almost all of his time warming the substitutes ' bench .
and much more recently , once he had finally seemed to establish himself clearly as germany 's number one goalkeeper , an illness stopped him in his tracks .
however the ebbs and flows of his sporting career seem almost banal when compared to what he had endured off the pitch , more specifically the death of his two-year-old daughter in 2006 .
we will never know if that was the catalyst for this tragedy , or whether the process began at another moment in time .
robert enke , the goalkeeper , has been analyzed in painstaking detail for years , however , it seems the wider world failed to even scratch the surface of robert enke , the man .
and now he 's gone .

the national player suffered from depression . in a press conference on wednesday , enke 's doctor valentin markser said the soccer star had first come to him in 2003 when he was suffering from a fear of failure on the pitch .
the doctor said he had been treating the goalkeeper for depression since then and confirmed that enke had thought about suicide in the past . the soccer star 's widow , teresa enke , who also attended the press conference , said her husband experienced phases of depression . " i wanted to help him get through it , " she said .
" i tried to be there for him . " but enke always rejected any suggestion that his depression be treated in a hospital .
his widow said he was afraid that in doing so , he would run the risk of losing the couple 's adopted daughter . in his suicide note , enke is said to have apologized to his family and doctors for his decision to take his life and for not having been honest about the severity of his condition . a world cup favorite germany 's national team have called off their saturday match against chile .
" we need to be able to take a moment , " said theo zwanziger , head of the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- at an afternoon press conference .
" there 's no other option , " he said , adding that the decision was made by the dfb management in conjunction with the players . " we thought about playing the game as a farewell to robert , but it is clear it is too soon after this terrible news , " said team manager oliver bierhoff , who was visibly upset during the press conference . zwanziger said the players were already leaving the training complex and would not reconvene until sunday when they would train for next wednesday 's match against the ivory coast . although enke was considered one of the front-runners for the keeper position on the 2010 world cup squad , he was forced to miss the last four games for germany and several matches for hanover due to an intestinal infection and he had not been selected for germany 's friendly matches against chile and the ivory coast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim loew still favored enke for the world cup after sitting out for two months , enke returned to the pitch for hanover on october 31 against cologne .
his last match in the bundesliga came just two days before his death , a 2-2 draw against hamburg . german national coach joachim loew had said it was too early for enke to return to the squad after his illness .
nevertheless , loew had indicated that enke was still his favorite to be germany 's goalkeeper at the world cup finals in south africa next year . the infection , which caused enke to miss key world cup qualifying matches , was not the first personal hardship the goalkeeper faced in his lifetime .
in 2006 he and his wife suffered a personal tragedy with the death of their then two-year-old daughter due to a rare heart condition . german soccer mourns the response from the german soccer community has been both shock and sadness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candles for the goalkeeper " it is a tragedy , " martin kind , president of enke 's bundesliga club hanover 96 , said .
" you expect many things , but not something like that . ” dfb 's zwanziger said he was " stunned and full of sadness . " " we send our deepest sympathies to his wife and family .
robert enke was a wonderful person who had been dealt some tough cards , " he said . fc barcelona , one of enke 's former clubs , held a minute of silence for the german keeper ahead of their spanish cup match against cultural leonesa on tuesday night . in hanover , hundreds of the team 's fans gathered outside the club 's stadium to light candles and leave flowers . " he leaves behind a large hole in our lives , not only in hanover , but for soccer in germany , " said the team 's sports director joerg schmadtke . on wednesday evening , team colleagues and fans gathered for a service of remembrance in hanover .
enke 's funeral will be held on sunday .
during the next bundesliga matches a minute of silence will be held and black armbands will be worn in his honor . hf / tkw / mz / rb / dpa / afp / ap editor : nigel tandy / sh send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the national player suffered from depression . in a press conference on wednesday , enke 's doctor valentin markser said the soccer star had first come to him in 2003 when he was suffering from a fear of failure on the pitch .
the doctor said he had been treating the goalkeeper for depression since then and confirmed that enke had thought about suicide in the past . the soccer star 's widow , teresa enke , who also attended the press conference , said her husband experienced phases of depression . " i wanted to help him get through it , " she said .
" i tried to be there for him . " but enke always rejected any suggestion that his depression be treated in a hospital .
his widow said he was afraid that in doing so , he would run the risk of losing the couple 's adopted daughter . in his suicide note , enke is said to have apologized to his family and doctors for his decision to take his life and for not having been honest about the severity of his condition . a world cup favorite germany 's national team have called off their saturday match against chile .
" we need to be able to take a moment , " said theo zwanziger , head of the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- at an afternoon press conference .
" there 's no other option , " he said , adding that the decision was made by the dfb management in conjunction with the players . " we thought about playing the game as a farewell to robert , but it is clear it is too soon after this terrible news , " said team manager oliver bierhoff , who was visibly upset during the press conference . zwanziger said the players were already leaving the training complex and would not reconvene until sunday when they would train for next wednesday 's match against the ivory coast . although enke was considered one of the front-runners for the keeper position on the 2010 world cup squad , he was forced to miss the last four games for germany and several matches for hanover due to an intestinal infection and he had not been selected for germany 's friendly matches against chile and the ivory coast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim loew still favored enke for the world cup after sitting out for two months , enke returned to the pitch for hanover on october 31 against cologne .
his last match in the bundesliga came just two days before his death , a 2-2 draw against hamburg . german national coach joachim loew had said it was too early for enke to return to the squad after his illness .
nevertheless , loew had indicated that enke was still his favorite to be germany 's goalkeeper at the world cup finals in south africa next year . the infection , which caused enke to miss key world cup qualifying matches , was not the first personal hardship the goalkeeper faced in his lifetime .
in 2006 he and his wife suffered a personal tragedy with the death of their then two-year-old daughter due to a rare heart condition . german soccer mourns the response from the german soccer community has been both shock and sadness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candles for the goalkeeper " it is a tragedy , " martin kind , president of enke 's bundesliga club hanover 96 , said .
" you expect many things , but not something like that . ” dfb 's zwanziger said he was " stunned and full of sadness . " " we send our deepest sympathies to his wife and family .
robert enke was a wonderful person who had been dealt some tough cards , " he said . fc barcelona , one of enke 's former clubs , held a minute of silence for the german keeper ahead of their spanish cup match against cultural leonesa on tuesday night . in hanover , hundreds of the team 's fans gathered outside the club 's stadium to light candles and leave flowers . " he leaves behind a large hole in our lives , not only in hanover , but for soccer in germany , " said the team 's sports director joerg schmadtke . on wednesday evening , team colleagues and fans gathered for a service of remembrance in hanover .
enke 's funeral will be held on sunday .
during the next bundesliga matches a minute of silence will be held and black armbands will be worn in his honor . hf / tkw / mz / rb / dpa / afp / ap editor : nigel tandy / sh send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they are also designed to improve the lot of women and increase environmental sustainability .
cambodia is seeing mixed progress as it tries to reach its nine targets .
while infant and child mortality have come down , maternal mortality rates remain high . a baby ’ s cry pierces the afternoon air at a maternity hospital in cambodia ’ s capital phnom penh .
in an important way , that is the sound of success .
cambodia has cut the rate of infants dying before their first birthday from around 95 per 1,000 live births a decade ago to 60 .
the target is 50 per 1,000 live births .
it is one of nine mdg targets that cambodia has signed up to .
dr lo veasnakiry , head of planning at the ministry of health , says progress towards meeting the mdg on child and infant mortality is in part due to the government ’ s commitment to maintaining health sector spending despite the global economic crisis .
it has also made efforts to improve access to child health services , and has received cash and technical assistance from health partners such as unicef , the united nations children ’ s fund .
malalay ahmadzai is the mother and child specialist at unicef .
she credits other factors too : " one has been the strong performance of the national immunisation programme .
second has been the improvement in breastfeeding practices , and that goes back to a lot of community work plus support to the health centres and so on . "
no progress on maternal mortality but with just a few years to go , cambodia could well miss six other mdg targets , including the one on maternal mortality .
a decade ago 460 women died in childbirth in cambodia for every 100,000 births .
the target is 140 and yet the rate has not come down .
why ?
dr lo explains that , to begin with , the target is very ambitious .
" from the global viewpoint , not only cambodia but a lot of countries have not made significant progress in terms of maternal deaths " , he says .
more resources needed a study found that more than half of the women who die in childbirth in cambodia succumb to massive blood loss .
another fifth die from eclampsia , that is high blood pressure .
they require a rapid response - and any delay can result in death .
" the first delay is decision-making in the family whether to seek care or not " , says unicef 's malalay ahmadzai .
" the second is costs , roads and access .
and third is the quality of care . "
cambodia needs more resources and more trained staff , and dr lo says that is starting to happen , but it won ’ t be enough .
that ’ s why he recently proposed that the government revise the target .
shifting the target is a controversial way of reaching it – but as dr lo points out , if cambodia can reach the revised target of 250 deaths per 100,000 births that would still mark a big improvement .

in an important way , that is the sound of success .
cambodia has cut the rate of infants dying before their first birthday from around 95 per 1,000 live births a decade ago to 60 .
the target is 50 per 1,000 live births .
it is one of nine mdg targets that cambodia has signed up to .
dr lo veasnakiry , head of planning at the ministry of health , says progress towards meeting the mdg on child and infant mortality is in part due to the government ’ s commitment to maintaining health sector spending despite the global economic crisis .
it has also made efforts to improve access to child health services , and has received cash and technical assistance from health partners such as unicef , the united nations children ’ s fund .
malalay ahmadzai is the mother and child specialist at unicef .
she credits other factors too : " one has been the strong performance of the national immunisation programme .
second has been the improvement in breastfeeding practices , and that goes back to a lot of community work plus support to the health centres and so on . "
no progress on maternal mortality but with just a few years to go , cambodia could well miss six other mdg targets , including the one on maternal mortality .
a decade ago 460 women died in childbirth in cambodia for every 100,000 births .
the target is 140 and yet the rate has not come down .
why ?
dr lo explains that , to begin with , the target is very ambitious .
" from the global viewpoint , not only cambodia but a lot of countries have not made significant progress in terms of maternal deaths " , he says .
more resources needed a study found that more than half of the women who die in childbirth in cambodia succumb to massive blood loss .
another fifth die from eclampsia , that is high blood pressure .
they require a rapid response - and any delay can result in death .
" the first delay is decision-making in the family whether to seek care or not " , says unicef 's malalay ahmadzai .
" the second is costs , roads and access .
and third is the quality of care . "
cambodia needs more resources and more trained staff , and dr lo says that is starting to happen , but it won ’ t be enough .
that ’ s why he recently proposed that the government revise the target .
shifting the target is a controversial way of reaching it – but as dr lo points out , if cambodia can reach the revised target of 250 deaths per 100,000 births that would still mark a big improvement .

sweden , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , will hold a dinner for top diplomats in the belgian capital next week .
the meeting is aimed at helping swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt draw up a list of possible candidates for the two new posts created under the lisbon treaty .
the lisbon treaty , which was finally ratified last week , stipulates that both appointments have to be made by majority vote .
but diplomats believe reinfeldt is likely to try and find consensus candidates .
" my prime minister is going to start a second round of consultations and hopefully we will be able to present the candidates next thursday , " reinfeldt 's spokeswoman , robert alenius , told the afp news agency .
there has been much speculation about who is on the list .

this after supply shortfalls . new health minister philipp roesler said vaccine manufacturer glaxosmithkline -lrb- gsk -rrb- had assured delegates at the emergency flu summit on wednesday , november 11 , that the company was working toward overcoming the shortages the pharmaceuticals giant had pledged to deliver 20 million doses of pandemrix by the end of the year , said roesler .
" these figures already make clear that not everyone can be vaccinated , " he conceded .
" it is now important that not everyone runs to the vaccination points . "
health minister of rhineland-palatinate , malu dreyer , said members of the emergency services would be prioritized .
the chronically will be next in line .
" you do n't have to go out and get vaccinated tomorrow , " said dreyer .
patients sent home earlier this week many germans arriving in doctors ' practices to be vaccinated had to be sent home because of the delivery shortfalls . germany 's state ministers , a representative of the vaccine manufacturer glaxosmithkline -lrb- gsk -rrb- and the heads of two public health institutes were at the summit on wednesday , november 11 , which was convened after reports of shortages in some regions .
after the meeting , thueringen 's health minister said 150,000 adjuvant-free doses of the vaccine would be available for pregnant women in december .
the presence of adjuvants , additives designed to strengthen the active ingredients , in the gsk vaccine have been a cause of concern in germany .
taubert cautioned that there was no cause for hysteria .
she said new supplies of the vaccine would also be delivered in january and february .
ahead of the summit , the state health minister of saxon-anhalt , gerlinde kuppe , called on the pharmaceutical industry to issue reliable figures so that states know how much vaccine they can count on .
" we ca n't accept the vague announcements from week to week that supplies could drop again or they could rise again , " said kuppe .
demand far outstrips supply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the new health minister 's first big challenge up to now , german states have only received around half of the vaccine they were expecting from pharmaceutical company glaxosmithkline -lrb- gsk -rrb- , according to thueringen health ministry 's department head , heinz fracke .
in some areas , the situation is more extreme than others .
the health ministry of germany 's most populous state north rhine-westphalia said it would next week only be receiving 120,000 of the 420,000 doses that it had ordered . roesler told german television on tuesday that he was confident that the required protection could be put in place .
" regional difficulties can arise even in the case of optimum production .
that is why i am appealing for patience , " he said .
" the sector is making an effort and the states are putting on a strong show locally . " gsk spokesman markus hardenblicker said that the guaranteed quotas had been met and that the states were being informed a week in advance of the amount of vaccine that they would be receiving .
he said figures issued in july had been non-binding .
the pharmaceutical company spokesman also said significantly higher levels of supplies of the pandemrix vaccine would be delivered at the end of november and start of december .
however , the company has admitted that there had been initial production difficulties .
germans put skepticism aside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there has been a rise in demand for the flu jab in september a study found that 62 percent of germans polled would not get vaccinated because of concerns about possible side effects . but the demand for vaccination has risen over the last few days after infection rates doubled in one week .
the robert koch institute has now registered more than 40,000 cases and recorded 12 deaths up to november 9 .
the deaths of a 33-year-old woman in aachen and a 33-year-old man in munich from the h1n1 virus were reported in the media on tuesday .
a spokesman of the bavarian federation of pharmacists , thomas metz , said that there had been a leap in interest in vaccination .

however , finding appropriate and acceptable candidates is proving more difficult than expected .
the british government still backs former prime minister tony blair , despite his unpopularity in some quarters over his support for the iraq war .
british foreign secretary david miliband on wednesday categorically denied that he is a candidate to become the eu high representative , the bloc 's spokesman on foreign affairs and defense , after his name began circulating last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british foreign secretary opts for a career at home miliband , speaking at a press conference in london during a visit by the new german foreign minister , guido westerwelle , said he " came to british politics to serve the british people in britain . "
his comments immediately fueled speculation that he was striving for leadership of the labour party and possible future premiership .
british business secretary peter mandelson , a former eu trade commissioner , said he had been approached about the foreign policy job after miliband turned it down , but also said he was " committed to remaining in the british government . "
power struggles marring the selection process the current favorite to become president of the european council is belgium 's center-right prime minister herman van rompuy , who is said to have french and german backing .
but there are some doubts about rompuy in other eu member states , where it is feared he could find himself overshadowed and overwhelmed by berlin and paris .
others would prefer a more forceful foreign policy chief , who would stand up to france and germany , as well as russia , china and the united states .
other names mentioned for the post of president include dutch prime minister peter balkenende , former latvian president vaira vike-freiberga and luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner said on wednesday however that mr. blair was not yet out of the running .
for the foreign affairs job , former italian prime minister massimo d 'alema is considered a strong contender , now that miliband has clearly stated his intention not to take the post .
besides the fact that different member states have been proposing different names , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , representing the eu presidency , said he was finding it especially difficult to strike a balance between the political left and right , and the conflicting visions of the smaller and larger eu countries on what role the politicians would play in brussels .
german foreign minister outlines policy issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foreign minister has been doing the rounds of germany 's allies .
the conflicting visions are a concern that german foreign minister westerwelle touched on during visits to london and earlier to copenhagen .
westerwelle told his danish and british counterparts that he wanted smaller and larger countries to deal with one another at " eye level " .

where was i when the wall came down ?
i never thought in my lifetime i would see this horrible piece of shame come down .
having visited my grandparents in east germany as a teenager and seen for myself what communism is all about , i can not describe the emotions i had on november 9 .
i celebrated the day with two american friends at mcdonalds with a coke .
i will never forget this day as long as i live . - birgit harms , us we were living in new delhi at the time of the fall of the berlin wall .
i had made friends with a staff member of the east german embassy who was caught completely unaware by the sudden end of the existence of the gdr .
we received the usual invitation for the new year 's eve party from the west german embassy but the new friends from the ex-gdr embassy had also invited us .
we followed our hearts and chose to go to the east german embassy to celebrate new year 1990 on the roof of their now redundant diplomatic mission in asia .
the atmosphere was first somewhat low-spirited .
some of the eastern friends had lost their dreams and uncertainty was a dominant feeling .
we listened and drank champagne .
there was happiness and hope mixed with sadness and some fear .
we answered very simple questions , like " can i apply for a job with more than one company ? "
we had to explain the details of ' western freedom . '
what was for us entirely normal and common practice was very new and unusual for them .
we encouraged them to embrace the change but we did not praise the west over the east .
the wounds in their souls were still wide open and healing was yet to begin .
they were good people who lived for what they believed in and we respected that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' i never thought i would see this horrible piece of shame come down . "
the west german embassy had made it very clear they wanted none of them .
there were perhaps good reasons for this but for those affected it was yet another blow on a body that was already in great pain .
i am sure that all of them did well after the reunification and we feel privileged to have been able to make the sudden and unexpected change a bit easier for them . - dieter & nilima pelz , australia i was assigned to the berlin brigade , office of the commanding general , us army .
i remember the night before , when coming home from the grocery store , you could not get on a subway because they were completely full .
i came back up to the street and found out what was going on .
my german friend bruce schlottow and i made our way from sophie-charlotte platz over to brandenburg gate and watched history unfold in front of us for the next few days .
i can remember smelling the exhaust of the trabbies in the street , seeing how excited everyone was , and how i felt being a part of history .
i have never forgotten that time and i have always considered berlin my home after returning back to dallas , texas . - a. alex arce , us i was an undergraduate student in my advanced german conversation and composition class at a small midwestern liberal arts university .
i was majoring in german , planning to spend a semester abroad in the next year , and my instructor was able to provide us with up to the minute information as she had recently been teaching in east berlin .
for me , this event was monumental and , even from such a distance , the feeling was heady and i was engrossed in watching every moment .
i visited berlin and former east germany for the first time in september 1990 , shortly before reunification .
i was struck by the fact that i had spent most of my day wandering around former east berlin , and only when i crossed at the brandenburger tor , did i realize that east and west were not as obvious as i had thought .
sure , there were landmarks such as the fernsehturm at alexanderplatz and the pieces of wall still standing , but there was also a lot that looked similar and perhaps had already been assimilated by this time . - kathy evenson-mcdermott , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge dominos fell on november 9 2009 , to symbolise the fall of the berlin wall i was born in prague .
my father was slovak , my mother was hungarian .
our family emigrated to new zealand after world war ii .
when the berlin wall came down i was sitting in my bedroom watching tv news .
i was overcome with both joy and sadness and i found myself sobbing .
the sadness came because my father had not lived to witness this event , but i was joyful that it had happened .
i could not think who could understand my feelings and emotion as i was alone , but i thought of a lithuanian friend so i phoned him with the good news .
i was glad i found someone who i could share my feelings with ; a person who understood . - katarina broughton , new zealand i had just returned from visiting my family in germany .
my husband turned on the news and we saw the wall coming down in pieces .
i wished i would have planned my trip to have been there at that time and place . - sabine , us we had come to visit friends in hamburg and drove with them to west berlin , still through east germany at that time .
the excitement was like electricity .
we took a taxi to checkpoint charlie , a place i crossed into east berlin a few times , with sadness and a bitter taste .
it was buzzing this day like a bee hive .
people from all over the world gathered along the wall , hammering and chiseling .
a young frenchman stood next to me and with a big grin , handed me a big piece of its painted section .
i still have it .
people were wandering from east to west and vice versa , some crying , some laughing and hugging each other , complete strangers , yet united in what was at one time an impossible event in our lifetime .
i thought of my father , who went through two world wars together with so many others in his age group .
he would have shed tears too , as i did now .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' checkpoint charlie ... was buzzing this day like a bee hive . "
i returned to the taxi , where we gathered with glasses of champagne .
the first east berliners in their trabants were coming across .
windows rolled down and waving , laughing as we , who stood there , waved back .
i met a couple that had never been to the west .
we embraced each other .
the men were shaking hands and the women were crying .
this terrible division ended and a rebirth began .
the rebirth of a united europe and the end of the ' cold war . ' - isabella miram , us i wept when at long last my " liebes land " was free !
i am not german but since 1942 i have had a love affair with germany .
i do n't know why !
i was only 4 years old !
other than china , on that november 9 the world 's biggest prison - for both east and west - was closed .
november 9 was the greatest day in world history !
alles gute , deutschland - robert mccormick , australia how sad that in her recent speech celebrating the fall of the berlin wall , -lrb- as far as i know -rrb- angela merkel made no mention of the two individuals who , more than anyone else , brought a close to the cold war and the fall of the wall : lady margaret thatcher and president ronald reagan .
reagan and thatcher squarely faced the " evil empire " and refused to be intimidated .
under huge financial pressure , gorbachev was forced to remove all soviet troops from eastern europe .
i was in hungary shortly after the russian army pulled out , and it was obvious to all concerned that it was only a matter of time before the whole communist system fell apart .
the reason the wall came down is that the only thing keeping it up was removed : the red army .
gorbachev did n't tear down the wall , he abandoned it and the freedom-hungry people of germany tore it down . - john roughton , us having visited both west and east germany in 1985 , it was a melancholy experience to visit a divided country , its capital cut in half and its people torn apart by politics .
only four years later , i watched with joy the nation re-unify and put aside its painful past for a new start , at the very heart of an increasingly united europe .
20 years on , from far away australia , i send you my warmest congratulations on this special day and i wish and hope that germany continues to go from strength to strength . - terry papadis , australia i was 9 years old when the wall came down , so the only things i could clearly remember were the happy people from a fellow european nation celebrating their unity and hope for the future .
nevertheless , that was a powerful message for a young person as myself and i 've never forgotten it .
the fall of the wall and subsequent reunification also meant the end of the cold war and the dream of a peaceful european union , as the one we have today .
for me , germany 's unity symbolizes europe 's unity and the fall of the wall is the most convincing proof that you ca n't divide people with ideological barriers for long . - constantine michailidis , greece compiled by stuart tiffen editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

marine conservation society 's reaction laws allowing the creation of nature reserves at sea and coastal access paths are expected to be passed later .
the house of lords is due to vote on a bill permitting marine conservation zones to be developed around england and wales .
pressure groups want greater protection for rare sea life and more public rights of way to coastal areas .
landowners are worried they may have to pay to maintain the footpaths , while fishermen fear for their livelihoods .
they are concerned about the quality of consultation and want provisions to support the industry and allow continuation of fishing to at least be considered in protected zones .
the government says the marine and coastal access bill will create the first piece of legislation of its kind in the world .
it includes proposals for environmental advisory body natural england to add about 1,400 miles of new or improved coastal paths around the country at a cost of £ 50m .
the aim is to give people access on foot to land all around the english coast , including " spreading room " near the route for outdoor recreation .
however , mps on the commons environment , food and rural affairs committee have said greater formal safeguards are needed to protect affected landowners and occupiers .
meanwhile , it will be two years before any decision is made on where marine conservation zones will be created .
campaigners fear this could result in minimal protection for coastal waters .
similar laws are being prepared separately by the scottish parliament .

marine conservation society 's reaction laws allowing the creation of nature reserves at sea and coastal access paths are expected to be passed later .
the house of lords is due to vote on a bill permitting marine conservation zones to be developed around england and wales .
pressure groups want greater protection for rare sea life and more public rights of way to coastal areas .
landowners are worried they may have to pay to maintain the footpaths , while fishermen fear for their livelihoods .
they are concerned about the quality of consultation and want provisions to support the industry and allow continuation of fishing to at least be considered in protected zones .
the government says the marine and coastal access bill will create the first piece of legislation of its kind in the world .
it includes proposals for environmental advisory body natural england to add about 1,400 miles of new or improved coastal paths around the country at a cost of £ 50m .
the aim is to give people access on foot to land all around the english coast , including " spreading room " near the route for outdoor recreation .
however , mps on the commons environment , food and rural affairs committee have said greater formal safeguards are needed to protect affected landowners and occupiers .
meanwhile , it will be two years before any decision is made on where marine conservation zones will be created .
campaigners fear this could result in minimal protection for coastal waters .
similar laws are being prepared separately by the scottish parliament .

one of the first artefacts that visitors see on entering the pink neoclassical facade of the egyptian museum in cairo is a fake .
" this is a replica of the rosetta stone .
it is the only object in the museum that is not real , " announces a tour guide , his voice echoing through the high-domed hall . "
i 'm not asking for all the artefacts of the british museum to come to egypt " zahi hawass , egyptian supreme council of antiquities " the original is kept in the british museum . "
before leading his group on to the lines of old-fashioned cabinets filled with ancient treasures , he explains the significance of the basalt slab , which dates back to 196bc and was key to the modern decipherment of hieroglyphics .
the actual stone , discovered by french soldiers in 1799 and given to the english under the terms of the treaty of alexandria two years later , is one of the most high-profile items that egypt 's chief archaeologist would like returned .
" i 'm not asking for all the artefacts of the british museum to come to egypt , " says zahi hawass , the secretary general of the egyptian supreme council of antiquities .
" i 'm only asking for the unique cultural objects , " he added , referring to items of great archaeological value , such as the rosetta stone .
' further consideration ' also on his wish list is the 3,500-year-old bust of queen nefertiti , wife of the famous pharaoh akhenaten , on show at the newly re-opened neues museum in berlin , germany .
other items include a statue of hemiunu , the architect of the great pyramid at giza - also in germany ; the bust of anchhaf , builder of the chepren pyramid - at the museum of fine arts in boston ; and a painted zodiac from the dendera temple , which is kept at the louvre .
if they can not be returned permanently , mr hawass would at least like them back on loan for the opening of egypt 's grand museum at giza , due by 2013 .
so far there have been mostly cautious responses .
" a loan request regarding the rosetta stone was received and acknowledged , " says a spokeswoman for the british museum .
" the request currently stands as a matter for further consideration in due course . "
since he became head of the supreme council of antiquities in 2002 , mr hawass claims to have returned 5,000 artefacts to egypt which he says were stolen .
his approach is sometimes aggressive .
his recent dispute with the louvre over pharaonic steles thought to have been chipped from the walls of the 3,200-year-old tomb of the cleric , tetaki , resulted in ties being severed with the museum .
the louvre agreed to hand over the steles within days .
an egyptian delegation is due to collect them on 20 november .
" i 'm really happy that story became very big because this will warn every museum all over the world not to buy stolen artefacts , " says mr hawass .
" that will preserve the heritage not only of egypt , but of whole world . "
' great deed ' thousands of artefacts were spirited out of egypt during the period of colonial rule and afterwards by archaeologists , adventurers and thieves .
according to a 1970 united nations agreement , artefacts are the property of their country of origin and pieces smuggled out must be returned . "
i always say the egyptian people also have the right to see these unique objects " wafaa al-saddiq director , egyptian museum egypt also pursues items taken before that time if it has evidence of illegal practices .
however , the process of determining whether an item has ever been stolen can be laborious and complicated .
a red granite fragment returned last month was an exceptional case .
the metropolitan museum of art bought the piece from an antiques collector in new york so that it could be returned to a shrine in the ptah temple at karnak , near luxor .
egyptian officials called it " a great deed " and expressed hope that other institutions would follow its example .
" i have very mixed and difficult feelings when i go to a museum overseas and see all these wonderful items taken from egypt , " says the director of the egyptian museum , wafaa al-saddiq .
" the objects are giving a good example of egyptian civilisation to people in different countries so that they then come here to see the pyramids and tombs . "
" at the same time , i always say the egyptian people also have the right to see these unique objects , some of which were taken when egypt was under occupation , so my first wish is that they come back , " she adds .

one of the first artefacts that visitors see on entering the pink neoclassical facade of the egyptian museum in cairo is a fake .
" this is a replica of the rosetta stone .
it is the only object in the museum that is not real , " announces a tour guide , his voice echoing through the high-domed hall .
i 'm not asking for all the artefacts of the british museum to come to egypt zahi hawass , egyptian supreme council of antiquities " the original is kept in the british museum . "
before leading his group on to the lines of old-fashioned cabinets filled with ancient treasures , he explains the significance of the basalt slab , which dates back to 196bc and was key to the modern decipherment of hieroglyphics .
the actual stone , discovered by french soldiers in 1799 and given to the english under the terms of the treaty of alexandria two years later , is one of the most high-profile items that egypt 's chief archaeologist would like returned .
" i 'm not asking for all the artefacts of the british museum to come to egypt , " says zahi hawass , the secretary general of the egyptian supreme council of antiquities .
" i 'm only asking for the unique cultural objects , " he added , referring to items of great archaeological value , such as the rosetta stone .
' further consideration ' also on his wish list is the 3,500-year-old bust of queen nefertiti , wife of the famous pharaoh akhenaten , on show at the newly re-opened neues museum in berlin , germany .
other items include a statue of hemiunu , the architect of the great pyramid at giza - also in germany ; the bust of anchhaf , builder of the chepren pyramid - at the museum of fine arts in boston ; and a painted zodiac from the dendera temple , which is kept at the louvre .
the egyptian museum in cairo draws people from around the world if they can not be returned permanently , mr hawass would at least like them back on loan for the opening of egypt 's grand museum at giza , due by 2013 .
so far there have been mostly cautious responses .
" a loan request regarding the rosetta stone was received and acknowledged , " says a spokeswoman for the british museum .
" the request currently stands as a matter for further consideration in due course . "
since he became head of the supreme council of antiquities in 2002 , mr hawass claims to have returned 5,000 artefacts to egypt which he says were stolen .
his approach is sometimes aggressive .
his recent dispute with the louvre over pharaonic steles thought to have been chipped from the walls of the 3,200-year-old tomb of the cleric , tetaki , resulted in ties being severed with the museum .
the louvre agreed to hand over the steles within days .
an egyptian delegation is due to collect them on 20 november .
" i 'm really happy that story became very big because this will warn every museum all over the world not to buy stolen artefacts , " says mr hawass .
" that will preserve the heritage not only of egypt , but of whole world . "
' great deed ' thousands of artefacts were spirited out of egypt during the period of colonial rule and afterwards by archaeologists , adventurers and thieves .
according to a 1970 united nations agreement , artefacts are the property of their country of origin and pieces smuggled out must be returned .
i always say the egyptian people also have the right to see these unique objects wafaa al-saddiq director , egyptian museum egypt also pursues items taken before that time if it has evidence of illegal practices .
however , the process of determining whether an item has ever been stolen can be laborious and complicated .
a red granite fragment returned last month was an exceptional case .
the metropolitan museum of art bought the piece from an antiques collector in new york so that it could be returned to a shrine in the ptah temple at karnak , near luxor .
egyptian officials called it " a great deed " and expressed hope that other institutions would follow its example .
" i have very mixed and difficult feelings when i go to a museum overseas and see all these wonderful items taken from egypt , " says the director of the egyptian museum , wafaa al-saddiq .
" the objects are giving a good example of egyptian civilisation to people in different countries so that they then come here to see the pyramids and tombs . "
" at the same time , i always say the egyptian people also have the right to see these unique objects , some of which were taken when egypt was under occupation , so my first wish is that they come back , " she adds .

one of the first artefacts that visitors see on entering the pink neoclassical facade of the egyptian museum in cairo is a fake .
" this is a replica of the rosetta stone .
it is the only object in the museum that is not real , " announces a tour guide , his voice echoing through the high-domed hall .
i 'm not asking for all the artefacts of the british museum to come to egypt zahi hawass , egyptian supreme council of antiquities " the original is kept in the british museum . "
before leading his group on to the lines of old-fashioned cabinets filled with ancient treasures , he explains the significance of the basalt slab , which dates back to 196bc and was key to the modern decipherment of hieroglyphics .
the actual stone , discovered by french soldiers in 1799 and given to the english under the terms of the treaty of alexandria two years later , is one of the most high-profile items that egypt 's chief archaeologist would like returned .
" i 'm not asking for all the artefacts of the british museum to come to egypt , " says zahi hawass , the secretary general of the egyptian supreme council of antiquities .
" i 'm only asking for the unique cultural objects , " he added , referring to items of great archaeological value , such as the rosetta stone .
' further consideration ' also on his wish list is the 3,500-year-old bust of queen nefertiti , wife of the famous pharaoh akhenaten , on show at the newly re-opened neues museum in berlin , germany .
other items include a statue of hemiunu , the architect of the great pyramid at giza - also in germany ; the bust of anchhaf , builder of the chepren pyramid - at the museum of fine arts in boston ; and a painted zodiac from the dendera temple , which is kept at the louvre .
the egyptian museum in cairo draws people from around the world if they can not be returned permanently , mr hawass would at least like them back on loan for the opening of egypt 's grand museum at giza , due by 2013 .
so far there have been mostly cautious responses .
" a loan request regarding the rosetta stone was received and acknowledged , " says a spokeswoman for the british museum .
" the request currently stands as a matter for further consideration in due course . "
since he became head of the supreme council of antiquities in 2002 , mr hawass claims to have returned 5,000 artefacts to egypt which he says were stolen .
his approach is sometimes aggressive .
his recent dispute with the louvre over pharaonic steles thought to have been chipped from the walls of the 3,200-year-old tomb of the cleric , tetaki , resulted in ties being severed with the museum .
the louvre agreed to hand over the steles within days .
an egyptian delegation is due to collect them on 20 november .
" i 'm really happy that story became very big because this will warn every museum all over the world not to buy stolen artefacts , " says mr hawass .
" that will preserve the heritage not only of egypt , but of whole world . "
' great deed ' thousands of artefacts were spirited out of egypt during the period of colonial rule and afterwards by archaeologists , adventurers and thieves .
according to a 1970 united nations agreement , artefacts are the property of their country of origin and pieces smuggled out must be returned .
i always say the egyptian people also have the right to see these unique objects wafaa al-saddiq director , egyptian museum egypt also pursues items taken before that time if it has evidence of illegal practices .
however , the process of determining whether an item has ever been stolen can be laborious and complicated .
a red granite fragment returned last month was an exceptional case .
the metropolitan museum of art bought the piece from an antiques collector in new york so that it could be returned to a shrine in the ptah temple at karnak , near luxor .
egyptian officials called it " a great deed " and expressed hope that other institutions would follow its example .
" i have very mixed and difficult feelings when i go to a museum overseas and see all these wonderful items taken from egypt , " says the director of the egyptian museum , wafaa al-saddiq .
" the objects are giving a good example of egyptian civilisation to people in different countries so that they then come here to see the pyramids and tombs . "
" at the same time , i always say the egyptian people also have the right to see these unique objects , some of which were taken when egypt was under occupation , so my first wish is that they come back , " she adds .

oxford-educated king george tupou v and a group of hereditary aristocrats control parliament , where less than a third of mps are elected by the public .
according to the bbc correspondent in sydney , phil mercer , the push for reform has been encouraged by the king , who has insisted that he is wholeheartedly committed to democratic government .
many tongans have been demanding a more inclusive political process .
pro-democracy riots in november 2006 were followed by official assurances that islanders would be allowed a greater say in the running of their country .
campaigners have urged the government to implement the reform proposals in full .
teisina fuko , a cabinet minister and president of the people 's democratic party , says tonga is ready to make the changes .
" it is a very new concept .
however , there are -lrb- a -rrb- few parties that have been started informally , like the party that i am president of , the people 's democratic party , " he said .
" we have our own manifesto to be drawn for the next election , and we are going to run it as more like a party system like in other countries , like new zealand and australia , " he said .
reformers hope tonga will be a constitutional monarchy by the time the country goes to polls towards the end of next year .
critics have said that the absolute power of the king has hampered economic and social development in a nation which is dependent on foreign aid and remittances from tongan communities overseas .

cardiff-based tidal energy ltd has planning permission for onshore works and is now seeking consent to place its deltastream device on the seabed .
a year-long trial is due to be held at ramsey sound , near st davids .
the company said its tidal generator , capable of producing enough electricity to light around 1,000 homes , was at the cutting edge of green technology .
invented by pembrokeshire engineer richard ayre , each unit features three generators that sit on a triangular frame .
it is designed to be easily lowered onto and recovered from the seabed using a floating crane .
the company said its distinctive blade design enabled the turbine automatically to shed excess power , permitting consistently high energy conversion .
the device will sit on the seabed at ramsay sound , near st davids planning approval has been granted by pembrokeshire coast national park authority for the onshore works .
the company has now applied to both the uk and welsh assembly governments for consent for the offshore works which include laying a cable and positioning one deltastream device on the seabed .
chris williams , development director of tidal energy , said a " comprehensive " environmental impact assessment had been undertaken .
a public exhibition of the plans is due to be held later this month .
the company is hoping to start the trial in autumn next year .
mr williams said : " the next public exhibition is to update the local community on the project , and particularly to discuss and explain the findings of the environmental assessments .
" areas that have been assessed are far-reaching , ranging from bird life , to mammals , tourism and ecology .
" we invite anyone with an interest in the project to come along and talk with us about the details of the proposed 12-month test . "
the exhibition will be held from 1400 to 1700 gmt on friday , 20 november and 1000 to 1300 gmt on saturday , 21 november at curtis house on bryn road in st davids .

cardiff-based tidal energy ltd has planning permission for onshore works and is now seeking consent to place its deltastream device on the seabed .
a year-long trial is due to be held at ramsey sound , near st davids .
the company said its tidal generator , capable of producing enough electricity to light around 1,000 homes , was at the cutting edge of green technology .
invented by pembrokeshire engineer richard ayre , each unit features three generators that sit on a triangular frame .
it is designed to be easily lowered onto and recovered from the seabed using a floating crane .
the company said its distinctive blade design enabled the turbine automatically to shed excess power , permitting consistently high energy conversion .
planning approval has been granted by pembrokeshire coast national park authority for the onshore works .
the company has now applied to both the uk and welsh assembly governments for consent for the offshore works which include laying a cable and positioning one deltastream device on the seabed .
chris williams , development director of tidal energy , said a " comprehensive " environmental impact assessment had been undertaken .
a public exhibition of the plans is due to be held later this month .
the company is hoping to start the trial in autumn next year .
mr williams said : " the next public exhibition is to update the local community on the project , and particularly to discuss and explain the findings of the environmental assessments .
" areas that have been assessed are far-reaching , ranging from bird life , to mammals , tourism and ecology .
" we invite anyone with an interest in the project to come along and talk with us about the details of the proposed 12-month test . "
the exhibition will be held from 1400 to 1700 gmt on friday , 20 november and 1000 to 1300 gmt on saturday , 21 november at curtis house on bryn road in st davids .

former nhs clinician julia manning says it is time to look at the duplication of roles in the health service . "
the nhs was asked last financial year to start thinking about how to cut £ 10bn from its costs .
as time has gone by that amount has increased to estimates of £ 15bn to £ 20bn required in savings .
this surely has to be one of the most significant motivators for finding efficiency savings in the nhs that the government and nhs management has ever had ?
well , yes and no .
that 's because efficiency savings not only mean using the material resources you have more carefully , but it also means taking a hard-nosed look at duplication of roles , unproductive processes and to put it bluntly , unproductive people .
across all government departments there has been a huge increase in the number of civil servants and the department of health is no exception . "
the single most depressing fact is the waste in the nhs of a huge number of incredibly talented , imaginative , innovative medics and ancillary staff " read your comments this has helped to keep the unemployment figures down and the tax-take up but it seems to have had zero impact on productivity .
likewise in the field , there have been huge increases in the number of backroom staff and managers and management consultants - the independent in august reported an 80 % increase in spending by primary care trusts -lrb- pcts -rrb- over four years on administrative and clerical staff .
michael fallon 's piece on the ' bureaucratic monster ' in the telegraph in october articulated the confusion felt by so many about who is actually running their local health services and who is accountable .
is it the local hospital foundation trust or the community trust or the primary care trust or the social care partnership trust or the strategic health authority ?
so not only is there proliferation but confusion too .
' pool of wisdom ' and as a former nhs clinician i think the single most depressing fact is the waste in the nhs of a huge number of incredibly talented , imaginative , innovative medics and ancillary staff .
their expertise and experience is a significant pool of wisdom which is frequently ignored or dismissed .
and that 's when they feel able to express their opinions ; much of the time they keep quiet , not wanting to receive the wrath of their line manager . "
there are still stifling hierarchies in the nhs which mitigate against true partnership working and which breed mediocrity instead of excellence " the choice can simply be to choose the limited freedoms that they have to carry on looking after patients over the fight for justice and progress .
i met some superb nhs managers in my 17 years of working in the nhs , and they must feel incredibly annoyed when they are ' lumped ' into the general moan about nhs waste and poor management .
and those who have an excellent track record are probably the ones least fearful of the months ahead and most able to harness the wisdom of their clinical peers as they work together as partners .
they 've proved their worth and their trust knows it .
' stifling hierarchies ' for all the talk of ' nhs partnerships ' however this is still the greatest paradox .
partners are equals , able to work together to achieve the best service and outcomes for those they are serving .
there are still stifling hierarchies in the nhs which mitigate against true partnership working and which breed mediocrity instead of excellence .
until we achieve real independence for the trusts who deliver services for the nhs , there will be little incentive for them to streamline in the way that they should .
but just as turkeys do n't vote for christmas , mediocre and superfluous managers wo n't be quick to identify themselves as part of the efficiency savings equation . "

former nhs clinician julia manning says it is time to look at the duplication of roles in the health service .
the nhs was asked last financial year to start thinking about how to cut £ 10bn from its costs .
as time has gone by that amount has increased to estimates of £ 15bn to £ 20bn required in savings .
this surely has to be one of the most significant motivators for finding efficiency savings in the nhs that the government and nhs management has ever had ?
well , yes and no .
that 's because efficiency savings not only mean using the material resources you have more carefully , but it also means taking a hard-nosed look at duplication of roles , unproductive processes and to put it bluntly , unproductive people .
across all government departments there has been a huge increase in the number of civil servants and the department of health is no exception .
the single most depressing fact is the waste in the nhs of a huge number of incredibly talented , imaginative , innovative medics and ancillary staff read your comments this has helped to keep the unemployment figures down and the tax-take up but it seems to have had zero impact on productivity .
likewise in the field , there have been huge increases in the number of backroom staff and managers and management consultants - the independent in august reported an 80 % increase in spending by primary care trusts -lrb- pcts -rrb- over four years on administrative and clerical staff .
michael fallon 's piece on the ' bureaucratic monster ' in the telegraph in october articulated the confusion felt by so many about who is actually running their local health services and who is accountable .
is it the local hospital foundation trust or the community trust or the primary care trust or the social care partnership trust or the strategic health authority ?
so not only is there proliferation but confusion too .
' pool of wisdom ' and as a former nhs clinician i think the single most depressing fact is the waste in the nhs of a huge number of incredibly talented , imaginative , innovative medics and ancillary staff .
their expertise and experience is a significant pool of wisdom which is frequently ignored or dismissed .
and that 's when they feel able to express their opinions ; much of the time they keep quiet , not wanting to receive the wrath of their line manager .
there are still stifling hierarchies in the nhs which mitigate against true partnership working and which breed mediocrity instead of excellence the choice can simply be to choose the limited freedoms that they have to carry on looking after patients over the fight for justice and progress .
i met some superb nhs managers in my 17 years of working in the nhs , and they must feel incredibly annoyed when they are ' lumped ' into the general moan about nhs waste and poor management .
and those who have an excellent track record are probably the ones least fearful of the months ahead and most able to harness the wisdom of their clinical peers as they work together as partners .
they 've proved their worth and their trust knows it .
' stifling hierarchies ' for all the talk of ' nhs partnerships ' however this is still the greatest paradox .
partners are equals , able to work together to achieve the best service and outcomes for those they are serving .
there are still stifling hierarchies in the nhs which mitigate against true partnership working and which breed mediocrity instead of excellence .
until we achieve real independence for the trusts who deliver services for the nhs , there will be little incentive for them to streamline in the way that they should .
but just as turkeys do n't vote for christmas , mediocre and superfluous managers wo n't be quick to identify themselves as part of the efficiency savings equation .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- cut duplication not services in the nhs accessibility help skip to content skip to bbc.co.uk search low graphics help access keys help search term explore the bbc bbc news updated every minute of every day one-minute world news news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health medical notes science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog bbc world service page last updated at 07:31 gmt , wednesday , 11 november 2009 e-mail this to a friend printable version cut duplication not services in the nhs viewpoint julia manning chief executive of independent think tank 2020 health just as turkeys do n't vote for christmas , mediocre and superfluous managers wo n't be quick to identify themselves as the part of the efficiency savings equation the national health service is facing a huge budget shortfall after 2011 .
former nhs clinician julia manning says it is time to look at the duplication of roles in the health service .
the nhs was asked last financial year to start thinking about how to cut £ 10bn from its costs .
as time has gone by that amount has increased to estimates of £ 15bn to £ 20bn required in savings .
this surely has to be one of the most significant motivators for finding efficiency savings in the nhs that the government and nhs management has ever had ?
well , yes and no .
that 's because efficiency savings not only mean using the material resources you have more carefully , but it also means taking a hard-nosed look at duplication of roles , unproductive processes and to put it bluntly , unproductive people .
across all government departments there has been a huge increase in the number of civil servants and the department of health is no exception .
the single most depressing fact is the waste in the nhs of a huge number of incredibly talented , imaginative , innovative medics and ancillary staff read your comments this has helped to keep the unemployment figures down and the tax-take up but it seems to have had zero impact on productivity .
likewise in the field , there have been huge increases in the number of backroom staff and managers and management consultants - the independent in august reported an 80 % increase in spending by primary care trusts -lrb- pcts -rrb- over four years on administrative and clerical staff .
michael fallon 's piece on the ' bureaucratic monster ' in the telegraph in october articulated the confusion felt by so many about who is actually running their local health services and who is accountable .
is it the local hospital foundation trust or the community trust or the primary care trust or the social care partnership trust or the strategic health authority ?
so not only is there proliferation but confusion too .
' pool of wisdom ' and as a former nhs clinician i think the single most depressing fact is the waste in the nhs of a huge number of incredibly talented , imaginative , innovative medics and ancillary staff .
their expertise and experience is a significant pool of wisdom which is frequently ignored or dismissed .
and that 's when they feel able to express their opinions ; much of the time they keep quiet , not wanting to receive the wrath of their line manager .
there are still stifling hierarchies in the nhs which mitigate against true partnership working and which breed mediocrity instead of excellence the choice can simply be to choose the limited freedoms that they have to carry on looking after patients over the fight for justice and progress .
i met some superb nhs managers in my 17 years of working in the nhs , and they must feel incredibly annoyed when they are ' lumped ' into the general moan about nhs waste and poor management .
and those who have an excellent track record are probably the ones least fearful of the months ahead and most able to harness the wisdom of their clinical peers as they work together as partners .
they 've proved their worth and their trust knows it .
' stifling hierarchies ' for all the talk of ' nhs partnerships ' however this is still the greatest paradox .
partners are equals , able to work together to achieve the best service and outcomes for those they are serving .
there are still stifling hierarchies in the nhs which mitigate against true partnership working and which breed mediocrity instead of excellence .
until we achieve real independence for the trusts who deliver services for the nhs , there will be little incentive for them to streamline in the way that they should .
but just as turkeys do n't vote for christmas , mediocre and superfluous managers wo n't be quick to identify themselves as part of the efficiency savings equation .
