in geneva , russia and the united states have resumed talks on renewing their main cold war-era nuclear arms reduction treaty , start i. the talks have been overshadowed by alarm over north korea 's nuclear ambitions . russia and the united states have begun a second round of talks in geneva aimed at devising a follow-on treaty for start i. the strategic arms reduction treaty was signed in 1991 by the former cold war powers to make deep cuts in their own nuclear weapons arsenals .
it expires in december but still leaves the two powers heavily armed . as if to underscore the ever-present need to reign in proliferation , nuclear outsider north korea has been told by southeast asian leaders attending a two-day summit in south korea to cease its " provocative " acts .
pyongyang replied promptly on monday , saying it would " strengthen its nuclear deterrent . "
early last week , north korea defied united nations resolutions by staging an underground nuclear test , its second such detonation since 2006 , and renouncing the armistice that ended the war on the korean peninsula in 1953 .
on friday , the north fired a short-range missile , its sixth in a week , drawing more international condemnation .
south korea says north preparing missile in what could be a further escalation , south korea 's defense ministry says the north has moved a long-range missile to its launch base at dongchang-ri , on north korea 's west coast , near china .
according to south korean media , including the news agency yonghap and the daily newspaper joongang libo , south korean intelligence officials say the taepodong-2 missile is an " intercontinental " rocket that potentially could reach alaska .
they say launch preparations could take one to two more weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea has promised to " strengthen its nuclear deterrent " experts add , however , that north korea has not yet mastered the technology to miniaturize a nuclear warhead to mount on such a missile .
in april , north korea drew strong protests when it test fired a similar long-range rocket in the direction of japan .
visiting manila , us defense secretary robert gates said north korea 's intentions are " not clear . "
gates said he hoped a high-level us talks with china , japan , russia and south korea would help defuse tensions . visiting singapore at the weekend , gates had said pyongyang 's acts could spark an arms race with serious consequences for asia .
geneva start talks behind closed doors the start arms reduction talks in geneva are the second encounter involving us and russian envoys since us president barack obama and his russian counterpart dimitri medvedev met at the g-20 summit in london in april and agreed to strive for further reductions . russian diplomats say the presidents will unveil the first results of the start consultations at their planned summit in moscow in early july .
meantime , both sides have sworn confidentiality .
diplomats close to the geneva talks , spread over three days , say it is being held behind closed doors at russia 's mission .
progress is not expected to be swift .
recent russian-us relations have been troubled by tensions over the pro-western former soviet republic of georgia and russia 's objections to washington 's plan to site a us anti-missile shield in poland and the czech republic , ostensibly to counter a threat from iran .
russian military analyst alexander goltz says the start negotiations will help russia to restore its " status as a world power . " another analyst evgeny volk of the heritage foundation says president obama " needs a result " to demonstrate progress after the ' reset ' in us-russian relations declared early this year by his vice-president joseph biden .
in april while visiting prague , obama underscored his stance by saying his long-term goal was to create a " world without nuclear weapons . "
deep cuts but arsenals still large start i was signed in 1991 – shortly after the fall of europe 's iron curtain - by former us president george h. bush senior and the-then soviet president mikhail gorbachev .
it set up a system of bilateral inspections and stipulated that neither side could deploy more than 6,000 warheads and no more than 1,600 strategic delivery vehicles , including long-rang missiles , submarines and bomber aircraft .
that goal was reached by 2001 , still leaving both powers holding 90 percent of the world 's arsenals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some nuclear submarines have been decommissioned according to the us state department , at the beginning of january the united states had 550 intercontinental ballistic missiles ready for use ; russia had 469 such missiles , but with more warheads per missile .
russia does not publish its own figures .
in terms of warheads , the us said russia held 3,909 devices while the us military had 5,576 .
at the london summit in april , obama and medvedev pointed out that another treaty signed in 2002 , known as sort or the strategic offensive reductions treaty requires each power 's stockpile to be trimmed to a ceiling of between 1,700 - 2,200 nuclear warheads .
unlike start , however , it does not provide for verification systems .
thaw raises hopes for non-proliferation treaty review if a follow-on treaty supercedes start , stipulating further us and russian cuts , it could add fresh impulse to plans to revise the much wider non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- at a united nations review conference next year .
last friday , the permanent security council members , all nuclear powers , including china , france and britain , endorsed a review and an ambitious agenda under an algerian-mediated compromise .
that breakthrough at the long-running 65-member conference on disarmament at the un 's european offices in geneva ended more than a decade of deadlock .
at similar talks in 2005 not even an agenda was agreed. ipj / dpa / reuters / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the european parliament has been directly elected by european citizens for 30 years .
unlike national parliaments , which usually elect their heads of state , the european parliament does not elect a pan-european government .
this is why it has no real majority or opposition parties " the factions and majorities among us form around issues , " klaus haensch , a representative from germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , explained .
hänsch has been a member of the european parliament for 30 years , and was the parliament ’ s president from 1994 to 1997 . unlike other legislative bodies , media scandals and power struggles are not usually a feature of the european parliament .
jacki davis from the european policy center , a brussels-based political think tank , contended that while the parliamentary debates might not always be particularly exciting , the european parliament is very important because its members have a lot of power . the members of the parliament have a say in decisions regarding around 80 percent of all european laws and principles .
an estimated 30 to 50 percent of all laws that affect the eu member states are directly codetermined by the european parliament .
the effects of this legislation on the daily lives of the 500 million eu citizens are significant , even if many voters are not aware of this fact . more rights , but still not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does the parliament have too few rights ? the european parliament is just one of the two chambers of the eu legislative body .
the parliamentarians share power with the council of the european union -lrb- also known as the council of ministers -rrb- , in which the various national governments are represented .
both chambers vote for bills drafted by the european commission .
however , the parliament does not have the power to propose its own laws . " with each treaty - from maastricht to amsterdam to nizza - the parliament has acquired new rights and power over new policy areas , " jacki davis explained . today only agricultural policy , foreign policy , justice policy and the health care system are excluded from the parliament ’ s sphere of power . lots of parlamentarians but little time for member of parliament hans-peter martin , who doesn ’ t belong to any political faction , the parliament still has too few rights .
lobbyists and bureaucrats influence a lot of decisions , he said .
for example , the parliament does not have its own scientific department to thoroughly prepare its members for making certain decisions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it important to participate in eu elections " : hans-peter martin the parliamentarians often rely on the opinions of lobbyists to make up for this lack of scientific briefing .
but despite these shortcomings , it 's still important to vote , martin said .
because after all , the european parliament is the only democratically elected eu institution . in comparison to national parliaments in europe , a single member of the european parliament has less influence .
this is mostly due to the institution 's large size : 785 members from 27 eu member states .
they are divided into seven factions , and these in turn are divided into national groups .
the largest groups are the conservatives , the socialists and the liberals . the number of parliamentarians has increased tenfold since the parliament ’ s establishment in the 1950s .
today there are few opportunites to make big , memorable speeches .

one example of this is that the european parliament is actually based in three different cities : strasbourg , brussels and luxembourg . " i personally think that this parliament , with its 40 weeks of sessions , should not be additionally burdened with this whole traveling circus , " said michael gahler , eu parliamentarian and member of germany 's christian democratic union party -lrb- cdu -rrb- . gahler said he believes that with so many pressing issues , the parliamentarians can not afford to waste time traveling . more seats , more costs , more work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strasbourg is the official seat of the parliament many parliamentarians and eu citizens have the same opinion .
there has been much debate in recent years about whether the european parliament really needs to have three locations .
the official headquarters are in strasbourg , france , but this parliament building is only used 48 days of the year - for plenary sessions .
all other plenary , committee and faction meetings take place in brussels , belgium .
the largest part of the parliament 's administration , the secretariat , is based in luxembourg . " we find this very inconvenient and expensive , " eu parliamentarian wolf klinz said .
moving locations throughout the year costs around 200 million euros -lrb- $ 284 million -rrb- , klinz explained , and does not make the work any easier . " we are in favor of only having a base in brussels , " klinz said .
his party , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- of germany , is demanding the parliament 's complete relocation to brussels , putting a stop to what he also termed a " traveling circus . " a lot of support for the one-location option once a month , all 785 eu parliamentarians and 3,000 staff members travel from brussels to strasbourg for a plenary session , and then back again .
according to critics , this not only drains finances , but also creates 20,000 tons of carbon emissions .
this is why parliament members from various factions started the one seat campaign in 2006 , with the aim of moving all parliament activities to brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo bullmann : " no more separation from brussels " 1.25 million eu citizens have also signed the one seat campaign petition on the internet .
but why brussels rather than strasbourg ? udo bullmann , eu parliamentarian and member of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , explained : " we as the parliament need proximity to the commission and the council .
we can not afford to travel hundreds of kilometers . " strasbourg is not a feasible option because the other political bodies have their seat in brussels , according to bullmann . strasbourg a symbol of european unity but it is not as simple as it sounds .
strasbourg is place of historical importance for europe .
the city symbolizes french-german reconciliation after world war ii and the beginning of european unification .
in 1997 eu member states were united in the decision to make strasbourg the official seat of the parliament .
up until now , all attempts to change this have been stymied by france 's resistance . according to gahler , there should be more public pressure to force france and luxembourg to alter their position on the topic .
" it 's a question of time , but in the future i would like to see the parliament not providing so much room for attacks on itself .
because almost every visitor group that i meet , someone raises this question , and i 'm forced to say that i do n't agree with the current situation . " what will become of strasbourg ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the parliament 's secretariat has its seat in luxembourg however , among european conservatives , michael gahler represents a minority opinion .

and there are many ideas for making up such a move to france . a european university , a european diplomatic academy and a concentration of european jurisdiction are just some of the new possibilities for strasbourg .
however , any changes of this sort require the agreement of all 27 eu member states , including , of course , france and luxembourg . thus there is a good chance that the european parliament will continue to have three locations for some years to come . nina funke-kaiser / ew editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the united states government is set to own 60 percent of the " new gm , " which amounts to an unprecedented level of us government involvement in a large american company .
gm 's bankruptcy is expected to be legally complicated , in particular because of the company 's international reach , which includes german subsidiary opel .
only gm 's us brands were included in monday 's bankruptcy filing .
the us treasury would provide approximately $ 30.1 billion -lrb- 21 billion euros -rrb- in funds .
in exchange , the us government would receive about $ 8.8 billion in preferred stock and debt , and roughly 60 percent equity in the automaker .
in return for their concessions , the united auto workers trade union would be able to select a director to serve on the gm board with no voting rights .
as part of its restructuring , gm would establish the voluntary employee benefits association -lrb- veba -rrb- , a trust that would provide health care benefits for retired uaw workers .
in return the veba trust would receive 17.5 percent of the restructured gm 's equity and will have the right to buy a further two and a half percent .
canadian money canada is also getting involved financially by contributing $ 10 billion dollars and receiving a 12 percent stake in the new gm .
it is also to have a right to select one initial member of the board .
this is on top of the $ 20 billion that has already been given to the struggling automaker since last december .
in return , gm is to eliminate over 30,000 jobs , sell off many of its over a dozen brands , among which are hummer , saab , and saturn .
it is currently looking for a buyer for volvo .
according to officials , the us government is a " reluctant " equity holder and will keep its involvement to a minimum .

south ossetia 's election commission said two other parties won seats .
the people 's party , largely uncritical of kokoity , won 22.5 percent , while the communists took 22.2 percent .
the sidelined opposition did not get enough votes to win seats .
kokoity , a former wrestling champion , is accused by his critics of muzzling opponents and stealing aid money from russia as he tries to cement his hold on power .
a total of 88 polling stations had been set up for the region 's 50,000 residents , as well as additional sites in russia for expatriates and refugees from the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eduard kokoity , right , is looking to cement his grip on power eu : vote ' not acceptable ' georgia has ridiculed the vote , with the country 's reintegration minister , temur iakobashvili , saying the elections were " nothing but clownery , a farce and a redistribution of a criminal power . "
the european union on monday dismissed the poll , calling it " illegitimate . "
a statement , released by the eu presidency in brussels , said the " eu does not accept the legality of the ' elections ' , nor its results . "
" the holding of such elections is illegitimate and represents a setback in the search for a peaceful and lasting settlement of the situation in georgia , " the statement concluded .
russia , which outraged the west by recognizing south ossetia as independent , has been pumping money and arms into the region in the wake of last augusts ' war with georgia .
south ossetia has only been recognized internationally by russia and nicaragua. gb / ap / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the czech communist party parliamentarian used to be an astronaut and took part in a russian space mission in the 1970s .
he was the first man in space from outside the soviet union or united states .
from the soyuz 28 spaceship in 1978 , vladimir remek thanked the central committee of the soviet communist party and comrade leonid brezhnev for giving him the chance to take part in the mission .
thirty-one years later , the former cosmonaut spoke at a communist party election rally in the small czech city of hradec kralové .
the few in attendance were mainly elderly people who fondly remembered the days when remek was a national hero .
" a year after his flight he visited a school where i was the head teacher and spoke to the children , " one woman remembered .
" people came from all around - some walked five kilometers just to see him . "
" he was extremely popular .
but he has always been modest too , so … he 'll get my vote . "

he conceded his huge communist-era fame contributed to his success at the ballot box .
“ i think it definitely played a role , because i can say in all modesty i was known throughout society , " remek said .
" but at the same time i think many people understood that i ’ ve done much more . "
" for instance , i represented czech machinery firms in russia , i was a diplomat in the field of trade at the czechoslovak embassy in moscow , " he explained .
" so i ’ ve achieved more than that space flight .
but it ’ s true that ’ s what made me well known . ”
bringing experience in space to brussels after five years representing the czech republic in brussels and strasbourg , remek can compare life in space and life in the european parliament , in a way few other parlementarians can .
“ in space or any kind of flight cooperation is an absolute given , so that the plane or spacecraft fulfills its mission and lands safely , " remek said .
" there are strict rules .
they exist in the european parliament too , but it ’ s all about discussion . "
" when you fly not every decision is a matter of life and death , " he said .
" in the parliament it is about life in a way , because our decisions affect people ’ s lives . ”

in geneva , russia and the united states have resumed talks on renewing their main cold war-era nuclear arms reduction treaty , start i. the talks have been overshadowed by alarm over north korea 's nuclear ambitions . russia and the united states have begun a second round of talks in geneva aimed at devising a follow-on treaty for start i. the strategic arms reduction treaty was signed in 1991 by the former cold war powers to make deep cuts in their own nuclear weapons arsenals .
it expires in december but still leaves the two powers heavily armed . as if to underscore the ever-present need to reign in proliferation , nuclear outsider north korea has been told by southeast asian leaders attending a two-day summit in south korea to cease its " provocative " acts .
pyongyang replied promptly on monday , saying it would " strengthen its nuclear deterrent . "
early last week , north korea defied united nations resolutions by staging an underground nuclear test , its second such detonation since 2006 , and renouncing the armistice that ended the war on the korean peninsula in 1953 .
on friday , the north fired a short-range missile , its sixth in a week , drawing more international condemnation .
south korea says north preparing missile in what could be a further escalation , south korea 's defense ministry says the north has moved a long-range missile to its launch base at dongchang-ri , on north korea 's west coast , near china .
according to south korean media , including the news agency yonghap and the daily newspaper joongang libo , south korean intelligence officials say the taepodong-2 missile is an " intercontinental " rocket that potentially could reach alaska .
they say launch preparations could take one to two more weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea has promised to " strengthen its nuclear deterrent " experts add , however , that north korea has not yet mastered the technology to miniaturize a nuclear warhead to mount on such a missile .
in april , north korea drew strong protests when it test fired a similar long-range rocket in the direction of japan .
visiting manila , us defense secretary robert gates said north korea 's intentions are " not clear . "
gates said he hoped a high-level us talks with china , japan , russia and south korea would help defuse tensions . visiting singapore at the weekend , gates had said pyongyang 's acts could spark an arms race with serious consequences for asia .
geneva start talks behind closed doors the start arms reduction talks in geneva are the second encounter involving us and russian envoys since us president barack obama and his russian counterpart dimitri medvedev met at the g-20 summit in london in april and agreed to strive for further reductions . russian diplomats say the presidents will unveil the first results of the start consultations at their planned summit in moscow in early july .
meantime , both sides have sworn confidentiality .
diplomats close to the geneva talks , spread over three days , say it is being held behind closed doors at russia 's mission .
progress is not expected to be swift .
recent russian-us relations have been troubled by tensions over the pro-western former soviet republic of georgia and russia 's objections to washington 's plan to site a us anti-missile shield in poland and the czech republic , ostensibly to counter a threat from iran .
russian military analyst alexander goltz says the start negotiations will help russia to restore its " status as a world power . " another analyst evgeny volk of the heritage foundation says president obama " needs a result " to demonstrate progress after the ' reset ' in us-russian relations declared early this year by his vice-president joseph biden .
in april while visiting prague , obama underscored his stance by saying his long-term goal was to create a " world without nuclear weapons . "
deep cuts but arsenals still large start i was signed in 1991 – shortly after the fall of europe 's iron curtain - by former us president george h. bush senior and the-then soviet president mikhail gorbachev .
it set up a system of bilateral inspections and stipulated that neither side could deploy more than 6,000 warheads and no more than 1,600 strategic delivery vehicles , including long-rang missiles , submarines and bomber aircraft .
that goal was reached by 2001 , still leaving both powers holding 90 percent of the world 's arsenals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some nuclear submarines have been decommissioned according to the us state department , at the beginning of january the united states had 550 intercontinental ballistic missiles ready for use ; russia had 469 such missiles , but with more warheads per missile .
russia does not publish its own figures .
in terms of warheads , the us said russia held 3,909 devices while the us military had 5,576 .
at the london summit in april , obama and medvedev pointed out that another treaty signed in 2002 , known as sort or the strategic offensive reductions treaty requires each power 's stockpile to be trimmed to a ceiling of between 1,700 - 2,200 nuclear warheads .
unlike start , however , it does not provide for verification systems .
thaw raises hopes for non-proliferation treaty review if a follow-on treaty supercedes start , stipulating further us and russian cuts , it could add fresh impulse to plans to revise the much wider non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- at a united nations review conference next year .
last friday , the permanent security council members , all nuclear powers , including china , france and britain , endorsed a review and an ambitious agenda under an algerian-mediated compromise .
that breakthrough at the long-running 65-member conference on disarmament at the un 's european offices in geneva ended more than a decade of deadlock .
at similar talks in 2005 not even an agenda was agreed. ipj / dpa / reuters / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this means it is empowered to adopt european laws , directives and regulations .
it can accept , amend , or reject the content of european legislation proposed by the council , or the european commission .
more specifically , it can legislate on issues , such as the free movement of workers , education , market policies and environmental protection .
parliament has only a " consultative " role on judicial issues , foreign policy , taxation , industrial policy and in agricultural affairs , but eu member states are not bound to follow the parliament 's opinion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parliament only plays a consultative role on issues like turkey 's bid to join the eu the european parliament , however , does have a power of political initiative .
it can ask the commission to present legislative proposals for laws on particular issues .
budgetary powers : the european parliament and the council of the european union together constitute the eu 's budgetary authority , which decides each year on its expenditures and revenues .
in the case of " compulsory expenditures " , related to international agreements and agriculture , it is the council that has the last word .
in the case of " non-compulsory expenditures " , parliament decides in close collaboration with the council .
these include areas such as rural development , infrastructure and research .
parliament also monitors how the eu 's executive , the european commission , implements the budget .
oversight powers : the european parliament has major supervisory powers over the activities of the european union .
it can take the commission or the council to the european court , if it believes they have broken eu law .
it can also launch inquiries into alleged breaches of eu law in individual member states .

the president , vice-president and the executive board of the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- can not be appointed by the council until the european parliament has given its consent .
the ecb also presents its annual report to parliament in a plenary session .
parliament can also veto the appointment of a commission president and can even veto an entire commission , if it feels that any one member is unacceptable , although it can not reject that member alone .
it also has the right to fire the commission .
future role : if the eu 's stalled lisbon treaty is finally agreed on by all 27-member states , the eu parliament will gain powers over the entire eu budget , many areas of justice policy , and the appointment of the high representative , the eu 's top diplomat. gb / eup / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there has been much debate in recent years about whether the european parliament really needs to have three locations .
the official headquarters are in strasbourg , france , but this parliament building is only used 48 days of the year - for plenary sessions .
all other plenary , committee and faction meetings take place in brussels , belgium .

strasbourg is place of historical importance for europe .
the city symbolizes french-german reconciliation after world war ii and the beginning of european unification .
in 1997 eu member states were united in the decision to make strasbourg the official seat of the parliament .
up until now , all attempts to change this have been stymied by france 's resistance . according to gahler , there should be more public pressure to force france and luxembourg to alter their position on the topic .

one example of this is that the european parliament is actually based in three different cities : strasbourg , brussels and luxembourg . " i personally think that this parliament , with its 40 weeks of sessions , should not be additionally burdened with this whole traveling circus , " said michael gahler , eu parliamentarian and member of germany 's christian democratic union party -lrb- cdu -rrb- . gahler said he believes that with so many pressing issues , the parliamentarians can not afford to waste time traveling . more seats , more costs , more work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strasbourg is the official seat of the parliament many parliamentarians and eu citizens have the same opinion .
there has been much debate in recent years about whether the european parliament really needs to have three locations .
the official headquarters are in strasbourg , france , but this parliament building is only used 48 days of the year - for plenary sessions .
all other plenary , committee and faction meetings take place in brussels , belgium .
the largest part of the parliament 's administration , the secretariat , is based in luxembourg . " we find this very inconvenient and expensive , " eu parliamentarian wolf klinz said .
moving locations throughout the year costs around 200 million euros -lrb- $ 284 million -rrb- , klinz explained , and does not make the work any easier . " we are in favor of only having a base in brussels , " klinz said .
his party , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- of germany , is demanding the parliament 's complete relocation to brussels , putting a stop to what he also termed a " traveling circus . " a lot of support for the one-location option once a month , all 785 eu parliamentarians and 3,000 staff members travel from brussels to strasbourg for a plenary session , and then back again .
according to critics , this not only drains finances , but also creates 20,000 tons of carbon emissions .
this is why parliament members from various factions started the one seat campaign in 2006 , with the aim of moving all parliament activities to brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo bullmann : " no more separation from brussels " 1.25 million eu citizens have also signed the one seat campaign petition on the internet .
but why brussels rather than strasbourg ? udo bullmann , eu parliamentarian and member of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , explained : " we as the parliament need proximity to the commission and the council .
we can not afford to travel hundreds of kilometers . " strasbourg is not a feasible option because the other political bodies have their seat in brussels , according to bullmann . strasbourg a symbol of european unity but it is not as simple as it sounds .
strasbourg is place of historical importance for europe .
the city symbolizes french-german reconciliation after world war ii and the beginning of european unification .
in 1997 eu member states were united in the decision to make strasbourg the official seat of the parliament .
up until now , all attempts to change this have been stymied by france 's resistance . according to gahler , there should be more public pressure to force france and luxembourg to alter their position on the topic .
" it 's a question of time , but in the future i would like to see the parliament not providing so much room for attacks on itself .
because almost every visitor group that i meet , someone raises this question , and i 'm forced to say that i do n't agree with the current situation . " what will become of strasbourg ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the parliament 's secretariat has its seat in luxembourg however , among european conservatives , michael gahler represents a minority opinion .
on the french side there is great concern about losing something meaningful if the eu parliament were not officially based in strasbourg . but the council of europe and the european court of human rights , both important , non-eu , international bodies , would still remain in strasbourg .
and there are many ideas for making up such a move to france . a european university , a european diplomatic academy and a concentration of european jurisdiction are just some of the new possibilities for strasbourg .
however , any changes of this sort require the agreement of all 27 eu member states , including , of course , france and luxembourg . thus there is a good chance that the european parliament will continue to have three locations for some years to come . nina funke-kaiser / ew editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 01.06.2009 general motors enters bankruptcy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm 's bankruptcy is the biggest industrial collapse in us history american car giant general motors on monday filed for bankruptcy protection in a move that will see the us government take a 60 percent stake in the company and the likely loss of 20,000 us jobs . backed by the us government , the move marks the biggest industrial collapse in america and the bankruptcy filing is the third-largest in us history .
gm is now the second of the " big three " us carmakers to enter bankruptcy protection , following chrysler 's lead .
gm 's bankruptcy is expected to be legally complicated , in particular because of the company 's international reach , which includes german subsidiary opel and the uk 's vauxhall brand .
vauxhall and opel are in the process of being sold off to canadian-austrian auto parts manufacturer magna and a russian partner , with the aid of the german government .
only gm 's us brands were included in monday 's bankruptcy filing .
the us government is expected to take a 60 percent stake in the carmaker which has struggled with years of heavy losses .
washington will also pump in an additional $ 30 billion -lrb- 21 billion euros -rrb- to help restructure the 100-year-old automaker .
canada 's government will also contribute another $ 10 billion and take a 12-percent stake in gm gm , which had already received $ 20 billion of emergency loans since the end of last year , said in its bankruptcy filing that its current debts total $ 173 billion .
" tough but fair move " us president barack obama said on monday he was confident general motors corp would emerge quickly from bankruptcy , saying the government is in a reluctant position as a controlling shareholder and that he had no interest in running the company .
" i am absolutely confident that if well managed , a new gm will emerge that can ... out-compete automakers around the world and that can once again be an integral part of america 's economic future , " obama said in remarks at the white house .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has described the government as a " reluctant shareholder " in gm president barack obama described the move as " tough " but said it was " also fair " and added it would " give this iconic american company a chance to rise again . "
the president also promised a hands-off approach , saying the carmaker - and not his administration - would be responsible for decisions on the day-to-day running of the company .
" a new chapter " gm chief executive fritz henderson called it a " difficult but very important day " and appealed to customers to " give us another chance . "
he promised a speedy bankruptcy process that will allow the carmaker to take the necessary steps to reinvent itself .
" we 'll do it right and we will do it once , " henderson said at a press conference .
" this is not the end of general motors but the start of a new chapter . "
it is expected that gm may be able to exit bankruptcy protection in between 60 and 90 days .
on the same day that gm filed for bankruptcy , a bankruptcy judge approved the sale of chrysler 's best assets into a new company to be managed by italian carmaker fiat .
" a sacrifice for the next generation " the restructuring is expected to produce a drastically leaner gm .
some 20,000 us workers are thought likely to lose their jobs as the firm streamlines its operations .
it currently has 173,000 employees across the us , canada and mexico .
gm also plans to close three service and parts operations .
president obama made an appeal to workers who are set to lose their jobs . bildunterschrift : the german government is trying hard to save jobs at gm 's european subsidiary opel " i know you 've already seen more than your fair share of hard times , " he said .
" i want you to know that what you 're doing is making a sacrifice for the next generation - a sacrifice you may not have chosen to make , but a sacrifice that you are nevertheless called to make so that your children and all of our children can grow up in an america that still makes things . "
as part of its restructuring , gm would establish the voluntary employee benefits association -lrb- veba -rrb- , a trust that would provide health care benefits for retired workers of united auto workers union .
in return the veba trust would receive 17.5 percent of the restructured gm 's equity and will have the right to buy a further two and a half percent. sp / reuters / ap / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the united states government is set to own 60 percent of the " new gm , " which amounts to an unprecedented level of us government involvement in a large american company .
gm 's bankruptcy is expected to be legally complicated , in particular because of the company 's international reach , which includes german subsidiary opel .
only gm 's us brands were included in monday 's bankruptcy filing .
the us treasury would provide approximately $ 30.1 billion -lrb- 21 billion euros -rrb- in funds .
in exchange , the us government would receive about $ 8.8 billion in preferred stock and debt , and roughly 60 percent equity in the automaker .
in return for their concessions , the united auto workers trade union would be able to select a director to serve on the gm board with no voting rights .
as part of its restructuring , gm would establish the voluntary employee benefits association -lrb- veba -rrb- , a trust that would provide health care benefits for retired uaw workers .
in return the veba trust would receive 17.5 percent of the restructured gm 's equity and will have the right to buy a further two and a half percent .
canadian money canada is also getting involved financially by contributing $ 10 billion dollars and receiving a 12 percent stake in the new gm .
it is also to have a right to select one initial member of the board .
this is on top of the $ 20 billion that has already been given to the struggling automaker since last december .
in return , gm is to eliminate over 30,000 jobs , sell off many of its over a dozen brands , among which are hummer , saab , and saturn .

gm is now the second of the " big three " us carmakers to enter bankruptcy protection , following chrysler 's lead .
gm 's bankruptcy is expected to be legally complicated , in particular because of the company 's international reach , which includes german subsidiary opel and the uk 's vauxhall brand .
vauxhall and opel are in the process of being sold off to canadian-austrian auto parts manufacturer magna and a russian partner , with the aid of the german government .
only gm 's us brands were included in monday 's bankruptcy filing .
the us government is expected to take a 60 percent stake in the carmaker which has struggled with years of heavy losses .
washington will also pump in an additional $ 30 billion -lrb- 21 billion euros -rrb- to help restructure the 100-year-old automaker .
canada 's government will also contribute another $ 10 billion and take a 12-percent stake in gm gm , which had already received $ 20 billion of emergency loans since the end of last year , said in its bankruptcy filing that its current debts total $ 173 billion .
" tough but fair move " us president barack obama said on monday he was confident general motors corp would emerge quickly from bankruptcy , saying the government is in a reluctant position as a controlling shareholder and that he had no interest in running the company .
" i am absolutely confident that if well managed , a new gm will emerge that can ... out-compete automakers around the world and that can once again be an integral part of america 's economic future , " obama said in remarks at the white house .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has described the government as a " reluctant shareholder " in gm president barack obama described the move as " tough " but said it was " also fair " and added it would " give this iconic american company a chance to rise again . "
the president also promised a hands-off approach , saying the carmaker - and not his administration - would be responsible for decisions on the day-to-day running of the company .
" a new chapter " gm chief executive fritz henderson called it a " difficult but very important day " and appealed to customers to " give us another chance . "
he promised a speedy bankruptcy process that will allow the carmaker to take the necessary steps to reinvent itself .
" we 'll do it right and we will do it once , " henderson said at a press conference .
" this is not the end of general motors but the start of a new chapter . "
it is expected that gm may be able to exit bankruptcy protection in between 60 and 90 days .
on the same day that gm filed for bankruptcy , a bankruptcy judge approved the sale of chrysler 's best assets into a new company to be managed by italian carmaker fiat .
" a sacrifice for the next generation " the restructuring is expected to produce a drastically leaner gm .
some 20,000 us workers are thought likely to lose their jobs as the firm streamlines its operations .
it currently has 173,000 employees across the us , canada and mexico .
gm also plans to close three service and parts operations .
president obama made an appeal to workers who are set to lose their jobs . bildunterschrift : the german government is trying hard to save jobs at gm 's european subsidiary opel " i know you 've already seen more than your fair share of hard times , " he said .
" i want you to know that what you 're doing is making a sacrifice for the next generation - a sacrifice you may not have chosen to make , but a sacrifice that you are nevertheless called to make so that your children and all of our children can grow up in an america that still makes things . "
as part of its restructuring , gm would establish the voluntary employee benefits association -lrb- veba -rrb- , a trust that would provide health care benefits for retired workers of united auto workers union .
in return the veba trust would receive 17.5 percent of the restructured gm 's equity and will have the right to buy a further two and a half percent. sp / reuters / ap / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i want you to know that what you 're doing is making a sacrifice for the next generation - a sacrifice you may not have chosen to make , but a sacrifice that you are nevertheless called to make so that your children and all of our children can grow up in an america that still makes things . "
as part of its restructuring , gm would establish the voluntary employee benefits association -lrb- veba -rrb- , a trust that would provide health care benefits for retired workers of united auto workers union .
in return the veba trust would receive 17.5 percent of the restructured gm 's equity and will have the right to buy a further two and a half percent. sp / reuters / ap / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the european parliament has been directly elected by european citizens for 30 years .
unlike national parliaments , which usually elect their heads of state , the european parliament does not elect a pan-european government .
this is why it has no real majority or opposition parties " the factions and majorities among us form around issues , " klaus haensch , a representative from germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , explained .
hänsch has been a member of the european parliament for 30 years , and was the parliament ’ s president from 1994 to 1997 . unlike other legislative bodies , media scandals and power struggles are not usually a feature of the european parliament .
jacki davis from the european policy center , a brussels-based political think tank , contended that while the parliamentary debates might not always be particularly exciting , the european parliament is very important because its members have a lot of power . the members of the parliament have a say in decisions regarding around 80 percent of all european laws and principles .
an estimated 30 to 50 percent of all laws that affect the eu member states are directly codetermined by the european parliament .
the effects of this legislation on the daily lives of the 500 million eu citizens are significant , even if many voters are not aware of this fact . more rights , but still not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does the parliament have too few rights ? the european parliament is just one of the two chambers of the eu legislative body .
the parliamentarians share power with the council of the european union -lrb- also known as the council of ministers -rrb- , in which the various national governments are represented .
both chambers vote for bills drafted by the european commission .
however , the parliament does not have the power to propose its own laws . " with each treaty - from maastricht to amsterdam to nizza - the parliament has acquired new rights and power over new policy areas , " jacki davis explained . today only agricultural policy , foreign policy , justice policy and the health care system are excluded from the parliament ’ s sphere of power . lots of parlamentarians but little time for member of parliament hans-peter martin , who doesn ’ t belong to any political faction , the parliament still has too few rights .
lobbyists and bureaucrats influence a lot of decisions , he said .
for example , the parliament does not have its own scientific department to thoroughly prepare its members for making certain decisions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it important to participate in eu elections " : hans-peter martin the parliamentarians often rely on the opinions of lobbyists to make up for this lack of scientific briefing .
but despite these shortcomings , it 's still important to vote , martin said .
because after all , the european parliament is the only democratically elected eu institution . in comparison to national parliaments in europe , a single member of the european parliament has less influence .
this is mostly due to the institution 's large size : 785 members from 27 eu member states .
they are divided into seven factions , and these in turn are divided into national groups .
the largest groups are the conservatives , the socialists and the liberals . the number of parliamentarians has increased tenfold since the parliament ’ s establishment in the 1950s .
today there are few opportunites to make big , memorable speeches .
in fact , their speaking time in debates is usually limited to just one minute . bernd riegert / euranet / ew editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

jacki davis from the european policy center , a brussels-based political think tank , contended that while the parliamentary debates might not always be particularly exciting , the european parliament is very important because its members have a lot of power . the members of the parliament have a say in decisions regarding around 80 percent of all european laws and principles .
an estimated 30 to 50 percent of all laws that affect the eu member states are directly codetermined by the european parliament .
the effects of this legislation on the daily lives of the 500 million eu citizens are significant , even if many voters are not aware of this fact . more rights , but still not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does the parliament have too few rights ? the european parliament is just one of the two chambers of the eu legislative body .
the parliamentarians share power with the council of the european union -lrb- also known as the council of ministers -rrb- , in which the various national governments are represented .
both chambers vote for bills drafted by the european commission .
however , the parliament does not have the power to propose its own laws . " with each treaty - from maastricht to amsterdam to nizza - the parliament has acquired new rights and power over new policy areas , " jacki davis explained . today only agricultural policy , foreign policy , justice policy and the health care system are excluded from the parliament ’ s sphere of power . lots of parlamentarians but little time for member of parliament hans-peter martin , who doesn ’ t belong to any political faction , the parliament still has too few rights .
lobbyists and bureaucrats influence a lot of decisions , he said .
for example , the parliament does not have its own scientific department to thoroughly prepare its members for making certain decisions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it important to participate in eu elections " : hans-peter martin the parliamentarians often rely on the opinions of lobbyists to make up for this lack of scientific briefing .
but despite these shortcomings , it 's still important to vote , martin said .
because after all , the european parliament is the only democratically elected eu institution . in comparison to national parliaments in europe , a single member of the european parliament has less influence .
this is mostly due to the institution 's large size : 785 members from 27 eu member states .
they are divided into seven factions , and these in turn are divided into national groups .
the largest groups are the conservatives , the socialists and the liberals . the number of parliamentarians has increased tenfold since the parliament ’ s establishment in the 1950s .

despite its growing influence , the number of voters has been sinking since the first eu elections in 1979 . the first european union election took place 30 years ago and 63 percent of the eligible voters showed up to have their voices heard .
since then , the european parliament has been one of the eu ’ s major political institutions .
while the council of the european union is made up of various ministers of the member states and the european commission 's members are appointed by the european council , the european parliament is the only directly elected body , giving citizens a chance to influence european politics . 30 years ago , the parliament played a mostly advisory role .
the council was obliged to acknowledge the parliament ’ s opinion in important matters , but was not forced to accept it .
even then , however , some parts of the budget required the approval of parliament . since then , the parliament ’ s authority has steadily increased , but the voter turnout at eu elections has plummeted .
at the last election in 2004 it stood at just 45.6 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 01.06.2009 general motors enters bankruptcy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm 's bankruptcy is the biggest industrial collapse in us history american car giant general motors on monday filed for bankruptcy protection in a move that will see the us government take a 60 percent stake in the company and the likely loss of 20,000 us jobs . backed by the us government , the move marks the biggest industrial collapse in america and the bankruptcy filing is the third-largest in us history .
gm is now the second of the " big three " us carmakers to enter bankruptcy protection , following chrysler 's lead .
gm 's bankruptcy is expected to be legally complicated , in particular because of the company 's international reach , which includes german subsidiary opel and the uk 's vauxhall brand .
vauxhall and opel are in the process of being sold off to canadian-austrian auto parts manufacturer magna and a russian partner , with the aid of the german government .
only gm 's us brands were included in monday 's bankruptcy filing .
the us government is expected to take a 60 percent stake in the carmaker which has struggled with years of heavy losses .
washington will also pump in an additional $ 30 billion -lrb- 21 billion euros -rrb- to help restructure the 100-year-old automaker .
canada 's government will also contribute another $ 10 billion and take a 12-percent stake in gm gm , which had already received $ 20 billion of emergency loans since the end of last year , said in its bankruptcy filing that its current debts total $ 173 billion .
" tough but fair move " us president barack obama said on monday he was confident general motors corp would emerge quickly from bankruptcy , saying the government is in a reluctant position as a controlling shareholder and that he had no interest in running the company .
" i am absolutely confident that if well managed , a new gm will emerge that can ... out-compete automakers around the world and that can once again be an integral part of america 's economic future , " obama said in remarks at the white house .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has described the government as a " reluctant shareholder " in gm president barack obama described the move as " tough " but said it was " also fair " and added it would " give this iconic american company a chance to rise again . "
the president also promised a hands-off approach , saying the carmaker - and not his administration - would be responsible for decisions on the day-to-day running of the company .
" a new chapter " gm chief executive fritz henderson called it a " difficult but very important day " and appealed to customers to " give us another chance . "
he promised a speedy bankruptcy process that will allow the carmaker to take the necessary steps to reinvent itself .
" we 'll do it right and we will do it once , " henderson said at a press conference .
" this is not the end of general motors but the start of a new chapter . "
it is expected that gm may be able to exit bankruptcy protection in between 60 and 90 days .
on the same day that gm filed for bankruptcy , a bankruptcy judge approved the sale of chrysler 's best assets into a new company to be managed by italian carmaker fiat .
" a sacrifice for the next generation " the restructuring is expected to produce a drastically leaner gm .
some 20,000 us workers are thought likely to lose their jobs as the firm streamlines its operations .
it currently has 173,000 employees across the us , canada and mexico .
gm also plans to close three service and parts operations .
president obama made an appeal to workers who are set to lose their jobs . bildunterschrift : the german government is trying hard to save jobs at gm 's european subsidiary opel " i know you 've already seen more than your fair share of hard times , " he said .
" i want you to know that what you 're doing is making a sacrifice for the next generation - a sacrifice you may not have chosen to make , but a sacrifice that you are nevertheless called to make so that your children and all of our children can grow up in an america that still makes things . "
as part of its restructuring , gm would establish the voluntary employee benefits association -lrb- veba -rrb- , a trust that would provide health care benefits for retired workers of united auto workers union .
in return the veba trust would receive 17.5 percent of the restructured gm 's equity and will have the right to buy a further two and a half percent. sp / reuters / ap / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

austria 's far-right freedom party has plunged austrian politics into an uproar . one freedom party campaing poster reads " abendland in christenhand " - or europe in christian hands - the implication being that the eu has allowed too many muslims to enter europe .
another freedom party election ad in a tabloid newspaper promises to veto the eu membership of israel and turkey to avoid getting sucked into what is described as " the bloody middle east crisis . " that 's been interpreted by some as anti-semitic as well as anti-islam .
israel is not a candidate to become an eu member . austrian president heinz fischer responded by saying that religion and politics should not mix , though popular sentiment is that he waited too long to get involved . public outcry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these freedom party posters imply that judgment day is coming senior figures in the catholic church and the muslim community are also outraged .
catholic theologian and author hubert feichtelbauer fears that freedom party leader heinz christian strache may be tapping into religious prejudices . " in their hearts they did n't feel very upset about this , " feichtelbauer said of those who are not outraged by the campaign tactics .

in geneva , russia and the united states have resumed talks on renewing their main cold war-era nuclear arms reduction treaty , start i. the talks have been overshadowed by alarm over north korea 's nuclear ambitions . russia and the united states have begun a second round of talks in geneva aimed at devising a follow-on treaty for start i. the strategic arms reduction treaty was signed in 1991 by the former cold war powers to make deep cuts in their own nuclear weapons arsenals .
it expires in december but still leaves the two powers heavily armed . as if to underscore the ever-present need to reign in proliferation , nuclear outsider north korea has been told by southeast asian leaders attending a two-day summit in south korea to cease its " provocative " acts .
pyongyang replied promptly on monday , saying it would " strengthen its nuclear deterrent . "

the czech communist party parliamentarian used to be an astronaut and took part in a russian space mission in the 1970s .
he was the first man in space from outside the soviet union or united states .
from the soyuz 28 spaceship in 1978 , vladimir remek thanked the central committee of the soviet communist party and comrade leonid brezhnev for giving him the chance to take part in the mission .
thirty-one years later , the former cosmonaut spoke at a communist party election rally in the small czech city of hradec kralové .
the few in attendance were mainly elderly people who fondly remembered the days when remek was a national hero .
" a year after his flight he visited a school where i was the head teacher and spoke to the children , " one woman remembered .
" people came from all around - some walked five kilometers just to see him . "
" he was extremely popular .
but he has always been modest too , so … he 'll get my vote . "

he conceded his huge communist-era fame contributed to his success at the ballot box .
“ i think it definitely played a role , because i can say in all modesty i was known throughout society , " remek said .
" but at the same time i think many people understood that i ’ ve done much more . "
" for instance , i represented czech machinery firms in russia , i was a diplomat in the field of trade at the czechoslovak embassy in moscow , " he explained .
" so i ’ ve achieved more than that space flight .
but it ’ s true that ’ s what made me well known . ”
bringing experience in space to brussels after five years representing the czech republic in brussels and strasbourg , remek can compare life in space and life in the european parliament , in a way few other parlementarians can .
“ in space or any kind of flight cooperation is an absolute given , so that the plane or spacecraft fulfills its mission and lands safely , " remek said .
" there are strict rules .
they exist in the european parliament too , but it ’ s all about discussion . "
" when you fly not every decision is a matter of life and death , " he said .
" in the parliament it is about life in a way , because our decisions affect people ’ s lives . ”
vladimir remek isn ’ t the only former astronaut in the european parliament .

" the european parliament has been directly elected by european citizens for 30 years .
unlike national parliaments , which usually elect their heads of state , the european parliament does not elect a pan-european government .
this is why it has no real majority or opposition parties " the factions and majorities among us form around issues , " klaus haensch , a representative from germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , explained .
hänsch has been a member of the european parliament for 30 years , and was the parliament ’ s president from 1994 to 1997 . unlike other legislative bodies , media scandals and power struggles are not usually a feature of the european parliament .
jacki davis from the european policy center , a brussels-based political think tank , contended that while the parliamentary debates might not always be particularly exciting , the european parliament is very important because its members have a lot of power . the members of the parliament have a say in decisions regarding around 80 percent of all european laws and principles .
an estimated 30 to 50 percent of all laws that affect the eu member states are directly codetermined by the european parliament .
the effects of this legislation on the daily lives of the 500 million eu citizens are significant , even if many voters are not aware of this fact . more rights , but still not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does the parliament have too few rights ? the european parliament is just one of the two chambers of the eu legislative body .
the parliamentarians share power with the council of the european union -lrb- also known as the council of ministers -rrb- , in which the various national governments are represented .
both chambers vote for bills drafted by the european commission .
however , the parliament does not have the power to propose its own laws . " with each treaty - from maastricht to amsterdam to nizza - the parliament has acquired new rights and power over new policy areas , " jacki davis explained . today only agricultural policy , foreign policy , justice policy and the health care system are excluded from the parliament ’ s sphere of power . lots of parlamentarians but little time for member of parliament hans-peter martin , who doesn ’ t belong to any political faction , the parliament still has too few rights .
lobbyists and bureaucrats influence a lot of decisions , he said .
for example , the parliament does not have its own scientific department to thoroughly prepare its members for making certain decisions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it important to participate in eu elections " : hans-peter martin the parliamentarians often rely on the opinions of lobbyists to make up for this lack of scientific briefing .
but despite these shortcomings , it 's still important to vote , martin said .
because after all , the european parliament is the only democratically elected eu institution . in comparison to national parliaments in europe , a single member of the european parliament has less influence .
this is mostly due to the institution 's large size : 785 members from 27 eu member states .
they are divided into seven factions , and these in turn are divided into national groups .
the largest groups are the conservatives , the socialists and the liberals . the number of parliamentarians has increased tenfold since the parliament ’ s establishment in the 1950s .
today there are few opportunites to make big , memorable speeches .
in fact , their speaking time in debates is usually limited to just one minute . bernd riegert / euranet / ew editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the european parliament has been directly elected by european citizens for 30 years .
unlike national parliaments , which usually elect their heads of state , the european parliament does not elect a pan-european government .
this is why it has no real majority or opposition parties " the factions and majorities among us form around issues , " klaus haensch , a representative from germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , explained .
hänsch has been a member of the european parliament for 30 years , and was the parliament ’ s president from 1994 to 1997 . unlike other legislative bodies , media scandals and power struggles are not usually a feature of the european parliament .
jacki davis from the european policy center , a brussels-based political think tank , contended that while the parliamentary debates might not always be particularly exciting , the european parliament is very important because its members have a lot of power . the members of the parliament have a say in decisions regarding around 80 percent of all european laws and principles .
an estimated 30 to 50 percent of all laws that affect the eu member states are directly codetermined by the european parliament .
the effects of this legislation on the daily lives of the 500 million eu citizens are significant , even if many voters are not aware of this fact . more rights , but still not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does the parliament have too few rights ? the european parliament is just one of the two chambers of the eu legislative body .
the parliamentarians share power with the council of the european union -lrb- also known as the council of ministers -rrb- , in which the various national governments are represented .
both chambers vote for bills drafted by the european commission .
however , the parliament does not have the power to propose its own laws . " with each treaty - from maastricht to amsterdam to nizza - the parliament has acquired new rights and power over new policy areas , " jacki davis explained . today only agricultural policy , foreign policy , justice policy and the health care system are excluded from the parliament ’ s sphere of power . lots of parlamentarians but little time for member of parliament hans-peter martin , who doesn ’ t belong to any political faction , the parliament still has too few rights .
lobbyists and bureaucrats influence a lot of decisions , he said .
for example , the parliament does not have its own scientific department to thoroughly prepare its members for making certain decisions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it important to participate in eu elections " : hans-peter martin the parliamentarians often rely on the opinions of lobbyists to make up for this lack of scientific briefing .
but despite these shortcomings , it 's still important to vote , martin said .
because after all , the european parliament is the only democratically elected eu institution . in comparison to national parliaments in europe , a single member of the european parliament has less influence .
this is mostly due to the institution 's large size : 785 members from 27 eu member states .
they are divided into seven factions , and these in turn are divided into national groups .
the largest groups are the conservatives , the socialists and the liberals . the number of parliamentarians has increased tenfold since the parliament ’ s establishment in the 1950s .
today there are few opportunites to make big , memorable speeches .
in fact , their speaking time in debates is usually limited to just one minute . bernd riegert / euranet / ew editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one example of this is that the european parliament is actually based in three different cities : strasbourg , brussels and luxembourg . " i personally think that this parliament , with its 40 weeks of sessions , should not be additionally burdened with this whole traveling circus , " said michael gahler , eu parliamentarian and member of germany 's christian democratic union party -lrb- cdu -rrb- . gahler said he believes that with so many pressing issues , the parliamentarians can not afford to waste time traveling . more seats , more costs , more work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strasbourg is the official seat of the parliament many parliamentarians and eu citizens have the same opinion .
there has been much debate in recent years about whether the european parliament really needs to have three locations .
the official headquarters are in strasbourg , france , but this parliament building is only used 48 days of the year - for plenary sessions .
all other plenary , committee and faction meetings take place in brussels , belgium .
the largest part of the parliament 's administration , the secretariat , is based in luxembourg . " we find this very inconvenient and expensive , " eu parliamentarian wolf klinz said .
moving locations throughout the year costs around 200 million euros -lrb- $ 284 million -rrb- , klinz explained , and does not make the work any easier . " we are in favor of only having a base in brussels , " klinz said .
his party , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- of germany , is demanding the parliament 's complete relocation to brussels , putting a stop to what he also termed a " traveling circus . " a lot of support for the one-location option once a month , all 785 eu parliamentarians and 3,000 staff members travel from brussels to strasbourg for a plenary session , and then back again .
according to critics , this not only drains finances , but also creates 20,000 tons of carbon emissions .
this is why parliament members from various factions started the one seat campaign in 2006 , with the aim of moving all parliament activities to brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo bullmann : " no more separation from brussels " 1.25 million eu citizens have also signed the one seat campaign petition on the internet .

we can not afford to travel hundreds of kilometers . " strasbourg is not a feasible option because the other political bodies have their seat in brussels , according to bullmann . strasbourg a symbol of european unity but it is not as simple as it sounds .
strasbourg is place of historical importance for europe .
the city symbolizes french-german reconciliation after world war ii and the beginning of european unification .
in 1997 eu member states were united in the decision to make strasbourg the official seat of the parliament .
up until now , all attempts to change this have been stymied by france 's resistance . according to gahler , there should be more public pressure to force france and luxembourg to alter their position on the topic .
" it 's a question of time , but in the future i would like to see the parliament not providing so much room for attacks on itself .

"

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 01.06.2009 general motors files for bankruptcy protection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm is headed towards bankruptcy general motor 's bankruptcy filing is the third-largest in us history and ushers in a new era of government ownership . now that gm has won concessions from trade unions , and backing from its creditors , it will begin the restructuring process .
the united states government is set to own 60 percent of the " new gm , " which amounts to an unprecedented level of us government involvement in a large american company .
gm 's bankruptcy is expected to be legally complicated , in particular because of the company 's international reach , which includes german subsidiary opel .
only gm 's us brands were included in monday 's bankruptcy filing .
the us treasury would provide approximately $ 30.1 billion -lrb- 21 billion euros -rrb- in funds .
in exchange , the us government would receive about $ 8.8 billion in preferred stock and debt , and roughly 60 percent equity in the automaker .
in return for their concessions , the united auto workers trade union would be able to select a director to serve on the gm board with no voting rights .
as part of its restructuring , gm would establish the voluntary employee benefits association -lrb- veba -rrb- , a trust that would provide health care benefits for retired uaw workers .
in return the veba trust would receive 17.5 percent of the restructured gm 's equity and will have the right to buy a further two and a half percent .

the united states government is set to own 60 percent of the " new gm , " which amounts to an unprecedented level of us government involvement in a large american company .
gm 's bankruptcy is expected to be legally complicated , in particular because of the company 's international reach , which includes german subsidiary opel .
only gm 's us brands were included in monday 's bankruptcy filing .
the us treasury would provide approximately $ 30.1 billion -lrb- 21 billion euros -rrb- in funds .
in exchange , the us government would receive about $ 8.8 billion in preferred stock and debt , and roughly 60 percent equity in the automaker .
in return for their concessions , the united auto workers trade union would be able to select a director to serve on the gm board with no voting rights .
as part of its restructuring , gm would establish the voluntary employee benefits association -lrb- veba -rrb- , a trust that would provide health care benefits for retired uaw workers .
in return the veba trust would receive 17.5 percent of the restructured gm 's equity and will have the right to buy a further two and a half percent .
canadian money canada is also getting involved financially by contributing $ 10 billion dollars and receiving a 12 percent stake in the new gm .
it is also to have a right to select one initial member of the board .
this is on top of the $ 20 billion that has already been given to the struggling automaker since last december .
in return , gm is to eliminate over 30,000 jobs , sell off many of its over a dozen brands , among which are hummer , saab , and saturn .
it is currently looking for a buyer for volvo .
according to officials , the us government is a " reluctant " equity holder and will keep its involvement to a minimum .
it will also seek to dispose of its equity as soon as possible. av / reuters / dpa / ap editor : chuck penfold / trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 01.06.2009 general motors enters bankruptcy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm 's bankruptcy is the biggest industrial collapse in us history american car giant general motors on monday filed for bankruptcy protection in a move that will see the us government take a 60 percent stake in the company and the likely loss of 20,000 us jobs . backed by the us government , the move marks the biggest industrial collapse in america and the bankruptcy filing is the third-largest in us history .
gm is now the second of the " big three " us carmakers to enter bankruptcy protection , following chrysler 's lead .
gm 's bankruptcy is expected to be legally complicated , in particular because of the company 's international reach , which includes german subsidiary opel and the uk 's vauxhall brand .
vauxhall and opel are in the process of being sold off to canadian-austrian auto parts manufacturer magna and a russian partner , with the aid of the german government .
only gm 's us brands were included in monday 's bankruptcy filing .
the us government is expected to take a 60 percent stake in the carmaker which has struggled with years of heavy losses .
washington will also pump in an additional $ 30 billion -lrb- 21 billion euros -rrb- to help restructure the 100-year-old automaker .
canada 's government will also contribute another $ 10 billion and take a 12-percent stake in gm gm , which had already received $ 20 billion of emergency loans since the end of last year , said in its bankruptcy filing that its current debts total $ 173 billion .
" tough but fair move " us president barack obama said on monday he was confident general motors corp would emerge quickly from bankruptcy , saying the government is in a reluctant position as a controlling shareholder and that he had no interest in running the company .
" i am absolutely confident that if well managed , a new gm will emerge that can ... out-compete automakers around the world and that can once again be an integral part of america 's economic future , " obama said in remarks at the white house .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has described the government as a " reluctant shareholder " in gm president barack obama described the move as " tough " but said it was " also fair " and added it would " give this iconic american company a chance to rise again . "
the president also promised a hands-off approach , saying the carmaker - and not his administration - would be responsible for decisions on the day-to-day running of the company .
" a new chapter " gm chief executive fritz henderson called it a " difficult but very important day " and appealed to customers to " give us another chance . "
he promised a speedy bankruptcy process that will allow the carmaker to take the necessary steps to reinvent itself .
" we 'll do it right and we will do it once , " henderson said at a press conference .
" this is not the end of general motors but the start of a new chapter . "
it is expected that gm may be able to exit bankruptcy protection in between 60 and 90 days .
on the same day that gm filed for bankruptcy , a bankruptcy judge approved the sale of chrysler 's best assets into a new company to be managed by italian carmaker fiat .
" a sacrifice for the next generation " the restructuring is expected to produce a drastically leaner gm .
some 20,000 us workers are thought likely to lose their jobs as the firm streamlines its operations .
it currently has 173,000 employees across the us , canada and mexico .
gm also plans to close three service and parts operations .
president obama made an appeal to workers who are set to lose their jobs . bildunterschrift : the german government is trying hard to save jobs at gm 's european subsidiary opel " i know you 've already seen more than your fair share of hard times , " he said .
" i want you to know that what you 're doing is making a sacrifice for the next generation - a sacrifice you may not have chosen to make , but a sacrifice that you are nevertheless called to make so that your children and all of our children can grow up in an america that still makes things . "
as part of its restructuring , gm would establish the voluntary employee benefits association -lrb- veba -rrb- , a trust that would provide health care benefits for retired workers of united auto workers union .
in return the veba trust would receive 17.5 percent of the restructured gm 's equity and will have the right to buy a further two and a half percent. sp / reuters / ap / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german coalition quibbles over opel rescue deal the german government has pledged to put up 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.1 billion -rrb- to save gm 's german subsidy from going bankrupt .
but not everybody in berlin thinks that handing out millions to opel is money well spent .
-lrb- 31.05.2009 -rrb- russian funds save german jobs in opel deal ahead of elections german chancellor angela merkel has called the deal to save car manufacturer opel a " test for trans-atlantic relations . "
berlin and washington seem to have passed it - but with moscow seizing a lead role in the takeover .

gm is now the second of the " big three " us carmakers to enter bankruptcy protection , following chrysler 's lead .
gm 's bankruptcy is expected to be legally complicated , in particular because of the company 's international reach , which includes german subsidiary opel and the uk 's vauxhall brand .
vauxhall and opel are in the process of being sold off to canadian-austrian auto parts manufacturer magna and a russian partner , with the aid of the german government .
only gm 's us brands were included in monday 's bankruptcy filing .
the us government is expected to take a 60 percent stake in the carmaker which has struggled with years of heavy losses .
washington will also pump in an additional $ 30 billion -lrb- 21 billion euros -rrb- to help restructure the 100-year-old automaker .
canada 's government will also contribute another $ 10 billion and take a 12-percent stake in gm gm , which had already received $ 20 billion of emergency loans since the end of last year , said in its bankruptcy filing that its current debts total $ 173 billion .
" tough but fair move " us president barack obama said on monday he was confident general motors corp would emerge quickly from bankruptcy , saying the government is in a reluctant position as a controlling shareholder and that he had no interest in running the company .
" i am absolutely confident that if well managed , a new gm will emerge that can ... out-compete automakers around the world and that can once again be an integral part of america 's economic future , " obama said in remarks at the white house .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has described the government as a " reluctant shareholder " in gm president barack obama described the move as " tough " but said it was " also fair " and added it would " give this iconic american company a chance to rise again . "
the president also promised a hands-off approach , saying the carmaker - and not his administration - would be responsible for decisions on the day-to-day running of the company .
" a new chapter " gm chief executive fritz henderson called it a " difficult but very important day " and appealed to customers to " give us another chance . "
he promised a speedy bankruptcy process that will allow the carmaker to take the necessary steps to reinvent itself .
" we 'll do it right and we will do it once , " henderson said at a press conference .
" this is not the end of general motors but the start of a new chapter . "
it is expected that gm may be able to exit bankruptcy protection in between 60 and 90 days .
on the same day that gm filed for bankruptcy , a bankruptcy judge approved the sale of chrysler 's best assets into a new company to be managed by italian carmaker fiat .
" a sacrifice for the next generation " the restructuring is expected to produce a drastically leaner gm .
some 20,000 us workers are thought likely to lose their jobs as the firm streamlines its operations .
it currently has 173,000 employees across the us , canada and mexico .
gm also plans to close three service and parts operations .
president obama made an appeal to workers who are set to lose their jobs . bildunterschrift : the german government is trying hard to save jobs at gm 's european subsidiary opel " i know you 've already seen more than your fair share of hard times , " he said .
" i want you to know that what you 're doing is making a sacrifice for the next generation - a sacrifice you may not have chosen to make , but a sacrifice that you are nevertheless called to make so that your children and all of our children can grow up in an america that still makes things . "
as part of its restructuring , gm would establish the voluntary employee benefits association -lrb- veba -rrb- , a trust that would provide health care benefits for retired workers of united auto workers union .
in return the veba trust would receive 17.5 percent of the restructured gm 's equity and will have the right to buy a further two and a half percent. sp / reuters / ap / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

canada 's government will also contribute another $ 10 billion and take a 12-percent stake in gm gm , which had already received $ 20 billion of emergency loans since the end of last year , said in its bankruptcy filing that its current debts total $ 173 billion .
" tough but fair move " us president barack obama said on monday he was confident general motors corp would emerge quickly from bankruptcy , saying the government is in a reluctant position as a controlling shareholder and that he had no interest in running the company .
" i am absolutely confident that if well managed , a new gm will emerge that can ... out-compete automakers around the world and that can once again be an integral part of america 's economic future , " obama said in remarks at the white house .

"
the president also promised a hands-off approach , saying the carmaker - and not his administration - would be responsible for decisions on the day-to-day running of the company .
" a new chapter " gm chief executive fritz henderson called it a " difficult but very important day " and appealed to customers to " give us another chance . "
he promised a speedy bankruptcy process that will allow the carmaker to take the necessary steps to reinvent itself .
" we 'll do it right and we will do it once , " henderson said at a press conference .
" this is not the end of general motors but the start of a new chapter . "
it is expected that gm may be able to exit bankruptcy protection in between 60 and 90 days .
on the same day that gm filed for bankruptcy , a bankruptcy judge approved the sale of chrysler 's best assets into a new company to be managed by italian carmaker fiat .
" a sacrifice for the next generation " the restructuring is expected to produce a drastically leaner gm .
some 20,000 us workers are thought likely to lose their jobs as the firm streamlines its operations .
it currently has 173,000 employees across the us , canada and mexico .
gm also plans to close three service and parts operations .
president obama made an appeal to workers who are set to lose their jobs . bildunterschrift : the german government is trying hard to save jobs at gm 's european subsidiary opel " i know you 've already seen more than your fair share of hard times , " he said .
" i want you to know that what you 're doing is making a sacrifice for the next generation - a sacrifice you may not have chosen to make , but a sacrifice that you are nevertheless called to make so that your children and all of our children can grow up in an america that still makes things . "
as part of its restructuring , gm would establish the voluntary employee benefits association -lrb- veba -rrb- , a trust that would provide health care benefits for retired workers of united auto workers union .
in return the veba trust would receive 17.5 percent of the restructured gm 's equity and will have the right to buy a further two and a half percent. sp / reuters / ap / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gm is now the second of the " big three " us carmakers to enter bankruptcy protection , following chrysler 's lead .
gm 's bankruptcy is expected to be legally complicated , in particular because of the company 's international reach , which includes german subsidiary opel and the uk 's vauxhall brand .
vauxhall and opel are in the process of being sold off to canadian-austrian auto parts manufacturer magna and a russian partner , with the aid of the german government .
only gm 's us brands were included in monday 's bankruptcy filing .
the us government is expected to take a 60 percent stake in the carmaker which has struggled with years of heavy losses .

despite its growing influence , the number of voters has been sinking since the first eu elections in 1979 . the first european union election took place 30 years ago and 63 percent of the eligible voters showed up to have their voices heard .
since then , the european parliament has been one of the eu ’ s major political institutions .
while the council of the european union is made up of various ministers of the member states and the european commission 's members are appointed by the european council , the european parliament is the only directly elected body , giving citizens a chance to influence european politics . 30 years ago , the parliament played a mostly advisory role .
the council was obliged to acknowledge the parliament ’ s opinion in important matters , but was not forced to accept it .
even then , however , some parts of the budget required the approval of parliament . since then , the parliament ’ s authority has steadily increased , but the voter turnout at eu elections has plummeted .
at the last election in 2004 it stood at just 45.6 percent .
many feel that the reason for this decline lies in the complicated structures of eu bureaucracy , which can be difficult to understand .
those who do not know what the european parliament is and what it does are unlikely to be interested in voting for it . the parliament ’ s playing field bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the plenary hall in the european parliament in brussels today , the european parliament has to officially approve the european council ’ s nominations of members of the european commission .
like the us congress , the parliament tends to accept the suggestions of commissioners . the commission also has to justify its activities to the parliament and any of its members can be discharged at any time through a vote of no-confidence . the codecision procedure , which has been in place since the 1992 maastricht treaty , puts the parliament on equal footing with the council in many law-making processes .
both chambers have the right to reject the european commission ’ s proposals .
this system applies to more than 75 percent of all eu laws .
exceptions to this rule include some key areas such as a common foreign and security policy , as well as the areas of justice and interior affairs . the parliament ’ s third sphere of authority is the budget .
every december the parliament must approve an eu budget for the following year .
however , there are some exceptions to this rule , too .
all of the so-called compulsory spending - the funds that the european union needs to carry out its duties - do not require the parliament ’ s approval .
included in this compulsory spending , for example , are the agricultural budgets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simone veil was the president of the european parliament from 1979 to 1982 the parliament also has the right of codetermination with regard to eu expansion .
it must agree to all eu-entry-related decisions made by the commission and the council .
it also has the power to block decisions related to the european market .
the treaty of lisbon , which has not yet been ratified by all eu member states , aims to give the european parliament even more power in relation to the council and the commission . important decisions in december 1979 the parliament displayed its power for the first time .
its president , simone veil , refused to sign the financial plan for 1980 and thus forced the commission to amend it .
the parliament has periodically blocked budget decisions in the following years . during the appointment of the european commission in 2004 , the parliament made the first use of its veto rights .
it rejected the conservative italian rocco buttiglione , who had been nominated for the position of commissioner for justice , freedom and security . the parliament also brings forth its own legislative ideas and in this way contributes actively to the eu decision-making process .
numerous laws relating to consumer protection , climate protection , civil rights and labor have been created in this way . torsten spies / ew editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite its growing influence , the number of voters has been sinking since the first eu elections in 1979 . the first european union election took place 30 years ago and 63 percent of the eligible voters showed up to have their voices heard .
since then , the european parliament has been one of the eu ’ s major political institutions .
while the council of the european union is made up of various ministers of the member states and the european commission 's members are appointed by the european council , the european parliament is the only directly elected body , giving citizens a chance to influence european politics . 30 years ago , the parliament played a mostly advisory role .
the council was obliged to acknowledge the parliament ’ s opinion in important matters , but was not forced to accept it .
even then , however , some parts of the budget required the approval of parliament . since then , the parliament ’ s authority has steadily increased , but the voter turnout at eu elections has plummeted .
at the last election in 2004 it stood at just 45.6 percent .
many feel that the reason for this decline lies in the complicated structures of eu bureaucracy , which can be difficult to understand .
those who do not know what the european parliament is and what it does are unlikely to be interested in voting for it . the parliament ’ s playing field bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the plenary hall in the european parliament in brussels today , the european parliament has to officially approve the european council ’ s nominations of members of the european commission .
like the us congress , the parliament tends to accept the suggestions of commissioners . the commission also has to justify its activities to the parliament and any of its members can be discharged at any time through a vote of no-confidence . the codecision procedure , which has been in place since the 1992 maastricht treaty , puts the parliament on equal footing with the council in many law-making processes .
both chambers have the right to reject the european commission ’ s proposals .
this system applies to more than 75 percent of all eu laws .
exceptions to this rule include some key areas such as a common foreign and security policy , as well as the areas of justice and interior affairs . the parliament ’ s third sphere of authority is the budget .
every december the parliament must approve an eu budget for the following year .
however , there are some exceptions to this rule , too .
all of the so-called compulsory spending - the funds that the european union needs to carry out its duties - do not require the parliament ’ s approval .
included in this compulsory spending , for example , are the agricultural budgets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simone veil was the president of the european parliament from 1979 to 1982 the parliament also has the right of codetermination with regard to eu expansion .
it must agree to all eu-entry-related decisions made by the commission and the council .
it also has the power to block decisions related to the european market .
the treaty of lisbon , which has not yet been ratified by all eu member states , aims to give the european parliament even more power in relation to the council and the commission . important decisions in december 1979 the parliament displayed its power for the first time .
its president , simone veil , refused to sign the financial plan for 1980 and thus forced the commission to amend it .
the parliament has periodically blocked budget decisions in the following years . during the appointment of the european commission in 2004 , the parliament made the first use of its veto rights .
it rejected the conservative italian rocco buttiglione , who had been nominated for the position of commissioner for justice , freedom and security . the parliament also brings forth its own legislative ideas and in this way contributes actively to the eu decision-making process .
numerous laws relating to consumer protection , climate protection , civil rights and labor have been created in this way . torsten spies / ew editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

up until now , all attempts to change this have been stymied by france 's resistance . according to gahler , there should be more public pressure to force france and luxembourg to alter their position on the topic .

one example of this is that the european parliament is actually based in three different cities : strasbourg , brussels and luxembourg . " i personally think that this parliament , with its 40 weeks of sessions , should not be additionally burdened with this whole traveling circus , " said michael gahler , eu parliamentarian and member of germany 's christian democratic union party -lrb- cdu -rrb- . gahler said he believes that with so many pressing issues , the parliamentarians can not afford to waste time traveling . more seats , more costs , more work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strasbourg is the official seat of the parliament many parliamentarians and eu citizens have the same opinion .
there has been much debate in recent years about whether the european parliament really needs to have three locations .
the official headquarters are in strasbourg , france , but this parliament building is only used 48 days of the year - for plenary sessions .
all other plenary , committee and faction meetings take place in brussels , belgium .
the largest part of the parliament 's administration , the secretariat , is based in luxembourg . " we find this very inconvenient and expensive , " eu parliamentarian wolf klinz said .
moving locations throughout the year costs around 200 million euros -lrb- $ 284 million -rrb- , klinz explained , and does not make the work any easier . " we are in favor of only having a base in brussels , " klinz said .

unlike national parliaments , which usually elect their heads of state , the european parliament does not elect a pan-european government .
this is why it has no real majority or opposition parties " the factions and majorities among us form around issues , " klaus haensch , a representative from germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , explained .

jacki davis from the european policy center , a brussels-based political think tank , contended that while the parliamentary debates might not always be particularly exciting , the european parliament is very important because its members have a lot of power . the members of the parliament have a say in decisions regarding around 80 percent of all european laws and principles .

lobbyists and bureaucrats influence a lot of decisions , he said .

austria 's far-right freedom party has plunged austrian politics into an uproar . one freedom party campaing poster reads " abendland in christenhand " - or europe in christian hands - the implication being that the eu has allowed too many muslims to enter europe .
another freedom party election ad in a tabloid newspaper promises to veto the eu membership of israel and turkey to avoid getting sucked into what is described as " the bloody middle east crisis . " that 's been interpreted by some as anti-semitic as well as anti-islam .
israel is not a candidate to become an eu member . austrian president heinz fischer responded by saying that religion and politics should not mix , though popular sentiment is that he waited too long to get involved . public outcry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these freedom party posters imply that judgment day is coming senior figures in the catholic church and the muslim community are also outraged .
catholic theologian and author hubert feichtelbauer fears that freedom party leader heinz christian strache may be tapping into religious prejudices . " in their hearts they did n't feel very upset about this , " feichtelbauer said of those who are not outraged by the campaign tactics .
" therefore i fear that in a minority of the catholic population there might be some agreement with the slogans put forward by mr. strache . " the freedom party rejects all criticism of its campaigning as absurd and irrelevant and says it 's sticking with the slogans .
the latest statements from a freedom party politician are once again stirring up controversy .
in a reight-wing publication , martin graf , one of the presidents of the lower house of the austrian parliament , wrote of ariel muzicant , the head of vienna 's jewish community , " many are asking if muzicant is not the father of anti-fascist left wing terrorism . " " this is to be condemned " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor faymann : " we want nothing to do with hate campaigns " in the middle of an election campaign , statements like that have been taken by all but the right wing as a clear provocation and an attempt to whip up anti-semitic feeling .
the social democrat chancellor werner faymann was one of the first to react . " if this is true , then he is completely off the rails and is to be condemned , " faymann said .
" this is incitement and preaching hate and we want nothing to do with hate campaigns . " the chancellor later joined a growing chorus of leading politicians and public figures calling for the freedom party politician to resign .
but there no sign of that happening , and the freedom party has claimed that it is graf who has been victimized . kerry skyring / sjt editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pyongyang replied promptly on monday , saying it would " strengthen its nuclear deterrent . "
early last week , north korea defied united nations resolutions by staging an underground nuclear test , its second such detonation since 2006 , and renouncing the armistice that ended the war on the korean peninsula in 1953 .

geneva start talks behind closed doors the start arms reduction talks in geneva are the second encounter involving us and russian envoys since us president barack obama and his russian counterpart dimitri medvedev met at the g-20 summit in london in april and agreed to strive for further reductions . russian diplomats say the presidents will unveil the first results of the start consultations at their planned summit in moscow in early july .
meantime , both sides have sworn confidentiality .
diplomats close to the geneva talks , spread over three days , say it is being held behind closed doors at russia 's mission .
progress is not expected to be swift .
recent russian-us relations have been troubled by tensions over the pro-western former soviet republic of georgia and russia 's objections to washington 's plan to site a us anti-missile shield in poland and the czech republic , ostensibly to counter a threat from iran .
russian military analyst alexander goltz says the start negotiations will help russia to restore its " status as a world power . " another analyst evgeny volk of the heritage foundation says president obama " needs a result " to demonstrate progress after the ' reset ' in us-russian relations declared early this year by his vice-president joseph biden .
in april while visiting prague , obama underscored his stance by saying his long-term goal was to create a " world without nuclear weapons . "
deep cuts but arsenals still large start i was signed in 1991 – shortly after the fall of europe 's iron curtain - by former us president george h. bush senior and the-then soviet president mikhail gorbachev .
it set up a system of bilateral inspections and stipulated that neither side could deploy more than 6,000 warheads and no more than 1,600 strategic delivery vehicles , including long-rang missiles , submarines and bomber aircraft .
that goal was reached by 2001 , still leaving both powers holding 90 percent of the world 's arsenals .

russia does not publish its own figures .
in terms of warheads , the us said russia held 3,909 devices while the us military had 5,576 .
at the london summit in april , obama and medvedev pointed out that another treaty signed in 2002 , known as sort or the strategic offensive reductions treaty requires each power 's stockpile to be trimmed to a ceiling of between 1,700 - 2,200 nuclear warheads .

the united states government is set to own 60 percent of the " new gm , " which amounts to an unprecedented level of us government involvement in a large american company .
gm 's bankruptcy is expected to be legally complicated , in particular because of the company 's international reach , which includes german subsidiary opel .
only gm 's us brands were included in monday 's bankruptcy filing .
the us treasury would provide approximately $ 30.1 billion -lrb- 21 billion euros -rrb- in funds .
in exchange , the us government would receive about $ 8.8 billion in preferred stock and debt , and roughly 60 percent equity in the automaker .
in return for their concessions , the united auto workers trade union would be able to select a director to serve on the gm board with no voting rights .
as part of its restructuring , gm would establish the voluntary employee benefits association -lrb- veba -rrb- , a trust that would provide health care benefits for retired uaw workers .
in return the veba trust would receive 17.5 percent of the restructured gm 's equity and will have the right to buy a further two and a half percent .
canadian money canada is also getting involved financially by contributing $ 10 billion dollars and receiving a 12 percent stake in the new gm .
it is also to have a right to select one initial member of the board .
this is on top of the $ 20 billion that has already been given to the struggling automaker since last december .
in return , gm is to eliminate over 30,000 jobs , sell off many of its over a dozen brands , among which are hummer , saab , and saturn .
it is currently looking for a buyer for volvo .
according to officials , the us government is a " reluctant " equity holder and will keep its involvement to a minimum .
it will also seek to dispose of its equity as soon as possible. av / reuters / dpa / ap editor : chuck penfold / trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one example of this is that the european parliament is actually based in three different cities : strasbourg , brussels and luxembourg . " i personally think that this parliament , with its 40 weeks of sessions , should not be additionally burdened with this whole traveling circus , " said michael gahler , eu parliamentarian and member of germany 's christian democratic union party -lrb- cdu -rrb- . gahler said he believes that with so many pressing issues , the parliamentarians can not afford to waste time traveling . more seats , more costs , more work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strasbourg is the official seat of the parliament many parliamentarians and eu citizens have the same opinion .
there has been much debate in recent years about whether the european parliament really needs to have three locations .
the official headquarters are in strasbourg , france , but this parliament building is only used 48 days of the year - for plenary sessions .
all other plenary , committee and faction meetings take place in brussels , belgium .
the largest part of the parliament 's administration , the secretariat , is based in luxembourg . " we find this very inconvenient and expensive , " eu parliamentarian wolf klinz said .
moving locations throughout the year costs around 200 million euros -lrb- $ 284 million -rrb- , klinz explained , and does not make the work any easier . " we are in favor of only having a base in brussels , " klinz said .
his party , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- of germany , is demanding the parliament 's complete relocation to brussels , putting a stop to what he also termed a " traveling circus . " a lot of support for the one-location option once a month , all 785 eu parliamentarians and 3,000 staff members travel from brussels to strasbourg for a plenary session , and then back again .
according to critics , this not only drains finances , but also creates 20,000 tons of carbon emissions .
this is why parliament members from various factions started the one seat campaign in 2006 , with the aim of moving all parliament activities to brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo bullmann : " no more separation from brussels " 1.25 million eu citizens have also signed the one seat campaign petition on the internet .
but why brussels rather than strasbourg ? udo bullmann , eu parliamentarian and member of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , explained : " we as the parliament need proximity to the commission and the council .
we can not afford to travel hundreds of kilometers . " strasbourg is not a feasible option because the other political bodies have their seat in brussels , according to bullmann . strasbourg a symbol of european unity but it is not as simple as it sounds .
strasbourg is place of historical importance for europe .
the city symbolizes french-german reconciliation after world war ii and the beginning of european unification .
in 1997 eu member states were united in the decision to make strasbourg the official seat of the parliament .
up until now , all attempts to change this have been stymied by france 's resistance . according to gahler , there should be more public pressure to force france and luxembourg to alter their position on the topic .
" it 's a question of time , but in the future i would like to see the parliament not providing so much room for attacks on itself .
because almost every visitor group that i meet , someone raises this question , and i 'm forced to say that i do n't agree with the current situation . " what will become of strasbourg ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the parliament 's secretariat has its seat in luxembourg however , among european conservatives , michael gahler represents a minority opinion .
on the french side there is great concern about losing something meaningful if the eu parliament were not officially based in strasbourg . but the council of europe and the european court of human rights , both important , non-eu , international bodies , would still remain in strasbourg .
and there are many ideas for making up such a move to france . a european university , a european diplomatic academy and a concentration of european jurisdiction are just some of the new possibilities for strasbourg .
however , any changes of this sort require the agreement of all 27 eu member states , including , of course , france and luxembourg . thus there is a good chance that the european parliament will continue to have three locations for some years to come . nina funke-kaiser / ew editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in geneva , russia and the united states have resumed talks on renewing their main cold war-era nuclear arms reduction treaty , start i. the talks have been overshadowed by alarm over north korea 's nuclear ambitions . russia and the united states have begun a second round of talks in geneva aimed at devising a follow-on treaty for start i. the strategic arms reduction treaty was signed in 1991 by the former cold war powers to make deep cuts in their own nuclear weapons arsenals .
it expires in december but still leaves the two powers heavily armed . as if to underscore the ever-present need to reign in proliferation , nuclear outsider north korea has been told by southeast asian leaders attending a two-day summit in south korea to cease its " provocative " acts .
pyongyang replied promptly on monday , saying it would " strengthen its nuclear deterrent . "
early last week , north korea defied united nations resolutions by staging an underground nuclear test , its second such detonation since 2006 , and renouncing the armistice that ended the war on the korean peninsula in 1953 .
on friday , the north fired a short-range missile , its sixth in a week , drawing more international condemnation .
south korea says north preparing missile in what could be a further escalation , south korea 's defense ministry says the north has moved a long-range missile to its launch base at dongchang-ri , on north korea 's west coast , near china .
according to south korean media , including the news agency yonghap and the daily newspaper joongang libo , south korean intelligence officials say the taepodong-2 missile is an " intercontinental " rocket that potentially could reach alaska .
they say launch preparations could take one to two more weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea has promised to " strengthen its nuclear deterrent " experts add , however , that north korea has not yet mastered the technology to miniaturize a nuclear warhead to mount on such a missile .
in april , north korea drew strong protests when it test fired a similar long-range rocket in the direction of japan .
visiting manila , us defense secretary robert gates said north korea 's intentions are " not clear . "
gates said he hoped a high-level us talks with china , japan , russia and south korea would help defuse tensions . visiting singapore at the weekend , gates had said pyongyang 's acts could spark an arms race with serious consequences for asia .
geneva start talks behind closed doors the start arms reduction talks in geneva are the second encounter involving us and russian envoys since us president barack obama and his russian counterpart dimitri medvedev met at the g-20 summit in london in april and agreed to strive for further reductions . russian diplomats say the presidents will unveil the first results of the start consultations at their planned summit in moscow in early july .
meantime , both sides have sworn confidentiality .
diplomats close to the geneva talks , spread over three days , say it is being held behind closed doors at russia 's mission .
progress is not expected to be swift .
recent russian-us relations have been troubled by tensions over the pro-western former soviet republic of georgia and russia 's objections to washington 's plan to site a us anti-missile shield in poland and the czech republic , ostensibly to counter a threat from iran .
russian military analyst alexander goltz says the start negotiations will help russia to restore its " status as a world power . " another analyst evgeny volk of the heritage foundation says president obama " needs a result " to demonstrate progress after the ' reset ' in us-russian relations declared early this year by his vice-president joseph biden .
in april while visiting prague , obama underscored his stance by saying his long-term goal was to create a " world without nuclear weapons . "
deep cuts but arsenals still large start i was signed in 1991 – shortly after the fall of europe 's iron curtain - by former us president george h. bush senior and the-then soviet president mikhail gorbachev .
it set up a system of bilateral inspections and stipulated that neither side could deploy more than 6,000 warheads and no more than 1,600 strategic delivery vehicles , including long-rang missiles , submarines and bomber aircraft .
that goal was reached by 2001 , still leaving both powers holding 90 percent of the world 's arsenals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some nuclear submarines have been decommissioned according to the us state department , at the beginning of january the united states had 550 intercontinental ballistic missiles ready for use ; russia had 469 such missiles , but with more warheads per missile .
russia does not publish its own figures .
in terms of warheads , the us said russia held 3,909 devices while the us military had 5,576 .
at the london summit in april , obama and medvedev pointed out that another treaty signed in 2002 , known as sort or the strategic offensive reductions treaty requires each power 's stockpile to be trimmed to a ceiling of between 1,700 - 2,200 nuclear warheads .
unlike start , however , it does not provide for verification systems .
thaw raises hopes for non-proliferation treaty review if a follow-on treaty supercedes start , stipulating further us and russian cuts , it could add fresh impulse to plans to revise the much wider non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- at a united nations review conference next year .
last friday , the permanent security council members , all nuclear powers , including china , france and britain , endorsed a review and an ambitious agenda under an algerian-mediated compromise .
that breakthrough at the long-running 65-member conference on disarmament at the un 's european offices in geneva ended more than a decade of deadlock .
at similar talks in 2005 not even an agenda was agreed. ipj / dpa / reuters / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the czech communist party parliamentarian used to be an astronaut and took part in a russian space mission in the 1970s .
he was the first man in space from outside the soviet union or united states .
from the soyuz 28 spaceship in 1978 , vladimir remek thanked the central committee of the soviet communist party and comrade leonid brezhnev for giving him the chance to take part in the mission .
thirty-one years later , the former cosmonaut spoke at a communist party election rally in the small czech city of hradec kralové .
the few in attendance were mainly elderly people who fondly remembered the days when remek was a national hero .
" a year after his flight he visited a school where i was the head teacher and spoke to the children , " one woman remembered .
" people came from all around - some walked five kilometers just to see him . "
" he was extremely popular .

“ i think it definitely played a role , because i can say in all modesty i was known throughout society , " remek said .

" for instance , i represented czech machinery firms in russia , i was a diplomat in the field of trade at the czechoslovak embassy in moscow , " he explained .
" so i ’ ve achieved more than that space flight .
but it ’ s true that ’ s what made me well known . ”
bringing experience in space to brussels after five years representing the czech republic in brussels and strasbourg , remek can compare life in space and life in the european parliament , in a way few other parlementarians can .
“ in space or any kind of flight cooperation is an absolute given , so that the plane or spacecraft fulfills its mission and lands safely , " remek said .
" there are strict rules .
they exist in the european parliament too , but it ’ s all about discussion . "
" when you fly not every decision is a matter of life and death , " he said .
" in the parliament it is about life in a way , because our decisions affect people ’ s lives . ”
vladimir remek isn ’ t the only former astronaut in the european parliament .
the italian mep umberto guidoni - also in the group of the united left - flew two nasa space shuttle missions .
he too is standing for re-election .

one example of this is that the european parliament is actually based in three different cities : strasbourg , brussels and luxembourg . " i personally think that this parliament , with its 40 weeks of sessions , should not be additionally burdened with this whole traveling circus , " said michael gahler , eu parliamentarian and member of germany 's christian democratic union party -lrb- cdu -rrb- . gahler said he believes that with so many pressing issues , the parliamentarians can not afford to waste time traveling . more seats , more costs , more work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strasbourg is the official seat of the parliament many parliamentarians and eu citizens have the same opinion .
there has been much debate in recent years about whether the european parliament really needs to have three locations .
the official headquarters are in strasbourg , france , but this parliament building is only used 48 days of the year - for plenary sessions .
all other plenary , committee and faction meetings take place in brussels , belgium .
the largest part of the parliament 's administration , the secretariat , is based in luxembourg . " we find this very inconvenient and expensive , " eu parliamentarian wolf klinz said .
moving locations throughout the year costs around 200 million euros -lrb- $ 284 million -rrb- , klinz explained , and does not make the work any easier . " we are in favor of only having a base in brussels , " klinz said .
his party , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- of germany , is demanding the parliament 's complete relocation to brussels , putting a stop to what he also termed a " traveling circus . " a lot of support for the one-location option once a month , all 785 eu parliamentarians and 3,000 staff members travel from brussels to strasbourg for a plenary session , and then back again .
according to critics , this not only drains finances , but also creates 20,000 tons of carbon emissions .
this is why parliament members from various factions started the one seat campaign in 2006 , with the aim of moving all parliament activities to brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo bullmann : " no more separation from brussels " 1.25 million eu citizens have also signed the one seat campaign petition on the internet .
but why brussels rather than strasbourg ? udo bullmann , eu parliamentarian and member of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , explained : " we as the parliament need proximity to the commission and the council .
we can not afford to travel hundreds of kilometers . " strasbourg is not a feasible option because the other political bodies have their seat in brussels , according to bullmann . strasbourg a symbol of european unity but it is not as simple as it sounds .
strasbourg is place of historical importance for europe .
the city symbolizes french-german reconciliation after world war ii and the beginning of european unification .
in 1997 eu member states were united in the decision to make strasbourg the official seat of the parliament .
up until now , all attempts to change this have been stymied by france 's resistance . according to gahler , there should be more public pressure to force france and luxembourg to alter their position on the topic .
" it 's a question of time , but in the future i would like to see the parliament not providing so much room for attacks on itself .
because almost every visitor group that i meet , someone raises this question , and i 'm forced to say that i do n't agree with the current situation . " what will become of strasbourg ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the parliament 's secretariat has its seat in luxembourg however , among european conservatives , michael gahler represents a minority opinion .
on the french side there is great concern about losing something meaningful if the eu parliament were not officially based in strasbourg . but the council of europe and the european court of human rights , both important , non-eu , international bodies , would still remain in strasbourg .
and there are many ideas for making up such a move to france . a european university , a european diplomatic academy and a concentration of european jurisdiction are just some of the new possibilities for strasbourg .
however , any changes of this sort require the agreement of all 27 eu member states , including , of course , france and luxembourg . thus there is a good chance that the european parliament will continue to have three locations for some years to come . nina funke-kaiser / ew editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the czech communist party parliamentarian used to be an astronaut and took part in a russian space mission in the 1970s .
he was the first man in space from outside the soviet union or united states .
from the soyuz 28 spaceship in 1978 , vladimir remek thanked the central committee of the soviet communist party and comrade leonid brezhnev for giving him the chance to take part in the mission .
thirty-one years later , the former cosmonaut spoke at a communist party election rally in the small czech city of hradec kralové .
the few in attendance were mainly elderly people who fondly remembered the days when remek was a national hero .
" a year after his flight he visited a school where i was the head teacher and spoke to the children , " one woman remembered .
" people came from all around - some walked five kilometers just to see him . "
" he was extremely popular .
but he has always been modest too , so … he 'll get my vote . "
meteoric rise to stardom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remek -lrb- left -rrb- inspects casks of the famous czech bitters becherovka in his capacity as a czech mep vladimir remek , who unsurprisingly was a party member under the former regime , stood successfully for the czech communist party in the last elections to the european parliament in 2004 .
he conceded his huge communist-era fame contributed to his success at the ballot box .
“ i think it definitely played a role , because i can say in all modesty i was known throughout society , " remek said .
" but at the same time i think many people understood that i ’ ve done much more . "
" for instance , i represented czech machinery firms in russia , i was a diplomat in the field of trade at the czechoslovak embassy in moscow , " he explained .
" so i ’ ve achieved more than that space flight .
but it ’ s true that ’ s what made me well known . ”
bringing experience in space to brussels after five years representing the czech republic in brussels and strasbourg , remek can compare life in space and life in the european parliament , in a way few other parlementarians can .
“ in space or any kind of flight cooperation is an absolute given , so that the plane or spacecraft fulfills its mission and lands safely , " remek said .
" there are strict rules .
they exist in the european parliament too , but it ’ s all about discussion . "
" when you fly not every decision is a matter of life and death , " he said .
" in the parliament it is about life in a way , because our decisions affect people ’ s lives . ”
vladimir remek isn ’ t the only former astronaut in the european parliament .
the italian mep umberto guidoni - also in the group of the united left - flew two nasa space shuttle missions .
he too is standing for re-election .

" the european parliament has been directly elected by european citizens for 30 years .
unlike national parliaments , which usually elect their heads of state , the european parliament does not elect a pan-european government .
this is why it has no real majority or opposition parties " the factions and majorities among us form around issues , " klaus haensch , a representative from germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , explained .
hänsch has been a member of the european parliament for 30 years , and was the parliament ’ s president from 1994 to 1997 . unlike other legislative bodies , media scandals and power struggles are not usually a feature of the european parliament .
jacki davis from the european policy center , a brussels-based political think tank , contended that while the parliamentary debates might not always be particularly exciting , the european parliament is very important because its members have a lot of power . the members of the parliament have a say in decisions regarding around 80 percent of all european laws and principles .
an estimated 30 to 50 percent of all laws that affect the eu member states are directly codetermined by the european parliament .

both chambers vote for bills drafted by the european commission .
however , the parliament does not have the power to propose its own laws . " with each treaty - from maastricht to amsterdam to nizza - the parliament has acquired new rights and power over new policy areas , " jacki davis explained . today only agricultural policy , foreign policy , justice policy and the health care system are excluded from the parliament ’ s sphere of power . lots of parlamentarians but little time for member of parliament hans-peter martin , who doesn ’ t belong to any political faction , the parliament still has too few rights .
lobbyists and bureaucrats influence a lot of decisions , he said .

but despite these shortcomings , it 's still important to vote , martin said .
because after all , the european parliament is the only democratically elected eu institution . in comparison to national parliaments in europe , a single member of the european parliament has less influence .
this is mostly due to the institution 's large size : 785 members from 27 eu member states .

" the european parliament has been directly elected by european citizens for 30 years .
unlike national parliaments , which usually elect their heads of state , the european parliament does not elect a pan-european government .
this is why it has no real majority or opposition parties " the factions and majorities among us form around issues , " klaus haensch , a representative from germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , explained .
hänsch has been a member of the european parliament for 30 years , and was the parliament ’ s president from 1994 to 1997 . unlike other legislative bodies , media scandals and power struggles are not usually a feature of the european parliament .
jacki davis from the european policy center , a brussels-based political think tank , contended that while the parliamentary debates might not always be particularly exciting , the european parliament is very important because its members have a lot of power . the members of the parliament have a say in decisions regarding around 80 percent of all european laws and principles .
an estimated 30 to 50 percent of all laws that affect the eu member states are directly codetermined by the european parliament .
the effects of this legislation on the daily lives of the 500 million eu citizens are significant , even if many voters are not aware of this fact . more rights , but still not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does the parliament have too few rights ? the european parliament is just one of the two chambers of the eu legislative body .
the parliamentarians share power with the council of the european union -lrb- also known as the council of ministers -rrb- , in which the various national governments are represented .
both chambers vote for bills drafted by the european commission .
however , the parliament does not have the power to propose its own laws . " with each treaty - from maastricht to amsterdam to nizza - the parliament has acquired new rights and power over new policy areas , " jacki davis explained . today only agricultural policy , foreign policy , justice policy and the health care system are excluded from the parliament ’ s sphere of power . lots of parlamentarians but little time for member of parliament hans-peter martin , who doesn ’ t belong to any political faction , the parliament still has too few rights .
lobbyists and bureaucrats influence a lot of decisions , he said .
for example , the parliament does not have its own scientific department to thoroughly prepare its members for making certain decisions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it important to participate in eu elections " : hans-peter martin the parliamentarians often rely on the opinions of lobbyists to make up for this lack of scientific briefing .
but despite these shortcomings , it 's still important to vote , martin said .
because after all , the european parliament is the only democratically elected eu institution . in comparison to national parliaments in europe , a single member of the european parliament has less influence .
this is mostly due to the institution 's large size : 785 members from 27 eu member states .
they are divided into seven factions , and these in turn are divided into national groups .
the largest groups are the conservatives , the socialists and the liberals . the number of parliamentarians has increased tenfold since the parliament ’ s establishment in the 1950s .

unlike national parliaments , which usually elect their heads of state , the european parliament does not elect a pan-european government .
this is why it has no real majority or opposition parties " the factions and majorities among us form around issues , " klaus haensch , a representative from germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , explained .
hänsch has been a member of the european parliament for 30 years , and was the parliament ’ s president from 1994 to 1997 . unlike other legislative bodies , media scandals and power struggles are not usually a feature of the european parliament .
jacki davis from the european policy center , a brussels-based political think tank , contended that while the parliamentary debates might not always be particularly exciting , the european parliament is very important because its members have a lot of power . the members of the parliament have a say in decisions regarding around 80 percent of all european laws and principles .
an estimated 30 to 50 percent of all laws that affect the eu member states are directly codetermined by the european parliament .
the effects of this legislation on the daily lives of the 500 million eu citizens are significant , even if many voters are not aware of this fact . more rights , but still not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does the parliament have too few rights ? the european parliament is just one of the two chambers of the eu legislative body .
the parliamentarians share power with the council of the european union -lrb- also known as the council of ministers -rrb- , in which the various national governments are represented .
both chambers vote for bills drafted by the european commission .
however , the parliament does not have the power to propose its own laws . " with each treaty - from maastricht to amsterdam to nizza - the parliament has acquired new rights and power over new policy areas , " jacki davis explained . today only agricultural policy , foreign policy , justice policy and the health care system are excluded from the parliament ’ s sphere of power . lots of parlamentarians but little time for member of parliament hans-peter martin , who doesn ’ t belong to any political faction , the parliament still has too few rights .
lobbyists and bureaucrats influence a lot of decisions , he said .
for example , the parliament does not have its own scientific department to thoroughly prepare its members for making certain decisions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it important to participate in eu elections " : hans-peter martin the parliamentarians often rely on the opinions of lobbyists to make up for this lack of scientific briefing .
but despite these shortcomings , it 's still important to vote , martin said .
because after all , the european parliament is the only democratically elected eu institution . in comparison to national parliaments in europe , a single member of the european parliament has less influence .
this is mostly due to the institution 's large size : 785 members from 27 eu member states .
they are divided into seven factions , and these in turn are divided into national groups .
the largest groups are the conservatives , the socialists and the liberals . the number of parliamentarians has increased tenfold since the parliament ’ s establishment in the 1950s .
today there are few opportunites to make big , memorable speeches .
in fact , their speaking time in debates is usually limited to just one minute . bernd riegert / euranet / ew editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite its growing influence , the number of voters has been sinking since the first eu elections in 1979 . the first european union election took place 30 years ago and 63 percent of the eligible voters showed up to have their voices heard .
since then , the european parliament has been one of the eu ’ s major political institutions .
while the council of the european union is made up of various ministers of the member states and the european commission 's members are appointed by the european council , the european parliament is the only directly elected body , giving citizens a chance to influence european politics . 30 years ago , the parliament played a mostly advisory role .
the council was obliged to acknowledge the parliament ’ s opinion in important matters , but was not forced to accept it .
even then , however , some parts of the budget required the approval of parliament . since then , the parliament ’ s authority has steadily increased , but the voter turnout at eu elections has plummeted .
at the last election in 2004 it stood at just 45.6 percent .
many feel that the reason for this decline lies in the complicated structures of eu bureaucracy , which can be difficult to understand .
those who do not know what the european parliament is and what it does are unlikely to be interested in voting for it . the parliament ’ s playing field bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the plenary hall in the european parliament in brussels today , the european parliament has to officially approve the european council ’ s nominations of members of the european commission .
like the us congress , the parliament tends to accept the suggestions of commissioners . the commission also has to justify its activities to the parliament and any of its members can be discharged at any time through a vote of no-confidence . the codecision procedure , which has been in place since the 1992 maastricht treaty , puts the parliament on equal footing with the council in many law-making processes .
both chambers have the right to reject the european commission ’ s proposals .
this system applies to more than 75 percent of all eu laws .
exceptions to this rule include some key areas such as a common foreign and security policy , as well as the areas of justice and interior affairs . the parliament ’ s third sphere of authority is the budget .
every december the parliament must approve an eu budget for the following year .
however , there are some exceptions to this rule , too .
all of the so-called compulsory spending - the funds that the european union needs to carry out its duties - do not require the parliament ’ s approval .
included in this compulsory spending , for example , are the agricultural budgets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simone veil was the president of the european parliament from 1979 to 1982 the parliament also has the right of codetermination with regard to eu expansion .
it must agree to all eu-entry-related decisions made by the commission and the council .
it also has the power to block decisions related to the european market .
the treaty of lisbon , which has not yet been ratified by all eu member states , aims to give the european parliament even more power in relation to the council and the commission . important decisions in december 1979 the parliament displayed its power for the first time .
its president , simone veil , refused to sign the financial plan for 1980 and thus forced the commission to amend it .
the parliament has periodically blocked budget decisions in the following years . during the appointment of the european commission in 2004 , the parliament made the first use of its veto rights .
it rejected the conservative italian rocco buttiglione , who had been nominated for the position of commissioner for justice , freedom and security . the parliament also brings forth its own legislative ideas and in this way contributes actively to the eu decision-making process .
numerous laws relating to consumer protection , climate protection , civil rights and labor have been created in this way . torsten spies / ew editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the european parliament has been directly elected by european citizens for 30 years .
unlike national parliaments , which usually elect their heads of state , the european parliament does not elect a pan-european government .
this is why it has no real majority or opposition parties " the factions and majorities among us form around issues , " klaus haensch , a representative from germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , explained .
hänsch has been a member of the european parliament for 30 years , and was the parliament ’ s president from 1994 to 1997 . unlike other legislative bodies , media scandals and power struggles are not usually a feature of the european parliament .
jacki davis from the european policy center , a brussels-based political think tank , contended that while the parliamentary debates might not always be particularly exciting , the european parliament is very important because its members have a lot of power . the members of the parliament have a say in decisions regarding around 80 percent of all european laws and principles .
an estimated 30 to 50 percent of all laws that affect the eu member states are directly codetermined by the european parliament .
the effects of this legislation on the daily lives of the 500 million eu citizens are significant , even if many voters are not aware of this fact . more rights , but still not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does the parliament have too few rights ? the european parliament is just one of the two chambers of the eu legislative body .
the parliamentarians share power with the council of the european union -lrb- also known as the council of ministers -rrb- , in which the various national governments are represented .
both chambers vote for bills drafted by the european commission .
however , the parliament does not have the power to propose its own laws . " with each treaty - from maastricht to amsterdam to nizza - the parliament has acquired new rights and power over new policy areas , " jacki davis explained . today only agricultural policy , foreign policy , justice policy and the health care system are excluded from the parliament ’ s sphere of power . lots of parlamentarians but little time for member of parliament hans-peter martin , who doesn ’ t belong to any political faction , the parliament still has too few rights .
lobbyists and bureaucrats influence a lot of decisions , he said .
for example , the parliament does not have its own scientific department to thoroughly prepare its members for making certain decisions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it important to participate in eu elections " : hans-peter martin the parliamentarians often rely on the opinions of lobbyists to make up for this lack of scientific briefing .
but despite these shortcomings , it 's still important to vote , martin said .
because after all , the european parliament is the only democratically elected eu institution . in comparison to national parliaments in europe , a single member of the european parliament has less influence .
this is mostly due to the institution 's large size : 785 members from 27 eu member states .
they are divided into seven factions , and these in turn are divided into national groups .
the largest groups are the conservatives , the socialists and the liberals . the number of parliamentarians has increased tenfold since the parliament ’ s establishment in the 1950s .
today there are few opportunites to make big , memorable speeches .
in fact , their speaking time in debates is usually limited to just one minute . bernd riegert / euranet / ew editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the czech communist party parliamentarian used to be an astronaut and took part in a russian space mission in the 1970s .
he was the first man in space from outside the soviet union or united states .
from the soyuz 28 spaceship in 1978 , vladimir remek thanked the central committee of the soviet communist party and comrade leonid brezhnev for giving him the chance to take part in the mission .
thirty-one years later , the former cosmonaut spoke at a communist party election rally in the small czech city of hradec kralové .
the few in attendance were mainly elderly people who fondly remembered the days when remek was a national hero .
" a year after his flight he visited a school where i was the head teacher and spoke to the children , " one woman remembered .
" people came from all around - some walked five kilometers just to see him . "
" he was extremely popular .

he conceded his huge communist-era fame contributed to his success at the ballot box .
“ i think it definitely played a role , because i can say in all modesty i was known throughout society , " remek said .
" but at the same time i think many people understood that i ’ ve done much more . "
" for instance , i represented czech machinery firms in russia , i was a diplomat in the field of trade at the czechoslovak embassy in moscow , " he explained .
" so i ’ ve achieved more than that space flight .
but it ’ s true that ’ s what made me well known . ”
bringing experience in space to brussels after five years representing the czech republic in brussels and strasbourg , remek can compare life in space and life in the european parliament , in a way few other parlementarians can .
“ in space or any kind of flight cooperation is an absolute given , so that the plane or spacecraft fulfills its mission and lands safely , " remek said .
" there are strict rules .
they exist in the european parliament too , but it ’ s all about discussion . "

" the european parliament has been directly elected by european citizens for 30 years .
unlike national parliaments , which usually elect their heads of state , the european parliament does not elect a pan-european government .
this is why it has no real majority or opposition parties " the factions and majorities among us form around issues , " klaus haensch , a representative from germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , explained .
hänsch has been a member of the european parliament for 30 years , and was the parliament ’ s president from 1994 to 1997 . unlike other legislative bodies , media scandals and power struggles are not usually a feature of the european parliament .
jacki davis from the european policy center , a brussels-based political think tank , contended that while the parliamentary debates might not always be particularly exciting , the european parliament is very important because its members have a lot of power . the members of the parliament have a say in decisions regarding around 80 percent of all european laws and principles .
an estimated 30 to 50 percent of all laws that affect the eu member states are directly codetermined by the european parliament .
the effects of this legislation on the daily lives of the 500 million eu citizens are significant , even if many voters are not aware of this fact . more rights , but still not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does the parliament have too few rights ? the european parliament is just one of the two chambers of the eu legislative body .
the parliamentarians share power with the council of the european union -lrb- also known as the council of ministers -rrb- , in which the various national governments are represented .
both chambers vote for bills drafted by the european commission .
however , the parliament does not have the power to propose its own laws . " with each treaty - from maastricht to amsterdam to nizza - the parliament has acquired new rights and power over new policy areas , " jacki davis explained . today only agricultural policy , foreign policy , justice policy and the health care system are excluded from the parliament ’ s sphere of power . lots of parlamentarians but little time for member of parliament hans-peter martin , who doesn ’ t belong to any political faction , the parliament still has too few rights .
lobbyists and bureaucrats influence a lot of decisions , he said .
for example , the parliament does not have its own scientific department to thoroughly prepare its members for making certain decisions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it important to participate in eu elections " : hans-peter martin the parliamentarians often rely on the opinions of lobbyists to make up for this lack of scientific briefing .
but despite these shortcomings , it 's still important to vote , martin said .
because after all , the european parliament is the only democratically elected eu institution . in comparison to national parliaments in europe , a single member of the european parliament has less influence .
this is mostly due to the institution 's large size : 785 members from 27 eu member states .
they are divided into seven factions , and these in turn are divided into national groups .
the largest groups are the conservatives , the socialists and the liberals . the number of parliamentarians has increased tenfold since the parliament ’ s establishment in the 1950s .
today there are few opportunites to make big , memorable speeches .
in fact , their speaking time in debates is usually limited to just one minute . bernd riegert / euranet / ew editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their first of many shows in the north german port city was at the indra club on august 17 , 1960 .
at the shows in hamburg , the band -lrb- then with five members -rrb- would play for hours , often playing several clubs in the same night . through these early concerts , the beatles began to develop the sound that would come to be their trademark .
it was also in hamburg that ringo starr made his first appearance as the band 's new drummer . beatlemania the beatlemania museum takes visitors to a time when the beatles were all the rage .
the walls duplicate the style of the hamburg clubs where the band once played , and there ’ s beatles memorabilia of all kinds .
one room is decorated to look like the bedroom of a young beatles fan , filled from top to bottom with beatles collectables . visitors can marvel over the original version of the beatles ' first record contract , which was signed in hamburg , or read postcards sent by ringo starr to his grandmother in liverpool , in which he sings the praises of the german city .
there are even womens ’ stockings with a beatles logo woven in . further on in the museum , visitors can sneak a peak backstage at a beatles concert , or sit in a theater filled with a recording of hysterical screams from beatles fans .

there 's a constant stream of questions coming in from people around the world wanting to know more about hamburg ’ s links with the beatles . but one question remains : why was hamburg the city where the beatles got their start ?
that ’ s a question uwe blascke , one of the museum 's founders , feels no need to answer . “ that question answers itself , ” he says .

more specifically , it can legislate on issues , such as the free movement of workers , education , market policies and environmental protection .
parliament has only a " consultative " role on judicial issues , foreign policy , taxation , industrial policy and in agricultural affairs , but eu member states are not bound to follow the parliament 's opinion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parliament only plays a consultative role on issues like turkey 's bid to join the eu the european parliament , however , does have a power of political initiative .
it can ask the commission to present legislative proposals for laws on particular issues .
budgetary powers : the european parliament and the council of the european union together constitute the eu 's budgetary authority , which decides each year on its expenditures and revenues .
in the case of " compulsory expenditures " , related to international agreements and agriculture , it is the council that has the last word .
in the case of " non-compulsory expenditures " , parliament decides in close collaboration with the council .
these include areas such as rural development , infrastructure and research .
parliament also monitors how the eu 's executive , the european commission , implements the budget .
oversight powers : the european parliament has major supervisory powers over the activities of the european union .
it can take the commission or the council to the european court , if it believes they have broken eu law .

it also has the right to fire the commission .
future role : if the eu 's stalled lisbon treaty is finally agreed on by all 27-member states , the eu parliament will gain powers over the entire eu budget , many areas of justice policy , and the appointment of the high representative , the eu 's top diplomat. gb / eup / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the european parliament has been directly elected by european citizens for 30 years .
unlike national parliaments , which usually elect their heads of state , the european parliament does not elect a pan-european government .
this is why it has no real majority or opposition parties " the factions and majorities among us form around issues , " klaus haensch , a representative from germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , explained .
hänsch has been a member of the european parliament for 30 years , and was the parliament ’ s president from 1994 to 1997 . unlike other legislative bodies , media scandals and power struggles are not usually a feature of the european parliament .
jacki davis from the european policy center , a brussels-based political think tank , contended that while the parliamentary debates might not always be particularly exciting , the european parliament is very important because its members have a lot of power . the members of the parliament have a say in decisions regarding around 80 percent of all european laws and principles .
an estimated 30 to 50 percent of all laws that affect the eu member states are directly codetermined by the european parliament .
the effects of this legislation on the daily lives of the 500 million eu citizens are significant , even if many voters are not aware of this fact . more rights , but still not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does the parliament have too few rights ? the european parliament is just one of the two chambers of the eu legislative body .
the parliamentarians share power with the council of the european union -lrb- also known as the council of ministers -rrb- , in which the various national governments are represented .
both chambers vote for bills drafted by the european commission .
however , the parliament does not have the power to propose its own laws . " with each treaty - from maastricht to amsterdam to nizza - the parliament has acquired new rights and power over new policy areas , " jacki davis explained . today only agricultural policy , foreign policy , justice policy and the health care system are excluded from the parliament ’ s sphere of power . lots of parlamentarians but little time for member of parliament hans-peter martin , who doesn ’ t belong to any political faction , the parliament still has too few rights .
lobbyists and bureaucrats influence a lot of decisions , he said .
for example , the parliament does not have its own scientific department to thoroughly prepare its members for making certain decisions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it important to participate in eu elections " : hans-peter martin the parliamentarians often rely on the opinions of lobbyists to make up for this lack of scientific briefing .
but despite these shortcomings , it 's still important to vote , martin said .
because after all , the european parliament is the only democratically elected eu institution . in comparison to national parliaments in europe , a single member of the european parliament has less influence .
this is mostly due to the institution 's large size : 785 members from 27 eu member states .
they are divided into seven factions , and these in turn are divided into national groups .
the largest groups are the conservatives , the socialists and the liberals . the number of parliamentarians has increased tenfold since the parliament ’ s establishment in the 1950s .
today there are few opportunites to make big , memorable speeches .
in fact , their speaking time in debates is usually limited to just one minute . bernd riegert / euranet / ew editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the european parliament has been directly elected by european citizens for 30 years .
unlike national parliaments , which usually elect their heads of state , the european parliament does not elect a pan-european government .
this is why it has no real majority or opposition parties " the factions and majorities among us form around issues , " klaus haensch , a representative from germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , explained .
hänsch has been a member of the european parliament for 30 years , and was the parliament ’ s president from 1994 to 1997 . unlike other legislative bodies , media scandals and power struggles are not usually a feature of the european parliament .
jacki davis from the european policy center , a brussels-based political think tank , contended that while the parliamentary debates might not always be particularly exciting , the european parliament is very important because its members have a lot of power . the members of the parliament have a say in decisions regarding around 80 percent of all european laws and principles .
an estimated 30 to 50 percent of all laws that affect the eu member states are directly codetermined by the european parliament .
the effects of this legislation on the daily lives of the 500 million eu citizens are significant , even if many voters are not aware of this fact . more rights , but still not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does the parliament have too few rights ? the european parliament is just one of the two chambers of the eu legislative body .
the parliamentarians share power with the council of the european union -lrb- also known as the council of ministers -rrb- , in which the various national governments are represented .
both chambers vote for bills drafted by the european commission .
however , the parliament does not have the power to propose its own laws . " with each treaty - from maastricht to amsterdam to nizza - the parliament has acquired new rights and power over new policy areas , " jacki davis explained . today only agricultural policy , foreign policy , justice policy and the health care system are excluded from the parliament ’ s sphere of power . lots of parlamentarians but little time for member of parliament hans-peter martin , who doesn ’ t belong to any political faction , the parliament still has too few rights .
lobbyists and bureaucrats influence a lot of decisions , he said .
for example , the parliament does not have its own scientific department to thoroughly prepare its members for making certain decisions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it important to participate in eu elections " : hans-peter martin the parliamentarians often rely on the opinions of lobbyists to make up for this lack of scientific briefing .
but despite these shortcomings , it 's still important to vote , martin said .
because after all , the european parliament is the only democratically elected eu institution . in comparison to national parliaments in europe , a single member of the european parliament has less influence .
this is mostly due to the institution 's large size : 785 members from 27 eu member states .
they are divided into seven factions , and these in turn are divided into national groups .
the largest groups are the conservatives , the socialists and the liberals . the number of parliamentarians has increased tenfold since the parliament ’ s establishment in the 1950s .

one example of this is that the european parliament is actually based in three different cities : strasbourg , brussels and luxembourg . " i personally think that this parliament , with its 40 weeks of sessions , should not be additionally burdened with this whole traveling circus , " said michael gahler , eu parliamentarian and member of germany 's christian democratic union party -lrb- cdu -rrb- . gahler said he believes that with so many pressing issues , the parliamentarians can not afford to waste time traveling . more seats , more costs , more work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strasbourg is the official seat of the parliament many parliamentarians and eu citizens have the same opinion .
there has been much debate in recent years about whether the european parliament really needs to have three locations .
the official headquarters are in strasbourg , france , but this parliament building is only used 48 days of the year - for plenary sessions .
all other plenary , committee and faction meetings take place in brussels , belgium .
the largest part of the parliament 's administration , the secretariat , is based in luxembourg . " we find this very inconvenient and expensive , " eu parliamentarian wolf klinz said .
moving locations throughout the year costs around 200 million euros -lrb- $ 284 million -rrb- , klinz explained , and does not make the work any easier . " we are in favor of only having a base in brussels , " klinz said .

according to critics , this not only drains finances , but also creates 20,000 tons of carbon emissions .
this is why parliament members from various factions started the one seat campaign in 2006 , with the aim of moving all parliament activities to brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo bullmann : " no more separation from brussels " 1.25 million eu citizens have also signed the one seat campaign petition on the internet .
but why brussels rather than strasbourg ? udo bullmann , eu parliamentarian and member of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , explained : " we as the parliament need proximity to the commission and the council .
we can not afford to travel hundreds of kilometers . " strasbourg is not a feasible option because the other political bodies have their seat in brussels , according to bullmann . strasbourg a symbol of european unity but it is not as simple as it sounds .
strasbourg is place of historical importance for europe .
the city symbolizes french-german reconciliation after world war ii and the beginning of european unification .
in 1997 eu member states were united in the decision to make strasbourg the official seat of the parliament .
up until now , all attempts to change this have been stymied by france 's resistance . according to gahler , there should be more public pressure to force france and luxembourg to alter their position on the topic .
" it 's a question of time , but in the future i would like to see the parliament not providing so much room for attacks on itself .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the parliament 's secretariat has its seat in luxembourg however , among european conservatives , michael gahler represents a minority opinion .
on the french side there is great concern about losing something meaningful if the eu parliament were not officially based in strasbourg . but the council of europe and the european court of human rights , both important , non-eu , international bodies , would still remain in strasbourg .
and there are many ideas for making up such a move to france . a european university , a european diplomatic academy and a concentration of european jurisdiction are just some of the new possibilities for strasbourg .
however , any changes of this sort require the agreement of all 27 eu member states , including , of course , france and luxembourg . thus there is a good chance that the european parliament will continue to have three locations for some years to come . nina funke-kaiser / ew editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but why brussels rather than strasbourg ? udo bullmann , eu parliamentarian and member of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , explained : " we as the parliament need proximity to the commission and the council .
we can not afford to travel hundreds of kilometers . " strasbourg is not a feasible option because the other political bodies have their seat in brussels , according to bullmann . strasbourg a symbol of european unity but it is not as simple as it sounds .
strasbourg is place of historical importance for europe .
the city symbolizes french-german reconciliation after world war ii and the beginning of european unification .
in 1997 eu member states were united in the decision to make strasbourg the official seat of the parliament .
up until now , all attempts to change this have been stymied by france 's resistance . according to gahler , there should be more public pressure to force france and luxembourg to alter their position on the topic .
" it 's a question of time , but in the future i would like to see the parliament not providing so much room for attacks on itself .
because almost every visitor group that i meet , someone raises this question , and i 'm forced to say that i do n't agree with the current situation . " what will become of strasbourg ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the parliament 's secretariat has its seat in luxembourg however , among european conservatives , michael gahler represents a minority opinion .
on the french side there is great concern about losing something meaningful if the eu parliament were not officially based in strasbourg . but the council of europe and the european court of human rights , both important , non-eu , international bodies , would still remain in strasbourg .
and there are many ideas for making up such a move to france . a european university , a european diplomatic academy and a concentration of european jurisdiction are just some of the new possibilities for strasbourg .
however , any changes of this sort require the agreement of all 27 eu member states , including , of course , france and luxembourg . thus there is a good chance that the european parliament will continue to have three locations for some years to come . nina funke-kaiser / ew editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite its growing influence , the number of voters has been sinking since the first eu elections in 1979 . the first european union election took place 30 years ago and 63 percent of the eligible voters showed up to have their voices heard .
since then , the european parliament has been one of the eu ’ s major political institutions .
while the council of the european union is made up of various ministers of the member states and the european commission 's members are appointed by the european council , the european parliament is the only directly elected body , giving citizens a chance to influence european politics . 30 years ago , the parliament played a mostly advisory role .
the council was obliged to acknowledge the parliament ’ s opinion in important matters , but was not forced to accept it .
even then , however , some parts of the budget required the approval of parliament . since then , the parliament ’ s authority has steadily increased , but the voter turnout at eu elections has plummeted .
at the last election in 2004 it stood at just 45.6 percent .

despite its growing influence , the number of voters has been sinking since the first eu elections in 1979 . the first european union election took place 30 years ago and 63 percent of the eligible voters showed up to have their voices heard .
since then , the european parliament has been one of the eu ’ s major political institutions .
while the council of the european union is made up of various ministers of the member states and the european commission 's members are appointed by the european council , the european parliament is the only directly elected body , giving citizens a chance to influence european politics . 30 years ago , the parliament played a mostly advisory role .
the council was obliged to acknowledge the parliament ’ s opinion in important matters , but was not forced to accept it .
even then , however , some parts of the budget required the approval of parliament . since then , the parliament ’ s authority has steadily increased , but the voter turnout at eu elections has plummeted .
at the last election in 2004 it stood at just 45.6 percent .

every december the parliament must approve an eu budget for the following year .

the czech communist party parliamentarian used to be an astronaut and took part in a russian space mission in the 1970s .
he was the first man in space from outside the soviet union or united states .
from the soyuz 28 spaceship in 1978 , vladimir remek thanked the central committee of the soviet communist party and comrade leonid brezhnev for giving him the chance to take part in the mission .
thirty-one years later , the former cosmonaut spoke at a communist party election rally in the small czech city of hradec kralové .
the few in attendance were mainly elderly people who fondly remembered the days when remek was a national hero .
" a year after his flight he visited a school where i was the head teacher and spoke to the children , " one woman remembered .
" people came from all around - some walked five kilometers just to see him . "
" he was extremely popular .
but he has always been modest too , so … he 'll get my vote . "
meteoric rise to stardom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remek -lrb- left -rrb- inspects casks of the famous czech bitters becherovka in his capacity as a czech mep vladimir remek , who unsurprisingly was a party member under the former regime , stood successfully for the czech communist party in the last elections to the european parliament in 2004 .
he conceded his huge communist-era fame contributed to his success at the ballot box .

the czech communist party parliamentarian used to be an astronaut and took part in a russian space mission in the 1970s .
he was the first man in space from outside the soviet union or united states .
from the soyuz 28 spaceship in 1978 , vladimir remek thanked the central committee of the soviet communist party and comrade leonid brezhnev for giving him the chance to take part in the mission .
thirty-one years later , the former cosmonaut spoke at a communist party election rally in the small czech city of hradec kralové .
the few in attendance were mainly elderly people who fondly remembered the days when remek was a national hero .
" a year after his flight he visited a school where i was the head teacher and spoke to the children , " one woman remembered .
" people came from all around - some walked five kilometers just to see him . "
" he was extremely popular .
but he has always been modest too , so … he 'll get my vote . "

he conceded his huge communist-era fame contributed to his success at the ballot box .
“ i think it definitely played a role , because i can say in all modesty i was known throughout society , " remek said .
" but at the same time i think many people understood that i ’ ve done much more . "
" for instance , i represented czech machinery firms in russia , i was a diplomat in the field of trade at the czechoslovak embassy in moscow , " he explained .
" so i ’ ve achieved more than that space flight .

the united states government is set to own 60 percent of the " new gm , " which amounts to an unprecedented level of us government involvement in a large american company .
gm 's bankruptcy is expected to be legally complicated , in particular because of the company 's international reach , which includes german subsidiary opel .
only gm 's us brands were included in monday 's bankruptcy filing .
the us treasury would provide approximately $ 30.1 billion -lrb- 21 billion euros -rrb- in funds .
in exchange , the us government would receive about $ 8.8 billion in preferred stock and debt , and roughly 60 percent equity in the automaker .
in return for their concessions , the united auto workers trade union would be able to select a director to serve on the gm board with no voting rights .
as part of its restructuring , gm would establish the voluntary employee benefits association -lrb- veba -rrb- , a trust that would provide health care benefits for retired uaw workers .
in return the veba trust would receive 17.5 percent of the restructured gm 's equity and will have the right to buy a further two and a half percent .
canadian money canada is also getting involved financially by contributing $ 10 billion dollars and receiving a 12 percent stake in the new gm .
it is also to have a right to select one initial member of the board .
this is on top of the $ 20 billion that has already been given to the struggling automaker since last december .
in return , gm is to eliminate over 30,000 jobs , sell off many of its over a dozen brands , among which are hummer , saab , and saturn .
it is currently looking for a buyer for volvo .
according to officials , the us government is a " reluctant " equity holder and will keep its involvement to a minimum .
it will also seek to dispose of its equity as soon as possible. av / reuters / dpa / ap editor : chuck penfold / trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the european parliament has been directly elected by european citizens for 30 years .
unlike national parliaments , which usually elect their heads of state , the european parliament does not elect a pan-european government .
this is why it has no real majority or opposition parties " the factions and majorities among us form around issues , " klaus haensch , a representative from germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , explained .
hänsch has been a member of the european parliament for 30 years , and was the parliament ’ s president from 1994 to 1997 . unlike other legislative bodies , media scandals and power struggles are not usually a feature of the european parliament .
jacki davis from the european policy center , a brussels-based political think tank , contended that while the parliamentary debates might not always be particularly exciting , the european parliament is very important because its members have a lot of power . the members of the parliament have a say in decisions regarding around 80 percent of all european laws and principles .
an estimated 30 to 50 percent of all laws that affect the eu member states are directly codetermined by the european parliament .
the effects of this legislation on the daily lives of the 500 million eu citizens are significant , even if many voters are not aware of this fact . more rights , but still not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does the parliament have too few rights ? the european parliament is just one of the two chambers of the eu legislative body .
the parliamentarians share power with the council of the european union -lrb- also known as the council of ministers -rrb- , in which the various national governments are represented .
both chambers vote for bills drafted by the european commission .
however , the parliament does not have the power to propose its own laws . " with each treaty - from maastricht to amsterdam to nizza - the parliament has acquired new rights and power over new policy areas , " jacki davis explained . today only agricultural policy , foreign policy , justice policy and the health care system are excluded from the parliament ’ s sphere of power . lots of parlamentarians but little time for member of parliament hans-peter martin , who doesn ’ t belong to any political faction , the parliament still has too few rights .
lobbyists and bureaucrats influence a lot of decisions , he said .
for example , the parliament does not have its own scientific department to thoroughly prepare its members for making certain decisions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it important to participate in eu elections " : hans-peter martin the parliamentarians often rely on the opinions of lobbyists to make up for this lack of scientific briefing .
but despite these shortcomings , it 's still important to vote , martin said .
because after all , the european parliament is the only democratically elected eu institution . in comparison to national parliaments in europe , a single member of the european parliament has less influence .
this is mostly due to the institution 's large size : 785 members from 27 eu member states .
they are divided into seven factions , and these in turn are divided into national groups .
the largest groups are the conservatives , the socialists and the liberals . the number of parliamentarians has increased tenfold since the parliament ’ s establishment in the 1950s .
today there are few opportunites to make big , memorable speeches .
in fact , their speaking time in debates is usually limited to just one minute . bernd riegert / euranet / ew editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite its growing influence , the number of voters has been sinking since the first eu elections in 1979 . the first european union election took place 30 years ago and 63 percent of the eligible voters showed up to have their voices heard .
since then , the european parliament has been one of the eu ’ s major political institutions .
while the council of the european union is made up of various ministers of the member states and the european commission 's members are appointed by the european council , the european parliament is the only directly elected body , giving citizens a chance to influence european politics . 30 years ago , the parliament played a mostly advisory role .
the council was obliged to acknowledge the parliament ’ s opinion in important matters , but was not forced to accept it .
even then , however , some parts of the budget required the approval of parliament . since then , the parliament ’ s authority has steadily increased , but the voter turnout at eu elections has plummeted .
at the last election in 2004 it stood at just 45.6 percent .
many feel that the reason for this decline lies in the complicated structures of eu bureaucracy , which can be difficult to understand .
those who do not know what the european parliament is and what it does are unlikely to be interested in voting for it . the parliament ’ s playing field bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the plenary hall in the european parliament in brussels today , the european parliament has to officially approve the european council ’ s nominations of members of the european commission .
like the us congress , the parliament tends to accept the suggestions of commissioners . the commission also has to justify its activities to the parliament and any of its members can be discharged at any time through a vote of no-confidence . the codecision procedure , which has been in place since the 1992 maastricht treaty , puts the parliament on equal footing with the council in many law-making processes .
both chambers have the right to reject the european commission ’ s proposals .
this system applies to more than 75 percent of all eu laws .
exceptions to this rule include some key areas such as a common foreign and security policy , as well as the areas of justice and interior affairs . the parliament ’ s third sphere of authority is the budget .
every december the parliament must approve an eu budget for the following year .
however , there are some exceptions to this rule , too .
all of the so-called compulsory spending - the funds that the european union needs to carry out its duties - do not require the parliament ’ s approval .
included in this compulsory spending , for example , are the agricultural budgets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simone veil was the president of the european parliament from 1979 to 1982 the parliament also has the right of codetermination with regard to eu expansion .
it must agree to all eu-entry-related decisions made by the commission and the council .
it also has the power to block decisions related to the european market .
the treaty of lisbon , which has not yet been ratified by all eu member states , aims to give the european parliament even more power in relation to the council and the commission . important decisions in december 1979 the parliament displayed its power for the first time .
its president , simone veil , refused to sign the financial plan for 1980 and thus forced the commission to amend it .
the parliament has periodically blocked budget decisions in the following years . during the appointment of the european commission in 2004 , the parliament made the first use of its veto rights .
it rejected the conservative italian rocco buttiglione , who had been nominated for the position of commissioner for justice , freedom and security . the parliament also brings forth its own legislative ideas and in this way contributes actively to the eu decision-making process .
numerous laws relating to consumer protection , climate protection , civil rights and labor have been created in this way . torsten spies / ew editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the united states government is set to own 60 percent of the " new gm , " which amounts to an unprecedented level of us government involvement in a large american company .
gm 's bankruptcy is expected to be legally complicated , in particular because of the company 's international reach , which includes german subsidiary opel .
only gm 's us brands were included in monday 's bankruptcy filing .
the us treasury would provide approximately $ 30.1 billion -lrb- 21 billion euros -rrb- in funds .
in exchange , the us government would receive about $ 8.8 billion in preferred stock and debt , and roughly 60 percent equity in the automaker .
in return for their concessions , the united auto workers trade union would be able to select a director to serve on the gm board with no voting rights .
as part of its restructuring , gm would establish the voluntary employee benefits association -lrb- veba -rrb- , a trust that would provide health care benefits for retired uaw workers .
in return the veba trust would receive 17.5 percent of the restructured gm 's equity and will have the right to buy a further two and a half percent .
canadian money canada is also getting involved financially by contributing $ 10 billion dollars and receiving a 12 percent stake in the new gm .
it is also to have a right to select one initial member of the board .
this is on top of the $ 20 billion that has already been given to the struggling automaker since last december .
in return , gm is to eliminate over 30,000 jobs , sell off many of its over a dozen brands , among which are hummer , saab , and saturn .
it is currently looking for a buyer for volvo .
according to officials , the us government is a " reluctant " equity holder and will keep its involvement to a minimum .

strasbourg is place of historical importance for europe .
the city symbolizes french-german reconciliation after world war ii and the beginning of european unification .

up until now , all attempts to change this have been stymied by france 's resistance . according to gahler , there should be more public pressure to force france and luxembourg to alter their position on the topic .

" i personally think that this parliament , with its 40 weeks of sessions , should not be additionally burdened with this whole traveling circus , " said michael gahler , eu parliamentarian and member of germany 's christian democratic union party -lrb- cdu -rrb- . gahler said he believes that with so many pressing issues , the parliamentarians can not afford to waste time traveling . more seats , more costs , more work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strasbourg is the official seat of the parliament many parliamentarians and eu citizens have the same opinion .
there has been much debate in recent years about whether the european parliament really needs to have three locations .
the official headquarters are in strasbourg , france , but this parliament building is only used 48 days of the year - for plenary sessions .
all other plenary , committee and faction meetings take place in brussels , belgium .
the largest part of the parliament 's administration , the secretariat , is based in luxembourg . " we find this very inconvenient and expensive , " eu parliamentarian wolf klinz said .
moving locations throughout the year costs around 200 million euros -lrb- $ 284 million -rrb- , klinz explained , and does not make the work any easier . " we are in favor of only having a base in brussels , " klinz said .
his party , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- of germany , is demanding the parliament 's complete relocation to brussels , putting a stop to what he also termed a " traveling circus . " a lot of support for the one-location option once a month , all 785 eu parliamentarians and 3,000 staff members travel from brussels to strasbourg for a plenary session , and then back again .
according to critics , this not only drains finances , but also creates 20,000 tons of carbon emissions .
this is why parliament members from various factions started the one seat campaign in 2006 , with the aim of moving all parliament activities to brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo bullmann : " no more separation from brussels " 1.25 million eu citizens have also signed the one seat campaign petition on the internet .
but why brussels rather than strasbourg ? udo bullmann , eu parliamentarian and member of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , explained : " we as the parliament need proximity to the commission and the council .
we can not afford to travel hundreds of kilometers . " strasbourg is not a feasible option because the other political bodies have their seat in brussels , according to bullmann . strasbourg a symbol of european unity but it is not as simple as it sounds .
strasbourg is place of historical importance for europe .
the city symbolizes french-german reconciliation after world war ii and the beginning of european unification .
in 1997 eu member states were united in the decision to make strasbourg the official seat of the parliament .
up until now , all attempts to change this have been stymied by france 's resistance . according to gahler , there should be more public pressure to force france and luxembourg to alter their position on the topic .
" it 's a question of time , but in the future i would like to see the parliament not providing so much room for attacks on itself .
because almost every visitor group that i meet , someone raises this question , and i 'm forced to say that i do n't agree with the current situation . " what will become of strasbourg ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the parliament 's secretariat has its seat in luxembourg however , among european conservatives , michael gahler represents a minority opinion .
on the french side there is great concern about losing something meaningful if the eu parliament were not officially based in strasbourg . but the council of europe and the european court of human rights , both important , non-eu , international bodies , would still remain in strasbourg .
and there are many ideas for making up such a move to france . a european university , a european diplomatic academy and a concentration of european jurisdiction are just some of the new possibilities for strasbourg .
however , any changes of this sort require the agreement of all 27 eu member states , including , of course , france and luxembourg . thus there is a good chance that the european parliament will continue to have three locations for some years to come . nina funke-kaiser / ew editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the czech communist party parliamentarian used to be an astronaut and took part in a russian space mission in the 1970s .
he was the first man in space from outside the soviet union or united states .
from the soyuz 28 spaceship in 1978 , vladimir remek thanked the central committee of the soviet communist party and comrade leonid brezhnev for giving him the chance to take part in the mission .
thirty-one years later , the former cosmonaut spoke at a communist party election rally in the small czech city of hradec kralové .
the few in attendance were mainly elderly people who fondly remembered the days when remek was a national hero .
" a year after his flight he visited a school where i was the head teacher and spoke to the children , " one woman remembered .
" people came from all around - some walked five kilometers just to see him . "
" he was extremely popular .
but he has always been modest too , so … he 'll get my vote . "
meteoric rise to stardom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remek -lrb- left -rrb- inspects casks of the famous czech bitters becherovka in his capacity as a czech mep vladimir remek , who unsurprisingly was a party member under the former regime , stood successfully for the czech communist party in the last elections to the european parliament in 2004 .
he conceded his huge communist-era fame contributed to his success at the ballot box .
“ i think it definitely played a role , because i can say in all modesty i was known throughout society , " remek said .
" but at the same time i think many people understood that i ’ ve done much more . "
" for instance , i represented czech machinery firms in russia , i was a diplomat in the field of trade at the czechoslovak embassy in moscow , " he explained .
" so i ’ ve achieved more than that space flight .
but it ’ s true that ’ s what made me well known . ”
bringing experience in space to brussels after five years representing the czech republic in brussels and strasbourg , remek can compare life in space and life in the european parliament , in a way few other parlementarians can .
“ in space or any kind of flight cooperation is an absolute given , so that the plane or spacecraft fulfills its mission and lands safely , " remek said .
" there are strict rules .
they exist in the european parliament too , but it ’ s all about discussion . "
" when you fly not every decision is a matter of life and death , " he said .
" in the parliament it is about life in a way , because our decisions affect people ’ s lives . ”
vladimir remek isn ’ t the only former astronaut in the european parliament .
the italian mep umberto guidoni - also in the group of the united left - flew two nasa space shuttle missions .
he too is standing for re-election .

the few in attendance were mainly elderly people who fondly remembered the days when remek was a national hero .
" a year after his flight he visited a school where i was the head teacher and spoke to the children , " one woman remembered .
" people came from all around - some walked five kilometers just to see him . "
" he was extremely popular .
but he has always been modest too , so … he 'll get my vote . "
meteoric rise to stardom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remek -lrb- left -rrb- inspects casks of the famous czech bitters becherovka in his capacity as a czech mep vladimir remek , who unsurprisingly was a party member under the former regime , stood successfully for the czech communist party in the last elections to the european parliament in 2004 .
he conceded his huge communist-era fame contributed to his success at the ballot box .
“ i think it definitely played a role , because i can say in all modesty i was known throughout society , " remek said .
" but at the same time i think many people understood that i ’ ve done much more . "
" for instance , i represented czech machinery firms in russia , i was a diplomat in the field of trade at the czechoslovak embassy in moscow , " he explained .
" so i ’ ve achieved more than that space flight .
but it ’ s true that ’ s what made me well known . ”
bringing experience in space to brussels after five years representing the czech republic in brussels and strasbourg , remek can compare life in space and life in the european parliament , in a way few other parlementarians can .
“ in space or any kind of flight cooperation is an absolute given , so that the plane or spacecraft fulfills its mission and lands safely , " remek said .
" there are strict rules .
they exist in the european parliament too , but it ’ s all about discussion . "
" when you fly not every decision is a matter of life and death , " he said .
" in the parliament it is about life in a way , because our decisions affect people ’ s lives . ”
vladimir remek isn ’ t the only former astronaut in the european parliament .
the italian mep umberto guidoni - also in the group of the united left - flew two nasa space shuttle missions .
he too is standing for re-election .

" the european parliament has been directly elected by european citizens for 30 years .
unlike national parliaments , which usually elect their heads of state , the european parliament does not elect a pan-european government .
this is why it has no real majority or opposition parties " the factions and majorities among us form around issues , " klaus haensch , a representative from germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , explained .
hänsch has been a member of the european parliament for 30 years , and was the parliament ’ s president from 1994 to 1997 . unlike other legislative bodies , media scandals and power struggles are not usually a feature of the european parliament .
jacki davis from the european policy center , a brussels-based political think tank , contended that while the parliamentary debates might not always be particularly exciting , the european parliament is very important because its members have a lot of power . the members of the parliament have a say in decisions regarding around 80 percent of all european laws and principles .
an estimated 30 to 50 percent of all laws that affect the eu member states are directly codetermined by the european parliament .
the effects of this legislation on the daily lives of the 500 million eu citizens are significant , even if many voters are not aware of this fact . more rights , but still not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does the parliament have too few rights ? the european parliament is just one of the two chambers of the eu legislative body .
the parliamentarians share power with the council of the european union -lrb- also known as the council of ministers -rrb- , in which the various national governments are represented .
both chambers vote for bills drafted by the european commission .
however , the parliament does not have the power to propose its own laws . " with each treaty - from maastricht to amsterdam to nizza - the parliament has acquired new rights and power over new policy areas , " jacki davis explained . today only agricultural policy , foreign policy , justice policy and the health care system are excluded from the parliament ’ s sphere of power . lots of parlamentarians but little time for member of parliament hans-peter martin , who doesn ’ t belong to any political faction , the parliament still has too few rights .
lobbyists and bureaucrats influence a lot of decisions , he said .
for example , the parliament does not have its own scientific department to thoroughly prepare its members for making certain decisions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it important to participate in eu elections " : hans-peter martin the parliamentarians often rely on the opinions of lobbyists to make up for this lack of scientific briefing .
but despite these shortcomings , it 's still important to vote , martin said .
because after all , the european parliament is the only democratically elected eu institution . in comparison to national parliaments in europe , a single member of the european parliament has less influence .
this is mostly due to the institution 's large size : 785 members from 27 eu member states .
they are divided into seven factions , and these in turn are divided into national groups .
the largest groups are the conservatives , the socialists and the liberals . the number of parliamentarians has increased tenfold since the parliament ’ s establishment in the 1950s .
today there are few opportunites to make big , memorable speeches .
in fact , their speaking time in debates is usually limited to just one minute . bernd riegert / euranet / ew editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite its growing influence , the number of voters has been sinking since the first eu elections in 1979 . the first european union election took place 30 years ago and 63 percent of the eligible voters showed up to have their voices heard .
since then , the european parliament has been one of the eu ’ s major political institutions .
while the council of the european union is made up of various ministers of the member states and the european commission 's members are appointed by the european council , the european parliament is the only directly elected body , giving citizens a chance to influence european politics . 30 years ago , the parliament played a mostly advisory role .
the council was obliged to acknowledge the parliament ’ s opinion in important matters , but was not forced to accept it .
even then , however , some parts of the budget required the approval of parliament . since then , the parliament ’ s authority has steadily increased , but the voter turnout at eu elections has plummeted .
at the last election in 2004 it stood at just 45.6 percent .
many feel that the reason for this decline lies in the complicated structures of eu bureaucracy , which can be difficult to understand .
those who do not know what the european parliament is and what it does are unlikely to be interested in voting for it . the parliament ’ s playing field bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the plenary hall in the european parliament in brussels today , the european parliament has to officially approve the european council ’ s nominations of members of the european commission .
like the us congress , the parliament tends to accept the suggestions of commissioners . the commission also has to justify its activities to the parliament and any of its members can be discharged at any time through a vote of no-confidence . the codecision procedure , which has been in place since the 1992 maastricht treaty , puts the parliament on equal footing with the council in many law-making processes .
both chambers have the right to reject the european commission ’ s proposals .
this system applies to more than 75 percent of all eu laws .
exceptions to this rule include some key areas such as a common foreign and security policy , as well as the areas of justice and interior affairs . the parliament ’ s third sphere of authority is the budget .
every december the parliament must approve an eu budget for the following year .
however , there are some exceptions to this rule , too .
all of the so-called compulsory spending - the funds that the european union needs to carry out its duties - do not require the parliament ’ s approval .
included in this compulsory spending , for example , are the agricultural budgets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simone veil was the president of the european parliament from 1979 to 1982 the parliament also has the right of codetermination with regard to eu expansion .
it must agree to all eu-entry-related decisions made by the commission and the council .
it also has the power to block decisions related to the european market .
the treaty of lisbon , which has not yet been ratified by all eu member states , aims to give the european parliament even more power in relation to the council and the commission . important decisions in december 1979 the parliament displayed its power for the first time .
its president , simone veil , refused to sign the financial plan for 1980 and thus forced the commission to amend it .
the parliament has periodically blocked budget decisions in the following years . during the appointment of the european commission in 2004 , the parliament made the first use of its veto rights .
it rejected the conservative italian rocco buttiglione , who had been nominated for the position of commissioner for justice , freedom and security . the parliament also brings forth its own legislative ideas and in this way contributes actively to the eu decision-making process .

none of its competitors is expected to win more than one seat rubiks is one of the most well-known public figures from latvia 's soviet years .
the 73-year-old politician was first secretary of the soviet communist party in latvia and head of the riga city council in the 1980s . a history of politcal dissidence rubiks strongly opposed latvian independence from the soviet union .
he was one of the supporters of a soviet putsch in 1991 , an attempt by a group of hard-liners to wrest control of the soviet union from president mikhail gorbachev .
when the putsch failed , rubiks was imprisoned for six years . later , rubiks was also against latvia joining the european union .
now as a candidate for the european parliament , he has softened his rhetoric and promises to concentrate on issues of social security in europe . however , his feelings on the eu remain clear .
" our country was like a small child that was just about to fall in the river , " rubiks said .
" and older people were warning against that .
i also thought that latvia was not ready to join the eu five years ago .
now this child has fallen into the river and it ’ s time to go and save it . " a representative for the russian-speaking minority concord center 's main supporters are the russian-speaking voters .
many of them see rubiks as a man of principle who stood up for his beliefs and their country 's only political martyr in recent history .
he is perceived as someone who speaks for the russian-speaking population , latvian political analyst viktor makarov said . rubiks might also be being sent off to the european parliament by his party because latvian laws do not allow him and other former leaders of the soviet communist party to participate in local parliamentary or municipal elections . a well-paid position in brussels could also be seen as a tribute to him by his party , political analyst iveta kazoka said . it ’ s not rubiks himself that people mostly support , but rather the opposition political party he represents , kazoka said .
his election could be a message of protest against the ruling parties that do not address the needs of the russian minority . artjoms konohovs / sjt editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

south ossetia 's election commission said two other parties won seats .
the people 's party , largely uncritical of kokoity , won 22.5 percent , while the communists took 22.2 percent .
the sidelined opposition did not get enough votes to win seats .
kokoity , a former wrestling champion , is accused by his critics of muzzling opponents and stealing aid money from russia as he tries to cement his hold on power .

a statement , released by the eu presidency in brussels , said the " eu does not accept the legality of the ' elections ' , nor its results . "
" the holding of such elections is illegitimate and represents a setback in the search for a peaceful and lasting settlement of the situation in georgia , " the statement concluded .

in geneva , russia and the united states have resumed talks on renewing their main cold war-era nuclear arms reduction treaty , start i. the talks have been overshadowed by alarm over north korea 's nuclear ambitions . russia and the united states have begun a second round of talks in geneva aimed at devising a follow-on treaty for start i. the strategic arms reduction treaty was signed in 1991 by the former cold war powers to make deep cuts in their own nuclear weapons arsenals .
it expires in december but still leaves the two powers heavily armed . as if to underscore the ever-present need to reign in proliferation , nuclear outsider north korea has been told by southeast asian leaders attending a two-day summit in south korea to cease its " provocative " acts .
pyongyang replied promptly on monday , saying it would " strengthen its nuclear deterrent . "
early last week , north korea defied united nations resolutions by staging an underground nuclear test , its second such detonation since 2006 , and renouncing the armistice that ended the war on the korean peninsula in 1953 .
on friday , the north fired a short-range missile , its sixth in a week , drawing more international condemnation .
south korea says north preparing missile in what could be a further escalation , south korea 's defense ministry says the north has moved a long-range missile to its launch base at dongchang-ri , on north korea 's west coast , near china .
according to south korean media , including the news agency yonghap and the daily newspaper joongang libo , south korean intelligence officials say the taepodong-2 missile is an " intercontinental " rocket that potentially could reach alaska .
they say launch preparations could take one to two more weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea has promised to " strengthen its nuclear deterrent " experts add , however , that north korea has not yet mastered the technology to miniaturize a nuclear warhead to mount on such a missile .
in april , north korea drew strong protests when it test fired a similar long-range rocket in the direction of japan .
visiting manila , us defense secretary robert gates said north korea 's intentions are " not clear . "
gates said he hoped a high-level us talks with china , japan , russia and south korea would help defuse tensions . visiting singapore at the weekend , gates had said pyongyang 's acts could spark an arms race with serious consequences for asia .
geneva start talks behind closed doors the start arms reduction talks in geneva are the second encounter involving us and russian envoys since us president barack obama and his russian counterpart dimitri medvedev met at the g-20 summit in london in april and agreed to strive for further reductions . russian diplomats say the presidents will unveil the first results of the start consultations at their planned summit in moscow in early july .
meantime , both sides have sworn confidentiality .
diplomats close to the geneva talks , spread over three days , say it is being held behind closed doors at russia 's mission .
progress is not expected to be swift .
recent russian-us relations have been troubled by tensions over the pro-western former soviet republic of georgia and russia 's objections to washington 's plan to site a us anti-missile shield in poland and the czech republic , ostensibly to counter a threat from iran .
russian military analyst alexander goltz says the start negotiations will help russia to restore its " status as a world power . " another analyst evgeny volk of the heritage foundation says president obama " needs a result " to demonstrate progress after the ' reset ' in us-russian relations declared early this year by his vice-president joseph biden .
in april while visiting prague , obama underscored his stance by saying his long-term goal was to create a " world without nuclear weapons . "
deep cuts but arsenals still large start i was signed in 1991 – shortly after the fall of europe 's iron curtain - by former us president george h. bush senior and the-then soviet president mikhail gorbachev .
it set up a system of bilateral inspections and stipulated that neither side could deploy more than 6,000 warheads and no more than 1,600 strategic delivery vehicles , including long-rang missiles , submarines and bomber aircraft .
that goal was reached by 2001 , still leaving both powers holding 90 percent of the world 's arsenals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some nuclear submarines have been decommissioned according to the us state department , at the beginning of january the united states had 550 intercontinental ballistic missiles ready for use ; russia had 469 such missiles , but with more warheads per missile .
russia does not publish its own figures .
in terms of warheads , the us said russia held 3,909 devices while the us military had 5,576 .
at the london summit in april , obama and medvedev pointed out that another treaty signed in 2002 , known as sort or the strategic offensive reductions treaty requires each power 's stockpile to be trimmed to a ceiling of between 1,700 - 2,200 nuclear warheads .
unlike start , however , it does not provide for verification systems .
thaw raises hopes for non-proliferation treaty review if a follow-on treaty supercedes start , stipulating further us and russian cuts , it could add fresh impulse to plans to revise the much wider non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- at a united nations review conference next year .
last friday , the permanent security council members , all nuclear powers , including china , france and britain , endorsed a review and an ambitious agenda under an algerian-mediated compromise .
that breakthrough at the long-running 65-member conference on disarmament at the un 's european offices in geneva ended more than a decade of deadlock .
at similar talks in 2005 not even an agenda was agreed. ipj / dpa / reuters / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the european parliament has been directly elected by european citizens for 30 years .
unlike national parliaments , which usually elect their heads of state , the european parliament does not elect a pan-european government .
this is why it has no real majority or opposition parties " the factions and majorities among us form around issues , " klaus haensch , a representative from germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , explained .
hänsch has been a member of the european parliament for 30 years , and was the parliament ’ s president from 1994 to 1997 . unlike other legislative bodies , media scandals and power struggles are not usually a feature of the european parliament .
jacki davis from the european policy center , a brussels-based political think tank , contended that while the parliamentary debates might not always be particularly exciting , the european parliament is very important because its members have a lot of power . the members of the parliament have a say in decisions regarding around 80 percent of all european laws and principles .
an estimated 30 to 50 percent of all laws that affect the eu member states are directly codetermined by the european parliament .
the effects of this legislation on the daily lives of the 500 million eu citizens are significant , even if many voters are not aware of this fact . more rights , but still not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does the parliament have too few rights ? the european parliament is just one of the two chambers of the eu legislative body .
the parliamentarians share power with the council of the european union -lrb- also known as the council of ministers -rrb- , in which the various national governments are represented .
both chambers vote for bills drafted by the european commission .
however , the parliament does not have the power to propose its own laws . " with each treaty - from maastricht to amsterdam to nizza - the parliament has acquired new rights and power over new policy areas , " jacki davis explained . today only agricultural policy , foreign policy , justice policy and the health care system are excluded from the parliament ’ s sphere of power . lots of parlamentarians but little time for member of parliament hans-peter martin , who doesn ’ t belong to any political faction , the parliament still has too few rights .
lobbyists and bureaucrats influence a lot of decisions , he said .
for example , the parliament does not have its own scientific department to thoroughly prepare its members for making certain decisions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it important to participate in eu elections " : hans-peter martin the parliamentarians often rely on the opinions of lobbyists to make up for this lack of scientific briefing .
but despite these shortcomings , it 's still important to vote , martin said .
because after all , the european parliament is the only democratically elected eu institution . in comparison to national parliaments in europe , a single member of the european parliament has less influence .
this is mostly due to the institution 's large size : 785 members from 27 eu member states .
they are divided into seven factions , and these in turn are divided into national groups .
the largest groups are the conservatives , the socialists and the liberals . the number of parliamentarians has increased tenfold since the parliament ’ s establishment in the 1950s .

in geneva , russia and the united states have resumed talks on renewing their main cold war-era nuclear arms reduction treaty , start i. the talks have been overshadowed by alarm over north korea 's nuclear ambitions . russia and the united states have begun a second round of talks in geneva aimed at devising a follow-on treaty for start i. the strategic arms reduction treaty was signed in 1991 by the former cold war powers to make deep cuts in their own nuclear weapons arsenals .
it expires in december but still leaves the two powers heavily armed . as if to underscore the ever-present need to reign in proliferation , nuclear outsider north korea has been told by southeast asian leaders attending a two-day summit in south korea to cease its " provocative " acts .
pyongyang replied promptly on monday , saying it would " strengthen its nuclear deterrent . "
early last week , north korea defied united nations resolutions by staging an underground nuclear test , its second such detonation since 2006 , and renouncing the armistice that ended the war on the korean peninsula in 1953 .
on friday , the north fired a short-range missile , its sixth in a week , drawing more international condemnation .
south korea says north preparing missile in what could be a further escalation , south korea 's defense ministry says the north has moved a long-range missile to its launch base at dongchang-ri , on north korea 's west coast , near china .
according to south korean media , including the news agency yonghap and the daily newspaper joongang libo , south korean intelligence officials say the taepodong-2 missile is an " intercontinental " rocket that potentially could reach alaska .
they say launch preparations could take one to two more weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea has promised to " strengthen its nuclear deterrent " experts add , however , that north korea has not yet mastered the technology to miniaturize a nuclear warhead to mount on such a missile .
in april , north korea drew strong protests when it test fired a similar long-range rocket in the direction of japan .
visiting manila , us defense secretary robert gates said north korea 's intentions are " not clear . "
gates said he hoped a high-level us talks with china , japan , russia and south korea would help defuse tensions . visiting singapore at the weekend , gates had said pyongyang 's acts could spark an arms race with serious consequences for asia .
geneva start talks behind closed doors the start arms reduction talks in geneva are the second encounter involving us and russian envoys since us president barack obama and his russian counterpart dimitri medvedev met at the g-20 summit in london in april and agreed to strive for further reductions . russian diplomats say the presidents will unveil the first results of the start consultations at their planned summit in moscow in early july .
meantime , both sides have sworn confidentiality .
diplomats close to the geneva talks , spread over three days , say it is being held behind closed doors at russia 's mission .
progress is not expected to be swift .
recent russian-us relations have been troubled by tensions over the pro-western former soviet republic of georgia and russia 's objections to washington 's plan to site a us anti-missile shield in poland and the czech republic , ostensibly to counter a threat from iran .
russian military analyst alexander goltz says the start negotiations will help russia to restore its " status as a world power . " another analyst evgeny volk of the heritage foundation says president obama " needs a result " to demonstrate progress after the ' reset ' in us-russian relations declared early this year by his vice-president joseph biden .
in april while visiting prague , obama underscored his stance by saying his long-term goal was to create a " world without nuclear weapons . "
deep cuts but arsenals still large start i was signed in 1991 – shortly after the fall of europe 's iron curtain - by former us president george h. bush senior and the-then soviet president mikhail gorbachev .
it set up a system of bilateral inspections and stipulated that neither side could deploy more than 6,000 warheads and no more than 1,600 strategic delivery vehicles , including long-rang missiles , submarines and bomber aircraft .
that goal was reached by 2001 , still leaving both powers holding 90 percent of the world 's arsenals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some nuclear submarines have been decommissioned according to the us state department , at the beginning of january the united states had 550 intercontinental ballistic missiles ready for use ; russia had 469 such missiles , but with more warheads per missile .
russia does not publish its own figures .
in terms of warheads , the us said russia held 3,909 devices while the us military had 5,576 .
at the london summit in april , obama and medvedev pointed out that another treaty signed in 2002 , known as sort or the strategic offensive reductions treaty requires each power 's stockpile to be trimmed to a ceiling of between 1,700 - 2,200 nuclear warheads .
unlike start , however , it does not provide for verification systems .
thaw raises hopes for non-proliferation treaty review if a follow-on treaty supercedes start , stipulating further us and russian cuts , it could add fresh impulse to plans to revise the much wider non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- at a united nations review conference next year .
last friday , the permanent security council members , all nuclear powers , including china , france and britain , endorsed a review and an ambitious agenda under an algerian-mediated compromise .
that breakthrough at the long-running 65-member conference on disarmament at the un 's european offices in geneva ended more than a decade of deadlock .
at similar talks in 2005 not even an agenda was agreed. ipj / dpa / reuters / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it expires in december but still leaves the two powers heavily armed . as if to underscore the ever-present need to reign in proliferation , nuclear outsider north korea has been told by southeast asian leaders attending a two-day summit in south korea to cease its " provocative " acts .
pyongyang replied promptly on monday , saying it would " strengthen its nuclear deterrent . "
early last week , north korea defied united nations resolutions by staging an underground nuclear test , its second such detonation since 2006 , and renouncing the armistice that ended the war on the korean peninsula in 1953 .

recent russian-us relations have been troubled by tensions over the pro-western former soviet republic of georgia and russia 's objections to washington 's plan to site a us anti-missile shield in poland and the czech republic , ostensibly to counter a threat from iran .
russian military analyst alexander goltz says the start negotiations will help russia to restore its " status as a world power .

russia does not publish its own figures .
in terms of warheads , the us said russia held 3,909 devices while the us military had 5,576 .
at the london summit in april , obama and medvedev pointed out that another treaty signed in 2002 , known as sort or the strategic offensive reductions treaty requires each power 's stockpile to be trimmed to a ceiling of between 1,700 - 2,200 nuclear warheads .

the czech communist party parliamentarian used to be an astronaut and took part in a russian space mission in the 1970s .
he was the first man in space from outside the soviet union or united states .
from the soyuz 28 spaceship in 1978 , vladimir remek thanked the central committee of the soviet communist party and comrade leonid brezhnev for giving him the chance to take part in the mission .
thirty-one years later , the former cosmonaut spoke at a communist party election rally in the small czech city of hradec kralové .
the few in attendance were mainly elderly people who fondly remembered the days when remek was a national hero .
" a year after his flight he visited a school where i was the head teacher and spoke to the children , " one woman remembered .
" people came from all around - some walked five kilometers just to see him . "
" he was extremely popular .
but he has always been modest too , so … he 'll get my vote . "

he conceded his huge communist-era fame contributed to his success at the ballot box .
“ i think it definitely played a role , because i can say in all modesty i was known throughout society , " remek said .
" but at the same time i think many people understood that i ’ ve done much more . "
" for instance , i represented czech machinery firms in russia , i was a diplomat in the field of trade at the czechoslovak embassy in moscow , " he explained .
" so i ’ ve achieved more than that space flight .
but it ’ s true that ’ s what made me well known . ”
bringing experience in space to brussels after five years representing the czech republic in brussels and strasbourg , remek can compare life in space and life in the european parliament , in a way few other parlementarians can .
“ in space or any kind of flight cooperation is an absolute given , so that the plane or spacecraft fulfills its mission and lands safely , " remek said .
" there are strict rules .
they exist in the european parliament too , but it ’ s all about discussion . "
" when you fly not every decision is a matter of life and death , " he said .
" in the parliament it is about life in a way , because our decisions affect people ’ s lives . ”
vladimir remek isn ’ t the only former astronaut in the european parliament .

their first of many shows in the north german port city was at the indra club on august 17 , 1960 .
at the shows in hamburg , the band -lrb- then with five members -rrb- would play for hours , often playing several clubs in the same night . through these early concerts , the beatles began to develop the sound that would come to be their trademark .
it was also in hamburg that ringo starr made his first appearance as the band 's new drummer . beatlemania the beatlemania museum takes visitors to a time when the beatles were all the rage .
the walls duplicate the style of the hamburg clubs where the band once played , and there ’ s beatles memorabilia of all kinds .
one room is decorated to look like the bedroom of a young beatles fan , filled from top to bottom with beatles collectables . visitors can marvel over the original version of the beatles ' first record contract , which was signed in hamburg , or read postcards sent by ringo starr to his grandmother in liverpool , in which he sings the praises of the german city .
there are even womens ’ stockings with a beatles logo woven in . further on in the museum , visitors can sneak a peak backstage at a beatles concert , or sit in a theater filled with a recording of hysterical screams from beatles fans .

there 's a constant stream of questions coming in from people around the world wanting to know more about hamburg ’ s links with the beatles . but one question remains : why was hamburg the city where the beatles got their start ?
that ’ s a question uwe blascke , one of the museum 's founders , feels no need to answer . “ that question answers itself , ” he says .
“ if a band has a museum , we don ’ t really need to discuss how or why they got so big .
you just have to listen to one of their records . ” and if the music isn ’ t enough , you can always visit the museum gift shop and pick up a ringo starr coffee mug , t-shirts with beatlemania logos , beatles beer coasters – even a beatles umbrella . author : michael marek / mz editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

none of its competitors is expected to win more than one seat rubiks is one of the most well-known public figures from latvia 's soviet years .
the 73-year-old politician was first secretary of the soviet communist party in latvia and head of the riga city council in the 1980s . a history of politcal dissidence rubiks strongly opposed latvian independence from the soviet union .
he was one of the supporters of a soviet putsch in 1991 , an attempt by a group of hard-liners to wrest control of the soviet union from president mikhail gorbachev .
when the putsch failed , rubiks was imprisoned for six years . later , rubiks was also against latvia joining the european union .
now as a candidate for the european parliament , he has softened his rhetoric and promises to concentrate on issues of social security in europe . however , his feelings on the eu remain clear .
" our country was like a small child that was just about to fall in the river , " rubiks said .
" and older people were warning against that .
i also thought that latvia was not ready to join the eu five years ago .
now this child has fallen into the river and it ’ s time to go and save it . " a representative for the russian-speaking minority concord center 's main supporters are the russian-speaking voters .
many of them see rubiks as a man of principle who stood up for his beliefs and their country 's only political martyr in recent history .
he is perceived as someone who speaks for the russian-speaking population , latvian political analyst viktor makarov said . rubiks might also be being sent off to the european parliament by his party because latvian laws do not allow him and other former leaders of the soviet communist party to participate in local parliamentary or municipal elections . a well-paid position in brussels could also be seen as a tribute to him by his party , political analyst iveta kazoka said . it ’ s not rubiks himself that people mostly support , but rather the opposition political party he represents , kazoka said .
his election could be a message of protest against the ruling parties that do not address the needs of the russian minority . artjoms konohovs / sjt editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the czech communist party parliamentarian used to be an astronaut and took part in a russian space mission in the 1970s .
he was the first man in space from outside the soviet union or united states .
from the soyuz 28 spaceship in 1978 , vladimir remek thanked the central committee of the soviet communist party and comrade leonid brezhnev for giving him the chance to take part in the mission .
thirty-one years later , the former cosmonaut spoke at a communist party election rally in the small czech city of hradec kralové .
the few in attendance were mainly elderly people who fondly remembered the days when remek was a national hero .
" a year after his flight he visited a school where i was the head teacher and spoke to the children , " one woman remembered .
" people came from all around - some walked five kilometers just to see him . "
" he was extremely popular .
but he has always been modest too , so … he 'll get my vote . "
meteoric rise to stardom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remek -lrb- left -rrb- inspects casks of the famous czech bitters becherovka in his capacity as a czech mep vladimir remek , who unsurprisingly was a party member under the former regime , stood successfully for the czech communist party in the last elections to the european parliament in 2004 .
he conceded his huge communist-era fame contributed to his success at the ballot box .
“ i think it definitely played a role , because i can say in all modesty i was known throughout society , " remek said .
" but at the same time i think many people understood that i ’ ve done much more . "
" for instance , i represented czech machinery firms in russia , i was a diplomat in the field of trade at the czechoslovak embassy in moscow , " he explained .
" so i ’ ve achieved more than that space flight .
but it ’ s true that ’ s what made me well known . ”
bringing experience in space to brussels after five years representing the czech republic in brussels and strasbourg , remek can compare life in space and life in the european parliament , in a way few other parlementarians can .
“ in space or any kind of flight cooperation is an absolute given , so that the plane or spacecraft fulfills its mission and lands safely , " remek said .
" there are strict rules .
they exist in the european parliament too , but it ’ s all about discussion . "
" when you fly not every decision is a matter of life and death , " he said .
" in the parliament it is about life in a way , because our decisions affect people ’ s lives . ”
vladimir remek isn ’ t the only former astronaut in the european parliament .
the italian mep umberto guidoni - also in the group of the united left - flew two nasa space shuttle missions .
he too is standing for re-election .

one example of this is that the european parliament is actually based in three different cities : strasbourg , brussels and luxembourg . " i personally think that this parliament , with its 40 weeks of sessions , should not be additionally burdened with this whole traveling circus , " said michael gahler , eu parliamentarian and member of germany 's christian democratic union party -lrb- cdu -rrb- . gahler said he believes that with so many pressing issues , the parliamentarians can not afford to waste time traveling . more seats , more costs , more work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strasbourg is the official seat of the parliament many parliamentarians and eu citizens have the same opinion .
there has been much debate in recent years about whether the european parliament really needs to have three locations .
the official headquarters are in strasbourg , france , but this parliament building is only used 48 days of the year - for plenary sessions .
all other plenary , committee and faction meetings take place in brussels , belgium .
the largest part of the parliament 's administration , the secretariat , is based in luxembourg . " we find this very inconvenient and expensive , " eu parliamentarian wolf klinz said .
moving locations throughout the year costs around 200 million euros -lrb- $ 284 million -rrb- , klinz explained , and does not make the work any easier . " we are in favor of only having a base in brussels , " klinz said .
his party , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- of germany , is demanding the parliament 's complete relocation to brussels , putting a stop to what he also termed a " traveling circus . " a lot of support for the one-location option once a month , all 785 eu parliamentarians and 3,000 staff members travel from brussels to strasbourg for a plenary session , and then back again .
according to critics , this not only drains finances , but also creates 20,000 tons of carbon emissions .
this is why parliament members from various factions started the one seat campaign in 2006 , with the aim of moving all parliament activities to brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo bullmann : " no more separation from brussels " 1.25 million eu citizens have also signed the one seat campaign petition on the internet .
but why brussels rather than strasbourg ? udo bullmann , eu parliamentarian and member of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , explained : " we as the parliament need proximity to the commission and the council .
we can not afford to travel hundreds of kilometers . " strasbourg is not a feasible option because the other political bodies have their seat in brussels , according to bullmann . strasbourg a symbol of european unity but it is not as simple as it sounds .
strasbourg is place of historical importance for europe .
the city symbolizes french-german reconciliation after world war ii and the beginning of european unification .
in 1997 eu member states were united in the decision to make strasbourg the official seat of the parliament .
up until now , all attempts to change this have been stymied by france 's resistance . according to gahler , there should be more public pressure to force france and luxembourg to alter their position on the topic .
" it 's a question of time , but in the future i would like to see the parliament not providing so much room for attacks on itself .
because almost every visitor group that i meet , someone raises this question , and i 'm forced to say that i do n't agree with the current situation . " what will become of strasbourg ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the parliament 's secretariat has its seat in luxembourg however , among european conservatives , michael gahler represents a minority opinion .
on the french side there is great concern about losing something meaningful if the eu parliament were not officially based in strasbourg . but the council of europe and the european court of human rights , both important , non-eu , international bodies , would still remain in strasbourg .
and there are many ideas for making up such a move to france . a european university , a european diplomatic academy and a concentration of european jurisdiction are just some of the new possibilities for strasbourg .
however , any changes of this sort require the agreement of all 27 eu member states , including , of course , france and luxembourg . thus there is a good chance that the european parliament will continue to have three locations for some years to come . nina funke-kaiser / ew editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

austria 's far-right freedom party has plunged austrian politics into an uproar . one freedom party campaing poster reads " abendland in christenhand " - or europe in christian hands - the implication being that the eu has allowed too many muslims to enter europe .
another freedom party election ad in a tabloid newspaper promises to veto the eu membership of israel and turkey to avoid getting sucked into what is described as " the bloody middle east crisis . " that 's been interpreted by some as anti-semitic as well as anti-islam .
israel is not a candidate to become an eu member . austrian president heinz fischer responded by saying that religion and politics should not mix , though popular sentiment is that he waited too long to get involved . public outcry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these freedom party posters imply that judgment day is coming senior figures in the catholic church and the muslim community are also outraged .
catholic theologian and author hubert feichtelbauer fears that freedom party leader heinz christian strache may be tapping into religious prejudices . " in their hearts they did n't feel very upset about this , " feichtelbauer said of those who are not outraged by the campaign tactics .
" therefore i fear that in a minority of the catholic population there might be some agreement with the slogans put forward by mr. strache . " the freedom party rejects all criticism of its campaigning as absurd and irrelevant and says it 's sticking with the slogans .
the latest statements from a freedom party politician are once again stirring up controversy .
in a reight-wing publication , martin graf , one of the presidents of the lower house of the austrian parliament , wrote of ariel muzicant , the head of vienna 's jewish community , " many are asking if muzicant is not the father of anti-fascist left wing terrorism . " " this is to be condemned " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor faymann : " we want nothing to do with hate campaigns " in the middle of an election campaign , statements like that have been taken by all but the right wing as a clear provocation and an attempt to whip up anti-semitic feeling .
the social democrat chancellor werner faymann was one of the first to react . " if this is true , then he is completely off the rails and is to be condemned , " faymann said .
" this is incitement and preaching hate and we want nothing to do with hate campaigns . " the chancellor later joined a growing chorus of leading politicians and public figures calling for the freedom party politician to resign .
but there no sign of that happening , and the freedom party has claimed that it is graf who has been victimized . kerry skyring / sjt editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite its growing influence , the number of voters has been sinking since the first eu elections in 1979 . the first european union election took place 30 years ago and 63 percent of the eligible voters showed up to have their voices heard .
since then , the european parliament has been one of the eu ’ s major political institutions .
while the council of the european union is made up of various ministers of the member states and the european commission 's members are appointed by the european council , the european parliament is the only directly elected body , giving citizens a chance to influence european politics . 30 years ago , the parliament played a mostly advisory role .
the council was obliged to acknowledge the parliament ’ s opinion in important matters , but was not forced to accept it .
even then , however , some parts of the budget required the approval of parliament . since then , the parliament ’ s authority has steadily increased , but the voter turnout at eu elections has plummeted .
at the last election in 2004 it stood at just 45.6 percent .
many feel that the reason for this decline lies in the complicated structures of eu bureaucracy , which can be difficult to understand .
those who do not know what the european parliament is and what it does are unlikely to be interested in voting for it . the parliament ’ s playing field bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the plenary hall in the european parliament in brussels today , the european parliament has to officially approve the european council ’ s nominations of members of the european commission .
like the us congress , the parliament tends to accept the suggestions of commissioners . the commission also has to justify its activities to the parliament and any of its members can be discharged at any time through a vote of no-confidence . the codecision procedure , which has been in place since the 1992 maastricht treaty , puts the parliament on equal footing with the council in many law-making processes .
both chambers have the right to reject the european commission ’ s proposals .
this system applies to more than 75 percent of all eu laws .
exceptions to this rule include some key areas such as a common foreign and security policy , as well as the areas of justice and interior affairs . the parliament ’ s third sphere of authority is the budget .
every december the parliament must approve an eu budget for the following year .
however , there are some exceptions to this rule , too .
all of the so-called compulsory spending - the funds that the european union needs to carry out its duties - do not require the parliament ’ s approval .
included in this compulsory spending , for example , are the agricultural budgets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simone veil was the president of the european parliament from 1979 to 1982 the parliament also has the right of codetermination with regard to eu expansion .
it must agree to all eu-entry-related decisions made by the commission and the council .
it also has the power to block decisions related to the european market .
the treaty of lisbon , which has not yet been ratified by all eu member states , aims to give the european parliament even more power in relation to the council and the commission . important decisions in december 1979 the parliament displayed its power for the first time .
its president , simone veil , refused to sign the financial plan for 1980 and thus forced the commission to amend it .
the parliament has periodically blocked budget decisions in the following years . during the appointment of the european commission in 2004 , the parliament made the first use of its veto rights .
it rejected the conservative italian rocco buttiglione , who had been nominated for the position of commissioner for justice , freedom and security . the parliament also brings forth its own legislative ideas and in this way contributes actively to the eu decision-making process .
numerous laws relating to consumer protection , climate protection , civil rights and labor have been created in this way . torsten spies / ew editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the european parliament has been directly elected by european citizens for 30 years .
unlike national parliaments , which usually elect their heads of state , the european parliament does not elect a pan-european government .
this is why it has no real majority or opposition parties " the factions and majorities among us form around issues , " klaus haensch , a representative from germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , explained .
hänsch has been a member of the european parliament for 30 years , and was the parliament ’ s president from 1994 to 1997 . unlike other legislative bodies , media scandals and power struggles are not usually a feature of the european parliament .
jacki davis from the european policy center , a brussels-based political think tank , contended that while the parliamentary debates might not always be particularly exciting , the european parliament is very important because its members have a lot of power . the members of the parliament have a say in decisions regarding around 80 percent of all european laws and principles .
an estimated 30 to 50 percent of all laws that affect the eu member states are directly codetermined by the european parliament .
the effects of this legislation on the daily lives of the 500 million eu citizens are significant , even if many voters are not aware of this fact . more rights , but still not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does the parliament have too few rights ? the european parliament is just one of the two chambers of the eu legislative body .
the parliamentarians share power with the council of the european union -lrb- also known as the council of ministers -rrb- , in which the various national governments are represented .
both chambers vote for bills drafted by the european commission .
however , the parliament does not have the power to propose its own laws . " with each treaty - from maastricht to amsterdam to nizza - the parliament has acquired new rights and power over new policy areas , " jacki davis explained . today only agricultural policy , foreign policy , justice policy and the health care system are excluded from the parliament ’ s sphere of power . lots of parlamentarians but little time for member of parliament hans-peter martin , who doesn ’ t belong to any political faction , the parliament still has too few rights .
lobbyists and bureaucrats influence a lot of decisions , he said .
for example , the parliament does not have its own scientific department to thoroughly prepare its members for making certain decisions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it important to participate in eu elections " : hans-peter martin the parliamentarians often rely on the opinions of lobbyists to make up for this lack of scientific briefing .
but despite these shortcomings , it 's still important to vote , martin said .
because after all , the european parliament is the only democratically elected eu institution . in comparison to national parliaments in europe , a single member of the european parliament has less influence .
this is mostly due to the institution 's large size : 785 members from 27 eu member states .
they are divided into seven factions , and these in turn are divided into national groups .
the largest groups are the conservatives , the socialists and the liberals . the number of parliamentarians has increased tenfold since the parliament ’ s establishment in the 1950s .

the welsh assembly government wants all new patients in wales to be seen within 26 weeks of referral by december .
but medics say it means those already in the system get appointments moved in order for new patients to be seen .
the assembly government said its targets were developed in close consultation with health professionals .
patients who have chronic eye conditions such as glaucoma need to be seen regularly at hospital to stop their condition worsening .
we have some very clear anecdotal evidence of patients who have already suffered irreversible sight loss as a result of delayed appointments consultant nick hawksworth but doctors have told the bbc 's eye on wales programme that there is anecdotal evidence that some patients in wales are going blind because targets mean their appointments are being postponed or moved to accommodate new patients .
consultant nick hawksworth , who is also the council member for wales for the royal college of ophthalmologists , said : " there 's a big drive on at the moment for hospital trusts to meet targets , in particular for new patients . "
" unfortunately it has had something of an adverse effect in that many follow-up patients are disadvantaged and appointments have been moved in order to make place for new patients .

but some doctors believe the pressure to deliver on waiting time targets is causing problems for many patients .
jonathan osborne , an ear , nose and throat surgeon and vice-chairman of the welsh council of the british medical association said : " all specialities have particular conditions that do require fairly close monitoring and follow up and those patients are undoubtedly suffering .
" there are conditions such as glaucoma - where patients go blind on a silent basis - and pre-malignant conditions where we 're observing people who may develop malignancy where this could be extremely serious . "
re-think rules he urged welsh health minister edwina hart to re-think .
" there 's a whole army of people employed by the nhs - not in frontline clinical care - merely monitoring the targets , " he said .
" that is activity that does not benefit patients in any way . "
a spokesperson for the welsh assembly government said " patients should be treated in order of clinical priority " .
" our targets have been developed in close consultation with health professionals to ensure that patients receive the appropriate care and treatment within reasonable waiting times .
" clinicians will continue to have absolute flexibility in determining their priorities within the targets so patients are treated when needed . "

the welsh assembly government wants all new patients in wales to be seen within 26 weeks of referral by december .
but medics say it means those already in the system get appointments moved in order for new patients to be seen .
the assembly government said its targets were developed in close consultation with health professionals .
patients who have chronic eye conditions such as glaucoma need to be seen regularly at hospital to stop their condition worsening .
we have some very clear anecdotal evidence of patients who have already suffered irreversible sight loss as a result of delayed appointments consultant nick hawksworth but doctors have told the bbc 's eye on wales programme that there is anecdotal evidence that some patients in wales are going blind because targets mean their appointments are being postponed or moved to accommodate new patients .
consultant nick hawksworth , who is also the council member for wales for the royal college of ophthalmologists , said : " there 's a big drive on at the moment for hospital trusts to meet targets , in particular for new patients . "
" unfortunately it has had something of an adverse effect in that many follow-up patients are disadvantaged and appointments have been moved in order to make place for new patients .

but some doctors believe the pressure to deliver on waiting time targets is causing problems for many patients .
jonathan osborne , an ear , nose and throat surgeon and vice-chairman of the welsh council of the british medical association said : " all specialities have particular conditions that do require fairly close monitoring and follow up and those patients are undoubtedly suffering .
" there are conditions such as glaucoma - where patients go blind on a silent basis - and pre-malignant conditions where we 're observing people who may develop malignancy where this could be extremely serious . "
re-think rules he urged welsh health minister edwina hart to re-think .
" there 's a whole army of people employed by the nhs - not in frontline clinical care - merely monitoring the targets , " he said .
" that is activity that does not benefit patients in any way . "
a spokesperson for the welsh assembly government said " patients should be treated in order of clinical priority " .
" our targets have been developed in close consultation with health professionals to ensure that patients receive the appropriate care and treatment within reasonable waiting times .
" clinicians will continue to have absolute flexibility in determining their priorities within the targets so patients are treated when needed . "

a top us official said cuba had sent a diplomatic note accepting a recent us invitation to restart the talks .
the official said cuba was also ready to cooperate with the us on direct mail services , as well as fighting terrorism and drug trafficking , reports said .
the talks were halted in 2003 after havana refused to give exit permits to people who had been granted us visas .
secretary of state hillary clinton welcomed the cuban response during a visit to el salvador where she will attend the inauguration of mauricio funes as president on monday .
" at the same time we will continue to press the cuban government to protect basic rights , release political prisoners and move toward democratic reform , " mrs clinton said .
she is due to move on to honduras for a meeting of the organisation of american states -lrb- oas -rrb- on tuesday , where cuba 's possible readmission is expected to be discussed .
by then , the us will be the only country in the americas without full diplomatic relations with the communist island .
el salvador , the only other oas state without such ties , plans to restore them when president-elect funes takes office .
' no preconditions ' in march , president barack obama eased restrictions on visits to the communist island by cuban-americans and allowed them to send money home more easily .
curbs on sending medicines and food were also eased .
the legislation overturned rules imposed by the bush administration , which had limited travel to just two weeks every three years and had confined visits to immediate family members .
mr obama had recently indicated he would be open to dialogue with cuba 's leaders .
but he has said that , like previous american presidents , he will only consider a full lifting of the embargo - in place since 1962 - if cuba makes significant moves such as the holding of democratic elections .
cuba 's president raul castro has said he is prepared to negotiate with the new us administration , providing there are no preconditions .
the bbc 's michael voss , in havana , says the us demands on democracy and human rights before ending the trade embargo or admitting cuba to the oas place washington at odds with almost all the other countries in the americas .
he says mrs clinton is likely to face pressure from many oas members to drop such demands - making them a goal rather than a precondition for normalising relations .

but he has said that , like previous american presidents , he will only consider a full lifting of the embargo - in place since 1962 - if cuba makes significant moves such as the holding of democratic elections .
cuba 's president raul castro has said he is prepared to negotiate with the new us administration , providing there are no preconditions .
the bbc 's michael voss , in havana , says the us demands on democracy and human rights before ending the trade embargo or admitting cuba to the oas place washington at odds with almost all the other countries in the americas .
he says mrs clinton is likely to face pressure from many oas members to drop such demands - making them a goal rather than a precondition for normalising relations .
