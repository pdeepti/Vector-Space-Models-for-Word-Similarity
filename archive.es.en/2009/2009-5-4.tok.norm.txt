otherwise , the government has threatened to expropriate shareholders to secure a controlling stake in the troubled moneylender .
as this share buyout deadline looms , the german handelsblatt newspaper reports that hre 's financial woes continue .
according to the german business paper , hre has lost roughly 500 million euros -lrb- $ 664 million -rrb- in the first quarter of 2009 , meaning that the struggling bank has not yet turned a corner despite three separate government bailouts .
hre is scheduled to post its first quarter results on tuesday .
berlin has already shored up hre with loan guarantees and cash injections totalling 102 billion euros , and now wants control of the bank .
the us private equity firm jc flowers & co , which owns an estimated 22 percent of hre , has rejected the government 's share offer , saying it is too low .
the group has threatened legal action if berlin tries to seize its shares .
germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck has described the offer , which is 10 percent above the legal minimum , as " very fair " , and has said that the government will expropriate shareholders if they refuse to sell .
the german government passed temporary legislation allowing it to seize private stocks in february , before providing a third set of financial aid to hre .
the government is thought to own almost 23 percent of hre , making it a slightly bigger stakeholder than jc flowers & co .
berlin 's stake in the bank is rising all the time as more and more small shareholders accept the 1.39 euro offer .
the remainder of hre stock is held in small quantites by assorted hedgefunds and private investors. msh / rm , reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european union economies are now expected to contract by 4 percent in 2009 . some 8.5 million jobs will disappear in the eu this year and next , more than wiping out the new jobs created in recent years .
unemployment will reach 11.5 percent by the end of next year , the commission said .
skyrocketing unemployment will be accompanied by plunging exports through the end of 2010 , the commission predicts .
the eu said monday that euro zone exports are “ forecast to suffer one of the worst setbacks on record . ”
conditions have worsened in january , the eu had predicted modest growth of 0.5 percent for the bloc next year .
but that prediction has been scrapped as the bloc 's five biggest members turned in grim economic data .
the commission now forecasts that the eu economies will shrink another 0.1 percent in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's export economy is hard hit by the downturn germany , the eu 's economic motor , faces a contraction of 5.4 percent this year .
and axel weber , president of germany 's national bank , the bundesbank , warned monday that the country 's gdp is unlikely to rise before the second half of 2010 .
" from today 's perspective , i do n't expect positive growth rates before the second half of next year , " weber said at a tax advisory congress in hamburg .
stable financial markets are a pre-requisite for economic growth , weber said , adding " there , adjustment processes are still in full swing . "
european economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia also said he hoped that the eu 's economic outlook would begin to improve in 2010 .
actions taken by governments and central banks " are expected to put a floor under the fall in economic activity this year and enable a recovery next year , " almunia said .
however , the government stimulus plans come at a cost .
public debt is expected to grow to an average 7.5 percent of gross domestic product in the eu next year .
no escape for eastern europe the storm also looks set to engulf previously robust economies in central and eastern europe such as poland , slovakia , romania , bulgaria and the czech republic .
as recently as january , the eu newcomers were tipped to record substantial growth .
but according to the latest forecasts , all are set to go into recession this year as key markets in western europe and russia collapse .
slovakia , tipped in january to record growth of 2.7 percent this year , now faces a contraction of 2.6 percent .
romania , which was in january expected to record growth of 1.8 percent , now faces a 4-percent fall in economic output .

he made the remarks during a joint news conference with italian foreign minister franco frattini .

" israel is n't looking for slogans , but for concrete results , " lieberman said replying to a question on the " two-state solution " backed by the us and the european union .

european union economies are now expected to contract by 4 percent in 2009 . some 8.5 million jobs will disappear in the eu this year and next , more than wiping out the new jobs created in recent years .
unemployment will reach 11.5 percent by the end of next year , the commission said .
skyrocketing unemployment will be accompanied by plunging exports through the end of 2010 , the commission predicts .
the eu said monday that euro zone exports are “ forecast to suffer one of the worst setbacks on record . ”
conditions have worsened in january , the eu had predicted modest growth of 0.5 percent for the bloc next year .
but that prediction has been scrapped as the bloc 's five biggest members turned in grim economic data .
the commission now forecasts that the eu economies will shrink another 0.1 percent in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's export economy is hard hit by the downturn germany , the eu 's economic motor , faces a contraction of 5.4 percent this year .
and axel weber , president of germany 's national bank , the bundesbank , warned monday that the country 's gdp is unlikely to rise before the second half of 2010 .
" from today 's perspective , i do n't expect positive growth rates before the second half of next year , " weber said at a tax advisory congress in hamburg .
stable financial markets are a pre-requisite for economic growth , weber said , adding " there , adjustment processes are still in full swing . "
european economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia also said he hoped that the eu 's economic outlook would begin to improve in 2010 .
actions taken by governments and central banks " are expected to put a floor under the fall in economic activity this year and enable a recovery next year , " almunia said .
however , the government stimulus plans come at a cost .
public debt is expected to grow to an average 7.5 percent of gross domestic product in the eu next year .
no escape for eastern europe the storm also looks set to engulf previously robust economies in central and eastern europe such as poland , slovakia , romania , bulgaria and the czech republic .
as recently as january , the eu newcomers were tipped to record substantial growth .
but according to the latest forecasts , all are set to go into recession this year as key markets in western europe and russia collapse .
slovakia , tipped in january to record growth of 2.7 percent this year , now faces a contraction of 2.6 percent .
romania , which was in january expected to record growth of 1.8 percent , now faces a 4-percent fall in economic output .
of all the eu 's 27 member states , only cyprus is set to record economic growth in 2009 , according to commission figures . th / rm / dc , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 04.05.2009 german citizenship applications continue to fall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of immigrants becoming naturalized germans has fallen steadily over the past decade .
a persistent fall in the number of immigrants becoming naturalized german citizens has seen politicians in berlin reignite the debate about cultural integration and citizenship tests . some 187,000 foreigners were naturalized as german citizens in 2000 .
by 2007 that number had dropped about 40 percent to just 113,000 .
official figures for 2008 have n't yet been published , but sevim dagdelen , a parliamentarian from germany 's left party , has done her own research and calculations .
she estimates the number of immigrants who chose to become german citizens last year fell by another 18 percent last year .
" the federal government keeps talking about germany as a land of integration , with a welcoming culture of naturalization , " dagdelen told deutsche welle .
" but it 's clearly untrue .
many foreigners are n't even applying for german citizenship because they 're worried they wo n't be accepted , because the hurdles are set too high . "
tough criteria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sevim dagdelen says citizenship tests are an obstacle to integration to be granted german citizenship , an immigrant must have lived in germany legally for at least eight years .
they have to prove they have an independent income , do n't require social welfare or unemployment benefits , and have a good grasp of the german language .
additional rules introduced in 2007 require applicants who have not graduated from a german school to pass a controversial " citizenship test " .
the examination costs 25 euros and consists of 33 multiple choice items selected from a catalog of 310 questions about german history , culture and the political system .
would-be germans must provide at least 17 correct answers to pass , otherwise they can try again and re-sit the examination at a later date .
the federal government says extremely low failure rates -lrb- around one percent -rrb- prove the test is a success .
but critics say the authorities have got it wrong .
the left-wing berlin state senate 's commissioner for integration , guenter piening , says many immigrants from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds are so worried by the test that they have n't dared to apply for german citizenship .
" these are the people we really want to include in our society , " piening told deutsche welle .
" the middle-class , educated immigrants who confidently decide they want to become german are n't a problem .
the people we really want to appeal to are the immigrants who 've until now have been unsure about naturalization , but do want to commit to our society .
and it 's precisely these people who are being put off by mixed signals . "
language barriers the government 's new language test is particularly unpopular among immigrants .
applicants ca n't get by on basic phrases communicating where they live and who they know .
they have to be able to describe their dreams and justify their opinions .
" we should make exceptions for older , first-generation immigrants , " piening said , adding that the current testing regime is especially challenging for people who never attended a german school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer says language tests promote social cohesion the federal government 's commissioner for integration , maria boehmer , however , is opposed to lowering standards even in the face of falling naturalization numbers .
" in hamburg i took part in a podium discussion .
there was an immigrant who 'd spent more than 30 years in germany .
he told me that without a good grasp of the german language , he would still be little more than a spectator on the edge of society ; " she told deutsche welle .
lies , damn lies , and statistics boehmer , a christian democrat , says the plunge in the number of foreigners taking up german citizenship needs to be carefully examined because a number of factors are at play .
one is a rule that came into force in 2000 .
it states that a child born to an immigrant parent who 's been living in germany for more than eight years is automatically granted german citizenship - so there 's no need for an application .
however , critics point out that such children only remain german if they choose to give up their foreign nationality when they reach 18 years of age .
they say this forced decision puts youths with immigrant backgrounds under a lot of pressure . so far calls for germany to lift its general ban on dual citizenship have found little support among germany 's major political parties - and there 's little to suggest their position will change any time soon .

a persistent fall in the number of immigrants becoming naturalized german citizens has seen politicians in berlin reignite the debate about cultural integration and citizenship tests . some 187,000 foreigners were naturalized as german citizens in 2000 .
by 2007 that number had dropped about 40 percent to just 113,000 .
official figures for 2008 have n't yet been published , but sevim dagdelen , a parliamentarian from germany 's left party , has done her own research and calculations .
she estimates the number of immigrants who chose to become german citizens last year fell by another 18 percent last year .
" the federal government keeps talking about germany as a land of integration , with a welcoming culture of naturalization , " dagdelen told deutsche welle .
" but it 's clearly untrue .
many foreigners are n't even applying for german citizenship because they 're worried they wo n't be accepted , because the hurdles are set too high . "
tough criteria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sevim dagdelen says citizenship tests are an obstacle to integration to be granted german citizenship , an immigrant must have lived in germany legally for at least eight years .
they have to prove they have an independent income , do n't require social welfare or unemployment benefits , and have a good grasp of the german language .
additional rules introduced in 2007 require applicants who have not graduated from a german school to pass a controversial " citizenship test " .
the examination costs 25 euros and consists of 33 multiple choice items selected from a catalog of 310 questions about german history , culture and the political system .
would-be germans must provide at least 17 correct answers to pass , otherwise they can try again and re-sit the examination at a later date .
the federal government says extremely low failure rates -lrb- around one percent -rrb- prove the test is a success .
but critics say the authorities have got it wrong .
the left-wing berlin state senate 's commissioner for integration , guenter piening , says many immigrants from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds are so worried by the test that they have n't dared to apply for german citizenship .
" these are the people we really want to include in our society , " piening told deutsche welle .
" the middle-class , educated immigrants who confidently decide they want to become german are n't a problem .
the people we really want to appeal to are the immigrants who 've until now have been unsure about naturalization , but do want to commit to our society .
and it 's precisely these people who are being put off by mixed signals . "
language barriers the government 's new language test is particularly unpopular among immigrants .
applicants ca n't get by on basic phrases communicating where they live and who they know .
they have to be able to describe their dreams and justify their opinions .
" we should make exceptions for older , first-generation immigrants , " piening said , adding that the current testing regime is especially challenging for people who never attended a german school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer says language tests promote social cohesion the federal government 's commissioner for integration , maria boehmer , however , is opposed to lowering standards even in the face of falling naturalization numbers .
" in hamburg i took part in a podium discussion .
there was an immigrant who 'd spent more than 30 years in germany .
he told me that without a good grasp of the german language , he would still be little more than a spectator on the edge of society ; " she told deutsche welle .
lies , damn lies , and statistics boehmer , a christian democrat , says the plunge in the number of foreigners taking up german citizenship needs to be carefully examined because a number of factors are at play .
one is a rule that came into force in 2000 .
it states that a child born to an immigrant parent who 's been living in germany for more than eight years is automatically granted german citizenship - so there 's no need for an application .
however , critics point out that such children only remain german if they choose to give up their foreign nationality when they reach 18 years of age .
they say this forced decision puts youths with immigrant backgrounds under a lot of pressure . so far calls for germany to lift its general ban on dual citizenship have found little support among germany 's major political parties - and there 's little to suggest their position will change any time soon .

a persistent fall in the number of immigrants becoming naturalized german citizens has seen politicians in berlin reignite the debate about cultural integration and citizenship tests . some 187,000 foreigners were naturalized as german citizens in 2000 .
by 2007 that number had dropped about 40 percent to just 113,000 .
official figures for 2008 have n't yet been published , but sevim dagdelen , a parliamentarian from germany 's left party , has done her own research and calculations .
she estimates the number of immigrants who chose to become german citizens last year fell by another 18 percent last year .
" the federal government keeps talking about germany as a land of integration , with a welcoming culture of naturalization , " dagdelen told deutsche welle .
" but it 's clearly untrue .
many foreigners are n't even applying for german citizenship because they 're worried they wo n't be accepted , because the hurdles are set too high . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fiat ceo sergio marchionne 's bid for opel includes all of gm 's european operations marchionne touted the plan as a " marriage made in heaven . "
at a press conference after the talks , guttenberg unveiled key aspects of the plan , but said more details were needed .
he said that " opel would be maintained as a brand with a german headquarters , and that all three final assembly plants in germany would be kept as well . "

the company would include the brands fiat , opel , britain 's vauxhall and sweden 's saab , as well as chrysler .

" transitional financing would be paid for with general motors debt and the liabilities of the gm pension fund . "
fiat estimates this figure to be between five and seven billion euros , guttenberg said .
germany has also said it is prepared to provide up to 3.3 billion euros in interim financing guarantees .
marchionne said he wanted a decision within 30 days .

the slowdown is much sharper than analysts had forecasted .
sales of food , drinks and tobacco were down most significantly , according to the statistics office .
the only bright spot was in car sales , which were helped by a government program that gave out bonuses to people replacing aging vehicles with new cars .

the sharp drop in retail sales increases the likelihood that the european central bank will cut its main interest rate to a record low of 1.0 percent on thursday .
the hope is that the rate cut will give the 16-nation euro zone 's economy a further boost .

iw researchers said they expected germany 's gdp to shrink by 4.5 percent in 2009 , and grow by a mere 0.5 percent in 2010 .
exports , which are expected to decrease by 17 percent this year , have been largely responsible for the decline in the german economy , the institute said .

however he added that there would n't be a final decision on the issue .
in an interview with the german paper bild am sonntag , zu guttenberg said that any proposal had to ensure long-term security for opel plants across europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg maintains berlin has no preference of investor " we are not going to allow taxpayers be the ones to pay for a financial adventure , " he said .
" for me , state involvement in opel is not an option .
at most what would be offered , would be a time limited loan . "
marchionne will also meet with the head of opel 's works ' council , klaus franz .
according to a report in the spiegel magazine , franz expects that fiat 's plans include asking berlin for financial support .
he has previously described a fiat takeover as " industrial restructuring , paid for with german taxes " .

at the heart of the checklist are the requirements that the investor commit to ensuring all opel plants remain in operation and that jobs are secured in germany .
fiat boss sergio marchionne on sunday outlined his plans for a european car giant that would include gm 's german unit opel .
he told the financial times that fiat , chrysler and opel would form a new publicly traded company with revenues of about 80 billion euros and sales of more than six million vehicles a year .
marchionne said that combining opel and fiat would save one billion euros a year .
the financial times indicated such a merger could lead to up to 9,000 job cuts .

otherwise , the government has threatened to expropriate shareholders to secure a controlling stake in the troubled moneylender .
as this share buyout deadline looms , the german handelsblatt newspaper reports that hre 's financial woes continue .
according to the german business paper , hre has lost roughly 500 million euros -lrb- $ 664 million -rrb- in the first quarter of 2009 , meaning that the struggling bank has not yet turned a corner despite three separate government bailouts .
hre is scheduled to post its first quarter results on tuesday .
berlin has already shored up hre with loan guarantees and cash injections totalling 102 billion euros , and now wants control of the bank .
the us private equity firm jc flowers & co , which owns an estimated 22 percent of hre , has rejected the government 's share offer , saying it is too low .
the group has threatened legal action if berlin tries to seize its shares .
germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck has described the offer , which is 10 percent above the legal minimum , as " very fair " , and has said that the government will expropriate shareholders if they refuse to sell .
the german government passed temporary legislation allowing it to seize private stocks in february , before providing a third set of financial aid to hre .
the government is thought to own almost 23 percent of hre , making it a slightly bigger stakeholder than jc flowers & co .

otherwise , the government has threatened to expropriate shareholders to secure a controlling stake in the troubled moneylender .
as this share buyout deadline looms , the german handelsblatt newspaper reports that hre 's financial woes continue .
according to the german business paper , hre has lost roughly 500 million euros -lrb- $ 664 million -rrb- in the first quarter of 2009 , meaning that the struggling bank has not yet turned a corner despite three separate government bailouts .
hre is scheduled to post its first quarter results on tuesday .
berlin has already shored up hre with loan guarantees and cash injections totalling 102 billion euros , and now wants control of the bank .
the us private equity firm jc flowers & co , which owns an estimated 22 percent of hre , has rejected the government 's share offer , saying it is too low .
the group has threatened legal action if berlin tries to seize its shares .
germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck has described the offer , which is 10 percent above the legal minimum , as " very fair " , and has said that the government will expropriate shareholders if they refuse to sell .
the german government passed temporary legislation allowing it to seize private stocks in february , before providing a third set of financial aid to hre .

otherwise , the government has threatened to expropriate shareholders to secure a controlling stake in the troubled moneylender .
as this share buyout deadline looms , the german handelsblatt newspaper reports that hre 's financial woes continue .
according to the german business paper , hre has lost roughly 500 million euros -lrb- $ 664 million -rrb- in the first quarter of 2009 , meaning that the struggling bank has not yet turned a corner despite three separate government bailouts .
hre is scheduled to post its first quarter results on tuesday .
berlin has already shored up hre with loan guarantees and cash injections totalling 102 billion euros , and now wants control of the bank .
the us private equity firm jc flowers & co , which owns an estimated 22 percent of hre , has rejected the government 's share offer , saying it is too low .
the group has threatened legal action if berlin tries to seize its shares .
germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck has described the offer , which is 10 percent above the legal minimum , as " very fair " , and has said that the government will expropriate shareholders if they refuse to sell .
the german government passed temporary legislation allowing it to seize private stocks in february , before providing a third set of financial aid to hre .
the government is thought to own almost 23 percent of hre , making it a slightly bigger stakeholder than jc flowers & co .
berlin 's stake in the bank is rising all the time as more and more small shareholders accept the 1.39 euro offer .
the remainder of hre stock is held in small quantites by assorted hedgefunds and private investors. msh / rm , reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 04.05.2009 german citizenship applications continue to fall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of immigrants becoming naturalized germans has fallen steadily over the past decade .
a persistent fall in the number of immigrants becoming naturalized german citizens has seen politicians in berlin reignite the debate about cultural integration and citizenship tests . some 187,000 foreigners were naturalized as german citizens in 2000 .
by 2007 that number had dropped about 40 percent to just 113,000 .
official figures for 2008 have n't yet been published , but sevim dagdelen , a parliamentarian from germany 's left party , has done her own research and calculations .
she estimates the number of immigrants who chose to become german citizens last year fell by another 18 percent last year .
" the federal government keeps talking about germany as a land of integration , with a welcoming culture of naturalization , " dagdelen told deutsche welle .
" but it 's clearly untrue .
many foreigners are n't even applying for german citizenship because they 're worried they wo n't be accepted , because the hurdles are set too high . "
tough criteria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sevim dagdelen says citizenship tests are an obstacle to integration to be granted german citizenship , an immigrant must have lived in germany legally for at least eight years .
they have to prove they have an independent income , do n't require social welfare or unemployment benefits , and have a good grasp of the german language .
additional rules introduced in 2007 require applicants who have not graduated from a german school to pass a controversial " citizenship test " .
the examination costs 25 euros and consists of 33 multiple choice items selected from a catalog of 310 questions about german history , culture and the political system .
would-be germans must provide at least 17 correct answers to pass , otherwise they can try again and re-sit the examination at a later date .
the federal government says extremely low failure rates -lrb- around one percent -rrb- prove the test is a success .
but critics say the authorities have got it wrong .
the left-wing berlin state senate 's commissioner for integration , guenter piening , says many immigrants from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds are so worried by the test that they have n't dared to apply for german citizenship .
" these are the people we really want to include in our society , " piening told deutsche welle .
" the middle-class , educated immigrants who confidently decide they want to become german are n't a problem .
the people we really want to appeal to are the immigrants who 've until now have been unsure about naturalization , but do want to commit to our society .
and it 's precisely these people who are being put off by mixed signals . "
language barriers the government 's new language test is particularly unpopular among immigrants .
applicants ca n't get by on basic phrases communicating where they live and who they know .
they have to be able to describe their dreams and justify their opinions .
" we should make exceptions for older , first-generation immigrants , " piening said , adding that the current testing regime is especially challenging for people who never attended a german school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer says language tests promote social cohesion the federal government 's commissioner for integration , maria boehmer , however , is opposed to lowering standards even in the face of falling naturalization numbers .
" in hamburg i took part in a podium discussion .
there was an immigrant who 'd spent more than 30 years in germany .
he told me that without a good grasp of the german language , he would still be little more than a spectator on the edge of society ; " she told deutsche welle .
lies , damn lies , and statistics boehmer , a christian democrat , says the plunge in the number of foreigners taking up german citizenship needs to be carefully examined because a number of factors are at play .
one is a rule that came into force in 2000 .
it states that a child born to an immigrant parent who 's been living in germany for more than eight years is automatically granted german citizenship - so there 's no need for an application .
however , critics point out that such children only remain german if they choose to give up their foreign nationality when they reach 18 years of age .
they say this forced decision puts youths with immigrant backgrounds under a lot of pressure . so far calls for germany to lift its general ban on dual citizenship have found little support among germany 's major political parties - and there 's little to suggest their position will change any time soon .

his italian counterpart called for closer israeli-eu ties . having kicked off the four-day trip in rome , lieberman said that italy could play a " decisive role " in improving relations between israel and " moderate " arab states .
he made the remarks during a joint news conference with italian foreign minister franco frattini .
lieberman , who has a reputation as a hardliner , has in the past expressed doubts that the israeli-palestinian conflict can be resolved through the creation of two separate , sovereign states .
" israel is n't looking for slogans , but for concrete results , " lieberman said replying to a question on the " two-state solution " backed by the us and the european union .
he then listed concessions made by previous israeli governments that had yielded " no results , " including former prime minister ariel sharon 's decision to withdraw from the gaza strip .
" the -lrb- peace -rrb- process is standing still , " lieberman said .

peace must be achieved through " immediate and concrete steps in the fields of development , security and stability , " frattini said .
frattini also said that relations between israel and the eu must be strengthened .
" the upgrading of ties between europe and israel must not stop because that way europe can play a major role " in the middle east peace process , he told a joint news conference with the ultra-nationalist lieberman . during his four-day european tour , lieberman is also scheduled to meet with officials in france , germany and the czech republic . relations between israel and the eu have been tense since european external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner warned last month that a planned upgrade of bilateral relations could not come about until the israeli government commits to peace talks with the palestinians . dc / pfd , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

six security officials and a former israeli defense minister have been accused of war crimes in the case . judge fernando andreu of spain 's national court was urged by the prosecutors ' office to drop his investigation into a 2002 bombing by the israeli air force that killed hamas leader salah shehadeh , as well as 14 civilians .

he made the remarks during a joint news conference with italian foreign minister franco frattini .
lieberman , who has a reputation as a hardliner , has in the past expressed doubts that the israeli-palestinian conflict can be resolved through the creation of two separate , sovereign states .
" israel is n't looking for slogans , but for concrete results , " lieberman said replying to a question on the " two-state solution " backed by the us and the european union .

peace must be achieved through " immediate and concrete steps in the fields of development , security and stability , " frattini said .
frattini also said that relations between israel and the eu must be strengthened .
" the upgrading of ties between europe and israel must not stop because that way europe can play a major role " in the middle east peace process , he told a joint news conference with the ultra-nationalist lieberman . during his four-day european tour , lieberman is also scheduled to meet with officials in france , germany and the czech republic . relations between israel and the eu have been tense since european external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner warned last month that a planned upgrade of bilateral relations could not come about until the israeli government commits to peace talks with the palestinians . dc / pfd , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

lieberman , who has a reputation as a hardliner , has in the past expressed doubts that the israeli-palestinian conflict can be resolved through the creation of two separate , sovereign states .
" israel is n't looking for slogans , but for concrete results , " lieberman said replying to a question on the " two-state solution " backed by the us and the european union .
he then listed concessions made by previous israeli governments that had yielded " no results , " including former prime minister ariel sharon 's decision to withdraw from the gaza strip .
" the -lrb- peace -rrb- process is standing still , " lieberman said .

peace must be achieved through " immediate and concrete steps in the fields of development , security and stability , " frattini said .
frattini also said that relations between israel and the eu must be strengthened .
" the upgrading of ties between europe and israel must not stop because that way europe can play a major role " in the middle east peace process , he told a joint news conference with the ultra-nationalist lieberman . during his four-day european tour , lieberman is also scheduled to meet with officials in france , germany and the czech republic . relations between israel and the eu have been tense since european external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner warned last month that a planned upgrade of bilateral relations could not come about until the israeli government commits to peace talks with the palestinians . dc / pfd , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the slowdown is much sharper than analysts had forecasted .
sales of food , drinks and tobacco were down most significantly , according to the statistics office .
the only bright spot was in car sales , which were helped by a government program that gave out bonuses to people replacing aging vehicles with new cars .
" on the one hand , the scrapping premium gave a boost to car sales , ” alexander koch of the italian bank unicredit told afp news agency .
" on the other hand , retail sales in other categories exhibited increasing weakness , as the bias towards car sales crowded out other durable good purchases and the increasingly negative labor market outlook already weighs considerably on peoples ' willingness to spend . "
the sharp drop in retail sales increases the likelihood that the european central bank will cut its main interest rate to a record low of 1.0 percent on thursday .
the hope is that the rate cut will give the 16-nation euro zone 's economy a further boost .

however , the cologne-based institute for economic research -lrb- iw -rrb- also said that it did n't expect a fast turnaround .
iw researchers said they expected germany 's gdp to shrink by 4.5 percent in 2009 , and grow by a mere 0.5 percent in 2010 .
exports , which are expected to decrease by 17 percent this year , have been largely responsible for the decline in the german economy , the institute said .

yet they 're still buying cars . german retail sales dropped 3.2 percent in the first quarter of 2009 .
the slowdown is much sharper than analysts had forecasted .
sales of food , drinks and tobacco were down most significantly , according to the statistics office .
the only bright spot was in car sales , which were helped by a government program that gave out bonuses to people replacing aging vehicles with new cars .
" on the one hand , the scrapping premium gave a boost to car sales , ” alexander koch of the italian bank unicredit told afp news agency .
" on the other hand , retail sales in other categories exhibited increasing weakness , as the bias towards car sales crowded out other durable good purchases and the increasingly negative labor market outlook already weighs considerably on peoples ' willingness to spend . "
the sharp drop in retail sales increases the likelihood that the european central bank will cut its main interest rate to a record low of 1.0 percent on thursday .
the hope is that the rate cut will give the 16-nation euro zone 's economy a further boost .

however , the cologne-based institute for economic research -lrb- iw -rrb- also said that it did n't expect a fast turnaround .
iw researchers said they expected germany 's gdp to shrink by 4.5 percent in 2009 , and grow by a mere 0.5 percent in 2010 .
exports , which are expected to decrease by 17 percent this year , have been largely responsible for the decline in the german economy , the institute said .
iw director michael huether also described a regional split in how the recession was impacting the country .

otherwise , the government has threatened to expropriate shareholders to secure a controlling stake in the troubled moneylender .
as this share buyout deadline looms , the german handelsblatt newspaper reports that hre 's financial woes continue .
according to the german business paper , hre has lost roughly 500 million euros -lrb- $ 664 million -rrb- in the first quarter of 2009 , meaning that the struggling bank has not yet turned a corner despite three separate government bailouts .
hre is scheduled to post its first quarter results on tuesday .
berlin has already shored up hre with loan guarantees and cash injections totalling 102 billion euros , and now wants control of the bank .
the us private equity firm jc flowers & co , which owns an estimated 22 percent of hre , has rejected the government 's share offer , saying it is too low .
the group has threatened legal action if berlin tries to seize its shares .
germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck has described the offer , which is 10 percent above the legal minimum , as " very fair " , and has said that the government will expropriate shareholders if they refuse to sell .
the german government passed temporary legislation allowing it to seize private stocks in february , before providing a third set of financial aid to hre .
the government is thought to own almost 23 percent of hre , making it a slightly bigger stakeholder than jc flowers & co .

otherwise , the government has threatened to expropriate shareholders to secure a controlling stake in the troubled moneylender .
as this share buyout deadline looms , the german handelsblatt newspaper reports that hre 's financial woes continue .
according to the german business paper , hre has lost roughly 500 million euros -lrb- $ 664 million -rrb- in the first quarter of 2009 , meaning that the struggling bank has not yet turned a corner despite three separate government bailouts .
hre is scheduled to post its first quarter results on tuesday .
berlin has already shored up hre with loan guarantees and cash injections totalling 102 billion euros , and now wants control of the bank .
the us private equity firm jc flowers & co , which owns an estimated 22 percent of hre , has rejected the government 's share offer , saying it is too low .
the group has threatened legal action if berlin tries to seize its shares .
germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck has described the offer , which is 10 percent above the legal minimum , as " very fair " , and has said that the government will expropriate shareholders if they refuse to sell .
the german government passed temporary legislation allowing it to seize private stocks in february , before providing a third set of financial aid to hre .
the government is thought to own almost 23 percent of hre , making it a slightly bigger stakeholder than jc flowers & co .
berlin 's stake in the bank is rising all the time as more and more small shareholders accept the 1.39 euro offer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 04.05.2009 for german youth , binge drinking is not just for weekends großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dangerous drinking is becoming a disturbing trend binge drinking is becoming more of a daily occurrence among german youth , a new report by the federal government 's commission for drug-related issues has warned . more than 23,000 children and teenagers in germany between the ages of 12 and 17 were treated in hospital for alcohol poisoning in 2008 , said the government 's drug commissioner , sabine baetzing , as she presented the results of her latest report on substance abuse .
it was the highest figure recorded since 2000 , when a noticeable increase in alcoholism among young people first brought the issue to the nation 's attention .
baetzing , a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said that the excessive consumption of alcohol by minors is a trend that is continuing .
in 2008 , more than 20 percent of minors reported being drunk at least once a month .
almost every tenth young person admits to drinking a dangerous volume of alcohol .
however , she stressed that the overall consumption of alcohol , tobacco and cannabis by minors had decreased .
for example , in 2001 , 28 percent of minors smoked cigarettes , while last year , that figure had dropped to 15.4 percent , baetzing said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : existing laws need to be better enforced , the government 's commissioner said she said that while her commission had reached some important goals , germany 's statistics on drug and alcohol abuse by young people are still " incredibly high " when compared with other countries .
according to baetzing , sufficient legislation is in place .
" what we 're lacking is enforcement , " she said .
drug-related deaths to rise , report says the commissioner said she was concerned about the increase in the number of drug-related deaths in germany .
figures released earlier in march revealed that 1449 people died from an overdose of drugs in 2008 - 4 percent more than was the case in 2007 .
baetzing also mentioned another form of addiction which she said was of particular concern : internet addiction .
up to 7 percent of internet users in germany are considered to be addicted to the medium , spending anywhere from 10 to 18 hours a day on chat forums or playing computer games .
when it comes to strategies to combat these various forms of addiction , however , it seems the ruling coalition still can not agree on a way forward .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 04.05.2009 german citizenship applications continue to fall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of immigrants becoming naturalized germans has fallen steadily over the past decade .
a persistent fall in the number of immigrants becoming naturalized german citizens has seen politicians in berlin reignite the debate about cultural integration and citizenship tests . some 187,000 foreigners were naturalized as german citizens in 2000 .
by 2007 that number had dropped about 40 percent to just 113,000 .
official figures for 2008 have n't yet been published , but sevim dagdelen , a parliamentarian from germany 's left party , has done her own research and calculations .
she estimates the number of immigrants who chose to become german citizens last year fell by another 18 percent last year .
" the federal government keeps talking about germany as a land of integration , with a welcoming culture of naturalization , " dagdelen told deutsche welle .
" but it 's clearly untrue .
many foreigners are n't even applying for german citizenship because they 're worried they wo n't be accepted , because the hurdles are set too high . "
tough criteria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sevim dagdelen says citizenship tests are an obstacle to integration to be granted german citizenship , an immigrant must have lived in germany legally for at least eight years .
they have to prove they have an independent income , do n't require social welfare or unemployment benefits , and have a good grasp of the german language .
additional rules introduced in 2007 require applicants who have not graduated from a german school to pass a controversial " citizenship test " .
the examination costs 25 euros and consists of 33 multiple choice items selected from a catalog of 310 questions about german history , culture and the political system .
would-be germans must provide at least 17 correct answers to pass , otherwise they can try again and re-sit the examination at a later date .
the federal government says extremely low failure rates -lrb- around one percent -rrb- prove the test is a success .
but critics say the authorities have got it wrong .
the left-wing berlin state senate 's commissioner for integration , guenter piening , says many immigrants from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds are so worried by the test that they have n't dared to apply for german citizenship .
" these are the people we really want to include in our society , " piening told deutsche welle .
" the middle-class , educated immigrants who confidently decide they want to become german are n't a problem .
the people we really want to appeal to are the immigrants who 've until now have been unsure about naturalization , but do want to commit to our society .
and it 's precisely these people who are being put off by mixed signals . "
language barriers the government 's new language test is particularly unpopular among immigrants .
applicants ca n't get by on basic phrases communicating where they live and who they know .
they have to be able to describe their dreams and justify their opinions .
" we should make exceptions for older , first-generation immigrants , " piening said , adding that the current testing regime is especially challenging for people who never attended a german school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer says language tests promote social cohesion the federal government 's commissioner for integration , maria boehmer , however , is opposed to lowering standards even in the face of falling naturalization numbers .
" in hamburg i took part in a podium discussion .
there was an immigrant who 'd spent more than 30 years in germany .
he told me that without a good grasp of the german language , he would still be little more than a spectator on the edge of society ; " she told deutsche welle .
lies , damn lies , and statistics boehmer , a christian democrat , says the plunge in the number of foreigners taking up german citizenship needs to be carefully examined because a number of factors are at play .
one is a rule that came into force in 2000 .
it states that a child born to an immigrant parent who 's been living in germany for more than eight years is automatically granted german citizenship - so there 's no need for an application .
however , critics point out that such children only remain german if they choose to give up their foreign nationality when they reach 18 years of age .
they say this forced decision puts youths with immigrant backgrounds under a lot of pressure . so far calls for germany to lift its general ban on dual citizenship have found little support among germany 's major political parties - and there 's little to suggest their position will change any time soon .

a persistent fall in the number of immigrants becoming naturalized german citizens has seen politicians in berlin reignite the debate about cultural integration and citizenship tests . some 187,000 foreigners were naturalized as german citizens in 2000 .
by 2007 that number had dropped about 40 percent to just 113,000 .
official figures for 2008 have n't yet been published , but sevim dagdelen , a parliamentarian from germany 's left party , has done her own research and calculations .
she estimates the number of immigrants who chose to become german citizens last year fell by another 18 percent last year .
" the federal government keeps talking about germany as a land of integration , with a welcoming culture of naturalization , " dagdelen told deutsche welle .
" but it 's clearly untrue .
many foreigners are n't even applying for german citizenship because they 're worried they wo n't be accepted , because the hurdles are set too high . "
tough criteria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sevim dagdelen says citizenship tests are an obstacle to integration to be granted german citizenship , an immigrant must have lived in germany legally for at least eight years .
they have to prove they have an independent income , do n't require social welfare or unemployment benefits , and have a good grasp of the german language .
additional rules introduced in 2007 require applicants who have not graduated from a german school to pass a controversial " citizenship test " .
the examination costs 25 euros and consists of 33 multiple choice items selected from a catalog of 310 questions about german history , culture and the political system .
would-be germans must provide at least 17 correct answers to pass , otherwise they can try again and re-sit the examination at a later date .
the federal government says extremely low failure rates -lrb- around one percent -rrb- prove the test is a success .
but critics say the authorities have got it wrong .
the left-wing berlin state senate 's commissioner for integration , guenter piening , says many immigrants from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds are so worried by the test that they have n't dared to apply for german citizenship .
" these are the people we really want to include in our society , " piening told deutsche welle .
" the middle-class , educated immigrants who confidently decide they want to become german are n't a problem .
the people we really want to appeal to are the immigrants who 've until now have been unsure about naturalization , but do want to commit to our society .
and it 's precisely these people who are being put off by mixed signals . "
language barriers the government 's new language test is particularly unpopular among immigrants .
applicants ca n't get by on basic phrases communicating where they live and who they know .
they have to be able to describe their dreams and justify their opinions .
" we should make exceptions for older , first-generation immigrants , " piening said , adding that the current testing regime is especially challenging for people who never attended a german school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer says language tests promote social cohesion the federal government 's commissioner for integration , maria boehmer , however , is opposed to lowering standards even in the face of falling naturalization numbers .
" in hamburg i took part in a podium discussion .
there was an immigrant who 'd spent more than 30 years in germany .
he told me that without a good grasp of the german language , he would still be little more than a spectator on the edge of society ; " she told deutsche welle .
lies , damn lies , and statistics boehmer , a christian democrat , says the plunge in the number of foreigners taking up german citizenship needs to be carefully examined because a number of factors are at play .
one is a rule that came into force in 2000 .
it states that a child born to an immigrant parent who 's been living in germany for more than eight years is automatically granted german citizenship - so there 's no need for an application .
however , critics point out that such children only remain german if they choose to give up their foreign nationality when they reach 18 years of age .
they say this forced decision puts youths with immigrant backgrounds under a lot of pressure . so far calls for germany to lift its general ban on dual citizenship have found little support among germany 's major political parties - and there 's little to suggest their position will change any time soon .

it was the highest figure recorded since 2000 , when a noticeable increase in alcoholism among young people first brought the issue to the nation 's attention .
baetzing , a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said that the excessive consumption of alcohol by minors is a trend that is continuing .
in 2008 , more than 20 percent of minors reported being drunk at least once a month .
almost every tenth young person admits to drinking a dangerous volume of alcohol .
however , she stressed that the overall consumption of alcohol , tobacco and cannabis by minors had decreased .
for example , in 2001 , 28 percent of minors smoked cigarettes , while last year , that figure had dropped to 15.4 percent , baetzing said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : existing laws need to be better enforced , the government 's commissioner said she said that while her commission had reached some important goals , germany 's statistics on drug and alcohol abuse by young people are still " incredibly high " when compared with other countries .
according to baetzing , sufficient legislation is in place .
" what we 're lacking is enforcement , " she said .
drug-related deaths to rise , report says the commissioner said she was concerned about the increase in the number of drug-related deaths in germany .
figures released earlier in march revealed that 1449 people died from an overdose of drugs in 2008 - 4 percent more than was the case in 2007 .
baetzing also mentioned another form of addiction which she said was of particular concern : internet addiction .
up to 7 percent of internet users in germany are considered to be addicted to the medium , spending anywhere from 10 to 18 hours a day on chat forums or playing computer games .
when it comes to strategies to combat these various forms of addiction , however , it seems the ruling coalition still can not agree on a way forward .
asked about a stalled national action program against excessive alcohol and tobacco consumption , baetzing accused chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- of blocking progress so as not to hurt their chances in the upcoming general election .
family minister ursula von der leyen rejected the accusation , saying that her party had only objected to the action plan in its current form .
" significant parts of the action program presented today offer mere recommendations , " a spokesperson from von der leyen 's ministry said .
" qualitatively , it 's not enough for the federal government to form a national initiative . " dc / pfd , dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

otherwise , the government has threatened to expropriate shareholders to secure a controlling stake in the troubled moneylender .
as this share buyout deadline looms , the german handelsblatt newspaper reports that hre 's financial woes continue .
according to the german business paper , hre has lost roughly 500 million euros -lrb- $ 664 million -rrb- in the first quarter of 2009 , meaning that the struggling bank has not yet turned a corner despite three separate government bailouts .
hre is scheduled to post its first quarter results on tuesday .
berlin has already shored up hre with loan guarantees and cash injections totalling 102 billion euros , and now wants control of the bank .
the us private equity firm jc flowers & co , which owns an estimated 22 percent of hre , has rejected the government 's share offer , saying it is too low .
the group has threatened legal action if berlin tries to seize its shares .
germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck has described the offer , which is 10 percent above the legal minimum , as " very fair " , and has said that the government will expropriate shareholders if they refuse to sell .
the german government passed temporary legislation allowing it to seize private stocks in february , before providing a third set of financial aid to hre .
the government is thought to own almost 23 percent of hre , making it a slightly bigger stakeholder than jc flowers & co .
berlin 's stake in the bank is rising all the time as more and more small shareholders accept the 1.39 euro offer .
the remainder of hre stock is held in small quantites by assorted hedgefunds and private investors. msh / rm , reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

otherwise , the government has threatened to expropriate shareholders to secure a controlling stake in the troubled moneylender .
as this share buyout deadline looms , the german handelsblatt newspaper reports that hre 's financial woes continue .
according to the german business paper , hre has lost roughly 500 million euros -lrb- $ 664 million -rrb- in the first quarter of 2009 , meaning that the struggling bank has not yet turned a corner despite three separate government bailouts .
hre is scheduled to post its first quarter results on tuesday .
berlin has already shored up hre with loan guarantees and cash injections totalling 102 billion euros , and now wants control of the bank .
the us private equity firm jc flowers & co , which owns an estimated 22 percent of hre , has rejected the government 's share offer , saying it is too low .
the group has threatened legal action if berlin tries to seize its shares .
germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck has described the offer , which is 10 percent above the legal minimum , as " very fair " , and has said that the government will expropriate shareholders if they refuse to sell .
the german government passed temporary legislation allowing it to seize private stocks in february , before providing a third set of financial aid to hre .
the government is thought to own almost 23 percent of hre , making it a slightly bigger stakeholder than jc flowers & co .
berlin 's stake in the bank is rising all the time as more and more small shareholders accept the 1.39 euro offer .
the remainder of hre stock is held in small quantites by assorted hedgefunds and private investors. msh / rm , reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

otherwise , the government has threatened to expropriate shareholders to secure a controlling stake in the troubled moneylender .

according to the german business paper , hre has lost roughly 500 million euros -lrb- $ 664 million -rrb- in the first quarter of 2009 , meaning that the struggling bank has not yet turned a corner despite three separate government bailouts .
hre is scheduled to post its first quarter results on tuesday .

germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck has described the offer , which is 10 percent above the legal minimum , as " very fair " , and has said that the government will expropriate shareholders if they refuse to sell .
the german government passed temporary legislation allowing it to seize private stocks in february , before providing a third set of financial aid to hre .

european union economies are now expected to contract by 4 percent in 2009 . some 8.5 million jobs will disappear in the eu this year and next , more than wiping out the new jobs created in recent years .
unemployment will reach 11.5 percent by the end of next year , the commission said .
skyrocketing unemployment will be accompanied by plunging exports through the end of 2010 , the commission predicts .
the eu said monday that euro zone exports are “ forecast to suffer one of the worst setbacks on record . ”
conditions have worsened in january , the eu had predicted modest growth of 0.5 percent for the bloc next year .
but that prediction has been scrapped as the bloc 's five biggest members turned in grim economic data .
the commission now forecasts that the eu economies will shrink another 0.1 percent in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's export economy is hard hit by the downturn germany , the eu 's economic motor , faces a contraction of 5.4 percent this year .
and axel weber , president of germany 's national bank , the bundesbank , warned monday that the country 's gdp is unlikely to rise before the second half of 2010 .
" from today 's perspective , i do n't expect positive growth rates before the second half of next year , " weber said at a tax advisory congress in hamburg .
stable financial markets are a pre-requisite for economic growth , weber said , adding " there , adjustment processes are still in full swing . "
european economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia also said he hoped that the eu 's economic outlook would begin to improve in 2010 .
actions taken by governments and central banks " are expected to put a floor under the fall in economic activity this year and enable a recovery next year , " almunia said .
however , the government stimulus plans come at a cost .
public debt is expected to grow to an average 7.5 percent of gross domestic product in the eu next year .
no escape for eastern europe the storm also looks set to engulf previously robust economies in central and eastern europe such as poland , slovakia , romania , bulgaria and the czech republic .
as recently as january , the eu newcomers were tipped to record substantial growth .
but according to the latest forecasts , all are set to go into recession this year as key markets in western europe and russia collapse .
slovakia , tipped in january to record growth of 2.7 percent this year , now faces a contraction of 2.6 percent .
romania , which was in january expected to record growth of 1.8 percent , now faces a 4-percent fall in economic output .

while it might make good daytime television , the newspaper says , it does not bode well for the german carmaker 's future .
vw and porsche have refused to comment on the discussions .
the two families met last week , but could n't reach an agreement .
they are reportedly scheduled to meet again on wednesday in salzburg , austria .
to sell , or not to sell while the porsche and piech families agree that something needs to be done to help their debt-ridden luxury brand , some family members are loathe to sell out to rival german carmaker volkswagen .
porsche will not be sold to vw , wolfgang porsche was quoted by german media as declaring over the weekend .
yet ferdinand piech , another heir to the porsche fortune , has reportedly proposed selling to volkswagen for 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- .
germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported that porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking is pushing for a middle ground solution .
instead of one company taking over the other , wiedeking reporteldy wants the two companies to merge , which would allow them to raise new capital .
porsche had eyed vw takeover porsche se , the luxury brand 's holding company , already owns 51 percent of vw , but analysts say that the 9 billion euros of debt it has accumulated to buy the shares is making it difficult for porsche to raise its target stake in vw to 75 percent .
late last week , volkswagen said it had n't reached any agreement with porsche regarding expanding cooperation between the two companies . th / rm , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while it might make good daytime television , the newspaper says , it does not bode well for the german carmaker 's future .
vw and porsche have refused to comment on the discussions .
the two families met last week , but could n't reach an agreement .
they are reportedly scheduled to meet again on wednesday in salzburg , austria .
to sell , or not to sell while the porsche and piech families agree that something needs to be done to help their debt-ridden luxury brand , some family members are loathe to sell out to rival german carmaker volkswagen .
porsche will not be sold to vw , wolfgang porsche was quoted by german media as declaring over the weekend .
yet ferdinand piech , another heir to the porsche fortune , has reportedly proposed selling to volkswagen for 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- .
germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported that porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking is pushing for a middle ground solution .
instead of one company taking over the other , wiedeking reporteldy wants the two companies to merge , which would allow them to raise new capital .
porsche had eyed vw takeover porsche se , the luxury brand 's holding company , already owns 51 percent of vw , but analysts say that the 9 billion euros of debt it has accumulated to buy the shares is making it difficult for porsche to raise its target stake in vw to 75 percent .
late last week , volkswagen said it had n't reached any agreement with porsche regarding expanding cooperation between the two companies . th / rm , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

otherwise , the government has threatened to expropriate shareholders to secure a controlling stake in the troubled moneylender .
as this share buyout deadline looms , the german handelsblatt newspaper reports that hre 's financial woes continue .
according to the german business paper , hre has lost roughly 500 million euros -lrb- $ 664 million -rrb- in the first quarter of 2009 , meaning that the struggling bank has not yet turned a corner despite three separate government bailouts .
hre is scheduled to post its first quarter results on tuesday .
berlin has already shored up hre with loan guarantees and cash injections totalling 102 billion euros , and now wants control of the bank .
the us private equity firm jc flowers & co , which owns an estimated 22 percent of hre , has rejected the government 's share offer , saying it is too low .
the group has threatened legal action if berlin tries to seize its shares .
germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck has described the offer , which is 10 percent above the legal minimum , as " very fair " , and has said that the government will expropriate shareholders if they refuse to sell .
the german government passed temporary legislation allowing it to seize private stocks in february , before providing a third set of financial aid to hre .
the government is thought to own almost 23 percent of hre , making it a slightly bigger stakeholder than jc flowers & co .
berlin 's stake in the bank is rising all the time as more and more small shareholders accept the 1.39 euro offer .
the remainder of hre stock is held in small quantites by assorted hedgefunds and private investors. msh / rm , reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" israel is n't looking for slogans , but for concrete results , " lieberman said replying to a question on the " two-state solution " backed by the us and the european union .

frattini also said that relations between israel and the eu must be strengthened .
" the upgrading of ties between europe and israel must not stop because that way europe can play a major role " in the middle east peace process , he told a joint news conference with the ultra-nationalist lieberman . during his four-day european tour , lieberman is also scheduled to meet with officials in france , germany and the czech republic . relations between israel and the eu have been tense since european external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner warned last month that a planned upgrade of bilateral relations could not come about until the israeli government commits to peace talks with the palestinians . dc / pfd , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" but the who continues to warn that a pandemic is possible , " ban said monday in a joint teleconference with who director-general margaret chan from geneva .
" let us remember that even if the who does declare phase six - a pandemic - that would be a statement about the geographic spread of the virus , not its severity , " ban said , reflecting the growing consensus that the h1n1 virus could be a mild flu virus .

otherwise , the government has threatened to expropriate shareholders to secure a controlling stake in the troubled moneylender .
as this share buyout deadline looms , the german handelsblatt newspaper reports that hre 's financial woes continue .
according to the german business paper , hre has lost roughly 500 million euros -lrb- $ 664 million -rrb- in the first quarter of 2009 , meaning that the struggling bank has not yet turned a corner despite three separate government bailouts .
hre is scheduled to post its first quarter results on tuesday .
berlin has already shored up hre with loan guarantees and cash injections totalling 102 billion euros , and now wants control of the bank .
the us private equity firm jc flowers & co , which owns an estimated 22 percent of hre , has rejected the government 's share offer , saying it is too low .
the group has threatened legal action if berlin tries to seize its shares .
germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck has described the offer , which is 10 percent above the legal minimum , as " very fair " , and has said that the government will expropriate shareholders if they refuse to sell .
the german government passed temporary legislation allowing it to seize private stocks in february , before providing a third set of financial aid to hre .
the government is thought to own almost 23 percent of hre , making it a slightly bigger stakeholder than jc flowers & co .
berlin 's stake in the bank is rising all the time as more and more small shareholders accept the 1.39 euro offer .
the remainder of hre stock is held in small quantites by assorted hedgefunds and private investors. msh / rm , reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 04.05.2009 german citizenship applications continue to fall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of immigrants becoming naturalized germans has fallen steadily over the past decade .
a persistent fall in the number of immigrants becoming naturalized german citizens has seen politicians in berlin reignite the debate about cultural integration and citizenship tests . some 187,000 foreigners were naturalized as german citizens in 2000 .
by 2007 that number had dropped about 40 percent to just 113,000 .
official figures for 2008 have n't yet been published , but sevim dagdelen , a parliamentarian from germany 's left party , has done her own research and calculations .
she estimates the number of immigrants who chose to become german citizens last year fell by another 18 percent last year .
" the federal government keeps talking about germany as a land of integration , with a welcoming culture of naturalization , " dagdelen told deutsche welle .
" but it 's clearly untrue .
many foreigners are n't even applying for german citizenship because they 're worried they wo n't be accepted , because the hurdles are set too high . "
tough criteria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sevim dagdelen says citizenship tests are an obstacle to integration to be granted german citizenship , an immigrant must have lived in germany legally for at least eight years .
they have to prove they have an independent income , do n't require social welfare or unemployment benefits , and have a good grasp of the german language .
additional rules introduced in 2007 require applicants who have not graduated from a german school to pass a controversial " citizenship test " .
the examination costs 25 euros and consists of 33 multiple choice items selected from a catalog of 310 questions about german history , culture and the political system .
would-be germans must provide at least 17 correct answers to pass , otherwise they can try again and re-sit the examination at a later date .
the federal government says extremely low failure rates -lrb- around one percent -rrb- prove the test is a success .
but critics say the authorities have got it wrong .
the left-wing berlin state senate 's commissioner for integration , guenter piening , says many immigrants from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds are so worried by the test that they have n't dared to apply for german citizenship .
" these are the people we really want to include in our society , " piening told deutsche welle .
" the middle-class , educated immigrants who confidently decide they want to become german are n't a problem .
the people we really want to appeal to are the immigrants who 've until now have been unsure about naturalization , but do want to commit to our society .
and it 's precisely these people who are being put off by mixed signals . "
language barriers the government 's new language test is particularly unpopular among immigrants .
applicants ca n't get by on basic phrases communicating where they live and who they know .
they have to be able to describe their dreams and justify their opinions .
" we should make exceptions for older , first-generation immigrants , " piening said , adding that the current testing regime is especially challenging for people who never attended a german school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer says language tests promote social cohesion the federal government 's commissioner for integration , maria boehmer , however , is opposed to lowering standards even in the face of falling naturalization numbers .
" in hamburg i took part in a podium discussion .
there was an immigrant who 'd spent more than 30 years in germany .
he told me that without a good grasp of the german language , he would still be little more than a spectator on the edge of society ; " she told deutsche welle .
lies , damn lies , and statistics boehmer , a christian democrat , says the plunge in the number of foreigners taking up german citizenship needs to be carefully examined because a number of factors are at play .
one is a rule that came into force in 2000 .
it states that a child born to an immigrant parent who 's been living in germany for more than eight years is automatically granted german citizenship - so there 's no need for an application .
however , critics point out that such children only remain german if they choose to give up their foreign nationality when they reach 18 years of age .
they say this forced decision puts youths with immigrant backgrounds under a lot of pressure . so far calls for germany to lift its general ban on dual citizenship have found little support among germany 's major political parties - and there 's little to suggest their position will change any time soon .

european union economies are now expected to contract by 4 percent in 2009 . some 8.5 million jobs will disappear in the eu this year and next , more than wiping out the new jobs created in recent years .
unemployment will reach 11.5 percent by the end of next year , the commission said .
skyrocketing unemployment will be accompanied by plunging exports through the end of 2010 , the commission predicts .
the eu said monday that euro zone exports are “ forecast to suffer one of the worst setbacks on record . ”
conditions have worsened in january , the eu had predicted modest growth of 0.5 percent for the bloc next year .
but that prediction has been scrapped as the bloc 's five biggest members turned in grim economic data .
the commission now forecasts that the eu economies will shrink another 0.1 percent in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's export economy is hard hit by the downturn germany , the eu 's economic motor , faces a contraction of 5.4 percent this year .
and axel weber , president of germany 's national bank , the bundesbank , warned monday that the country 's gdp is unlikely to rise before the second half of 2010 .
" from today 's perspective , i do n't expect positive growth rates before the second half of next year , " weber said at a tax advisory congress in hamburg .
stable financial markets are a pre-requisite for economic growth , weber said , adding " there , adjustment processes are still in full swing . "
european economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia also said he hoped that the eu 's economic outlook would begin to improve in 2010 .
actions taken by governments and central banks " are expected to put a floor under the fall in economic activity this year and enable a recovery next year , " almunia said .
however , the government stimulus plans come at a cost .
public debt is expected to grow to an average 7.5 percent of gross domestic product in the eu next year .
no escape for eastern europe the storm also looks set to engulf previously robust economies in central and eastern europe such as poland , slovakia , romania , bulgaria and the czech republic .
as recently as january , the eu newcomers were tipped to record substantial growth .
but according to the latest forecasts , all are set to go into recession this year as key markets in western europe and russia collapse .
slovakia , tipped in january to record growth of 2.7 percent this year , now faces a contraction of 2.6 percent .
romania , which was in january expected to record growth of 1.8 percent , now faces a 4-percent fall in economic output .

his italian counterpart called for closer israeli-eu ties . having kicked off the four-day trip in rome , lieberman said that italy could play a " decisive role " in improving relations between israel and " moderate " arab states .
he made the remarks during a joint news conference with italian foreign minister franco frattini .
lieberman , who has a reputation as a hardliner , has in the past expressed doubts that the israeli-palestinian conflict can be resolved through the creation of two separate , sovereign states .
" israel is n't looking for slogans , but for concrete results , " lieberman said replying to a question on the " two-state solution " backed by the us and the european union .
he then listed concessions made by previous israeli governments that had yielded " no results , " including former prime minister ariel sharon 's decision to withdraw from the gaza strip .
" the -lrb- peace -rrb- process is standing still , " lieberman said .

peace must be achieved through " immediate and concrete steps in the fields of development , security and stability , " frattini said .
frattini also said that relations between israel and the eu must be strengthened .
" the upgrading of ties between europe and israel must not stop because that way europe can play a major role " in the middle east peace process , he told a joint news conference with the ultra-nationalist lieberman . during his four-day european tour , lieberman is also scheduled to meet with officials in france , germany and the czech republic . relations between israel and the eu have been tense since european external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner warned last month that a planned upgrade of bilateral relations could not come about until the israeli government commits to peace talks with the palestinians . dc / pfd , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

lieberman , who has a reputation as a hardliner , has in the past expressed doubts that the israeli-palestinian conflict can be resolved through the creation of two separate , sovereign states .
" israel is n't looking for slogans , but for concrete results , " lieberman said replying to a question on the " two-state solution " backed by the us and the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 04.05.2009 german citizenship applications continue to fall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of immigrants becoming naturalized germans has fallen steadily over the past decade .
a persistent fall in the number of immigrants becoming naturalized german citizens has seen politicians in berlin reignite the debate about cultural integration and citizenship tests . some 187,000 foreigners were naturalized as german citizens in 2000 .
by 2007 that number had dropped about 40 percent to just 113,000 .
official figures for 2008 have n't yet been published , but sevim dagdelen , a parliamentarian from germany 's left party , has done her own research and calculations .
she estimates the number of immigrants who chose to become german citizens last year fell by another 18 percent last year .
" the federal government keeps talking about germany as a land of integration , with a welcoming culture of naturalization , " dagdelen told deutsche welle .
" but it 's clearly untrue .
many foreigners are n't even applying for german citizenship because they 're worried they wo n't be accepted , because the hurdles are set too high . "
tough criteria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sevim dagdelen says citizenship tests are an obstacle to integration to be granted german citizenship , an immigrant must have lived in germany legally for at least eight years .
they have to prove they have an independent income , do n't require social welfare or unemployment benefits , and have a good grasp of the german language .
additional rules introduced in 2007 require applicants who have not graduated from a german school to pass a controversial " citizenship test " .
the examination costs 25 euros and consists of 33 multiple choice items selected from a catalog of 310 questions about german history , culture and the political system .
would-be germans must provide at least 17 correct answers to pass , otherwise they can try again and re-sit the examination at a later date .
the federal government says extremely low failure rates -lrb- around one percent -rrb- prove the test is a success .
but critics say the authorities have got it wrong .
the left-wing berlin state senate 's commissioner for integration , guenter piening , says many immigrants from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds are so worried by the test that they have n't dared to apply for german citizenship .
" these are the people we really want to include in our society , " piening told deutsche welle .
" the middle-class , educated immigrants who confidently decide they want to become german are n't a problem .
the people we really want to appeal to are the immigrants who 've until now have been unsure about naturalization , but do want to commit to our society .
and it 's precisely these people who are being put off by mixed signals . "
language barriers the government 's new language test is particularly unpopular among immigrants .
applicants ca n't get by on basic phrases communicating where they live and who they know .
they have to be able to describe their dreams and justify their opinions .
" we should make exceptions for older , first-generation immigrants , " piening said , adding that the current testing regime is especially challenging for people who never attended a german school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer says language tests promote social cohesion the federal government 's commissioner for integration , maria boehmer , however , is opposed to lowering standards even in the face of falling naturalization numbers .
" in hamburg i took part in a podium discussion .
there was an immigrant who 'd spent more than 30 years in germany .
he told me that without a good grasp of the german language , he would still be little more than a spectator on the edge of society ; " she told deutsche welle .
lies , damn lies , and statistics boehmer , a christian democrat , says the plunge in the number of foreigners taking up german citizenship needs to be carefully examined because a number of factors are at play .
one is a rule that came into force in 2000 .
it states that a child born to an immigrant parent who 's been living in germany for more than eight years is automatically granted german citizenship - so there 's no need for an application .
however , critics point out that such children only remain german if they choose to give up their foreign nationality when they reach 18 years of age .
they say this forced decision puts youths with immigrant backgrounds under a lot of pressure . so far calls for germany to lift its general ban on dual citizenship have found little support among germany 's major political parties - and there 's little to suggest their position will change any time soon .

a persistent fall in the number of immigrants becoming naturalized german citizens has seen politicians in berlin reignite the debate about cultural integration and citizenship tests . some 187,000 foreigners were naturalized as german citizens in 2000 .
by 2007 that number had dropped about 40 percent to just 113,000 .
official figures for 2008 have n't yet been published , but sevim dagdelen , a parliamentarian from germany 's left party , has done her own research and calculations .
she estimates the number of immigrants who chose to become german citizens last year fell by another 18 percent last year .
" the federal government keeps talking about germany as a land of integration , with a welcoming culture of naturalization , " dagdelen told deutsche welle .
" but it 's clearly untrue .
many foreigners are n't even applying for german citizenship because they 're worried they wo n't be accepted , because the hurdles are set too high . "
tough criteria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sevim dagdelen says citizenship tests are an obstacle to integration to be granted german citizenship , an immigrant must have lived in germany legally for at least eight years .
they have to prove they have an independent income , do n't require social welfare or unemployment benefits , and have a good grasp of the german language .
additional rules introduced in 2007 require applicants who have not graduated from a german school to pass a controversial " citizenship test " .
the examination costs 25 euros and consists of 33 multiple choice items selected from a catalog of 310 questions about german history , culture and the political system .
would-be germans must provide at least 17 correct answers to pass , otherwise they can try again and re-sit the examination at a later date .
the federal government says extremely low failure rates -lrb- around one percent -rrb- prove the test is a success .
but critics say the authorities have got it wrong .
the left-wing berlin state senate 's commissioner for integration , guenter piening , says many immigrants from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds are so worried by the test that they have n't dared to apply for german citizenship .
" these are the people we really want to include in our society , " piening told deutsche welle .
" the middle-class , educated immigrants who confidently decide they want to become german are n't a problem .
the people we really want to appeal to are the immigrants who 've until now have been unsure about naturalization , but do want to commit to our society .
and it 's precisely these people who are being put off by mixed signals . "
language barriers the government 's new language test is particularly unpopular among immigrants .
applicants ca n't get by on basic phrases communicating where they live and who they know .
they have to be able to describe their dreams and justify their opinions .
" we should make exceptions for older , first-generation immigrants , " piening said , adding that the current testing regime is especially challenging for people who never attended a german school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer says language tests promote social cohesion the federal government 's commissioner for integration , maria boehmer , however , is opposed to lowering standards even in the face of falling naturalization numbers .
" in hamburg i took part in a podium discussion .
there was an immigrant who 'd spent more than 30 years in germany .
he told me that without a good grasp of the german language , he would still be little more than a spectator on the edge of society ; " she told deutsche welle .
lies , damn lies , and statistics boehmer , a christian democrat , says the plunge in the number of foreigners taking up german citizenship needs to be carefully examined because a number of factors are at play .
one is a rule that came into force in 2000 .
it states that a child born to an immigrant parent who 's been living in germany for more than eight years is automatically granted german citizenship - so there 's no need for an application .
however , critics point out that such children only remain german if they choose to give up their foreign nationality when they reach 18 years of age .
they say this forced decision puts youths with immigrant backgrounds under a lot of pressure . so far calls for germany to lift its general ban on dual citizenship have found little support among germany 's major political parties - and there 's little to suggest their position will change any time soon .

but , he also said he was open to bids from other suitors . on monday , the head of fiat met separately with guttenberg , chancellor angela merkel and vice-chancellor frank-walter steinmeier for high-level talks to discuss the italian automaker 's plans for an opel takeover .
the ceo of italy 's fiat , sergio marchionne , presented an audacious plan at the talks in berlin to snap up all of us carmaker general motor 's european operations and merge them with bankrupt chrysler to create a new global auto giant .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fiat ceo sergio marchionne 's bid for opel includes all of gm 's european operations marchionne touted the plan as a " marriage made in heaven . "
at a press conference after the talks , guttenberg unveiled key aspects of the plan , but said more details were needed .
he said that " opel would be maintained as a brand with a german headquarters , and that all three final assembly plants in germany would be kept as well . "
he did say , however , that there was a need for " consolidation of personnel and individual production facilities . "
in germany , this could affect the factory in kaiserslautern , the economics minister said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister guttenberg unveiled details of fiat 's takeover bid at a press conference in berlin marchionne 's plan would create an industrial behemoth with annual revenue of 80 billion euros and a production capacity of between six and seven million vehicles a year .
the new pan-european auto manufacturer would be second only to japan 's toyota , bigger than general motors or ford , and about the same size as germany 's volkswagen , currently europe 's largest carmaker .
the company would include the brands fiat , opel , britain 's vauxhall and sweden 's saab , as well as chrysler .
the economics minister said marchionne was looking to finance the deal without burdening what would be the italian parent company with extra costs : " fiat wants to complete the deal without taking on additional debt , " he said .
" transitional financing would be paid for with general motors debt and the liabilities of the gm pension fund . "
fiat estimates this figure to be between five and seven billion euros , guttenberg said .
germany has also said it is prepared to provide up to 3.3 billion euros in interim financing guarantees .
marchionne said he wanted a decision within 30 days .
fiat has offered around one billion euros for opel , according to rainer einenkel , the head of opel 's works council in the german industrial city of bochum .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 04.05.2009 for german youth , binge drinking is not just for weekends großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dangerous drinking is becoming a disturbing trend binge drinking is becoming more of a daily occurrence among german youth , a new report by the federal government 's commission for drug-related issues has warned . more than 23,000 children and teenagers in germany between the ages of 12 and 17 were treated in hospital for alcohol poisoning in 2008 , said the government 's drug commissioner , sabine baetzing , as she presented the results of her latest report on substance abuse .
it was the highest figure recorded since 2000 , when a noticeable increase in alcoholism among young people first brought the issue to the nation 's attention .
baetzing , a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said that the excessive consumption of alcohol by minors is a trend that is continuing .
in 2008 , more than 20 percent of minors reported being drunk at least once a month .
almost every tenth young person admits to drinking a dangerous volume of alcohol .
however , she stressed that the overall consumption of alcohol , tobacco and cannabis by minors had decreased .
for example , in 2001 , 28 percent of minors smoked cigarettes , while last year , that figure had dropped to 15.4 percent , baetzing said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : existing laws need to be better enforced , the government 's commissioner said she said that while her commission had reached some important goals , germany 's statistics on drug and alcohol abuse by young people are still " incredibly high " when compared with other countries .
according to baetzing , sufficient legislation is in place .
" what we 're lacking is enforcement , " she said .
drug-related deaths to rise , report says the commissioner said she was concerned about the increase in the number of drug-related deaths in germany .
figures released earlier in march revealed that 1449 people died from an overdose of drugs in 2008 - 4 percent more than was the case in 2007 .
baetzing also mentioned another form of addiction which she said was of particular concern : internet addiction .
up to 7 percent of internet users in germany are considered to be addicted to the medium , spending anywhere from 10 to 18 hours a day on chat forums or playing computer games .
when it comes to strategies to combat these various forms of addiction , however , it seems the ruling coalition still can not agree on a way forward .
asked about a stalled national action program against excessive alcohol and tobacco consumption , baetzing accused chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- of blocking progress so as not to hurt their chances in the upcoming general election .
family minister ursula von der leyen rejected the accusation , saying that her party had only objected to the action plan in its current form .
" significant parts of the action program presented today offer mere recommendations , " a spokesperson from von der leyen 's ministry said .

it was the highest figure recorded since 2000 , when a noticeable increase in alcoholism among young people first brought the issue to the nation 's attention .
baetzing , a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said that the excessive consumption of alcohol by minors is a trend that is continuing .
in 2008 , more than 20 percent of minors reported being drunk at least once a month .
almost every tenth young person admits to drinking a dangerous volume of alcohol .
however , she stressed that the overall consumption of alcohol , tobacco and cannabis by minors had decreased .
for example , in 2001 , 28 percent of minors smoked cigarettes , while last year , that figure had dropped to 15.4 percent , baetzing said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : existing laws need to be better enforced , the government 's commissioner said she said that while her commission had reached some important goals , germany 's statistics on drug and alcohol abuse by young people are still " incredibly high " when compared with other countries .
according to baetzing , sufficient legislation is in place .
" what we 're lacking is enforcement , " she said .
drug-related deaths to rise , report says the commissioner said she was concerned about the increase in the number of drug-related deaths in germany .
figures released earlier in march revealed that 1449 people died from an overdose of drugs in 2008 - 4 percent more than was the case in 2007 .
baetzing also mentioned another form of addiction which she said was of particular concern : internet addiction .
up to 7 percent of internet users in germany are considered to be addicted to the medium , spending anywhere from 10 to 18 hours a day on chat forums or playing computer games .
when it comes to strategies to combat these various forms of addiction , however , it seems the ruling coalition still can not agree on a way forward .
asked about a stalled national action program against excessive alcohol and tobacco consumption , baetzing accused chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- of blocking progress so as not to hurt their chances in the upcoming general election .
family minister ursula von der leyen rejected the accusation , saying that her party had only objected to the action plan in its current form .
" significant parts of the action program presented today offer mere recommendations , " a spokesperson from von der leyen 's ministry said .

otherwise , the government has threatened to expropriate shareholders to secure a controlling stake in the troubled moneylender .
as this share buyout deadline looms , the german handelsblatt newspaper reports that hre 's financial woes continue .
according to the german business paper , hre has lost roughly 500 million euros -lrb- $ 664 million -rrb- in the first quarter of 2009 , meaning that the struggling bank has not yet turned a corner despite three separate government bailouts .
hre is scheduled to post its first quarter results on tuesday .
berlin has already shored up hre with loan guarantees and cash injections totalling 102 billion euros , and now wants control of the bank .
the us private equity firm jc flowers & co , which owns an estimated 22 percent of hre , has rejected the government 's share offer , saying it is too low .
the group has threatened legal action if berlin tries to seize its shares .
germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck has described the offer , which is 10 percent above the legal minimum , as " very fair " , and has said that the government will expropriate shareholders if they refuse to sell .
the german government passed temporary legislation allowing it to seize private stocks in february , before providing a third set of financial aid to hre .
the government is thought to own almost 23 percent of hre , making it a slightly bigger stakeholder than jc flowers & co .
berlin 's stake in the bank is rising all the time as more and more small shareholders accept the 1.39 euro offer .

otherwise , the government has threatened to expropriate shareholders to secure a controlling stake in the troubled moneylender .
as this share buyout deadline looms , the german handelsblatt newspaper reports that hre 's financial woes continue .
according to the german business paper , hre has lost roughly 500 million euros -lrb- $ 664 million -rrb- in the first quarter of 2009 , meaning that the struggling bank has not yet turned a corner despite three separate government bailouts .
hre is scheduled to post its first quarter results on tuesday .
berlin has already shored up hre with loan guarantees and cash injections totalling 102 billion euros , and now wants control of the bank .
the us private equity firm jc flowers & co , which owns an estimated 22 percent of hre , has rejected the government 's share offer , saying it is too low .
the group has threatened legal action if berlin tries to seize its shares .
germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck has described the offer , which is 10 percent above the legal minimum , as " very fair " , and has said that the government will expropriate shareholders if they refuse to sell .
the german government passed temporary legislation allowing it to seize private stocks in february , before providing a third set of financial aid to hre .
the government is thought to own almost 23 percent of hre , making it a slightly bigger stakeholder than jc flowers & co .
berlin 's stake in the bank is rising all the time as more and more small shareholders accept the 1.39 euro offer .

it was the highest figure recorded since 2000 , when a noticeable increase in alcoholism among young people first brought the issue to the nation 's attention .
baetzing , a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said that the excessive consumption of alcohol by minors is a trend that is continuing .
in 2008 , more than 20 percent of minors reported being drunk at least once a month .
almost every tenth young person admits to drinking a dangerous volume of alcohol .
however , she stressed that the overall consumption of alcohol , tobacco and cannabis by minors had decreased .
for example , in 2001 , 28 percent of minors smoked cigarettes , while last year , that figure had dropped to 15.4 percent , baetzing said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : existing laws need to be better enforced , the government 's commissioner said she said that while her commission had reached some important goals , germany 's statistics on drug and alcohol abuse by young people are still " incredibly high " when compared with other countries .
according to baetzing , sufficient legislation is in place .
" what we 're lacking is enforcement , " she said .
drug-related deaths to rise , report says the commissioner said she was concerned about the increase in the number of drug-related deaths in germany .
figures released earlier in march revealed that 1449 people died from an overdose of drugs in 2008 - 4 percent more than was the case in 2007 .
baetzing also mentioned another form of addiction which she said was of particular concern : internet addiction .
up to 7 percent of internet users in germany are considered to be addicted to the medium , spending anywhere from 10 to 18 hours a day on chat forums or playing computer games .
when it comes to strategies to combat these various forms of addiction , however , it seems the ruling coalition still can not agree on a way forward .
asked about a stalled national action program against excessive alcohol and tobacco consumption , baetzing accused chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- of blocking progress so as not to hurt their chances in the upcoming general election .
family minister ursula von der leyen rejected the accusation , saying that her party had only objected to the action plan in its current form .

it was the highest figure recorded since 2000 , when a noticeable increase in alcoholism among young people first brought the issue to the nation 's attention .
baetzing , a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said that the excessive consumption of alcohol by minors is a trend that is continuing .
in 2008 , more than 20 percent of minors reported being drunk at least once a month .
almost every tenth young person admits to drinking a dangerous volume of alcohol .
however , she stressed that the overall consumption of alcohol , tobacco and cannabis by minors had decreased .
for example , in 2001 , 28 percent of minors smoked cigarettes , while last year , that figure had dropped to 15.4 percent , baetzing said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : existing laws need to be better enforced , the government 's commissioner said she said that while her commission had reached some important goals , germany 's statistics on drug and alcohol abuse by young people are still " incredibly high " when compared with other countries .
according to baetzing , sufficient legislation is in place .
" what we 're lacking is enforcement , " she said .
drug-related deaths to rise , report says the commissioner said she was concerned about the increase in the number of drug-related deaths in germany .
figures released earlier in march revealed that 1449 people died from an overdose of drugs in 2008 - 4 percent more than was the case in 2007 .
baetzing also mentioned another form of addiction which she said was of particular concern : internet addiction .
up to 7 percent of internet users in germany are considered to be addicted to the medium , spending anywhere from 10 to 18 hours a day on chat forums or playing computer games .
when it comes to strategies to combat these various forms of addiction , however , it seems the ruling coalition still can not agree on a way forward .
asked about a stalled national action program against excessive alcohol and tobacco consumption , baetzing accused chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- of blocking progress so as not to hurt their chances in the upcoming general election .
family minister ursula von der leyen rejected the accusation , saying that her party had only objected to the action plan in its current form .
" significant parts of the action program presented today offer mere recommendations , " a spokesperson from von der leyen 's ministry said .
" qualitatively , it 's not enough for the federal government to form a national initiative . " dc / pfd , dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was the highest figure recorded since 2000 , when a noticeable increase in alcoholism among young people first brought the issue to the nation 's attention .
baetzing , a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said that the excessive consumption of alcohol by minors is a trend that is continuing .
in 2008 , more than 20 percent of minors reported being drunk at least once a month .
almost every tenth young person admits to drinking a dangerous volume of alcohol .
however , she stressed that the overall consumption of alcohol , tobacco and cannabis by minors had decreased .
for example , in 2001 , 28 percent of minors smoked cigarettes , while last year , that figure had dropped to 15.4 percent , baetzing said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : existing laws need to be better enforced , the government 's commissioner said she said that while her commission had reached some important goals , germany 's statistics on drug and alcohol abuse by young people are still " incredibly high " when compared with other countries .
according to baetzing , sufficient legislation is in place .
" what we 're lacking is enforcement , " she said .
drug-related deaths to rise , report says the commissioner said she was concerned about the increase in the number of drug-related deaths in germany .
figures released earlier in march revealed that 1449 people died from an overdose of drugs in 2008 - 4 percent more than was the case in 2007 .
baetzing also mentioned another form of addiction which she said was of particular concern : internet addiction .
up to 7 percent of internet users in germany are considered to be addicted to the medium , spending anywhere from 10 to 18 hours a day on chat forums or playing computer games .
when it comes to strategies to combat these various forms of addiction , however , it seems the ruling coalition still can not agree on a way forward .
asked about a stalled national action program against excessive alcohol and tobacco consumption , baetzing accused chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- of blocking progress so as not to hurt their chances in the upcoming general election .
family minister ursula von der leyen rejected the accusation , saying that her party had only objected to the action plan in its current form .
" significant parts of the action program presented today offer mere recommendations , " a spokesperson from von der leyen 's ministry said .
" qualitatively , it 's not enough for the federal government to form a national initiative . " dc / pfd , dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european union economies are now expected to contract by 4 percent in 2009 . some 8.5 million jobs will disappear in the eu this year and next , more than wiping out the new jobs created in recent years .
unemployment will reach 11.5 percent by the end of next year , the commission said .
skyrocketing unemployment will be accompanied by plunging exports through the end of 2010 , the commission predicts .
the eu said monday that euro zone exports are “ forecast to suffer one of the worst setbacks on record . ”
conditions have worsened in january , the eu had predicted modest growth of 0.5 percent for the bloc next year .
but that prediction has been scrapped as the bloc 's five biggest members turned in grim economic data .
the commission now forecasts that the eu economies will shrink another 0.1 percent in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's export economy is hard hit by the downturn germany , the eu 's economic motor , faces a contraction of 5.4 percent this year .
and axel weber , president of germany 's national bank , the bundesbank , warned monday that the country 's gdp is unlikely to rise before the second half of 2010 .
" from today 's perspective , i do n't expect positive growth rates before the second half of next year , " weber said at a tax advisory congress in hamburg .
stable financial markets are a pre-requisite for economic growth , weber said , adding " there , adjustment processes are still in full swing . "
european economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia also said he hoped that the eu 's economic outlook would begin to improve in 2010 .
actions taken by governments and central banks " are expected to put a floor under the fall in economic activity this year and enable a recovery next year , " almunia said .
however , the government stimulus plans come at a cost .
public debt is expected to grow to an average 7.5 percent of gross domestic product in the eu next year .
no escape for eastern europe the storm also looks set to engulf previously robust economies in central and eastern europe such as poland , slovakia , romania , bulgaria and the czech republic .
as recently as january , the eu newcomers were tipped to record substantial growth .
but according to the latest forecasts , all are set to go into recession this year as key markets in western europe and russia collapse .
slovakia , tipped in january to record growth of 2.7 percent this year , now faces a contraction of 2.6 percent .
romania , which was in january expected to record growth of 1.8 percent , now faces a 4-percent fall in economic output .

this comes after his decision to sack the army chief , rookmangud katawal , on sunday was opposed by president ram baran yadav , who belongs to the opposition nepali congress party , sparking a dangerous constitutional crisis . the current crisis is a clear sign of growing polarisation between the maoists , who emerged as the strongest single political party in elections a year ago , and other political forces in nepal .
even the maoists ’ main coalition partner , the centre-left united marxist-leninists -lrb- uml -rrb- , withdrew its support to the government over the sacking of the army chief , prompting prime minister prachanda to announce his resignation .
some observers blame the president , from the opposition nepali congress party , for the confusion .
“ the current constitution has made the post of the president a ceremonial one , not executive , ” explains k.b. rokaya , a human rights activist who supports the integration of the maoists into the political mainstream .
“ the prime minister has the executive power !
and so by intervening directly , and by bypassing the elected government , the president crossed the limits of his office … so there are two chiefs of army right now , this is a very serious thing that has happened . ”
ambiguity because of interim nature of constitution but others disagree .
nepal only has an interim constitution and the powers of the new office of president that replaced the monarch just under a year ago are not yet fully defined .
this tussle over who can sack the army chief took place in a grey area , explains political commentator yuvraj ghimire .
“ it ’ s a very vague thing constitutionally because the president is the supreme commander of the army who also appoints the army chief on the recommendation of the council of ministers . ”
“ but here the prime minister , who heads a coalition government on the understanding that any major decision will have to be taken in consensus , went against the assurance he had given to the president and other partners in the cabinet that he would not take a decision on sacking the army chief without their approval . ”
“ so there was a breach of faith and breach of assurance , and the political parties including those who were in the coalition government , approached the president to intervene in the matter . ”
army chief refused to accept civilian authority if , and how , 19,000 former maoist guerrilla fighters currently living in camps should be induced into the army has long been a major political controversy .
but a special committee that was appointed to resolve it has reportedly made substantial progress .
the army chief was sacked over a more fundamental issue , argues k. b. rokaya : because he refused to accept the authority of the civilian government .
“ the military went ahead with recruiting 3,000 new army personnel .
the government had asked the military to stop recruiting .
but the army went ahead and recruited .
and the defence minister and the military chief were not on good terms . ”
maoists are extremely suspicious ever since coming to power , the maoists have been extremely suspicious of any attempts to obstruct their government .
in his resignation speech , prime minister prachanda hinted at different domestic and foreign forces working against him .
santosh poudel , a journalist with the maoist party-affiliated newspaper “ janadisha daily ” , explains : “ colonial forces means american and indian forces .

it was the highest figure recorded since 2000 , when a noticeable increase in alcoholism among young people first brought the issue to the nation 's attention .
baetzing , a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said that the excessive consumption of alcohol by minors is a trend that is continuing .
in 2008 , more than 20 percent of minors reported being drunk at least once a month .
almost every tenth young person admits to drinking a dangerous volume of alcohol .
however , she stressed that the overall consumption of alcohol , tobacco and cannabis by minors had decreased .
for example , in 2001 , 28 percent of minors smoked cigarettes , while last year , that figure had dropped to 15.4 percent , baetzing said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : existing laws need to be better enforced , the government 's commissioner said she said that while her commission had reached some important goals , germany 's statistics on drug and alcohol abuse by young people are still " incredibly high " when compared with other countries .
according to baetzing , sufficient legislation is in place .
" what we 're lacking is enforcement , " she said .
drug-related deaths to rise , report says the commissioner said she was concerned about the increase in the number of drug-related deaths in germany .
figures released earlier in march revealed that 1449 people died from an overdose of drugs in 2008 - 4 percent more than was the case in 2007 .
baetzing also mentioned another form of addiction which she said was of particular concern : internet addiction .
up to 7 percent of internet users in germany are considered to be addicted to the medium , spending anywhere from 10 to 18 hours a day on chat forums or playing computer games .
when it comes to strategies to combat these various forms of addiction , however , it seems the ruling coalition still can not agree on a way forward .
asked about a stalled national action program against excessive alcohol and tobacco consumption , baetzing accused chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- of blocking progress so as not to hurt their chances in the upcoming general election .
family minister ursula von der leyen rejected the accusation , saying that her party had only objected to the action plan in its current form .
" significant parts of the action program presented today offer mere recommendations , " a spokesperson from von der leyen 's ministry said .

while it might make good daytime television , the newspaper says , it does not bode well for the german carmaker 's future .
vw and porsche have refused to comment on the discussions .
the two families met last week , but could n't reach an agreement .
they are reportedly scheduled to meet again on wednesday in salzburg , austria .
to sell , or not to sell while the porsche and piech families agree that something needs to be done to help their debt-ridden luxury brand , some family members are loathe to sell out to rival german carmaker volkswagen .
porsche will not be sold to vw , wolfgang porsche was quoted by german media as declaring over the weekend .
yet ferdinand piech , another heir to the porsche fortune , has reportedly proposed selling to volkswagen for 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- .
germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported that porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking is pushing for a middle ground solution .
instead of one company taking over the other , wiedeking reporteldy wants the two companies to merge , which would allow them to raise new capital .
porsche had eyed vw takeover porsche se , the luxury brand 's holding company , already owns 51 percent of vw , but analysts say that the 9 billion euros of debt it has accumulated to buy the shares is making it difficult for porsche to raise its target stake in vw to 75 percent .

yet they 're still buying cars . german retail sales dropped 3.2 percent in the first quarter of 2009 .
the slowdown is much sharper than analysts had forecasted .
sales of food , drinks and tobacco were down most significantly , according to the statistics office .
the only bright spot was in car sales , which were helped by a government program that gave out bonuses to people replacing aging vehicles with new cars .
" on the one hand , the scrapping premium gave a boost to car sales , ” alexander koch of the italian bank unicredit told afp news agency .
" on the other hand , retail sales in other categories exhibited increasing weakness , as the bias towards car sales crowded out other durable good purchases and the increasingly negative labor market outlook already weighs considerably on peoples ' willingness to spend . "
the sharp drop in retail sales increases the likelihood that the european central bank will cut its main interest rate to a record low of 1.0 percent on thursday .
the hope is that the rate cut will give the 16-nation euro zone 's economy a further boost .
experts predict slow recovery for germany meanwhile , one of germany 's leading private economic research institutes predicted that the recession in germany would bottom out this year .
however , the cologne-based institute for economic research -lrb- iw -rrb- also said that it did n't expect a fast turnaround .
iw researchers said they expected germany 's gdp to shrink by 4.5 percent in 2009 , and grow by a mere 0.5 percent in 2010 .
exports , which are expected to decrease by 17 percent this year , have been largely responsible for the decline in the german economy , the institute said .

otherwise , the government has threatened to expropriate shareholders to secure a controlling stake in the troubled moneylender .
as this share buyout deadline looms , the german handelsblatt newspaper reports that hre 's financial woes continue .
according to the german business paper , hre has lost roughly 500 million euros -lrb- $ 664 million -rrb- in the first quarter of 2009 , meaning that the struggling bank has not yet turned a corner despite three separate government bailouts .
hre is scheduled to post its first quarter results on tuesday .
berlin has already shored up hre with loan guarantees and cash injections totalling 102 billion euros , and now wants control of the bank .
the us private equity firm jc flowers & co , which owns an estimated 22 percent of hre , has rejected the government 's share offer , saying it is too low .
the group has threatened legal action if berlin tries to seize its shares .
germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck has described the offer , which is 10 percent above the legal minimum , as " very fair " , and has said that the government will expropriate shareholders if they refuse to sell .
the german government passed temporary legislation allowing it to seize private stocks in february , before providing a third set of financial aid to hre .
the government is thought to own almost 23 percent of hre , making it a slightly bigger stakeholder than jc flowers & co .
berlin 's stake in the bank is rising all the time as more and more small shareholders accept the 1.39 euro offer .
the remainder of hre stock is held in small quantites by assorted hedgefunds and private investors. msh / rm , reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

otherwise , the government has threatened to expropriate shareholders to secure a controlling stake in the troubled moneylender .
as this share buyout deadline looms , the german handelsblatt newspaper reports that hre 's financial woes continue .
according to the german business paper , hre has lost roughly 500 million euros -lrb- $ 664 million -rrb- in the first quarter of 2009 , meaning that the struggling bank has not yet turned a corner despite three separate government bailouts .
hre is scheduled to post its first quarter results on tuesday .
berlin has already shored up hre with loan guarantees and cash injections totalling 102 billion euros , and now wants control of the bank .
the us private equity firm jc flowers & co , which owns an estimated 22 percent of hre , has rejected the government 's share offer , saying it is too low .
the group has threatened legal action if berlin tries to seize its shares .
germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck has described the offer , which is 10 percent above the legal minimum , as " very fair " , and has said that the government will expropriate shareholders if they refuse to sell .
the german government passed temporary legislation allowing it to seize private stocks in february , before providing a third set of financial aid to hre .
the government is thought to own almost 23 percent of hre , making it a slightly bigger stakeholder than jc flowers & co .
berlin 's stake in the bank is rising all the time as more and more small shareholders accept the 1.39 euro offer .

his italian counterpart called for closer israeli-eu ties . having kicked off the four-day trip in rome , lieberman said that italy could play a " decisive role " in improving relations between israel and " moderate " arab states .
he made the remarks during a joint news conference with italian foreign minister franco frattini .
lieberman , who has a reputation as a hardliner , has in the past expressed doubts that the israeli-palestinian conflict can be resolved through the creation of two separate , sovereign states .
" israel is n't looking for slogans , but for concrete results , " lieberman said replying to a question on the " two-state solution " backed by the us and the european union .

while it might make good daytime television , the newspaper says , it does not bode well for the german carmaker 's future .
vw and porsche have refused to comment on the discussions .
the two families met last week , but could n't reach an agreement .
they are reportedly scheduled to meet again on wednesday in salzburg , austria .
to sell , or not to sell while the porsche and piech families agree that something needs to be done to help their debt-ridden luxury brand , some family members are loathe to sell out to rival german carmaker volkswagen .
porsche will not be sold to vw , wolfgang porsche was quoted by german media as declaring over the weekend .
yet ferdinand piech , another heir to the porsche fortune , has reportedly proposed selling to volkswagen for 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- .
germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported that porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking is pushing for a middle ground solution .
instead of one company taking over the other , wiedeking reporteldy wants the two companies to merge , which would allow them to raise new capital .
porsche had eyed vw takeover porsche se , the luxury brand 's holding company , already owns 51 percent of vw , but analysts say that the 9 billion euros of debt it has accumulated to buy the shares is making it difficult for porsche to raise its target stake in vw to 75 percent .

" but the who continues to warn that a pandemic is possible , " ban said monday in a joint teleconference with who director-general margaret chan from geneva .
" let us remember that even if the who does declare phase six - a pandemic - that would be a statement about the geographic spread of the virus , not its severity , " ban said , reflecting the growing consensus that the h1n1 virus could be a mild flu virus .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 04.05.2009 german citizenship applications continue to fall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of immigrants becoming naturalized germans has fallen steadily over the past decade .
a persistent fall in the number of immigrants becoming naturalized german citizens has seen politicians in berlin reignite the debate about cultural integration and citizenship tests . some 187,000 foreigners were naturalized as german citizens in 2000 .
by 2007 that number had dropped about 40 percent to just 113,000 .
official figures for 2008 have n't yet been published , but sevim dagdelen , a parliamentarian from germany 's left party , has done her own research and calculations .
she estimates the number of immigrants who chose to become german citizens last year fell by another 18 percent last year .
" the federal government keeps talking about germany as a land of integration , with a welcoming culture of naturalization , " dagdelen told deutsche welle .
" but it 's clearly untrue .
many foreigners are n't even applying for german citizenship because they 're worried they wo n't be accepted , because the hurdles are set too high . "
tough criteria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sevim dagdelen says citizenship tests are an obstacle to integration to be granted german citizenship , an immigrant must have lived in germany legally for at least eight years .
they have to prove they have an independent income , do n't require social welfare or unemployment benefits , and have a good grasp of the german language .
additional rules introduced in 2007 require applicants who have not graduated from a german school to pass a controversial " citizenship test " .
the examination costs 25 euros and consists of 33 multiple choice items selected from a catalog of 310 questions about german history , culture and the political system .
would-be germans must provide at least 17 correct answers to pass , otherwise they can try again and re-sit the examination at a later date .
the federal government says extremely low failure rates -lrb- around one percent -rrb- prove the test is a success .
but critics say the authorities have got it wrong .
the left-wing berlin state senate 's commissioner for integration , guenter piening , says many immigrants from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds are so worried by the test that they have n't dared to apply for german citizenship .
" these are the people we really want to include in our society , " piening told deutsche welle .
" the middle-class , educated immigrants who confidently decide they want to become german are n't a problem .
the people we really want to appeal to are the immigrants who 've until now have been unsure about naturalization , but do want to commit to our society .
and it 's precisely these people who are being put off by mixed signals . "
language barriers the government 's new language test is particularly unpopular among immigrants .
applicants ca n't get by on basic phrases communicating where they live and who they know .
they have to be able to describe their dreams and justify their opinions .
" we should make exceptions for older , first-generation immigrants , " piening said , adding that the current testing regime is especially challenging for people who never attended a german school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer says language tests promote social cohesion the federal government 's commissioner for integration , maria boehmer , however , is opposed to lowering standards even in the face of falling naturalization numbers .
" in hamburg i took part in a podium discussion .
there was an immigrant who 'd spent more than 30 years in germany .
he told me that without a good grasp of the german language , he would still be little more than a spectator on the edge of society ; " she told deutsche welle .
lies , damn lies , and statistics boehmer , a christian democrat , says the plunge in the number of foreigners taking up german citizenship needs to be carefully examined because a number of factors are at play .
one is a rule that came into force in 2000 .
it states that a child born to an immigrant parent who 's been living in germany for more than eight years is automatically granted german citizenship - so there 's no need for an application .

a persistent fall in the number of immigrants becoming naturalized german citizens has seen politicians in berlin reignite the debate about cultural integration and citizenship tests . some 187,000 foreigners were naturalized as german citizens in 2000 .
by 2007 that number had dropped about 40 percent to just 113,000 .
official figures for 2008 have n't yet been published , but sevim dagdelen , a parliamentarian from germany 's left party , has done her own research and calculations .
she estimates the number of immigrants who chose to become german citizens last year fell by another 18 percent last year .
" the federal government keeps talking about germany as a land of integration , with a welcoming culture of naturalization , " dagdelen told deutsche welle .
" but it 's clearly untrue .
many foreigners are n't even applying for german citizenship because they 're worried they wo n't be accepted , because the hurdles are set too high . "
tough criteria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sevim dagdelen says citizenship tests are an obstacle to integration to be granted german citizenship , an immigrant must have lived in germany legally for at least eight years .
they have to prove they have an independent income , do n't require social welfare or unemployment benefits , and have a good grasp of the german language .
additional rules introduced in 2007 require applicants who have not graduated from a german school to pass a controversial " citizenship test " .
the examination costs 25 euros and consists of 33 multiple choice items selected from a catalog of 310 questions about german history , culture and the political system .
would-be germans must provide at least 17 correct answers to pass , otherwise they can try again and re-sit the examination at a later date .
the federal government says extremely low failure rates -lrb- around one percent -rrb- prove the test is a success .
but critics say the authorities have got it wrong .
the left-wing berlin state senate 's commissioner for integration , guenter piening , says many immigrants from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds are so worried by the test that they have n't dared to apply for german citizenship .
" these are the people we really want to include in our society , " piening told deutsche welle .
" the middle-class , educated immigrants who confidently decide they want to become german are n't a problem .
the people we really want to appeal to are the immigrants who 've until now have been unsure about naturalization , but do want to commit to our society .
and it 's precisely these people who are being put off by mixed signals . "
language barriers the government 's new language test is particularly unpopular among immigrants .
applicants ca n't get by on basic phrases communicating where they live and who they know .
they have to be able to describe their dreams and justify their opinions .
" we should make exceptions for older , first-generation immigrants , " piening said , adding that the current testing regime is especially challenging for people who never attended a german school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer says language tests promote social cohesion the federal government 's commissioner for integration , maria boehmer , however , is opposed to lowering standards even in the face of falling naturalization numbers .
" in hamburg i took part in a podium discussion .
there was an immigrant who 'd spent more than 30 years in germany .
he told me that without a good grasp of the german language , he would still be little more than a spectator on the edge of society ; " she told deutsche welle .
lies , damn lies , and statistics boehmer , a christian democrat , says the plunge in the number of foreigners taking up german citizenship needs to be carefully examined because a number of factors are at play .
one is a rule that came into force in 2000 .
it states that a child born to an immigrant parent who 's been living in germany for more than eight years is automatically granted german citizenship - so there 's no need for an application .
however , critics point out that such children only remain german if they choose to give up their foreign nationality when they reach 18 years of age .
they say this forced decision puts youths with immigrant backgrounds under a lot of pressure . so far calls for germany to lift its general ban on dual citizenship have found little support among germany 's major political parties - and there 's little to suggest their position will change any time soon .

european union economies are now expected to contract by 4 percent in 2009 . some 8.5 million jobs will disappear in the eu this year and next , more than wiping out the new jobs created in recent years .
unemployment will reach 11.5 percent by the end of next year , the commission said .
skyrocketing unemployment will be accompanied by plunging exports through the end of 2010 , the commission predicts .
the eu said monday that euro zone exports are “ forecast to suffer one of the worst setbacks on record . ”
conditions have worsened in january , the eu had predicted modest growth of 0.5 percent for the bloc next year .
but that prediction has been scrapped as the bloc 's five biggest members turned in grim economic data .
the commission now forecasts that the eu economies will shrink another 0.1 percent in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's export economy is hard hit by the downturn germany , the eu 's economic motor , faces a contraction of 5.4 percent this year .
and axel weber , president of germany 's national bank , the bundesbank , warned monday that the country 's gdp is unlikely to rise before the second half of 2010 .
" from today 's perspective , i do n't expect positive growth rates before the second half of next year , " weber said at a tax advisory congress in hamburg .
stable financial markets are a pre-requisite for economic growth , weber said , adding " there , adjustment processes are still in full swing . "
european economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia also said he hoped that the eu 's economic outlook would begin to improve in 2010 .
actions taken by governments and central banks " are expected to put a floor under the fall in economic activity this year and enable a recovery next year , " almunia said .
however , the government stimulus plans come at a cost .
public debt is expected to grow to an average 7.5 percent of gross domestic product in the eu next year .
no escape for eastern europe the storm also looks set to engulf previously robust economies in central and eastern europe such as poland , slovakia , romania , bulgaria and the czech republic .
as recently as january , the eu newcomers were tipped to record substantial growth .
but according to the latest forecasts , all are set to go into recession this year as key markets in western europe and russia collapse .
slovakia , tipped in january to record growth of 2.7 percent this year , now faces a contraction of 2.6 percent .
romania , which was in january expected to record growth of 1.8 percent , now faces a 4-percent fall in economic output .
of all the eu 's 27 member states , only cyprus is set to record economic growth in 2009 , according to commission figures . th / rm / dc , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while it might make good daytime television , the newspaper says , it does not bode well for the german carmaker 's future .
vw and porsche have refused to comment on the discussions .
the two families met last week , but could n't reach an agreement .
they are reportedly scheduled to meet again on wednesday in salzburg , austria .
to sell , or not to sell while the porsche and piech families agree that something needs to be done to help their debt-ridden luxury brand , some family members are loathe to sell out to rival german carmaker volkswagen .
porsche will not be sold to vw , wolfgang porsche was quoted by german media as declaring over the weekend .
yet ferdinand piech , another heir to the porsche fortune , has reportedly proposed selling to volkswagen for 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- .
germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported that porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking is pushing for a middle ground solution .
instead of one company taking over the other , wiedeking reporteldy wants the two companies to merge , which would allow them to raise new capital .
porsche had eyed vw takeover porsche se , the luxury brand 's holding company , already owns 51 percent of vw , but analysts say that the 9 billion euros of debt it has accumulated to buy the shares is making it difficult for porsche to raise its target stake in vw to 75 percent .
late last week , volkswagen said it had n't reached any agreement with porsche regarding expanding cooperation between the two companies . th / rm , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 04.05.2009 german citizenship applications continue to fall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of immigrants becoming naturalized germans has fallen steadily over the past decade .
a persistent fall in the number of immigrants becoming naturalized german citizens has seen politicians in berlin reignite the debate about cultural integration and citizenship tests . some 187,000 foreigners were naturalized as german citizens in 2000 .
by 2007 that number had dropped about 40 percent to just 113,000 .
official figures for 2008 have n't yet been published , but sevim dagdelen , a parliamentarian from germany 's left party , has done her own research and calculations .
she estimates the number of immigrants who chose to become german citizens last year fell by another 18 percent last year .
" the federal government keeps talking about germany as a land of integration , with a welcoming culture of naturalization , " dagdelen told deutsche welle .
" but it 's clearly untrue .
many foreigners are n't even applying for german citizenship because they 're worried they wo n't be accepted , because the hurdles are set too high . "
tough criteria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sevim dagdelen says citizenship tests are an obstacle to integration to be granted german citizenship , an immigrant must have lived in germany legally for at least eight years .
they have to prove they have an independent income , do n't require social welfare or unemployment benefits , and have a good grasp of the german language .
additional rules introduced in 2007 require applicants who have not graduated from a german school to pass a controversial " citizenship test " .
the examination costs 25 euros and consists of 33 multiple choice items selected from a catalog of 310 questions about german history , culture and the political system .
would-be germans must provide at least 17 correct answers to pass , otherwise they can try again and re-sit the examination at a later date .
the federal government says extremely low failure rates -lrb- around one percent -rrb- prove the test is a success .
but critics say the authorities have got it wrong .
the left-wing berlin state senate 's commissioner for integration , guenter piening , says many immigrants from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds are so worried by the test that they have n't dared to apply for german citizenship .
" these are the people we really want to include in our society , " piening told deutsche welle .
" the middle-class , educated immigrants who confidently decide they want to become german are n't a problem .
the people we really want to appeal to are the immigrants who 've until now have been unsure about naturalization , but do want to commit to our society .
and it 's precisely these people who are being put off by mixed signals . "
language barriers the government 's new language test is particularly unpopular among immigrants .
applicants ca n't get by on basic phrases communicating where they live and who they know .
they have to be able to describe their dreams and justify their opinions .
" we should make exceptions for older , first-generation immigrants , " piening said , adding that the current testing regime is especially challenging for people who never attended a german school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer says language tests promote social cohesion the federal government 's commissioner for integration , maria boehmer , however , is opposed to lowering standards even in the face of falling naturalization numbers .
" in hamburg i took part in a podium discussion .
there was an immigrant who 'd spent more than 30 years in germany .
he told me that without a good grasp of the german language , he would still be little more than a spectator on the edge of society ; " she told deutsche welle .
lies , damn lies , and statistics boehmer , a christian democrat , says the plunge in the number of foreigners taking up german citizenship needs to be carefully examined because a number of factors are at play .
one is a rule that came into force in 2000 .
it states that a child born to an immigrant parent who 's been living in germany for more than eight years is automatically granted german citizenship - so there 's no need for an application .
however , critics point out that such children only remain german if they choose to give up their foreign nationality when they reach 18 years of age .
they say this forced decision puts youths with immigrant backgrounds under a lot of pressure . so far calls for germany to lift its general ban on dual citizenship have found little support among germany 's major political parties - and there 's little to suggest their position will change any time soon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 04.05.2009 german citizenship applications continue to fall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of immigrants becoming naturalized germans has fallen steadily over the past decade .
a persistent fall in the number of immigrants becoming naturalized german citizens has seen politicians in berlin reignite the debate about cultural integration and citizenship tests . some 187,000 foreigners were naturalized as german citizens in 2000 .
by 2007 that number had dropped about 40 percent to just 113,000 .
official figures for 2008 have n't yet been published , but sevim dagdelen , a parliamentarian from germany 's left party , has done her own research and calculations .
she estimates the number of immigrants who chose to become german citizens last year fell by another 18 percent last year .
" the federal government keeps talking about germany as a land of integration , with a welcoming culture of naturalization , " dagdelen told deutsche welle .
" but it 's clearly untrue .
many foreigners are n't even applying for german citizenship because they 're worried they wo n't be accepted , because the hurdles are set too high . "
tough criteria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sevim dagdelen says citizenship tests are an obstacle to integration to be granted german citizenship , an immigrant must have lived in germany legally for at least eight years .
they have to prove they have an independent income , do n't require social welfare or unemployment benefits , and have a good grasp of the german language .
additional rules introduced in 2007 require applicants who have not graduated from a german school to pass a controversial " citizenship test " .
the examination costs 25 euros and consists of 33 multiple choice items selected from a catalog of 310 questions about german history , culture and the political system .
would-be germans must provide at least 17 correct answers to pass , otherwise they can try again and re-sit the examination at a later date .
the federal government says extremely low failure rates -lrb- around one percent -rrb- prove the test is a success .
but critics say the authorities have got it wrong .
the left-wing berlin state senate 's commissioner for integration , guenter piening , says many immigrants from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds are so worried by the test that they have n't dared to apply for german citizenship .
" these are the people we really want to include in our society , " piening told deutsche welle .
" the middle-class , educated immigrants who confidently decide they want to become german are n't a problem .
the people we really want to appeal to are the immigrants who 've until now have been unsure about naturalization , but do want to commit to our society .
and it 's precisely these people who are being put off by mixed signals . "
language barriers the government 's new language test is particularly unpopular among immigrants .
applicants ca n't get by on basic phrases communicating where they live and who they know .
they have to be able to describe their dreams and justify their opinions .
" we should make exceptions for older , first-generation immigrants , " piening said , adding that the current testing regime is especially challenging for people who never attended a german school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer says language tests promote social cohesion the federal government 's commissioner for integration , maria boehmer , however , is opposed to lowering standards even in the face of falling naturalization numbers .
" in hamburg i took part in a podium discussion .
there was an immigrant who 'd spent more than 30 years in germany .
he told me that without a good grasp of the german language , he would still be little more than a spectator on the edge of society ; " she told deutsche welle .
lies , damn lies , and statistics boehmer , a christian democrat , says the plunge in the number of foreigners taking up german citizenship needs to be carefully examined because a number of factors are at play .
one is a rule that came into force in 2000 .
it states that a child born to an immigrant parent who 's been living in germany for more than eight years is automatically granted german citizenship - so there 's no need for an application .
however , critics point out that such children only remain german if they choose to give up their foreign nationality when they reach 18 years of age .
they say this forced decision puts youths with immigrant backgrounds under a lot of pressure . so far calls for germany to lift its general ban on dual citizenship have found little support among germany 's major political parties - and there 's little to suggest their position will change any time soon .

yet they 're still buying cars . german retail sales dropped 3.2 percent in the first quarter of 2009 .
the slowdown is much sharper than analysts had forecasted .
sales of food , drinks and tobacco were down most significantly , according to the statistics office .
the only bright spot was in car sales , which were helped by a government program that gave out bonuses to people replacing aging vehicles with new cars .
" on the one hand , the scrapping premium gave a boost to car sales , ” alexander koch of the italian bank unicredit told afp news agency .
" on the other hand , retail sales in other categories exhibited increasing weakness , as the bias towards car sales crowded out other durable good purchases and the increasingly negative labor market outlook already weighs considerably on peoples ' willingness to spend . "
the sharp drop in retail sales increases the likelihood that the european central bank will cut its main interest rate to a record low of 1.0 percent on thursday .
the hope is that the rate cut will give the 16-nation euro zone 's economy a further boost .
experts predict slow recovery for germany meanwhile , one of germany 's leading private economic research institutes predicted that the recession in germany would bottom out this year .
however , the cologne-based institute for economic research -lrb- iw -rrb- also said that it did n't expect a fast turnaround .
iw researchers said they expected germany 's gdp to shrink by 4.5 percent in 2009 , and grow by a mere 0.5 percent in 2010 .
exports , which are expected to decrease by 17 percent this year , have been largely responsible for the decline in the german economy , the institute said .
iw director michael huether also described a regional split in how the recession was impacting the country .
he said that western germany was suffering more from the downturn than eastern germany , as businesses in the east tended to be less international in their focus . th / rm / dc , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european union economies are now expected to contract by 4 percent in 2009 . some 8.5 million jobs will disappear in the eu this year and next , more than wiping out the new jobs created in recent years .
unemployment will reach 11.5 percent by the end of next year , the commission said .
skyrocketing unemployment will be accompanied by plunging exports through the end of 2010 , the commission predicts .
the eu said monday that euro zone exports are “ forecast to suffer one of the worst setbacks on record . ”
conditions have worsened in january , the eu had predicted modest growth of 0.5 percent for the bloc next year .
but that prediction has been scrapped as the bloc 's five biggest members turned in grim economic data .
the commission now forecasts that the eu economies will shrink another 0.1 percent in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's export economy is hard hit by the downturn germany , the eu 's economic motor , faces a contraction of 5.4 percent this year .
and axel weber , president of germany 's national bank , the bundesbank , warned monday that the country 's gdp is unlikely to rise before the second half of 2010 .
" from today 's perspective , i do n't expect positive growth rates before the second half of next year , " weber said at a tax advisory congress in hamburg .

the couple married in 1980 and have three children , all in their 20s .
lario , 52 , is berlusconi 's second wife .
last week , lario publicly voiced outrage over reports that berlusconi 's political party was lining up tv showgirls and starlets as european parliament candidates .

the opposition said it plans to use the divorce to try and turn public opinion against the conservative premier .
" let 's leave the hypocrisy behind and say it clearly : berlusconi 's divorce is a political issue and an opportunity , " said mario adinolfi , a member of the main opposition democratic party .
" the person who knows him best says ' he 's not right ' or ' he is cavorting with minors ' . "

this comes after his decision to sack the army chief , rookmangud katawal , on sunday was opposed by president ram baran yadav , who belongs to the opposition nepali congress party , sparking a dangerous constitutional crisis . the current crisis is a clear sign of growing polarisation between the maoists , who emerged as the strongest single political party in elections a year ago , and other political forces in nepal .
even the maoists ’ main coalition partner , the centre-left united marxist-leninists -lrb- uml -rrb- , withdrew its support to the government over the sacking of the army chief , prompting prime minister prachanda to announce his resignation .
some observers blame the president , from the opposition nepali congress party , for the confusion .
“ the current constitution has made the post of the president a ceremonial one , not executive , ” explains k.b. rokaya , a human rights activist who supports the integration of the maoists into the political mainstream .
“ the prime minister has the executive power !

neuraminidase enzymes help viruses pathogens enter cells . by evaluating these substances , researchers can determine where the virus came from , what known viruses it is related to and possible treatments for those affected as well as ways to prevent more people from being infected . there are 16 different known types of hemagglutinin and nine of neuraminidase enzymes , combinations of which scientists then use to name viruses , such as the current h1n1 swine flu or the h5n1 avian flu . sms / pfd , afp / reuters / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however he added that there would n't be a final decision on the issue .
in an interview with the german paper bild am sonntag , zu guttenberg said that any proposal had to ensure long-term security for opel plants across europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg maintains berlin has no preference of investor " we are not going to allow taxpayers be the ones to pay for a financial adventure , " he said .
" for me , state involvement in opel is not an option .
at most what would be offered , would be a time limited loan . "
marchionne will also meet with the head of opel 's works ' council , klaus franz .
according to a report in the spiegel magazine , franz expects that fiat 's plans include asking berlin for financial support .
he has previously described a fiat takeover as " industrial restructuring , paid for with german taxes " .

information published by spiegel this weekend has revealed steinmeier has put together a 14-point checklist , which outlines the specific criteria berlin expects a future investor to meet .
at the heart of the checklist are the requirements that the investor commit to ensuring all opel plants remain in operation and that jobs are secured in germany .
fiat boss sergio marchionne on sunday outlined his plans for a european car giant that would include gm 's german unit opel .
he told the financial times that fiat , chrysler and opel would form a new publicly traded company with revenues of about 80 billion euros and sales of more than six million vehicles a year .
marchionne said that combining opel and fiat would save one billion euros a year .
the financial times indicated such a merger could lead to up to 9,000 job cuts .
fiat 's plans to acquire general motors ' european operations and takeover of chrysler , would form one of the world 's biggest car and truck makers .

yet they 're still buying cars . german retail sales dropped 3.2 percent in the first quarter of 2009 .
the slowdown is much sharper than analysts had forecasted .
sales of food , drinks and tobacco were down most significantly , according to the statistics office .
the only bright spot was in car sales , which were helped by a government program that gave out bonuses to people replacing aging vehicles with new cars .
" on the one hand , the scrapping premium gave a boost to car sales , ” alexander koch of the italian bank unicredit told afp news agency .
" on the other hand , retail sales in other categories exhibited increasing weakness , as the bias towards car sales crowded out other durable good purchases and the increasingly negative labor market outlook already weighs considerably on peoples ' willingness to spend . "
the sharp drop in retail sales increases the likelihood that the european central bank will cut its main interest rate to a record low of 1.0 percent on thursday .
the hope is that the rate cut will give the 16-nation euro zone 's economy a further boost .
experts predict slow recovery for germany meanwhile , one of germany 's leading private economic research institutes predicted that the recession in germany would bottom out this year .
however , the cologne-based institute for economic research -lrb- iw -rrb- also said that it did n't expect a fast turnaround .
iw researchers said they expected germany 's gdp to shrink by 4.5 percent in 2009 , and grow by a mere 0.5 percent in 2010 .
exports , which are expected to decrease by 17 percent this year , have been largely responsible for the decline in the german economy , the institute said .
iw director michael huether also described a regional split in how the recession was impacting the country .
he said that western germany was suffering more from the downturn than eastern germany , as businesses in the east tended to be less international in their focus . th / rm / dc , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he made the remarks during a joint news conference with italian foreign minister franco frattini .
lieberman , who has a reputation as a hardliner , has in the past expressed doubts that the israeli-palestinian conflict can be resolved through the creation of two separate , sovereign states .
" israel is n't looking for slogans , but for concrete results , " lieberman said replying to a question on the " two-state solution " backed by the us and the european union .
he then listed concessions made by previous israeli governments that had yielded " no results , " including former prime minister ariel sharon 's decision to withdraw from the gaza strip .

frattini also said that relations between israel and the eu must be strengthened .
" the upgrading of ties between europe and israel must not stop because that way europe can play a major role " in the middle east peace process , he told a joint news conference with the ultra-nationalist lieberman . during his four-day european tour , lieberman is also scheduled to meet with officials in france , germany and the czech republic . relations between israel and the eu have been tense since european external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner warned last month that a planned upgrade of bilateral relations could not come about until the israeli government commits to peace talks with the palestinians . dc / pfd , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet they 're still buying cars . german retail sales dropped 3.2 percent in the first quarter of 2009 .
the slowdown is much sharper than analysts had forecasted .
sales of food , drinks and tobacco were down most significantly , according to the statistics office .
the only bright spot was in car sales , which were helped by a government program that gave out bonuses to people replacing aging vehicles with new cars .
" on the one hand , the scrapping premium gave a boost to car sales , ” alexander koch of the italian bank unicredit told afp news agency .
" on the other hand , retail sales in other categories exhibited increasing weakness , as the bias towards car sales crowded out other durable good purchases and the increasingly negative labor market outlook already weighs considerably on peoples ' willingness to spend . "
the sharp drop in retail sales increases the likelihood that the european central bank will cut its main interest rate to a record low of 1.0 percent on thursday .
the hope is that the rate cut will give the 16-nation euro zone 's economy a further boost .
experts predict slow recovery for germany meanwhile , one of germany 's leading private economic research institutes predicted that the recession in germany would bottom out this year .
however , the cologne-based institute for economic research -lrb- iw -rrb- also said that it did n't expect a fast turnaround .
iw researchers said they expected germany 's gdp to shrink by 4.5 percent in 2009 , and grow by a mere 0.5 percent in 2010 .
exports , which are expected to decrease by 17 percent this year , have been largely responsible for the decline in the german economy , the institute said .
iw director michael huether also described a regional split in how the recession was impacting the country .
he said that western germany was suffering more from the downturn than eastern germany , as businesses in the east tended to be less international in their focus . th / rm / dc , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet they 're still buying cars . german retail sales dropped 3.2 percent in the first quarter of 2009 .
the slowdown is much sharper than analysts had forecasted .
sales of food , drinks and tobacco were down most significantly , according to the statistics office .
the only bright spot was in car sales , which were helped by a government program that gave out bonuses to people replacing aging vehicles with new cars .
" on the one hand , the scrapping premium gave a boost to car sales , ” alexander koch of the italian bank unicredit told afp news agency .
" on the other hand , retail sales in other categories exhibited increasing weakness , as the bias towards car sales crowded out other durable good purchases and the increasingly negative labor market outlook already weighs considerably on peoples ' willingness to spend . "
the sharp drop in retail sales increases the likelihood that the european central bank will cut its main interest rate to a record low of 1.0 percent on thursday .
the hope is that the rate cut will give the 16-nation euro zone 's economy a further boost .
experts predict slow recovery for germany meanwhile , one of germany 's leading private economic research institutes predicted that the recession in germany would bottom out this year .
however , the cologne-based institute for economic research -lrb- iw -rrb- also said that it did n't expect a fast turnaround .
iw researchers said they expected germany 's gdp to shrink by 4.5 percent in 2009 , and grow by a mere 0.5 percent in 2010 .
exports , which are expected to decrease by 17 percent this year , have been largely responsible for the decline in the german economy , the institute said .
iw director michael huether also described a regional split in how the recession was impacting the country .
he said that western germany was suffering more from the downturn than eastern germany , as businesses in the east tended to be less international in their focus . th / rm / dc , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european union economies are now expected to contract by 4 percent in 2009 . some 8.5 million jobs will disappear in the eu this year and next , more than wiping out the new jobs created in recent years .
unemployment will reach 11.5 percent by the end of next year , the commission said .
skyrocketing unemployment will be accompanied by plunging exports through the end of 2010 , the commission predicts .
the eu said monday that euro zone exports are “ forecast to suffer one of the worst setbacks on record . ”
conditions have worsened in january , the eu had predicted modest growth of 0.5 percent for the bloc next year .
but that prediction has been scrapped as the bloc 's five biggest members turned in grim economic data .
the commission now forecasts that the eu economies will shrink another 0.1 percent in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's export economy is hard hit by the downturn germany , the eu 's economic motor , faces a contraction of 5.4 percent this year .
and axel weber , president of germany 's national bank , the bundesbank , warned monday that the country 's gdp is unlikely to rise before the second half of 2010 .

stable financial markets are a pre-requisite for economic growth , weber said , adding " there , adjustment processes are still in full swing . "
european economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia also said he hoped that the eu 's economic outlook would begin to improve in 2010 .
actions taken by governments and central banks " are expected to put a floor under the fall in economic activity this year and enable a recovery next year , " almunia said .
however , the government stimulus plans come at a cost .

a persistent fall in the number of immigrants becoming naturalized german citizens has seen politicians in berlin reignite the debate about cultural integration and citizenship tests . some 187,000 foreigners were naturalized as german citizens in 2000 .
by 2007 that number had dropped about 40 percent to just 113,000 .
official figures for 2008 have n't yet been published , but sevim dagdelen , a parliamentarian from germany 's left party , has done her own research and calculations .
she estimates the number of immigrants who chose to become german citizens last year fell by another 18 percent last year .
" the federal government keeps talking about germany as a land of integration , with a welcoming culture of naturalization , " dagdelen told deutsche welle .
" but it 's clearly untrue .
many foreigners are n't even applying for german citizenship because they 're worried they wo n't be accepted , because the hurdles are set too high . "
tough criteria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sevim dagdelen says citizenship tests are an obstacle to integration to be granted german citizenship , an immigrant must have lived in germany legally for at least eight years .
they have to prove they have an independent income , do n't require social welfare or unemployment benefits , and have a good grasp of the german language .
additional rules introduced in 2007 require applicants who have not graduated from a german school to pass a controversial " citizenship test " .
the examination costs 25 euros and consists of 33 multiple choice items selected from a catalog of 310 questions about german history , culture and the political system .
would-be germans must provide at least 17 correct answers to pass , otherwise they can try again and re-sit the examination at a later date .
the federal government says extremely low failure rates -lrb- around one percent -rrb- prove the test is a success .
but critics say the authorities have got it wrong .
the left-wing berlin state senate 's commissioner for integration , guenter piening , says many immigrants from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds are so worried by the test that they have n't dared to apply for german citizenship .
" these are the people we really want to include in our society , " piening told deutsche welle .
" the middle-class , educated immigrants who confidently decide they want to become german are n't a problem .
the people we really want to appeal to are the immigrants who 've until now have been unsure about naturalization , but do want to commit to our society .
and it 's precisely these people who are being put off by mixed signals . "
language barriers the government 's new language test is particularly unpopular among immigrants .
applicants ca n't get by on basic phrases communicating where they live and who they know .
they have to be able to describe their dreams and justify their opinions .
" we should make exceptions for older , first-generation immigrants , " piening said , adding that the current testing regime is especially challenging for people who never attended a german school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer says language tests promote social cohesion the federal government 's commissioner for integration , maria boehmer , however , is opposed to lowering standards even in the face of falling naturalization numbers .
" in hamburg i took part in a podium discussion .
there was an immigrant who 'd spent more than 30 years in germany .
he told me that without a good grasp of the german language , he would still be little more than a spectator on the edge of society ; " she told deutsche welle .
lies , damn lies , and statistics boehmer , a christian democrat , says the plunge in the number of foreigners taking up german citizenship needs to be carefully examined because a number of factors are at play .
one is a rule that came into force in 2000 .
it states that a child born to an immigrant parent who 's been living in germany for more than eight years is automatically granted german citizenship - so there 's no need for an application .
however , critics point out that such children only remain german if they choose to give up their foreign nationality when they reach 18 years of age .
they say this forced decision puts youths with immigrant backgrounds under a lot of pressure . so far calls for germany to lift its general ban on dual citizenship have found little support among germany 's major political parties - and there 's little to suggest their position will change any time soon .

but germany 's education minister says the changes will go ahead as planned - preferably sooner rather than later . german university students staged demonstrations across the country on thursday to protest recent reforms to the country 's degree system and tuition fees .
they also complain that colleges are underfunded and understaffed .
by 2010 , germany will follow the bachelor-master-doctorate format as part of the eu 's bologna reforms , aimed at synchronizing europe 's higher education standards .
but critics say the new system will be too intense , as the time to complete one 's degree will be shorter .
" the students are protesting against the workload that results from this more condensed course and fear that a bachelor 's degree will not be enough when entering the job market , " said susanne schilden , a spokeswoman for the german rectors conference , a group representing 265 of the country 's 300 universities . demonstrators , who occupied lecture halls in 20 german cities , including berlin , hamburg and munich , also said they want tuition fees to be scrapped .
police evicted around 200 protesters from a university lecture hall in tuebingen .
inspiration from austria since 2005 , german universities have been allowed to charge tuition fees , which now run between 100 to 500 euros -lrb- $ 150 to $ 750 -rrb- per semester . " no one can force an academic reform against the will of the students , " a statement from the munich students said .
" therefore we call for rights of co-determination for all decision-making processes that affect studies at the university . "
education minister annette schavan has called for germany 's 16 states to quickly implement the planned reforms .
" the students need a clear signal that the corrections that have been decided are being incorporated into the academic system , " schavan told broadcaster suedwestrundfunk .
the demonstrations began on wednesday .
they were inspired by student protests in austria that have been underway for the past three weeks .
there , too , the students are protesting against the bologna reforms as well as plans to introduce tuition fees and to limit admissions to certain courses of study. vj / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

prime minister kevin rudd said the delay was necessary because of the poor economic climate .
but he also suggested that australia could pursue tougher emissions reductions targets if an international deal was reached .
the ets , which has been criticised by both industrial and environment groups , was due to launch in july 2010 .
business say the scheme will delay economic recovery and lead to job losses .
the environmental lobby , meanwhile , says that the targets are not tough enough .
australia has the highest per capita emissions in the developed world and coal is its biggest export .
' appropriate response ' in a speech in canberra , mr rudd said that the carbon trading scheme - requiring industrial polluters to buy licences to emit carbon - would be pushed back until july 2011 .
" the worst global recession since the great depression means we must adapt our climate change measures but not abandon them , " he said .
a one-year fixed price period would be introduced for the first year , he said , with carbon permits costing a $ 10 -lrb- $ 7 , £ 5 -rrb- per tonne , followed by a floating price until july 2013 .
" this , we believe represents an appropriate response to current uncertainty , " he said .
but - in a move aimed at the environment lobby - mr rudd said that the range of the emissions reduction target could be increased up to 25 % of 2000 levels if other nations agreed similar targets .
the previous target was to reduce emissions by between 5 and 15 % of 2000 levels by 2020 .
mr rudd needs the support of greens senators to pass the carbon trading legislation .
he admitted that he had been under pressure from industry and the resources sector to delay the scheme , reports the bbc 's nick bryant , in sydney .
he also conceded that there had been international pressure on australia to make deeper cuts in emissions .
the policy changes reflect the difficulties of reconciling the needs of the domestic economy against global expectations , our correspondent says .

but he also suggested that australia could pursue tougher emissions reductions targets if an international deal was reached .
the ets , which has been criticised by both industrial and environment groups , was due to launch in july 2010 .
business say the scheme will delay economic recovery and lead to job losses .
the environmental lobby , meanwhile , says that the targets are not tough enough .
australia has the highest per capita emissions in the developed world and coal is its biggest export .
' appropriate response ' in a speech in canberra , mr rudd said that the carbon trading scheme - requiring industrial polluters to buy licences to emit carbon - would be pushed back until july 2011 .
" the worst global recession since the great depression means we must adapt our climate change measures but not abandon them , " he said .
a one-year fixed price period would be introduced for the first year , he said , with carbon permits costing a $ 10 -lrb- $ 7 , £ 5 -rrb- per tonne , followed by a floating price until july 2013 .
" this , we believe represents an appropriate response to current uncertainty , " he said .
but - in a move aimed at the environment lobby - mr rudd said that the range of the emissions reduction target could be increased up to 25 % of 2000 levels if other nations agreed similar targets .
the previous target was to reduce emissions by between 5 and 15 % of 2000 levels by 2020 .
mr rudd needs the support of greens senators to pass the carbon trading legislation .
he admitted that he had been under pressure from industry and the resources sector to delay the scheme , reports the bbc 's nick bryant , in sydney .
he also conceded that there had been international pressure on australia to make deeper cuts in emissions .
the policy changes reflect the difficulties of reconciling the needs of the domestic economy against global expectations , our correspondent says .

but one of its less celebrated achievements was to boast the longest-standing advert on a stadium roof in the football league .
the captain morgan rum advert became a well-loved feature of the ground after adorning the bob bank roof for more than 40 years .
any cardiff city supporter over a certain age will recall with affection the words : " captain morgan rum - the right rum for today 's taste " . "
it was a bit like the bob bank toilets - it was one of those features that you associate with ninian park ! "
vince alm , cardiff city supporters ' club the rum brand certainly had value for money because the advert , which took up to two weeks to paint , proudly overlooked famous events such as cardiff city 's victory over real madrid in 1971 and the late pope john paul ii 's visit in 1982 .
it was finally painted over before the 2001-02 season with an advert for the discount retailer hyper value .
cardiff city historian richard shepherd said : " the roof -lsb- of the bob bank -rsb- was built in the summer of 1958 and was left blank until the summer of 1960 when the advert went on .
" i do n't know whether captain morgan rum paid for the advert for 42 years !
i think its time ran out but the club did n't get rid of it .
" it was the longest-serving advert on a stand roof in the football league . "
mr shepherd recalls its appearance changed somewhat over the years as the cardiff weather took its toll on the paintwork .
" the chemicals in the paint made the paint change colour over the years .
i think it started as maroon , " he said .
the rum also had a direct link with the city itself because it was named after sir henry morgan , a 17th century adventurer who was thought to be born in a village which is now a suburb of cardiff - llanrumney .
sometimes called a pirate , he made his name in the caribbean trying to secure trade routes to the new world .
vince alm , of cardiff city supporters ' club , remembers the old advert with affection .
" it was part of the structure , it was part of ninian park .
when i was a kid , whenever i saw a bottle of rum , i thought of ninian park , " he said .
" i think quite a few of us were quite sad when it disappeared .
" it was a bit like the bob bank toilets - it was one of those features that you associate with ninian park ! "
stan mills , 77 , from cardiff , is a commercial artist who helped paint roof adverts on ninian park 's stands .
sweeping brush " you would chalk the outline of the letters or , if you were working with a light colour , you would use charcoal , " he said .
" when you 're doing sign work , you would use a red sable brush -lsb- to apply the paint -rsb- but they only go up to an inch wide so on a stand we would use a sweeping brush .
" you would get run off so then you would come out with your two-inch brush to get rid of the run . "
mr mills , who still occasionally works as an artist , said the team would paint the roof of the stand without any form of safety harness .
" there would be a scaffold going up giving you a platform along the bottom , but there would be nothing on the roof itself , " he said .
" in the modern day , you would have something attached to you in case you fell but we had nothing of that nature . "
ninian park hosted its final cardiff city game against ipswich last month .

ricardo martinelli had 61 % , while the ruling party 's balbina herrera was on 37 % , with most of the votes counted .
correspondents say voters seemed to warm to mr martinelli 's message that he was the right man to steer panama through the global economic crisis .
he will also oversee a $ 5bn -lrb- £ 3.3bn -rrb- expansion of the panama canal .
" the tribunal considers you the undisputed winner of this presidential contest , " the head of the electoral tribunal told mr martinelli in a telephone call broadcast live on television and radio .
mr martinelli , the candidate of a right-wing alliance led by his democratic change -lrb- cd -rrb- party , said he would work for a national unity government because that was what the country was calling for .
ricardo martinelli born 11 march 1952 business degree from university of arkansas owns super 99 - panama 's biggest supermarket chain other businesses include : banking , agricultural , media 1994 - 1996 : head of social security 1999 - 2003 : chairman of panama canal authority board , minister for canal affairs " tomorrow we will all be panamanians and we will change this country so that it has a good health system , good education , good transportation and good security , " he said in his victory speech .
" we ca n't continue to have a country where 40 % of panamanians are poor . "
panama has enjoyed buoyant economic growth in recent years , averaging some 8.5 % , but this is forecast to slow considerably this year as the global downturn affects the crucial trade link of the panama canal .
panama receives a little under one-third of its tax revenues from the canal , but through traffic has been declining significantly .
mr martinelli , who is set to take office on 1 july , will also oversee the expansion of the canal approved and set in motion by the current president martin torrijos .
the expansion programme , scheduled to be competed in 2014 , aims to increase the canal 's capacity , making it big enough for supertankers and the largest container ships .
honeymoon five years ago when mr martinelli stood for president he only gained around 5 % of the vote .

ricardo martinelli had 61 % , while the ruling party 's balbina herrera was on 37 % , with most of the votes counted .
correspondents say voters seemed to warm to mr martinelli 's message that he was the right man to steer panama through the global economic crisis .
he will also oversee a $ 5bn -lrb- £ 3.3bn -rrb- expansion of the panama canal .
" the tribunal considers you the undisputed winner of this presidential contest , " the head of the electoral tribunal told mr martinelli in a telephone call broadcast live on television and radio .
mr martinelli , the candidate of a right-wing alliance led by his democratic change -lrb- cd -rrb- party , said he would work for a national unity government because that was what the country was calling for .
ricardo martinelli born 11 march 1952 business degree from university of arkansas owns super 99 - panama 's biggest supermarket chain other businesses include : banking , agricultural , media 1994 - 1996 : head of social security 1999 - 2003 : chairman of panama canal authority board , minister for canal affairs " tomorrow we will all be panamanians and we will change this country so that it has a good health system , good education , good transportation and good security , " he said in his victory speech .
" we ca n't continue to have a country where 40 % of panamanians are poor . "
panama has enjoyed buoyant economic growth in recent years , averaging some 8.5 % , but this is forecast to slow considerably this year as the global downturn affects the crucial trade link of the panama canal .
panama receives a little under one-third of its tax revenues from the canal , but through traffic has been declining significantly .
mr martinelli , who is set to take office on 1 july , will also oversee the expansion of the canal approved and set in motion by the current president martin torrijos .
the expansion programme , scheduled to be competed in 2014 , aims to increase the canal 's capacity , making it big enough for supertankers and the largest container ships .
honeymoon five years ago when mr martinelli stood for president he only gained around 5 % of the vote .

spelthorne council said the budgeting amount under dispute was £ 1.6m , and the cost of sending out new bills " did not make sense " .
surrey police authority -lrb- spa -rrb- is appealing against a government decision to cap its budget for a second year .
the government has said the move is to prevent excessive council tax rises .
a statement issued by spelthorne council said : " spelthorne borough council does not believe it makes sense to require surrey police to spend £ 1.2 million to send out new council tax bills which will , on average , result in a decrease of just £ 3.24 .
" the total cost of capping and rebilling equates to the funding of nearly 70 police offers and the council believes the money would be best spent on front-line policing . "
' tightening belts ' surrey police authority was allowed to keep its £ 191.5m budget for 2008/09 , but was restricted to £ 189.6m for 2009/10 .
the government said the move was to prevent excessive increases in council tax , which is shared between council , police and fire services .
when local government minister john healey revealed the level of council tax rises across england , he said : " most councils across the country are tightening their belts , which is exactly what the public wants to see . "
he said the government planned to cap the council tax increases set by two police authorities - derbyshire and surrey .
surrey police chief constable mark rowley said it would be hard to avoid front-line cuts if capping was imposed .
