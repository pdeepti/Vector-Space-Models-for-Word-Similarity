austrian frank strohsack arrived in canada in 1954 with nothing but a few dollars in his pockets .
he changed his name to stronach , rented a small garage and began building tools .
today , stronach 's company , magna international , is the world 's third biggest car parts manufacturer with around 75,000 employees in 25 countries across the globe .
before magna popped up in the headlines as a potential buyer of the german car maker and gm subsidy opel , few in europe would have heard of the company .
but magna has in fact been a big player for quite some time - it 's just that the logo and the name rarely appear on the products they make .
magna international supplies parts for the interiors , engines and designs for a wide range of car makers .

the company developed a prototype of an electric car that raised eyebrows at the geneva motor show earlier this year .
magna 's cutting-edge technology may help it succeed in running opel , according to german auto expert ferdinand dudenhoefer .

" the electric model of the ford focus is developed and built by magna .
that 's where the difference is between magna and fiat .
fiat has neither the hybrid technology nor any concepts for electric cars , " he said .
but magna has not been spared by the global recession .
a production site in the us has already been closed and thousands of employees in austria are working reduced hour weeks and have seen their salaries cut .

crucial to the deal is backing from russia 's state-controlled sberbank .
the ownership structure of the new company could , according to magna officials , look like this : the canadian company could get 20 percent , sberbank 35 percent , 35 percent would go to gm and 10 percent could stay in the hands of opel staff or opel car dealers . russian carmaker gaz will serve as an industrial partner for opel .
its assembly lines in nizhny novgorod will soon produce opel cars that are " made in russia . "

the german team was missing 17 regulars from their squad . hao junmin opened the scoring for the hosts in the fifth minute , with germany responding two minutes later through lukas podolski .

the outcome was nevertheless a disappointment for the visitors , who are ranked second in the world , 95 positions above a perennially underperforming china playing its first match under coach gao hongbo .

enke had to save from zhao xuri in the 24th and gao threatened with a header in the 37th .
the second half passed in similar fashion with huth blocking jiang ning at the last instance in the 58th and jiang denied by enke later in the game .
germany 's only notable chance after the break came from hitzlsperger 's free-kick which was tipped over the bar by yang zhi .

the win makes up for a disappointing league season for bremen and defeat in the uefa cup final . mesut oezil fired in the winner for bremen in the 58th minute to deliver the club its sixth german cup and first major trophy since 2004 when they won the league and cup double .
bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego received the ball around 10 meters out from the goal box and made his way through three leverkusen defenders with a turn of pace and nifty footwork .
from there he delivered to oezil who burst into the box unmarked left of goal .
oezil struck a solid left foot shot from a tight angle which took a slight but devilish deflection off a lunging manual friedrich before deceiving keeper rene adler and finding the back of the net .
bremen had missed diego 's creativity in last week 's uefa cup final against ukrainian side shakhtar donetsk in istanbul when the midfielder was suspended , and although the playmaker could not always shine on the berlin stage , his moment came when he set up bremen 's winner .
bremen were dominant throughout with diego seeing out his contract with bremen in style .
the 24-year-old has signed a five-year deal worth 24.5 million euros to move to juventus turin next season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf 's men outplayed their opponents thomas schaaf 's men were full value for their victory before a capacity 74,244 crowd in the berlin olympic stadium , and but for young leverkusen goalie rene adler could have taken the lead earlier .
the germany keeper had to save early from sebastian proedl , whose header from a free-kick looked to be from an offside position , and then did well before half-time to tip a naldo header over the bar .
leverkusen missed a chance to pull even with four minutes of regulation time remaining , when germany striker stefan kiessling fired wide .
the victory hands bremen the last remaining spot in the new europa league , the reworked uefa cup of old. dfm / dpa / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the win makes up for a disappointing league season for bremen and defeat in the uefa cup final . mesut oezil fired in the winner for bremen in the 58th minute to deliver the club its sixth german cup and first major trophy since 2004 when they won the league and cup double .
bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego received the ball around 10 meters out from the goal box and made his way through three leverkusen defenders with a turn of pace and nifty footwork .

"
berlin and washington seem to have passed it - but with moscow seizing a lead role in the takeover . following the announcement of the deal between opel and canadian-austrian car parts maker magna , merkel said she had spoken with us president barack obama on friday and that they had agreed to do " everything they could to find a positive solution to a complex situation . " with magna pledging to keep all four german opel factories open , it appears that merkel has found the positive solution she was looking for - although some may find it almost as complex as the problem it tries to solve .
the agreement includes a 1.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 2.1-billion -rrb- bridge loan from the german government aimed at preventing opel itself from going bust before magna can make its financing available . magna 's bid , meanwhile , is to be bankrolled by russia 's state-owned russian sberbank , which will consequently gain a 35-percent stake in opel .
and berlin will provide 4.5 billion euros in loan guarantees for magna and sberbank .
all of this is meant to help opel gain autonomy from its beleaguered parent company gm . breaking new ground with new money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money talks in an election year the investment of so much russian capital - magna plans to put in 700 million euros - into a german company is an unprecedented move .
according to hans-henning schroeder of the german institute for international and security affairs , the financial deal can be attributed to an upcoming general election in germany this fall . " opel is certainly a strategic enterprise , but it is only one of four german automakers and is neither the biggest nor the most important , " schroeder said .
" the most important thing as elections approach is the jobs , and if sberbank is ready to inject the money , one is inclined to accept . " it has not , however , always been so .
as a matter of fact , germany has something of a reputation for being suspicious of foreign investors .
since 2008 , the government has even had the power to veto the purchase of stakes in german companies of 25 percent or higher if the funds are linked to foreign governments . strictly business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's gaz cars need a helping hand themsevles but andrew wilson of the european council of foreign relations says the situation is a fundamentally different one when jobs are dangling in the balance so close to national elections .
" money does n't smell at election time , " he said . and the deal is not strictly an act of benevolence on the part of sberbank either . moscow is keen to protect russian car manufacturers from foreign competition and already has plans for a tie-in between opel and its ailing domestic carmaker , gaz . tkw / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

austrian frank strohsack arrived in canada in 1954 with nothing but a few dollars in his pockets .
he changed his name to stronach , rented a small garage and began building tools .
today , stronach 's company , magna international , is the world 's third biggest car parts manufacturer with around 75,000 employees in 25 countries across the globe .
before magna popped up in the headlines as a potential buyer of the german car maker and gm subsidy opel , few in europe would have heard of the company .
but magna has in fact been a big player for quite some time - it 's just that the logo and the name rarely appear on the products they make .
magna international supplies parts for the interiors , engines and designs for a wide range of car makers .
and , at its austrian production sites , magna assembles specific vehicles under contract for bmw , mercedes and aston martin .
innovative technologies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german media has called stronach " the schwarzenegger of the auto industry " when it comes to innovative technologies , magna also seems well prepared for the future .
the company developed a prototype of an electric car that raised eyebrows at the geneva motor show earlier this year .
magna 's cutting-edge technology may help it succeed in running opel , according to german auto expert ferdinand dudenhoefer .
" they are highly competent when it comes to manufacturing cars - much more than fiat who are mostly producing at old sites in italy , " dudenhoefer said .
" the electric model of the ford focus is developed and built by magna .
that 's where the difference is between magna and fiat .
fiat has neither the hybrid technology nor any concepts for electric cars , " he said .
but magna has not been spared by the global recession .
a production site in the us has already been closed and thousands of employees in austria are working reduced hour weeks and have seen their salaries cut .
russian backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's sberbank will foot the bill for magna 's plans taking opel off the hands of the troubled us giant is likely to push magna to its limits , but german politicians seem confident that in the end magna will be able to shoulder the task .
crucial to the deal is backing from russia 's state-controlled sberbank .
the ownership structure of the new company could , according to magna officials , look like this : the canadian company could get 20 percent , sberbank 35 percent , 35 percent would go to gm and 10 percent could stay in the hands of opel staff or opel car dealers . russian carmaker gaz will serve as an industrial partner for opel .
its assembly lines in nizhny novgorod will soon produce opel cars that are " made in russia . "
although the russian economy has also been hard hit by the global recession , many see the market as potentially lucrative once the crisis is over .

the win makes up for a disappointing league season for bremen and defeat in the uefa cup final . mesut oezil fired in the winner for bremen in the 58th minute to deliver the club its sixth german cup and first major trophy since 2004 when they won the league and cup double .
bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego received the ball around 10 meters out from the goal box and made his way through three leverkusen defenders with a turn of pace and nifty footwork .
from there he delivered to oezil who burst into the box unmarked left of goal .
oezil struck a solid left foot shot from a tight angle which took a slight but devilish deflection off a lunging manual friedrich before deceiving keeper rene adler and finding the back of the net .
bremen had missed diego 's creativity in last week 's uefa cup final against ukrainian side shakhtar donetsk in istanbul when the midfielder was suspended , and although the playmaker could not always shine on the berlin stage , his moment came when he set up bremen 's winner .
bremen were dominant throughout with diego seeing out his contract with bremen in style .
the 24-year-old has signed a five-year deal worth 24.5 million euros to move to juventus turin next season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf 's men outplayed their opponents thomas schaaf 's men were full value for their victory before a capacity 74,244 crowd in the berlin olympic stadium , and but for young leverkusen goalie rene adler could have taken the lead earlier .
the germany keeper had to save early from sebastian proedl , whose header from a free-kick looked to be from an offside position , and then did well before half-time to tip a naldo header over the bar .
leverkusen missed a chance to pull even with four minutes of regulation time remaining , when germany striker stefan kiessling fired wide .
the victory hands bremen the last remaining spot in the new europa league , the reworked uefa cup of old. dfm / dpa / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the agreement includes a 1.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 2.1-billion -rrb- bridge loan from the german government aimed at preventing opel itself from going bust before magna can make its financing available . magna 's bid , meanwhile , is to be bankrolled by russia 's state-owned russian sberbank , which will consequently gain a 35-percent stake in opel .

the win makes up for a disappointing league season for bremen and defeat in the uefa cup final . mesut oezil fired in the winner for bremen in the 58th minute to deliver the club its sixth german cup and first major trophy since 2004 when they won the league and cup double .
bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego received the ball around 10 meters out from the goal box and made his way through three leverkusen defenders with a turn of pace and nifty footwork .
from there he delivered to oezil who burst into the box unmarked left of goal .
oezil struck a solid left foot shot from a tight angle which took a slight but devilish deflection off a lunging manual friedrich before deceiving keeper rene adler and finding the back of the net .
bremen had missed diego 's creativity in last week 's uefa cup final against ukrainian side shakhtar donetsk in istanbul when the midfielder was suspended , and although the playmaker could not always shine on the berlin stage , his moment came when he set up bremen 's winner .
bremen were dominant throughout with diego seeing out his contract with bremen in style .
the 24-year-old has signed a five-year deal worth 24.5 million euros to move to juventus turin next season .

the win makes up for a disappointing league season for bremen and defeat in the uefa cup final . mesut oezil fired in the winner for bremen in the 58th minute to deliver the club its sixth german cup and first major trophy since 2004 when they won the league and cup double .
bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego received the ball around 10 meters out from the goal box and made his way through three leverkusen defenders with a turn of pace and nifty footwork .
from there he delivered to oezil who burst into the box unmarked left of goal .
oezil struck a solid left foot shot from a tight angle which took a slight but devilish deflection off a lunging manual friedrich before deceiving keeper rene adler and finding the back of the net .
bremen had missed diego 's creativity in last week 's uefa cup final against ukrainian side shakhtar donetsk in istanbul when the midfielder was suspended , and although the playmaker could not always shine on the berlin stage , his moment came when he set up bremen 's winner .
bremen were dominant throughout with diego seeing out his contract with bremen in style .
the 24-year-old has signed a five-year deal worth 24.5 million euros to move to juventus turin next season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf 's men outplayed their opponents thomas schaaf 's men were full value for their victory before a capacity 74,244 crowd in the berlin olympic stadium , and but for young leverkusen goalie rene adler could have taken the lead earlier .
the germany keeper had to save early from sebastian proedl , whose header from a free-kick looked to be from an offside position , and then did well before half-time to tip a naldo header over the bar .
leverkusen missed a chance to pull even with four minutes of regulation time remaining , when germany striker stefan kiessling fired wide .

austrian frank strohsack arrived in canada in 1954 with nothing but a few dollars in his pockets .
he changed his name to stronach , rented a small garage and began building tools .
today , stronach 's company , magna international , is the world 's third biggest car parts manufacturer with around 75,000 employees in 25 countries across the globe .
before magna popped up in the headlines as a potential buyer of the german car maker and gm subsidy opel , few in europe would have heard of the company .
but magna has in fact been a big player for quite some time - it 's just that the logo and the name rarely appear on the products they make .
magna international supplies parts for the interiors , engines and designs for a wide range of car makers .

the company developed a prototype of an electric car that raised eyebrows at the geneva motor show earlier this year .
magna 's cutting-edge technology may help it succeed in running opel , according to german auto expert ferdinand dudenhoefer .

" the electric model of the ford focus is developed and built by magna .

fiat has neither the hybrid technology nor any concepts for electric cars , " he said .

crucial to the deal is backing from russia 's state-controlled sberbank .
the ownership structure of the new company could , according to magna officials , look like this : the canadian company could get 20 percent , sberbank 35 percent , 35 percent would go to gm and 10 percent could stay in the hands of opel staff or opel car dealers . russian carmaker gaz will serve as an industrial partner for opel .
its assembly lines in nizhny novgorod will soon produce opel cars that are " made in russia . "

but magna has in fact been a big player for quite some time - it 's just that the logo and the name rarely appear on the products they make .
magna international supplies parts for the interiors , engines and designs for a wide range of car makers .
and , at its austrian production sites , magna assembles specific vehicles under contract for bmw , mercedes and aston martin .
innovative technologies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german media has called stronach " the schwarzenegger of the auto industry " when it comes to innovative technologies , magna also seems well prepared for the future .
the company developed a prototype of an electric car that raised eyebrows at the geneva motor show earlier this year .
magna 's cutting-edge technology may help it succeed in running opel , according to german auto expert ferdinand dudenhoefer .
" they are highly competent when it comes to manufacturing cars - much more than fiat who are mostly producing at old sites in italy , " dudenhoefer said .
" the electric model of the ford focus is developed and built by magna .
that 's where the difference is between magna and fiat .
fiat has neither the hybrid technology nor any concepts for electric cars , " he said .
but magna has not been spared by the global recession .
a production site in the us has already been closed and thousands of employees in austria are working reduced hour weeks and have seen their salaries cut .
russian backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's sberbank will foot the bill for magna 's plans taking opel off the hands of the troubled us giant is likely to push magna to its limits , but german politicians seem confident that in the end magna will be able to shoulder the task .
crucial to the deal is backing from russia 's state-controlled sberbank .
the ownership structure of the new company could , according to magna officials , look like this : the canadian company could get 20 percent , sberbank 35 percent , 35 percent would go to gm and 10 percent could stay in the hands of opel staff or opel car dealers . russian carmaker gaz will serve as an industrial partner for opel .
its assembly lines in nizhny novgorod will soon produce opel cars that are " made in russia . "
although the russian economy has also been hard hit by the global recession , many see the market as potentially lucrative once the crisis is over .

austrian frank strohsack arrived in canada in 1954 with nothing but a few dollars in his pockets .
he changed his name to stronach , rented a small garage and began building tools .
today , stronach 's company , magna international , is the world 's third biggest car parts manufacturer with around 75,000 employees in 25 countries across the globe .
before magna popped up in the headlines as a potential buyer of the german car maker and gm subsidy opel , few in europe would have heard of the company .
but magna has in fact been a big player for quite some time - it 's just that the logo and the name rarely appear on the products they make .
magna international supplies parts for the interiors , engines and designs for a wide range of car makers .
and , at its austrian production sites , magna assembles specific vehicles under contract for bmw , mercedes and aston martin .
innovative technologies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german media has called stronach " the schwarzenegger of the auto industry " when it comes to innovative technologies , magna also seems well prepared for the future .
the company developed a prototype of an electric car that raised eyebrows at the geneva motor show earlier this year .
magna 's cutting-edge technology may help it succeed in running opel , according to german auto expert ferdinand dudenhoefer .
" they are highly competent when it comes to manufacturing cars - much more than fiat who are mostly producing at old sites in italy , " dudenhoefer said .
" the electric model of the ford focus is developed and built by magna .
that 's where the difference is between magna and fiat .
fiat has neither the hybrid technology nor any concepts for electric cars , " he said .
but magna has not been spared by the global recession .
a production site in the us has already been closed and thousands of employees in austria are working reduced hour weeks and have seen their salaries cut .
russian backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's sberbank will foot the bill for magna 's plans taking opel off the hands of the troubled us giant is likely to push magna to its limits , but german politicians seem confident that in the end magna will be able to shoulder the task .
crucial to the deal is backing from russia 's state-controlled sberbank .
the ownership structure of the new company could , according to magna officials , look like this : the canadian company could get 20 percent , sberbank 35 percent , 35 percent would go to gm and 10 percent could stay in the hands of opel staff or opel car dealers . russian carmaker gaz will serve as an industrial partner for opel .
its assembly lines in nizhny novgorod will soon produce opel cars that are " made in russia . "
although the russian economy has also been hard hit by the global recession , many see the market as potentially lucrative once the crisis is over .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 30.05.2009 magna 's tech know-how may help opel out of crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna international employs 75,000 people in 25 countries magna international may not be a household name , but the russian-backed canadian company , which clinched a deal to take over battered german carmaker opel , is anything but an industry newcomer . it 's a classic rags-to-riches story .
austrian frank strohsack arrived in canada in 1954 with nothing but a few dollars in his pockets .
he changed his name to stronach , rented a small garage and began building tools .
today , stronach 's company , magna international , is the world 's third biggest car parts manufacturer with around 75,000 employees in 25 countries across the globe .
before magna popped up in the headlines as a potential buyer of the german car maker and gm subsidy opel , few in europe would have heard of the company .
but magna has in fact been a big player for quite some time - it 's just that the logo and the name rarely appear on the products they make .
magna international supplies parts for the interiors , engines and designs for a wide range of car makers .
and , at its austrian production sites , magna assembles specific vehicles under contract for bmw , mercedes and aston martin .
innovative technologies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german media has called stronach " the schwarzenegger of the auto industry " when it comes to innovative technologies , magna also seems well prepared for the future .
the company developed a prototype of an electric car that raised eyebrows at the geneva motor show earlier this year .
magna 's cutting-edge technology may help it succeed in running opel , according to german auto expert ferdinand dudenhoefer .
" they are highly competent when it comes to manufacturing cars - much more than fiat who are mostly producing at old sites in italy , " dudenhoefer said .
" the electric model of the ford focus is developed and built by magna .
that 's where the difference is between magna and fiat .
fiat has neither the hybrid technology nor any concepts for electric cars , " he said .
but magna has not been spared by the global recession .
a production site in the us has already been closed and thousands of employees in austria are working reduced hour weeks and have seen their salaries cut .
russian backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's sberbank will foot the bill for magna 's plans taking opel off the hands of the troubled us giant is likely to push magna to its limits , but german politicians seem confident that in the end magna will be able to shoulder the task .
crucial to the deal is backing from russia 's state-controlled sberbank .
the ownership structure of the new company could , according to magna officials , look like this : the canadian company could get 20 percent , sberbank 35 percent , 35 percent would go to gm and 10 percent could stay in the hands of opel staff or opel car dealers . russian carmaker gaz will serve as an industrial partner for opel .
its assembly lines in nizhny novgorod will soon produce opel cars that are " made in russia . "
although the russian economy has also been hard hit by the global recession , many see the market as potentially lucrative once the crisis is over .
magna has already said russia will be a prime target for opel in the future. ai / dpa / ap editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

steinmeier called for fresh efforts in the middle east peace process , and said the european union and us president barack obama 's administration needed to " speak with one voice . "
the new government of israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu has refused to freeze settlement activity , and has not agreed to a two-state solution for israel and palestine .

the win makes up for a disappointing league season for bremen and defeat in the uefa cup final . mesut oezil fired in the winner for bremen in the 58th minute to deliver the club its sixth german cup and first major trophy since 2004 when they won the league and cup double .
bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego received the ball around 10 meters out from the goal box and made his way through three leverkusen defenders with a turn of pace and nifty footwork .
from there he delivered to oezil who burst into the box unmarked left of goal .
oezil struck a solid left foot shot from a tight angle which took a slight but devilish deflection off a lunging manual friedrich before deceiving keeper rene adler and finding the back of the net .
bremen had missed diego 's creativity in last week 's uefa cup final against ukrainian side shakhtar donetsk in istanbul when the midfielder was suspended , and although the playmaker could not always shine on the berlin stage , his moment came when he set up bremen 's winner .
bremen were dominant throughout with diego seeing out his contract with bremen in style .

the win makes up for a disappointing league season for bremen and defeat in the uefa cup final . mesut oezil fired in the winner for bremen in the 58th minute to deliver the club its sixth german cup and first major trophy since 2004 when they won the league and cup double .
bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego received the ball around 10 meters out from the goal box and made his way through three leverkusen defenders with a turn of pace and nifty footwork .
from there he delivered to oezil who burst into the box unmarked left of goal .
oezil struck a solid left foot shot from a tight angle which took a slight but devilish deflection off a lunging manual friedrich before deceiving keeper rene adler and finding the back of the net .
bremen had missed diego 's creativity in last week 's uefa cup final against ukrainian side shakhtar donetsk in istanbul when the midfielder was suspended , and although the playmaker could not always shine on the berlin stage , his moment came when he set up bremen 's winner .
bremen were dominant throughout with diego seeing out his contract with bremen in style .
the 24-year-old has signed a five-year deal worth 24.5 million euros to move to juventus turin next season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf 's men outplayed their opponents thomas schaaf 's men were full value for their victory before a capacity 74,244 crowd in the berlin olympic stadium , and but for young leverkusen goalie rene adler could have taken the lead earlier .
the germany keeper had to save early from sebastian proedl , whose header from a free-kick looked to be from an offside position , and then did well before half-time to tip a naldo header over the bar .
leverkusen missed a chance to pull even with four minutes of regulation time remaining , when germany striker stefan kiessling fired wide .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 30.05.2009 russian funds save german jobs in opel deal ahead of elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel has been given the green light for a new lease of life german chancellor angela merkel has called the deal to save car manufacturer opel a " test for trans-atlantic relations . "
berlin and washington seem to have passed it - but with moscow seizing a lead role in the takeover . following the announcement of the deal between opel and canadian-austrian car parts maker magna , merkel said she had spoken with us president barack obama on friday and that they had agreed to do " everything they could to find a positive solution to a complex situation . " with magna pledging to keep all four german opel factories open , it appears that merkel has found the positive solution she was looking for - although some may find it almost as complex as the problem it tries to solve .
the agreement includes a 1.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 2.1-billion -rrb- bridge loan from the german government aimed at preventing opel itself from going bust before magna can make its financing available . magna 's bid , meanwhile , is to be bankrolled by russia 's state-owned russian sberbank , which will consequently gain a 35-percent stake in opel .
and berlin will provide 4.5 billion euros in loan guarantees for magna and sberbank .
all of this is meant to help opel gain autonomy from its beleaguered parent company gm . breaking new ground with new money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money talks in an election year the investment of so much russian capital - magna plans to put in 700 million euros - into a german company is an unprecedented move .
according to hans-henning schroeder of the german institute for international and security affairs , the financial deal can be attributed to an upcoming general election in germany this fall . " opel is certainly a strategic enterprise , but it is only one of four german automakers and is neither the biggest nor the most important , " schroeder said .
" the most important thing as elections approach is the jobs , and if sberbank is ready to inject the money , one is inclined to accept . " it has not , however , always been so .
as a matter of fact , germany has something of a reputation for being suspicious of foreign investors .

" the most important thing as elections approach is the jobs , and if sberbank is ready to inject the money , one is inclined to accept . " it has not , however , always been so .
as a matter of fact , germany has something of a reputation for being suspicious of foreign investors .
since 2008 , the government has even had the power to veto the purchase of stakes in german companies of 25 percent or higher if the funds are linked to foreign governments . strictly business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's gaz cars need a helping hand themsevles but andrew wilson of the european council of foreign relations says the situation is a fundamentally different one when jobs are dangling in the balance so close to national elections .

austrian frank strohsack arrived in canada in 1954 with nothing but a few dollars in his pockets .
he changed his name to stronach , rented a small garage and began building tools .
today , stronach 's company , magna international , is the world 's third biggest car parts manufacturer with around 75,000 employees in 25 countries across the globe .
before magna popped up in the headlines as a potential buyer of the german car maker and gm subsidy opel , few in europe would have heard of the company .
but magna has in fact been a big player for quite some time - it 's just that the logo and the name rarely appear on the products they make .
magna international supplies parts for the interiors , engines and designs for a wide range of car makers .
and , at its austrian production sites , magna assembles specific vehicles under contract for bmw , mercedes and aston martin .
innovative technologies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german media has called stronach " the schwarzenegger of the auto industry " when it comes to innovative technologies , magna also seems well prepared for the future .
the company developed a prototype of an electric car that raised eyebrows at the geneva motor show earlier this year .
magna 's cutting-edge technology may help it succeed in running opel , according to german auto expert ferdinand dudenhoefer .
" they are highly competent when it comes to manufacturing cars - much more than fiat who are mostly producing at old sites in italy , " dudenhoefer said .
" the electric model of the ford focus is developed and built by magna .
that 's where the difference is between magna and fiat .
fiat has neither the hybrid technology nor any concepts for electric cars , " he said .
but magna has not been spared by the global recession .
a production site in the us has already been closed and thousands of employees in austria are working reduced hour weeks and have seen their salaries cut .
russian backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's sberbank will foot the bill for magna 's plans taking opel off the hands of the troubled us giant is likely to push magna to its limits , but german politicians seem confident that in the end magna will be able to shoulder the task .
crucial to the deal is backing from russia 's state-controlled sberbank .
the ownership structure of the new company could , according to magna officials , look like this : the canadian company could get 20 percent , sberbank 35 percent , 35 percent would go to gm and 10 percent could stay in the hands of opel staff or opel car dealers . russian carmaker gaz will serve as an industrial partner for opel .
its assembly lines in nizhny novgorod will soon produce opel cars that are " made in russia . "
although the russian economy has also been hard hit by the global recession , many see the market as potentially lucrative once the crisis is over .
magna has already said russia will be a prime target for opel in the future. ai / dpa / ap editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german team was missing 17 regulars from their squad . hao junmin opened the scoring for the hosts in the fifth minute , with germany responding two minutes later through lukas podolski .
while lively china threatened on several occasions to find a winner , germany 's only other notable chance was a free-kick from thomas hitzlsperger on the hour mark .
german coach joachim loew is missing 17 players including captain michael ballack from the post-season asian tour , which will also feature a match in dubai on tuesday .
the outcome was nevertheless a disappointment for the visitors , who are ranked second in the world , 95 positions above a perennially underperforming china playing its first match under coach gao hongbo .
" we saw that several things did n't go well .
we were too slow in the build-up , " said loew . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coach joachim loew was anything but pleased forward mario gomez , whose scoreless run is now 15 games , said : " we expected something else .
we wanted to win , but china was very agile . "
christian gentner of vfb stuttgart made his debut and robert huth of middlesbrough returned from a three-year absence in the starting 11 .
stuttgart striker cacau also got his maiden cap when he came on in the 63rd minute for the bayern munich-bound gomez .
few chances china made a dream start to the game when hao got on the end of a through-ball , sped past huth and blasted a shot past robert enke from a tight right angle for a 1-0 lead .
but germany responded almost instantly .
a podolski shot a minute later missed by a matter of inches , and 60 seconds after that he made it 1-1 with a low shot off the back of a nice feed from bastian schweinsteiger .
but the germans were unable to impose themselves as the speedy chinese , based around shanghai shenhua forward gao lin , made life as difficult as they could for the visitors .
enke had to save from zhao xuri in the 24th and gao threatened with a header in the 37th .
the second half passed in similar fashion with huth blocking jiang ning at the last instance in the 58th and jiang denied by enke later in the game .
germany 's only notable chance after the break came from hitzlsperger 's free-kick which was tipped over the bar by yang zhi .
schweinsteiger then aimed wide with eight minutes left. dm , afp / dpa editor : nick amies darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the win makes up for a disappointing league season for bremen and defeat in the uefa cup final . mesut oezil fired in the winner for bremen in the 58th minute to deliver the club its sixth german cup and first major trophy since 2004 when they won the league and cup double .
bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego received the ball around 10 meters out from the goal box and made his way through three leverkusen defenders with a turn of pace and nifty footwork .
from there he delivered to oezil who burst into the box unmarked left of goal .
oezil struck a solid left foot shot from a tight angle which took a slight but devilish deflection off a lunging manual friedrich before deceiving keeper rene adler and finding the back of the net .
bremen had missed diego 's creativity in last week 's uefa cup final against ukrainian side shakhtar donetsk in istanbul when the midfielder was suspended , and although the playmaker could not always shine on the berlin stage , his moment came when he set up bremen 's winner .
bremen were dominant throughout with diego seeing out his contract with bremen in style .
the 24-year-old has signed a five-year deal worth 24.5 million euros to move to juventus turin next season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf 's men outplayed their opponents thomas schaaf 's men were full value for their victory before a capacity 74,244 crowd in the berlin olympic stadium , and but for young leverkusen goalie rene adler could have taken the lead earlier .
the germany keeper had to save early from sebastian proedl , whose header from a free-kick looked to be from an offside position , and then did well before half-time to tip a naldo header over the bar .
leverkusen missed a chance to pull even with four minutes of regulation time remaining , when germany striker stefan kiessling fired wide .
the victory hands bremen the last remaining spot in the new europa league , the reworked uefa cup of old. dfm / dpa / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the win makes up for a disappointing league season for bremen and defeat in the uefa cup final . mesut oezil fired in the winner for bremen in the 58th minute to deliver the club its sixth german cup and first major trophy since 2004 when they won the league and cup double .
bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego received the ball around 10 meters out from the goal box and made his way through three leverkusen defenders with a turn of pace and nifty footwork .
from there he delivered to oezil who burst into the box unmarked left of goal .
oezil struck a solid left foot shot from a tight angle which took a slight but devilish deflection off a lunging manual friedrich before deceiving keeper rene adler and finding the back of the net .
bremen had missed diego 's creativity in last week 's uefa cup final against ukrainian side shakhtar donetsk in istanbul when the midfielder was suspended , and although the playmaker could not always shine on the berlin stage , his moment came when he set up bremen 's winner .
bremen were dominant throughout with diego seeing out his contract with bremen in style .
the 24-year-old has signed a five-year deal worth 24.5 million euros to move to juventus turin next season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf 's men outplayed their opponents thomas schaaf 's men were full value for their victory before a capacity 74,244 crowd in the berlin olympic stadium , and but for young leverkusen goalie rene adler could have taken the lead earlier .
the germany keeper had to save early from sebastian proedl , whose header from a free-kick looked to be from an offside position , and then did well before half-time to tip a naldo header over the bar .
leverkusen missed a chance to pull even with four minutes of regulation time remaining , when germany striker stefan kiessling fired wide .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 30.05.2009 magna 's tech know-how may help opel out of crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna international employs 75,000 people in 25 countries magna international may not be a household name , but the russian-backed canadian company , which clinched a deal to take over battered german carmaker opel , is anything but an industry newcomer . it 's a classic rags-to-riches story .
austrian frank strohsack arrived in canada in 1954 with nothing but a few dollars in his pockets .
he changed his name to stronach , rented a small garage and began building tools .
today , stronach 's company , magna international , is the world 's third biggest car parts manufacturer with around 75,000 employees in 25 countries across the globe .
before magna popped up in the headlines as a potential buyer of the german car maker and gm subsidy opel , few in europe would have heard of the company .
but magna has in fact been a big player for quite some time - it 's just that the logo and the name rarely appear on the products they make .
magna international supplies parts for the interiors , engines and designs for a wide range of car makers .
and , at its austrian production sites , magna assembles specific vehicles under contract for bmw , mercedes and aston martin .
innovative technologies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german media has called stronach " the schwarzenegger of the auto industry " when it comes to innovative technologies , magna also seems well prepared for the future .
the company developed a prototype of an electric car that raised eyebrows at the geneva motor show earlier this year .
magna 's cutting-edge technology may help it succeed in running opel , according to german auto expert ferdinand dudenhoefer .
" they are highly competent when it comes to manufacturing cars - much more than fiat who are mostly producing at old sites in italy , " dudenhoefer said .
" the electric model of the ford focus is developed and built by magna .
that 's where the difference is between magna and fiat .
fiat has neither the hybrid technology nor any concepts for electric cars , " he said .
but magna has not been spared by the global recession .
a production site in the us has already been closed and thousands of employees in austria are working reduced hour weeks and have seen their salaries cut .
russian backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's sberbank will foot the bill for magna 's plans taking opel off the hands of the troubled us giant is likely to push magna to its limits , but german politicians seem confident that in the end magna will be able to shoulder the task .
crucial to the deal is backing from russia 's state-controlled sberbank .
the ownership structure of the new company could , according to magna officials , look like this : the canadian company could get 20 percent , sberbank 35 percent , 35 percent would go to gm and 10 percent could stay in the hands of opel staff or opel car dealers . russian carmaker gaz will serve as an industrial partner for opel .
its assembly lines in nizhny novgorod will soon produce opel cars that are " made in russia . "
although the russian economy has also been hard hit by the global recession , many see the market as potentially lucrative once the crisis is over .
magna has already said russia will be a prime target for opel in the future. ai / dpa / ap editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

today , stronach 's company , magna international , is the world 's third biggest car parts manufacturer with around 75,000 employees in 25 countries across the globe .
before magna popped up in the headlines as a potential buyer of the german car maker and gm subsidy opel , few in europe would have heard of the company .
but magna has in fact been a big player for quite some time - it 's just that the logo and the name rarely appear on the products they make .
magna international supplies parts for the interiors , engines and designs for a wide range of car makers .
and , at its austrian production sites , magna assembles specific vehicles under contract for bmw , mercedes and aston martin .
innovative technologies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german media has called stronach " the schwarzenegger of the auto industry " when it comes to innovative technologies , magna also seems well prepared for the future .
the company developed a prototype of an electric car that raised eyebrows at the geneva motor show earlier this year .
magna 's cutting-edge technology may help it succeed in running opel , according to german auto expert ferdinand dudenhoefer .
" they are highly competent when it comes to manufacturing cars - much more than fiat who are mostly producing at old sites in italy , " dudenhoefer said .
" the electric model of the ford focus is developed and built by magna .
that 's where the difference is between magna and fiat .
fiat has neither the hybrid technology nor any concepts for electric cars , " he said .
but magna has not been spared by the global recession .
a production site in the us has already been closed and thousands of employees in austria are working reduced hour weeks and have seen their salaries cut .
russian backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's sberbank will foot the bill for magna 's plans taking opel off the hands of the troubled us giant is likely to push magna to its limits , but german politicians seem confident that in the end magna will be able to shoulder the task .
crucial to the deal is backing from russia 's state-controlled sberbank .
the ownership structure of the new company could , according to magna officials , look like this : the canadian company could get 20 percent , sberbank 35 percent , 35 percent would go to gm and 10 percent could stay in the hands of opel staff or opel car dealers . russian carmaker gaz will serve as an industrial partner for opel .
its assembly lines in nizhny novgorod will soon produce opel cars that are " made in russia . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 30.05.2009 russian funds save german jobs in opel deal ahead of elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel has been given the green light for a new lease of life german chancellor angela merkel has called the deal to save car manufacturer opel a " test for trans-atlantic relations . "
berlin and washington seem to have passed it - but with moscow seizing a lead role in the takeover . following the announcement of the deal between opel and canadian-austrian car parts maker magna , merkel said she had spoken with us president barack obama on friday and that they had agreed to do " everything they could to find a positive solution to a complex situation . " with magna pledging to keep all four german opel factories open , it appears that merkel has found the positive solution she was looking for - although some may find it almost as complex as the problem it tries to solve .
the agreement includes a 1.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 2.1-billion -rrb- bridge loan from the german government aimed at preventing opel itself from going bust before magna can make its financing available . magna 's bid , meanwhile , is to be bankrolled by russia 's state-owned russian sberbank , which will consequently gain a 35-percent stake in opel .
and berlin will provide 4.5 billion euros in loan guarantees for magna and sberbank .
all of this is meant to help opel gain autonomy from its beleaguered parent company gm . breaking new ground with new money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money talks in an election year the investment of so much russian capital - magna plans to put in 700 million euros - into a german company is an unprecedented move .
according to hans-henning schroeder of the german institute for international and security affairs , the financial deal can be attributed to an upcoming general election in germany this fall . " opel is certainly a strategic enterprise , but it is only one of four german automakers and is neither the biggest nor the most important , " schroeder said .
" the most important thing as elections approach is the jobs , and if sberbank is ready to inject the money , one is inclined to accept . " it has not , however , always been so .
as a matter of fact , germany has something of a reputation for being suspicious of foreign investors .
since 2008 , the government has even had the power to veto the purchase of stakes in german companies of 25 percent or higher if the funds are linked to foreign governments . strictly business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's gaz cars need a helping hand themsevles but andrew wilson of the european council of foreign relations says the situation is a fundamentally different one when jobs are dangling in the balance so close to national elections .
" money does n't smell at election time , " he said . and the deal is not strictly an act of benevolence on the part of sberbank either . moscow is keen to protect russian car manufacturers from foreign competition and already has plans for a tie-in between opel and its ailing domestic carmaker , gaz . tkw / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 30.05.2009 russian funds save german jobs in opel deal ahead of elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel has been given the green light for a new lease of life german chancellor angela merkel has called the deal to save car manufacturer opel a " test for trans-atlantic relations . "
berlin and washington seem to have passed it - but with moscow seizing a lead role in the takeover . following the announcement of the deal between opel and canadian-austrian car parts maker magna , merkel said she had spoken with us president barack obama on friday and that they had agreed to do " everything they could to find a positive solution to a complex situation . " with magna pledging to keep all four german opel factories open , it appears that merkel has found the positive solution she was looking for - although some may find it almost as complex as the problem it tries to solve .
the agreement includes a 1.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 2.1-billion -rrb- bridge loan from the german government aimed at preventing opel itself from going bust before magna can make its financing available . magna 's bid , meanwhile , is to be bankrolled by russia 's state-owned russian sberbank , which will consequently gain a 35-percent stake in opel .
and berlin will provide 4.5 billion euros in loan guarantees for magna and sberbank .
all of this is meant to help opel gain autonomy from its beleaguered parent company gm . breaking new ground with new money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money talks in an election year the investment of so much russian capital - magna plans to put in 700 million euros - into a german company is an unprecedented move .
according to hans-henning schroeder of the german institute for international and security affairs , the financial deal can be attributed to an upcoming general election in germany this fall . " opel is certainly a strategic enterprise , but it is only one of four german automakers and is neither the biggest nor the most important , " schroeder said .
" the most important thing as elections approach is the jobs , and if sberbank is ready to inject the money , one is inclined to accept . " it has not , however , always been so .
as a matter of fact , germany has something of a reputation for being suspicious of foreign investors .
since 2008 , the government has even had the power to veto the purchase of stakes in german companies of 25 percent or higher if the funds are linked to foreign governments . strictly business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's gaz cars need a helping hand themsevles but andrew wilson of the european council of foreign relations says the situation is a fundamentally different one when jobs are dangling in the balance so close to national elections .
" money does n't smell at election time , " he said . and the deal is not strictly an act of benevolence on the part of sberbank either . moscow is keen to protect russian car manufacturers from foreign competition and already has plans for a tie-in between opel and its ailing domestic carmaker , gaz . tkw / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german team was missing 17 regulars from their squad . hao junmin opened the scoring for the hosts in the fifth minute , with germany responding two minutes later through lukas podolski .
while lively china threatened on several occasions to find a winner , germany 's only other notable chance was a free-kick from thomas hitzlsperger on the hour mark .
german coach joachim loew is missing 17 players including captain michael ballack from the post-season asian tour , which will also feature a match in dubai on tuesday .
the outcome was nevertheless a disappointment for the visitors , who are ranked second in the world , 95 positions above a perennially underperforming china playing its first match under coach gao hongbo .
" we saw that several things did n't go well .
we were too slow in the build-up , " said loew . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coach joachim loew was anything but pleased forward mario gomez , whose scoreless run is now 15 games , said : " we expected something else .
we wanted to win , but china was very agile . "
christian gentner of vfb stuttgart made his debut and robert huth of middlesbrough returned from a three-year absence in the starting 11 .
stuttgart striker cacau also got his maiden cap when he came on in the 63rd minute for the bayern munich-bound gomez .
few chances china made a dream start to the game when hao got on the end of a through-ball , sped past huth and blasted a shot past robert enke from a tight right angle for a 1-0 lead .
but germany responded almost instantly .
a podolski shot a minute later missed by a matter of inches , and 60 seconds after that he made it 1-1 with a low shot off the back of a nice feed from bastian schweinsteiger .
but the germans were unable to impose themselves as the speedy chinese , based around shanghai shenhua forward gao lin , made life as difficult as they could for the visitors .
enke had to save from zhao xuri in the 24th and gao threatened with a header in the 37th .
the second half passed in similar fashion with huth blocking jiang ning at the last instance in the 58th and jiang denied by enke later in the game .
germany 's only notable chance after the break came from hitzlsperger 's free-kick which was tipped over the bar by yang zhi .
schweinsteiger then aimed wide with eight minutes left. dm , afp / dpa editor : nick amies darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 30.05.2009 russian funds save german jobs in opel deal ahead of elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel has been given the green light for a new lease of life german chancellor angela merkel has called the deal to save car manufacturer opel a " test for trans-atlantic relations . "
berlin and washington seem to have passed it - but with moscow seizing a lead role in the takeover . following the announcement of the deal between opel and canadian-austrian car parts maker magna , merkel said she had spoken with us president barack obama on friday and that they had agreed to do " everything they could to find a positive solution to a complex situation . " with magna pledging to keep all four german opel factories open , it appears that merkel has found the positive solution she was looking for - although some may find it almost as complex as the problem it tries to solve .
the agreement includes a 1.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 2.1-billion -rrb- bridge loan from the german government aimed at preventing opel itself from going bust before magna can make its financing available . magna 's bid , meanwhile , is to be bankrolled by russia 's state-owned russian sberbank , which will consequently gain a 35-percent stake in opel .
and berlin will provide 4.5 billion euros in loan guarantees for magna and sberbank .
all of this is meant to help opel gain autonomy from its beleaguered parent company gm . breaking new ground with new money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money talks in an election year the investment of so much russian capital - magna plans to put in 700 million euros - into a german company is an unprecedented move .
according to hans-henning schroeder of the german institute for international and security affairs , the financial deal can be attributed to an upcoming general election in germany this fall . " opel is certainly a strategic enterprise , but it is only one of four german automakers and is neither the biggest nor the most important , " schroeder said .
" the most important thing as elections approach is the jobs , and if sberbank is ready to inject the money , one is inclined to accept . " it has not , however , always been so .
as a matter of fact , germany has something of a reputation for being suspicious of foreign investors .
since 2008 , the government has even had the power to veto the purchase of stakes in german companies of 25 percent or higher if the funds are linked to foreign governments . strictly business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's gaz cars need a helping hand themsevles but andrew wilson of the european council of foreign relations says the situation is a fundamentally different one when jobs are dangling in the balance so close to national elections .
" money does n't smell at election time , " he said . and the deal is not strictly an act of benevolence on the part of sberbank either . moscow is keen to protect russian car manufacturers from foreign competition and already has plans for a tie-in between opel and its ailing domestic carmaker , gaz . tkw / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german team was missing 17 regulars from their squad . hao junmin opened the scoring for the hosts in the fifth minute , with germany responding two minutes later through lukas podolski .
while lively china threatened on several occasions to find a winner , germany 's only other notable chance was a free-kick from thomas hitzlsperger on the hour mark .
german coach joachim loew is missing 17 players including captain michael ballack from the post-season asian tour , which will also feature a match in dubai on tuesday .
the outcome was nevertheless a disappointment for the visitors , who are ranked second in the world , 95 positions above a perennially underperforming china playing its first match under coach gao hongbo .
" we saw that several things did n't go well .
we were too slow in the build-up , " said loew . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coach joachim loew was anything but pleased forward mario gomez , whose scoreless run is now 15 games , said : " we expected something else .
we wanted to win , but china was very agile . "
christian gentner of vfb stuttgart made his debut and robert huth of middlesbrough returned from a three-year absence in the starting 11 .
stuttgart striker cacau also got his maiden cap when he came on in the 63rd minute for the bayern munich-bound gomez .
few chances china made a dream start to the game when hao got on the end of a through-ball , sped past huth and blasted a shot past robert enke from a tight right angle for a 1-0 lead .
but germany responded almost instantly .
a podolski shot a minute later missed by a matter of inches , and 60 seconds after that he made it 1-1 with a low shot off the back of a nice feed from bastian schweinsteiger .
but the germans were unable to impose themselves as the speedy chinese , based around shanghai shenhua forward gao lin , made life as difficult as they could for the visitors .
enke had to save from zhao xuri in the 24th and gao threatened with a header in the 37th .
the second half passed in similar fashion with huth blocking jiang ning at the last instance in the 58th and jiang denied by enke later in the game .
germany 's only notable chance after the break came from hitzlsperger 's free-kick which was tipped over the bar by yang zhi .
schweinsteiger then aimed wide with eight minutes left. dm , afp / dpa editor : nick amies darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
berlin and washington seem to have passed it - but with moscow seizing a lead role in the takeover . following the announcement of the deal between opel and canadian-austrian car parts maker magna , merkel said she had spoken with us president barack obama on friday and that they had agreed to do " everything they could to find a positive solution to a complex situation . " with magna pledging to keep all four german opel factories open , it appears that merkel has found the positive solution she was looking for - although some may find it almost as complex as the problem it tries to solve .
the agreement includes a 1.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 2.1-billion -rrb- bridge loan from the german government aimed at preventing opel itself from going bust before magna can make its financing available . magna 's bid , meanwhile , is to be bankrolled by russia 's state-owned russian sberbank , which will consequently gain a 35-percent stake in opel .
and berlin will provide 4.5 billion euros in loan guarantees for magna and sberbank .
all of this is meant to help opel gain autonomy from its beleaguered parent company gm . breaking new ground with new money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money talks in an election year the investment of so much russian capital - magna plans to put in 700 million euros - into a german company is an unprecedented move .
according to hans-henning schroeder of the german institute for international and security affairs , the financial deal can be attributed to an upcoming general election in germany this fall . " opel is certainly a strategic enterprise , but it is only one of four german automakers and is neither the biggest nor the most important , " schroeder said .
" the most important thing as elections approach is the jobs , and if sberbank is ready to inject the money , one is inclined to accept . " it has not , however , always been so .
as a matter of fact , germany has something of a reputation for being suspicious of foreign investors .
since 2008 , the government has even had the power to veto the purchase of stakes in german companies of 25 percent or higher if the funds are linked to foreign governments . strictly business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's gaz cars need a helping hand themsevles but andrew wilson of the european council of foreign relations says the situation is a fundamentally different one when jobs are dangling in the balance so close to national elections .
" money does n't smell at election time , " he said . and the deal is not strictly an act of benevolence on the part of sberbank either . moscow is keen to protect russian car manufacturers from foreign competition and already has plans for a tie-in between opel and its ailing domestic carmaker , gaz . tkw / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 30.05.2009 magna 's tech know-how may help opel out of crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna international employs 75,000 people in 25 countries magna international may not be a household name , but the russian-backed canadian company , which clinched a deal to take over battered german carmaker opel , is anything but an industry newcomer . it 's a classic rags-to-riches story .
austrian frank strohsack arrived in canada in 1954 with nothing but a few dollars in his pockets .
he changed his name to stronach , rented a small garage and began building tools .
today , stronach 's company , magna international , is the world 's third biggest car parts manufacturer with around 75,000 employees in 25 countries across the globe .
before magna popped up in the headlines as a potential buyer of the german car maker and gm subsidy opel , few in europe would have heard of the company .
but magna has in fact been a big player for quite some time - it 's just that the logo and the name rarely appear on the products they make .
magna international supplies parts for the interiors , engines and designs for a wide range of car makers .
and , at its austrian production sites , magna assembles specific vehicles under contract for bmw , mercedes and aston martin .
innovative technologies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german media has called stronach " the schwarzenegger of the auto industry " when it comes to innovative technologies , magna also seems well prepared for the future .
the company developed a prototype of an electric car that raised eyebrows at the geneva motor show earlier this year .
magna 's cutting-edge technology may help it succeed in running opel , according to german auto expert ferdinand dudenhoefer .
" they are highly competent when it comes to manufacturing cars - much more than fiat who are mostly producing at old sites in italy , " dudenhoefer said .
" the electric model of the ford focus is developed and built by magna .
that 's where the difference is between magna and fiat .
fiat has neither the hybrid technology nor any concepts for electric cars , " he said .
but magna has not been spared by the global recession .
a production site in the us has already been closed and thousands of employees in austria are working reduced hour weeks and have seen their salaries cut .
russian backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's sberbank will foot the bill for magna 's plans taking opel off the hands of the troubled us giant is likely to push magna to its limits , but german politicians seem confident that in the end magna will be able to shoulder the task .
crucial to the deal is backing from russia 's state-controlled sberbank .
the ownership structure of the new company could , according to magna officials , look like this : the canadian company could get 20 percent , sberbank 35 percent , 35 percent would go to gm and 10 percent could stay in the hands of opel staff or opel car dealers . russian carmaker gaz will serve as an industrial partner for opel .
its assembly lines in nizhny novgorod will soon produce opel cars that are " made in russia . "
although the russian economy has also been hard hit by the global recession , many see the market as potentially lucrative once the crisis is over .
magna has already said russia will be a prime target for opel in the future. ai / dpa / ap editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

austrian frank strohsack arrived in canada in 1954 with nothing but a few dollars in his pockets .
he changed his name to stronach , rented a small garage and began building tools .
today , stronach 's company , magna international , is the world 's third biggest car parts manufacturer with around 75,000 employees in 25 countries across the globe .
before magna popped up in the headlines as a potential buyer of the german car maker and gm subsidy opel , few in europe would have heard of the company .
but magna has in fact been a big player for quite some time - it 's just that the logo and the name rarely appear on the products they make .
magna international supplies parts for the interiors , engines and designs for a wide range of car makers .
and , at its austrian production sites , magna assembles specific vehicles under contract for bmw , mercedes and aston martin .
innovative technologies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german media has called stronach " the schwarzenegger of the auto industry " when it comes to innovative technologies , magna also seems well prepared for the future .
the company developed a prototype of an electric car that raised eyebrows at the geneva motor show earlier this year .
magna 's cutting-edge technology may help it succeed in running opel , according to german auto expert ferdinand dudenhoefer .
" they are highly competent when it comes to manufacturing cars - much more than fiat who are mostly producing at old sites in italy , " dudenhoefer said .
" the electric model of the ford focus is developed and built by magna .
that 's where the difference is between magna and fiat .
fiat has neither the hybrid technology nor any concepts for electric cars , " he said .
but magna has not been spared by the global recession .
a production site in the us has already been closed and thousands of employees in austria are working reduced hour weeks and have seen their salaries cut .
russian backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's sberbank will foot the bill for magna 's plans taking opel off the hands of the troubled us giant is likely to push magna to its limits , but german politicians seem confident that in the end magna will be able to shoulder the task .
crucial to the deal is backing from russia 's state-controlled sberbank .
the ownership structure of the new company could , according to magna officials , look like this : the canadian company could get 20 percent , sberbank 35 percent , 35 percent would go to gm and 10 percent could stay in the hands of opel staff or opel car dealers . russian carmaker gaz will serve as an industrial partner for opel .
its assembly lines in nizhny novgorod will soon produce opel cars that are " made in russia . "
although the russian economy has also been hard hit by the global recession , many see the market as potentially lucrative once the crisis is over .

berlin and washington seem to have passed it - but with moscow seizing a lead role in the takeover . following the announcement of the deal between opel and canadian-austrian car parts maker magna , merkel said she had spoken with us president barack obama on friday and that they had agreed to do " everything they could to find a positive solution to a complex situation . " with magna pledging to keep all four german opel factories open , it appears that merkel has found the positive solution she was looking for - although some may find it almost as complex as the problem it tries to solve .
the agreement includes a 1.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 2.1-billion -rrb- bridge loan from the german government aimed at preventing opel itself from going bust before magna can make its financing available . magna 's bid , meanwhile , is to be bankrolled by russia 's state-owned russian sberbank , which will consequently gain a 35-percent stake in opel .
and berlin will provide 4.5 billion euros in loan guarantees for magna and sberbank .

according to hans-henning schroeder of the german institute for international and security affairs , the financial deal can be attributed to an upcoming general election in germany this fall . " opel is certainly a strategic enterprise , but it is only one of four german automakers and is neither the biggest nor the most important , " schroeder said .

austrian frank strohsack arrived in canada in 1954 with nothing but a few dollars in his pockets .
he changed his name to stronach , rented a small garage and began building tools .
today , stronach 's company , magna international , is the world 's third biggest car parts manufacturer with around 75,000 employees in 25 countries across the globe .
before magna popped up in the headlines as a potential buyer of the german car maker and gm subsidy opel , few in europe would have heard of the company .
but magna has in fact been a big player for quite some time - it 's just that the logo and the name rarely appear on the products they make .
magna international supplies parts for the interiors , engines and designs for a wide range of car makers .
and , at its austrian production sites , magna assembles specific vehicles under contract for bmw , mercedes and aston martin .
innovative technologies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german media has called stronach " the schwarzenegger of the auto industry " when it comes to innovative technologies , magna also seems well prepared for the future .
the company developed a prototype of an electric car that raised eyebrows at the geneva motor show earlier this year .
magna 's cutting-edge technology may help it succeed in running opel , according to german auto expert ferdinand dudenhoefer .
" they are highly competent when it comes to manufacturing cars - much more than fiat who are mostly producing at old sites in italy , " dudenhoefer said .
" the electric model of the ford focus is developed and built by magna .
that 's where the difference is between magna and fiat .
fiat has neither the hybrid technology nor any concepts for electric cars , " he said .
but magna has not been spared by the global recession .
a production site in the us has already been closed and thousands of employees in austria are working reduced hour weeks and have seen their salaries cut .
russian backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's sberbank will foot the bill for magna 's plans taking opel off the hands of the troubled us giant is likely to push magna to its limits , but german politicians seem confident that in the end magna will be able to shoulder the task .
crucial to the deal is backing from russia 's state-controlled sberbank .
the ownership structure of the new company could , according to magna officials , look like this : the canadian company could get 20 percent , sberbank 35 percent , 35 percent would go to gm and 10 percent could stay in the hands of opel staff or opel car dealers . russian carmaker gaz will serve as an industrial partner for opel .
its assembly lines in nizhny novgorod will soon produce opel cars that are " made in russia . "
although the russian economy has also been hard hit by the global recession , many see the market as potentially lucrative once the crisis is over .

the german team was missing 17 regulars from their squad . hao junmin opened the scoring for the hosts in the fifth minute , with germany responding two minutes later through lukas podolski .
while lively china threatened on several occasions to find a winner , germany 's only other notable chance was a free-kick from thomas hitzlsperger on the hour mark .
german coach joachim loew is missing 17 players including captain michael ballack from the post-season asian tour , which will also feature a match in dubai on tuesday .
the outcome was nevertheless a disappointment for the visitors , who are ranked second in the world , 95 positions above a perennially underperforming china playing its first match under coach gao hongbo .
" we saw that several things did n't go well .
we were too slow in the build-up , " said loew . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coach joachim loew was anything but pleased forward mario gomez , whose scoreless run is now 15 games , said : " we expected something else .

enke had to save from zhao xuri in the 24th and gao threatened with a header in the 37th .
the second half passed in similar fashion with huth blocking jiang ning at the last instance in the 58th and jiang denied by enke later in the game .
germany 's only notable chance after the break came from hitzlsperger 's free-kick which was tipped over the bar by yang zhi .

" we will not stand idly by as north korea builds a capability to wreak destruction on any target in the region or on us , " gates told the conference delegates . compounding tensions on the korean peninsula , a south korean newspaper , quoting sources in washington , said on saturday that pyongyang was preparing to move an intercontinental ballistic missile from a factory to a launch pad on the country 's eastern coast . south korean defense minister lee sang hee urged the un security council on saturday to take action against north korea , stressing that his government would work peacefully to resolve the north korean nuclear issue . north korea increasingly bellicose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south koreans protested the north 's recent nuclear test increasingly belligerent north korea earlier warned south korea that its decision to join a us-led anti-proliferation campaign is tantamount to a declaration of war , freeing it from the korean war armistice . in a statement released by the official korean central news agency -lrb- kcna -rrb- , north korea said it no longer felt bound by the korean war armistice and that anyone who provoked it would " face unimaginable merciless punishment . " the statement added that the regime of kim jong il could no longer guarantee the safety of us and south korean ships off its western coast . the hard-line announcement came in response to seoul ’ s decision to join the proliferation security initiative -lrb- psi -rrb- , which provides for the searching of ships thought to be carrying any part of weapons of mass destruction . south korea became a full member of the psi on tuesday after north korea conducted a second internationally condemned nuclear test monday , considerably more powerful than its first test almost three years ago , and also fired several short-range missiles . but the north made it clear in its statement that it would not tolerate the stopping and searching of its ships .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de german cup -pipe- 30.05.2009 werder bremen undo leverkusen to claim german cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's mesut ozil scored the winner for bremen werder bremen have clinched the german cup after prevailing 1-0 over bayer leverkusen in the final in berlin on saturday .
the win makes up for a disappointing league season for bremen and defeat in the uefa cup final . mesut oezil fired in the winner for bremen in the 58th minute to deliver the club its sixth german cup and first major trophy since 2004 when they won the league and cup double .
bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego received the ball around 10 meters out from the goal box and made his way through three leverkusen defenders with a turn of pace and nifty footwork .
from there he delivered to oezil who burst into the box unmarked left of goal .
oezil struck a solid left foot shot from a tight angle which took a slight but devilish deflection off a lunging manual friedrich before deceiving keeper rene adler and finding the back of the net .
bremen had missed diego 's creativity in last week 's uefa cup final against ukrainian side shakhtar donetsk in istanbul when the midfielder was suspended , and although the playmaker could not always shine on the berlin stage , his moment came when he set up bremen 's winner .
bremen were dominant throughout with diego seeing out his contract with bremen in style .
the 24-year-old has signed a five-year deal worth 24.5 million euros to move to juventus turin next season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf 's men outplayed their opponents thomas schaaf 's men were full value for their victory before a capacity 74,244 crowd in the berlin olympic stadium , and but for young leverkusen goalie rene adler could have taken the lead earlier .

the win makes up for a disappointing league season for bremen and defeat in the uefa cup final . mesut oezil fired in the winner for bremen in the 58th minute to deliver the club its sixth german cup and first major trophy since 2004 when they won the league and cup double .
bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego received the ball around 10 meters out from the goal box and made his way through three leverkusen defenders with a turn of pace and nifty footwork .
from there he delivered to oezil who burst into the box unmarked left of goal .
oezil struck a solid left foot shot from a tight angle which took a slight but devilish deflection off a lunging manual friedrich before deceiving keeper rene adler and finding the back of the net .
bremen had missed diego 's creativity in last week 's uefa cup final against ukrainian side shakhtar donetsk in istanbul when the midfielder was suspended , and although the playmaker could not always shine on the berlin stage , his moment came when he set up bremen 's winner .
bremen were dominant throughout with diego seeing out his contract with bremen in style .
the 24-year-old has signed a five-year deal worth 24.5 million euros to move to juventus turin next season .

the german team was missing 17 regulars from their squad . hao junmin opened the scoring for the hosts in the fifth minute , with germany responding two minutes later through lukas podolski .
while lively china threatened on several occasions to find a winner , germany 's only other notable chance was a free-kick from thomas hitzlsperger on the hour mark .
german coach joachim loew is missing 17 players including captain michael ballack from the post-season asian tour , which will also feature a match in dubai on tuesday .
the outcome was nevertheless a disappointment for the visitors , who are ranked second in the world , 95 positions above a perennially underperforming china playing its first match under coach gao hongbo .
" we saw that several things did n't go well .
we were too slow in the build-up , " said loew . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coach joachim loew was anything but pleased forward mario gomez , whose scoreless run is now 15 games , said : " we expected something else .
we wanted to win , but china was very agile . "
christian gentner of vfb stuttgart made his debut and robert huth of middlesbrough returned from a three-year absence in the starting 11 .
stuttgart striker cacau also got his maiden cap when he came on in the 63rd minute for the bayern munich-bound gomez .
few chances china made a dream start to the game when hao got on the end of a through-ball , sped past huth and blasted a shot past robert enke from a tight right angle for a 1-0 lead .
but germany responded almost instantly .
a podolski shot a minute later missed by a matter of inches , and 60 seconds after that he made it 1-1 with a low shot off the back of a nice feed from bastian schweinsteiger .
but the germans were unable to impose themselves as the speedy chinese , based around shanghai shenhua forward gao lin , made life as difficult as they could for the visitors .
enke had to save from zhao xuri in the 24th and gao threatened with a header in the 37th .
the second half passed in similar fashion with huth blocking jiang ning at the last instance in the 58th and jiang denied by enke later in the game .
germany 's only notable chance after the break came from hitzlsperger 's free-kick which was tipped over the bar by yang zhi .
schweinsteiger then aimed wide with eight minutes left. dm , afp / dpa editor : nick amies darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
berlin and washington seem to have passed it - but with moscow seizing a lead role in the takeover . following the announcement of the deal between opel and canadian-austrian car parts maker magna , merkel said she had spoken with us president barack obama on friday and that they had agreed to do " everything they could to find a positive solution to a complex situation . " with magna pledging to keep all four german opel factories open , it appears that merkel has found the positive solution she was looking for - although some may find it almost as complex as the problem it tries to solve .
the agreement includes a 1.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 2.1-billion -rrb- bridge loan from the german government aimed at preventing opel itself from going bust before magna can make its financing available . magna 's bid , meanwhile , is to be bankrolled by russia 's state-owned russian sberbank , which will consequently gain a 35-percent stake in opel .
and berlin will provide 4.5 billion euros in loan guarantees for magna and sberbank .
all of this is meant to help opel gain autonomy from its beleaguered parent company gm . breaking new ground with new money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money talks in an election year the investment of so much russian capital - magna plans to put in 700 million euros - into a german company is an unprecedented move .
according to hans-henning schroeder of the german institute for international and security affairs , the financial deal can be attributed to an upcoming general election in germany this fall . " opel is certainly a strategic enterprise , but it is only one of four german automakers and is neither the biggest nor the most important , " schroeder said .
" the most important thing as elections approach is the jobs , and if sberbank is ready to inject the money , one is inclined to accept . " it has not , however , always been so .
as a matter of fact , germany has something of a reputation for being suspicious of foreign investors .
since 2008 , the government has even had the power to veto the purchase of stakes in german companies of 25 percent or higher if the funds are linked to foreign governments . strictly business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's gaz cars need a helping hand themsevles but andrew wilson of the european council of foreign relations says the situation is a fundamentally different one when jobs are dangling in the balance so close to national elections .
" money does n't smell at election time , " he said . and the deal is not strictly an act of benevolence on the part of sberbank either . moscow is keen to protect russian car manufacturers from foreign competition and already has plans for a tie-in between opel and its ailing domestic carmaker , gaz . tkw / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

austrian frank strohsack arrived in canada in 1954 with nothing but a few dollars in his pockets .
he changed his name to stronach , rented a small garage and began building tools .
today , stronach 's company , magna international , is the world 's third biggest car parts manufacturer with around 75,000 employees in 25 countries across the globe .
before magna popped up in the headlines as a potential buyer of the german car maker and gm subsidy opel , few in europe would have heard of the company .
but magna has in fact been a big player for quite some time - it 's just that the logo and the name rarely appear on the products they make .
magna international supplies parts for the interiors , engines and designs for a wide range of car makers .
and , at its austrian production sites , magna assembles specific vehicles under contract for bmw , mercedes and aston martin .
innovative technologies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german media has called stronach " the schwarzenegger of the auto industry " when it comes to innovative technologies , magna also seems well prepared for the future .
the company developed a prototype of an electric car that raised eyebrows at the geneva motor show earlier this year .
magna 's cutting-edge technology may help it succeed in running opel , according to german auto expert ferdinand dudenhoefer .
" they are highly competent when it comes to manufacturing cars - much more than fiat who are mostly producing at old sites in italy , " dudenhoefer said .
" the electric model of the ford focus is developed and built by magna .
that 's where the difference is between magna and fiat .
fiat has neither the hybrid technology nor any concepts for electric cars , " he said .
but magna has not been spared by the global recession .
a production site in the us has already been closed and thousands of employees in austria are working reduced hour weeks and have seen their salaries cut .
russian backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's sberbank will foot the bill for magna 's plans taking opel off the hands of the troubled us giant is likely to push magna to its limits , but german politicians seem confident that in the end magna will be able to shoulder the task .
crucial to the deal is backing from russia 's state-controlled sberbank .
the ownership structure of the new company could , according to magna officials , look like this : the canadian company could get 20 percent , sberbank 35 percent , 35 percent would go to gm and 10 percent could stay in the hands of opel staff or opel car dealers . russian carmaker gaz will serve as an industrial partner for opel .
its assembly lines in nizhny novgorod will soon produce opel cars that are " made in russia . "

the win makes up for a disappointing league season for bremen and defeat in the uefa cup final . mesut oezil fired in the winner for bremen in the 58th minute to deliver the club its sixth german cup and first major trophy since 2004 when they won the league and cup double .
bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego received the ball around 10 meters out from the goal box and made his way through three leverkusen defenders with a turn of pace and nifty footwork .
from there he delivered to oezil who burst into the box unmarked left of goal .
oezil struck a solid left foot shot from a tight angle which took a slight but devilish deflection off a lunging manual friedrich before deceiving keeper rene adler and finding the back of the net .
bremen had missed diego 's creativity in last week 's uefa cup final against ukrainian side shakhtar donetsk in istanbul when the midfielder was suspended , and although the playmaker could not always shine on the berlin stage , his moment came when he set up bremen 's winner .
bremen were dominant throughout with diego seeing out his contract with bremen in style .
the 24-year-old has signed a five-year deal worth 24.5 million euros to move to juventus turin next season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf 's men outplayed their opponents thomas schaaf 's men were full value for their victory before a capacity 74,244 crowd in the berlin olympic stadium , and but for young leverkusen goalie rene adler could have taken the lead earlier .
the germany keeper had to save early from sebastian proedl , whose header from a free-kick looked to be from an offside position , and then did well before half-time to tip a naldo header over the bar .
leverkusen missed a chance to pull even with four minutes of regulation time remaining , when germany striker stefan kiessling fired wide .

the win makes up for a disappointing league season for bremen and defeat in the uefa cup final . mesut oezil fired in the winner for bremen in the 58th minute to deliver the club its sixth german cup and first major trophy since 2004 when they won the league and cup double .
bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego received the ball around 10 meters out from the goal box and made his way through three leverkusen defenders with a turn of pace and nifty footwork .
from there he delivered to oezil who burst into the box unmarked left of goal .
oezil struck a solid left foot shot from a tight angle which took a slight but devilish deflection off a lunging manual friedrich before deceiving keeper rene adler and finding the back of the net .
bremen had missed diego 's creativity in last week 's uefa cup final against ukrainian side shakhtar donetsk in istanbul when the midfielder was suspended , and although the playmaker could not always shine on the berlin stage , his moment came when he set up bremen 's winner .
bremen were dominant throughout with diego seeing out his contract with bremen in style .
the 24-year-old has signed a five-year deal worth 24.5 million euros to move to juventus turin next season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf 's men outplayed their opponents thomas schaaf 's men were full value for their victory before a capacity 74,244 crowd in the berlin olympic stadium , and but for young leverkusen goalie rene adler could have taken the lead earlier .
the germany keeper had to save early from sebastian proedl , whose header from a free-kick looked to be from an offside position , and then did well before half-time to tip a naldo header over the bar .
leverkusen missed a chance to pull even with four minutes of regulation time remaining , when germany striker stefan kiessling fired wide .
the victory hands bremen the last remaining spot in the new europa league , the reworked uefa cup of old. dfm / dpa / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
