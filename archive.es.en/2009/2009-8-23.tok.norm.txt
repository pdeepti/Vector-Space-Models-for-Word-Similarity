but 2009 is also giving pecs a reason to celebrate , as diocese pecs plans to toast its 1000-year anniversary . one of the main landmarks in the western hungarian town of pecs is the church of st. maria , in the main square .
the building alone speaks volumes about the long history of this turbulent region . the now-church was once a turkish mosque - which in turn was built on the remains of a 16th century romanesque church .
today , it features features a grand green-copper cupola , prayer niches , keel-arch windows , and the remains of an ottoman painting that includes verses from the koran . from church , to mosque , and back again bishop mihaly mayer says that many catholics still call the downtown church a mosque . “ i always say : ‘ you can say that but its not entirely true , ’ ” mayer said .
“ half of it was built as a christian church , and if you look back even earlier , it was the holy church of bartholomew that was built as a mosque .
i stress that because no one ever mentioned this cathedral in the communist past . ” bishop mayer has been at the head of the pecs diocese for 20 years .
he remembers how the church was stifled under hungary ’ s communist rule , despite the long christian tradition in the region . several decades ago , early christian burial chambers were discovered beneath the church ; they date back to the fourth century , when pecs was a roman city .
today , these are a designated unesco world heritage site . the dioscese of pecs is also referred to as the diocese quinque ecclesia , a name that refers to the fact that the city was originally built around five old christian chapels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city is busy planning for 2010 , but 2009 need not be forgotten these five chapels no longer exist , and no one knows where they once stood .
what is clear is that king stephan founded of the diocese , laying the ground stone for the ancient cathedral in 1009 .
the church was changed and destroyed many times over in the ensuing years . the neo-romanesque cathedral , with its green copper domed roof and four corner towers that rise above the city , was built between 1882 and 1891 .
in places , the cathedral shows signs of its former life as a mosque .
this is especially true in the reliefs in the passageway leading to the lower church , where the heads of the statues of apostles have been broken off . for the 1000th anniversary of the diocese , the church has been restored both inside and out .
the restoration was helped along with state funding , and the state is expected to pick up the tab for the anniversary celebrations as well .
some 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 358,000 -rrb- in culture capital 2010 financing are expected - though by the end of july none of that money had made its way to the diocese , meyer complained . hopes for cultural cooperation in fact , given the number of active construction sites in the city , it appears that pecs is having problems putting its ambitious culture capital plans into action .
nonetheless , the diocese is kicking off its anniversary year with a special church service .
and there has been church-to-church contact between the diocese in pecs and in the city of essen , germany - along with istanbul , another cultural capital for 2010 . " we had a music school from essen here recently .
and i wrote to the auxiliary bishop there that we should make a partnership between the catholic school in pecs and the music school , " meyer said . " it would be nice if we could finish up that agreement in 2010 and take the next step in our relationship .

the church was changed and destroyed many times over in the ensuing years . the neo-romanesque cathedral , with its green copper domed roof and four corner towers that rise above the city , was built between 1882 and 1891 .
in places , the cathedral shows signs of its former life as a mosque .
this is especially true in the reliefs in the passageway leading to the lower church , where the heads of the statues of apostles have been broken off . for the 1000th anniversary of the diocese , the church has been restored both inside and out .
the restoration was helped along with state funding , and the state is expected to pick up the tab for the anniversary celebrations as well .
some 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 358,000 -rrb- in culture capital 2010 financing are expected - though by the end of july none of that money had made its way to the diocese , meyer complained . hopes for cultural cooperation in fact , given the number of active construction sites in the city , it appears that pecs is having problems putting its ambitious culture capital plans into action .
nonetheless , the diocese is kicking off its anniversary year with a special church service .
and there has been church-to-church contact between the diocese in pecs and in the city of essen , germany - along with istanbul , another cultural capital for 2010 . " we had a music school from essen here recently .
and i wrote to the auxiliary bishop there that we should make a partnership between the catholic school in pecs and the music school , " meyer said . " it would be nice if we could finish up that agreement in 2010 and take the next step in our relationship .
so we can stress the idea that our students are n't going to europe or that european students are n't coming to us , but that we live in europe . sigrid hoff -lrb- jen -rrb- editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" that was absolutely terrible and a serious wake-up call for us .
we should n't have lost like that , " rensing said .
things got even worse for louis van gaal 's side seven minutes before the break when bance rose above daniel van buyten to head home from 10 metres and make it 2-0 to thomas tuchel 's side .
with bayern now looking to pull back from a two-goal deficit , van gaal immediately brought on croatian striker ivica olic for midfielder danijel pranijic .
" normally i would n't make a substitution so early but i could have taken off a lot more players , " said an angry van gaal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 23.08.2009 bayern munich 's indifferent start becomes a nightmare großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz goalscorer aristide bance finished off bayern bayern 's new coach louis van gaal is still waiting for his first bundesliga win since taking charge in july .
he was also visibly angry when he faced the press after watching his team lose 2-1 to newly-promoted mainz . three games into the new bundesliga season bayern munich remain without a win after goals saturday from andreas ivanschitz and aristide bance helped newly-promoted mainz 05 to a shock 2-1 victory over the german giants .
meanwhile as a bayern team missing franck ribery and luca toni continued to struggle under new coach louis van gaal , bayer leverkusen maintained their strong start and go to the top on goal difference courtesy of a 5-0 mauling of sc freiburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's tranquillo barnetta leverkusen are the new pacesetters with seven points from three games , level with schalke 04 , who dropped their first points of the season when they were held to a goalless draw on friday at hoffenheim .
vfb stuttgart and borussia dortmund both lost ground on the top of the table after playing out a 1-1 draw while a surprise victory for mainz sees them move up to fourth on five points , level with eintracht frankfurt , who played out a scoreless draw with cologne .
champions vfl wolfsburg sit third on six points ahead of their visit to sv hamburg on sunday while munich now languishes in 12th on just two points .
bayern 's boss not happy " that was very disappointing and i am asking myself what we have done incorrectly in our preparations , " said a notably disappointed van gaal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's louis van gaal is not happy mainz were every bit bayern 's equals in the early stages and took a deserved lead on 25 minutes when austrian ivanschitz sent in a shot from 25 metres that slipped in under bayern goalkeeper michael rensing 's outstretched arm .
" that was absolutely terrible and a serious wake-up call for us .
we should n't have lost like that , " rensing said .
things got even worse for louis van gaal 's side seven minutes before the break when bance rose above daniel van buyten to head home from 10 metres and make it 2-0 to thomas tuchel 's side .
with bayern now looking to pull back from a two-goal deficit , van gaal immediately brought on croatian striker ivica olic for midfielder danijel pranijic .
" normally i would n't make a substitution so early but i could have taken off a lot more players , " said an angry van gaal .
mainz did give bayern a lifeline on 47 minutes when nikolce noveski headed a thomas mueller cross into his own net and mueller subsequently had a glorious opportunity to equalize on the hour-mark but his header of van buyten 's pinpoint cross was wide .
van gaal brought on jose sosa for miroslav klose with 18 minutes left as bayern continued to press for an equalizer but the argentine could n't make good a free-kick opportunity four minutes later .
mario gomez hit the side-netting as bayern got ever more desperate but mainz held on for a stunning win .
elsewhere in the league while bayern struggled , bayer leverkusen went top of the table after three games when they hammered freiburg .
" for us it was a very strange game , because freiburg were clearly the better team during the first 35 minutes , " said bayer coach jupp heynckes .
stefan kiessling scored his third goal of the season on 35 minutes to open the scoring at freiburg 's badenova stadium , firing home after being found by simon rolfes .
swiss international tranquillo barnetta doubled leverkusen 's lead two minutes after the restart with a nicely-struck shot from the edge of the area , while a further brace from eren deriyok , sandwiched by barnetta 's second , completed the rout .
" being top of the table means nothing to me , " said leverkusen 's jupp heynckes .

after months of negotiations , his foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop flew to moscow and met with his counterpart vyacheslav molotov .
on aug .
23 , they signed an agreement , most commonly known as the molotov-ribbentrop pact . the negotiations took place in secret , at the same time as france and britain negotiated an alliance with stalin . though primarily a non-aggression pact , the document incorporated some economic components . provisions under the agreement included : arbitration in the event of a disagreement , consultation and neutrality if either russia or germany went to war against a third power .
the pact also stipulated that neither party could join a group or alliance " directly or indirectly aimed at the other . " only after germany 's defeat in 1945 did details of the secret protocols of the pact emerge . bildunterschrift : as this 1939 cartoon shows , many saw stalin as the butcher of the baltic states secret protocols envisaged carve-up of europe the protocols divided europe into german and soviet spheres of control .
latvia and estonia were to be in the soviet sphere .
lithuania , the part that was adjacent to east prussia , was to come under german control .
later the protocol was altered , assigning lithuania to the soviets as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler and stalin helped each other prepare for wwii to the north , finland was to be carved off for stalin .
poland was to be partitioned , and soon after the pact was signed , both powers invaded the country to take their respective pieces . immediately afterwards , russia invaded finland , but the red army were repelled in the famous " winter war " of 1939/1940 .
after holding their ground for four months and inflicting terrible casualties on the russians , the heavily outnumbered finns were militarily exhausted , and they sued for peace . stalin annexed finland 's eastern province of karelia , which led eventually to finland and germany signing an alliance .
that alliance was to become a key element in hitler 's invasion of russia . quarrelling between germany and the soviets escalated during the summer of 1940 , as the soviet union refused to fulfill its economic commitments under the molotov-ribbentrop pact , and both parties carried out military operations without informing the other . the german war effort was heavily reliant on the russian raw materials that the pact had aimed to secure , and hitler 's plans were increasingly frustrated .
in august , nazi germany annexed part of romania to gain access to oil fields . hitler tears up pact , invades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany attacked the soviet union in 1941 on june 22 , 1941 , hitler abrogated the molotov-ribbentrop pact and launched operation barbarossa .
the multifaceted invasion involved attacks along the entire eastern front , from finland in the north to the black sea in the south . the eventual failure of barbarossa , the largest military operation in history , became the turning point in the nazi 's fortunes . after germany was defeated in 1945 , soviet troops remained in occupation across much of eastern europe , and the baltic states .
what the allies did n't give stalin as war reparations , he annexed anyway , until ending up with much of what the soviets had claimed in the secret protocols of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . details of the secret protocols dividing up europe surfaced during the nuremberg trials in 1945-46 even though the soviets continued to deny their existence .
after the war , they justified their occupation of the baltic states by claiming that the parliaments of latvia , lithuania and estonia had petitioned to join the ussr . the baltic pro-independence movement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two million balts protested against the soviet union in 1989 in the early 1980s , as the soviet union embraced glasnost , the baltic states ' pro-independence protest movement gathered strength .
on aug .
23 , 1986 , large street protests were held across latvia , lithuania and estonia to mark the anniversary of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . in 1989 , the fourth consecutive year of the protests , and the 50th anniversary of the pact , an especially large protest was planned , resulting in the so-called " baltic way " .
two million lithuanians , latvians and estonians linked arms to form a 671-kilometer -lrb- 417-mile -rrb- long human chain , connecting the three capitals , vilnius , riga and tallinn . the baltic pro-independence movements issued a joint declaration to the world and european community , condemning the molotov – ribbentrop pact , and calling it a criminal act . the declaration said independence for the baltics was a question of " inalienable human rights , " and accused the european community of ignoring the last colonies of the hitler – stalin era . in december 1989 , soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and the soviet congress of people 's deputies signed a report condemning the molotov-ribbentrop pact . on march 11 , 1990 , less than six months after the baltic way , lithuania declared independence , the first soviet state to do so .

after months of negotiations , his foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop flew to moscow and met with his counterpart vyacheslav molotov .
on aug .
23 , they signed an agreement , most commonly known as the molotov-ribbentrop pact . the negotiations took place in secret , at the same time as france and britain negotiated an alliance with stalin . though primarily a non-aggression pact , the document incorporated some economic components . provisions under the agreement included : arbitration in the event of a disagreement , consultation and neutrality if either russia or germany went to war against a third power .
the pact also stipulated that neither party could join a group or alliance " directly or indirectly aimed at the other . " only after germany 's defeat in 1945 did details of the secret protocols of the pact emerge . bildunterschrift : as this 1939 cartoon shows , many saw stalin as the butcher of the baltic states secret protocols envisaged carve-up of europe the protocols divided europe into german and soviet spheres of control .
latvia and estonia were to be in the soviet sphere .
lithuania , the part that was adjacent to east prussia , was to come under german control .
later the protocol was altered , assigning lithuania to the soviets as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler and stalin helped each other prepare for wwii to the north , finland was to be carved off for stalin .
poland was to be partitioned , and soon after the pact was signed , both powers invaded the country to take their respective pieces . immediately afterwards , russia invaded finland , but the red army were repelled in the famous " winter war " of 1939/1940 .
after holding their ground for four months and inflicting terrible casualties on the russians , the heavily outnumbered finns were militarily exhausted , and they sued for peace . stalin annexed finland 's eastern province of karelia , which led eventually to finland and germany signing an alliance .
that alliance was to become a key element in hitler 's invasion of russia . quarrelling between germany and the soviets escalated during the summer of 1940 , as the soviet union refused to fulfill its economic commitments under the molotov-ribbentrop pact , and both parties carried out military operations without informing the other . the german war effort was heavily reliant on the russian raw materials that the pact had aimed to secure , and hitler 's plans were increasingly frustrated .
in august , nazi germany annexed part of romania to gain access to oil fields . hitler tears up pact , invades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany attacked the soviet union in 1941 on june 22 , 1941 , hitler abrogated the molotov-ribbentrop pact and launched operation barbarossa .
the multifaceted invasion involved attacks along the entire eastern front , from finland in the north to the black sea in the south . the eventual failure of barbarossa , the largest military operation in history , became the turning point in the nazi 's fortunes . after germany was defeated in 1945 , soviet troops remained in occupation across much of eastern europe , and the baltic states .
what the allies did n't give stalin as war reparations , he annexed anyway , until ending up with much of what the soviets had claimed in the secret protocols of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . details of the secret protocols dividing up europe surfaced during the nuremberg trials in 1945-46 even though the soviets continued to deny their existence .
after the war , they justified their occupation of the baltic states by claiming that the parliaments of latvia , lithuania and estonia had petitioned to join the ussr . the baltic pro-independence movement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two million balts protested against the soviet union in 1989 in the early 1980s , as the soviet union embraced glasnost , the baltic states ' pro-independence protest movement gathered strength .
on aug .
23 , 1986 , large street protests were held across latvia , lithuania and estonia to mark the anniversary of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . in 1989 , the fourth consecutive year of the protests , and the 50th anniversary of the pact , an especially large protest was planned , resulting in the so-called " baltic way " .
two million lithuanians , latvians and estonians linked arms to form a 671-kilometer -lrb- 417-mile -rrb- long human chain , connecting the three capitals , vilnius , riga and tallinn . the baltic pro-independence movements issued a joint declaration to the world and european community , condemning the molotov – ribbentrop pact , and calling it a criminal act . the declaration said independence for the baltics was a question of " inalienable human rights , " and accused the european community of ignoring the last colonies of the hitler – stalin era . in december 1989 , soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and the soviet congress of people 's deputies signed a report condemning the molotov-ribbentrop pact . on march 11 , 1990 , less than six months after the baltic way , lithuania declared independence , the first soviet state to do so .

the multifaceted invasion involved attacks along the entire eastern front , from finland in the north to the black sea in the south . the eventual failure of barbarossa , the largest military operation in history , became the turning point in the nazi 's fortunes . after germany was defeated in 1945 , soviet troops remained in occupation across much of eastern europe , and the baltic states .
what the allies did n't give stalin as war reparations , he annexed anyway , until ending up with much of what the soviets had claimed in the secret protocols of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . details of the secret protocols dividing up europe surfaced during the nuremberg trials in 1945-46 even though the soviets continued to deny their existence .
after the war , they justified their occupation of the baltic states by claiming that the parliaments of latvia , lithuania and estonia had petitioned to join the ussr . the baltic pro-independence movement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two million balts protested against the soviet union in 1989 in the early 1980s , as the soviet union embraced glasnost , the baltic states ' pro-independence protest movement gathered strength .

two million lithuanians , latvians and estonians linked arms to form a 671-kilometer -lrb- 417-mile -rrb- long human chain , connecting the three capitals , vilnius , riga and tallinn . the baltic pro-independence movements issued a joint declaration to the world and european community , condemning the molotov – ribbentrop pact , and calling it a criminal act . the declaration said independence for the baltics was a question of " inalienable human rights , " and accused the european community of ignoring the last colonies of the hitler – stalin era . in december 1989 , soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and the soviet congress of people 's deputies signed a report condemning the molotov-ribbentrop pact . on march 11 , 1990 , less than six months after the baltic way , lithuania declared independence , the first soviet state to do so .

after months of negotiations , his foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop flew to moscow and met with his counterpart vyacheslav molotov .
on aug .
23 , they signed an agreement , most commonly known as the molotov-ribbentrop pact . the negotiations took place in secret , at the same time as france and britain negotiated an alliance with stalin . though primarily a non-aggression pact , the document incorporated some economic components . provisions under the agreement included : arbitration in the event of a disagreement , consultation and neutrality if either russia or germany went to war against a third power .
the pact also stipulated that neither party could join a group or alliance " directly or indirectly aimed at the other . " only after germany 's defeat in 1945 did details of the secret protocols of the pact emerge . bildunterschrift : as this 1939 cartoon shows , many saw stalin as the butcher of the baltic states secret protocols envisaged carve-up of europe the protocols divided europe into german and soviet spheres of control .
latvia and estonia were to be in the soviet sphere .
lithuania , the part that was adjacent to east prussia , was to come under german control .
later the protocol was altered , assigning lithuania to the soviets as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler and stalin helped each other prepare for wwii to the north , finland was to be carved off for stalin .
poland was to be partitioned , and soon after the pact was signed , both powers invaded the country to take their respective pieces . immediately afterwards , russia invaded finland , but the red army were repelled in the famous " winter war " of 1939/1940 .
after holding their ground for four months and inflicting terrible casualties on the russians , the heavily outnumbered finns were militarily exhausted , and they sued for peace . stalin annexed finland 's eastern province of karelia , which led eventually to finland and germany signing an alliance .
that alliance was to become a key element in hitler 's invasion of russia . quarrelling between germany and the soviets escalated during the summer of 1940 , as the soviet union refused to fulfill its economic commitments under the molotov-ribbentrop pact , and both parties carried out military operations without informing the other . the german war effort was heavily reliant on the russian raw materials that the pact had aimed to secure , and hitler 's plans were increasingly frustrated .

but 2009 is also giving pecs a reason to celebrate , as diocese pecs plans to toast its 1000-year anniversary . one of the main landmarks in the western hungarian town of pecs is the church of st. maria , in the main square .
the building alone speaks volumes about the long history of this turbulent region . the now-church was once a turkish mosque - which in turn was built on the remains of a 16th century romanesque church .
today , it features features a grand green-copper cupola , prayer niches , keel-arch windows , and the remains of an ottoman painting that includes verses from the koran . from church , to mosque , and back again bishop mihaly mayer says that many catholics still call the downtown church a mosque . “ i always say : ‘ you can say that but its not entirely true , ’ ” mayer said .
“ half of it was built as a christian church , and if you look back even earlier , it was the holy church of bartholomew that was built as a mosque .
i stress that because no one ever mentioned this cathedral in the communist past . ” bishop mayer has been at the head of the pecs diocese for 20 years .
he remembers how the church was stifled under hungary ’ s communist rule , despite the long christian tradition in the region . several decades ago , early christian burial chambers were discovered beneath the church ; they date back to the fourth century , when pecs was a roman city .
today , these are a designated unesco world heritage site . the dioscese of pecs is also referred to as the diocese quinque ecclesia , a name that refers to the fact that the city was originally built around five old christian chapels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city is busy planning for 2010 , but 2009 need not be forgotten these five chapels no longer exist , and no one knows where they once stood .
what is clear is that king stephan founded of the diocese , laying the ground stone for the ancient cathedral in 1009 .
the church was changed and destroyed many times over in the ensuing years . the neo-romanesque cathedral , with its green copper domed roof and four corner towers that rise above the city , was built between 1882 and 1891 .
in places , the cathedral shows signs of its former life as a mosque .
this is especially true in the reliefs in the passageway leading to the lower church , where the heads of the statues of apostles have been broken off . for the 1000th anniversary of the diocese , the church has been restored both inside and out .
the restoration was helped along with state funding , and the state is expected to pick up the tab for the anniversary celebrations as well .
some 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 358,000 -rrb- in culture capital 2010 financing are expected - though by the end of july none of that money had made its way to the diocese , meyer complained . hopes for cultural cooperation in fact , given the number of active construction sites in the city , it appears that pecs is having problems putting its ambitious culture capital plans into action .
nonetheless , the diocese is kicking off its anniversary year with a special church service .
and there has been church-to-church contact between the diocese in pecs and in the city of essen , germany - along with istanbul , another cultural capital for 2010 . " we had a music school from essen here recently .
and i wrote to the auxiliary bishop there that we should make a partnership between the catholic school in pecs and the music school , " meyer said . " it would be nice if we could finish up that agreement in 2010 and take the next step in our relationship .

this is especially true in the reliefs in the passageway leading to the lower church , where the heads of the statues of apostles have been broken off . for the 1000th anniversary of the diocese , the church has been restored both inside and out .
the restoration was helped along with state funding , and the state is expected to pick up the tab for the anniversary celebrations as well .
some 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 358,000 -rrb- in culture capital 2010 financing are expected - though by the end of july none of that money had made its way to the diocese , meyer complained . hopes for cultural cooperation in fact , given the number of active construction sites in the city , it appears that pecs is having problems putting its ambitious culture capital plans into action .
nonetheless , the diocese is kicking off its anniversary year with a special church service .
and there has been church-to-church contact between the diocese in pecs and in the city of essen , germany - along with istanbul , another cultural capital for 2010 . " we had a music school from essen here recently .
and i wrote to the auxiliary bishop there that we should make a partnership between the catholic school in pecs and the music school , " meyer said . " it would be nice if we could finish up that agreement in 2010 and take the next step in our relationship .
so we can stress the idea that our students are n't going to europe or that european students are n't coming to us , but that we live in europe . sigrid hoff -lrb- jen -rrb- editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after months of negotiations , his foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop flew to moscow and met with his counterpart vyacheslav molotov .
on aug .
23 , they signed an agreement , most commonly known as the molotov-ribbentrop pact . the negotiations took place in secret , at the same time as france and britain negotiated an alliance with stalin . though primarily a non-aggression pact , the document incorporated some economic components . provisions under the agreement included : arbitration in the event of a disagreement , consultation and neutrality if either russia or germany went to war against a third power .
the pact also stipulated that neither party could join a group or alliance " directly or indirectly aimed at the other . " only after germany 's defeat in 1945 did details of the secret protocols of the pact emerge . bildunterschrift : as this 1939 cartoon shows , many saw stalin as the butcher of the baltic states secret protocols envisaged carve-up of europe the protocols divided europe into german and soviet spheres of control .
latvia and estonia were to be in the soviet sphere .
lithuania , the part that was adjacent to east prussia , was to come under german control .
later the protocol was altered , assigning lithuania to the soviets as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler and stalin helped each other prepare for wwii to the north , finland was to be carved off for stalin .
poland was to be partitioned , and soon after the pact was signed , both powers invaded the country to take their respective pieces . immediately afterwards , russia invaded finland , but the red army were repelled in the famous " winter war " of 1939/1940 .
after holding their ground for four months and inflicting terrible casualties on the russians , the heavily outnumbered finns were militarily exhausted , and they sued for peace . stalin annexed finland 's eastern province of karelia , which led eventually to finland and germany signing an alliance .
that alliance was to become a key element in hitler 's invasion of russia . quarrelling between germany and the soviets escalated during the summer of 1940 , as the soviet union refused to fulfill its economic commitments under the molotov-ribbentrop pact , and both parties carried out military operations without informing the other . the german war effort was heavily reliant on the russian raw materials that the pact had aimed to secure , and hitler 's plans were increasingly frustrated .
in august , nazi germany annexed part of romania to gain access to oil fields . hitler tears up pact , invades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany attacked the soviet union in 1941 on june 22 , 1941 , hitler abrogated the molotov-ribbentrop pact and launched operation barbarossa .
the multifaceted invasion involved attacks along the entire eastern front , from finland in the north to the black sea in the south . the eventual failure of barbarossa , the largest military operation in history , became the turning point in the nazi 's fortunes . after germany was defeated in 1945 , soviet troops remained in occupation across much of eastern europe , and the baltic states .
what the allies did n't give stalin as war reparations , he annexed anyway , until ending up with much of what the soviets had claimed in the secret protocols of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . details of the secret protocols dividing up europe surfaced during the nuremberg trials in 1945-46 even though the soviets continued to deny their existence .
after the war , they justified their occupation of the baltic states by claiming that the parliaments of latvia , lithuania and estonia had petitioned to join the ussr . the baltic pro-independence movement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two million balts protested against the soviet union in 1989 in the early 1980s , as the soviet union embraced glasnost , the baltic states ' pro-independence protest movement gathered strength .
on aug .
23 , 1986 , large street protests were held across latvia , lithuania and estonia to mark the anniversary of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . in 1989 , the fourth consecutive year of the protests , and the 50th anniversary of the pact , an especially large protest was planned , resulting in the so-called " baltic way " .
two million lithuanians , latvians and estonians linked arms to form a 671-kilometer -lrb- 417-mile -rrb- long human chain , connecting the three capitals , vilnius , riga and tallinn . the baltic pro-independence movements issued a joint declaration to the world and european community , condemning the molotov – ribbentrop pact , and calling it a criminal act . the declaration said independence for the baltics was a question of " inalienable human rights , " and accused the european community of ignoring the last colonies of the hitler – stalin era . in december 1989 , soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and the soviet congress of people 's deputies signed a report condemning the molotov-ribbentrop pact . on march 11 , 1990 , less than six months after the baltic way , lithuania declared independence , the first soviet state to do so .
within a year , all three baltic states had declared independence and were internationally recognized as sovereign states . ch / av / afp / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but 2009 is also giving pecs a reason to celebrate , as diocese pecs plans to toast its 1000-year anniversary . one of the main landmarks in the western hungarian town of pecs is the church of st. maria , in the main square .
the building alone speaks volumes about the long history of this turbulent region . the now-church was once a turkish mosque - which in turn was built on the remains of a 16th century romanesque church .
today , it features features a grand green-copper cupola , prayer niches , keel-arch windows , and the remains of an ottoman painting that includes verses from the koran . from church , to mosque , and back again bishop mihaly mayer says that many catholics still call the downtown church a mosque . “ i always say : ‘ you can say that but its not entirely true , ’ ” mayer said .
“ half of it was built as a christian church , and if you look back even earlier , it was the holy church of bartholomew that was built as a mosque .
i stress that because no one ever mentioned this cathedral in the communist past . ” bishop mayer has been at the head of the pecs diocese for 20 years .
he remembers how the church was stifled under hungary ’ s communist rule , despite the long christian tradition in the region . several decades ago , early christian burial chambers were discovered beneath the church ; they date back to the fourth century , when pecs was a roman city .
today , these are a designated unesco world heritage site . the dioscese of pecs is also referred to as the diocese quinque ecclesia , a name that refers to the fact that the city was originally built around five old christian chapels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city is busy planning for 2010 , but 2009 need not be forgotten these five chapels no longer exist , and no one knows where they once stood .
what is clear is that king stephan founded of the diocese , laying the ground stone for the ancient cathedral in 1009 .
the church was changed and destroyed many times over in the ensuing years . the neo-romanesque cathedral , with its green copper domed roof and four corner towers that rise above the city , was built between 1882 and 1891 .
in places , the cathedral shows signs of its former life as a mosque .
this is especially true in the reliefs in the passageway leading to the lower church , where the heads of the statues of apostles have been broken off . for the 1000th anniversary of the diocese , the church has been restored both inside and out .
the restoration was helped along with state funding , and the state is expected to pick up the tab for the anniversary celebrations as well .
some 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 358,000 -rrb- in culture capital 2010 financing are expected - though by the end of july none of that money had made its way to the diocese , meyer complained . hopes for cultural cooperation in fact , given the number of active construction sites in the city , it appears that pecs is having problems putting its ambitious culture capital plans into action .
nonetheless , the diocese is kicking off its anniversary year with a special church service .
and there has been church-to-church contact between the diocese in pecs and in the city of essen , germany - along with istanbul , another cultural capital for 2010 . " we had a music school from essen here recently .
and i wrote to the auxiliary bishop there that we should make a partnership between the catholic school in pecs and the music school , " meyer said . " it would be nice if we could finish up that agreement in 2010 and take the next step in our relationship .

but 2009 is also giving pecs a reason to celebrate , as diocese pecs plans to toast its 1000-year anniversary . one of the main landmarks in the western hungarian town of pecs is the church of st. maria , in the main square .
the building alone speaks volumes about the long history of this turbulent region . the now-church was once a turkish mosque - which in turn was built on the remains of a 16th century romanesque church .
today , it features features a grand green-copper cupola , prayer niches , keel-arch windows , and the remains of an ottoman painting that includes verses from the koran . from church , to mosque , and back again bishop mihaly mayer says that many catholics still call the downtown church a mosque . “ i always say : ‘ you can say that but its not entirely true , ’ ” mayer said .
“ half of it was built as a christian church , and if you look back even earlier , it was the holy church of bartholomew that was built as a mosque .
i stress that because no one ever mentioned this cathedral in the communist past . ” bishop mayer has been at the head of the pecs diocese for 20 years .
he remembers how the church was stifled under hungary ’ s communist rule , despite the long christian tradition in the region . several decades ago , early christian burial chambers were discovered beneath the church ; they date back to the fourth century , when pecs was a roman city .
today , these are a designated unesco world heritage site . the dioscese of pecs is also referred to as the diocese quinque ecclesia , a name that refers to the fact that the city was originally built around five old christian chapels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city is busy planning for 2010 , but 2009 need not be forgotten these five chapels no longer exist , and no one knows where they once stood .
what is clear is that king stephan founded of the diocese , laying the ground stone for the ancient cathedral in 1009 .
the church was changed and destroyed many times over in the ensuing years . the neo-romanesque cathedral , with its green copper domed roof and four corner towers that rise above the city , was built between 1882 and 1891 .
in places , the cathedral shows signs of its former life as a mosque .
this is especially true in the reliefs in the passageway leading to the lower church , where the heads of the statues of apostles have been broken off . for the 1000th anniversary of the diocese , the church has been restored both inside and out .
the restoration was helped along with state funding , and the state is expected to pick up the tab for the anniversary celebrations as well .
some 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 358,000 -rrb- in culture capital 2010 financing are expected - though by the end of july none of that money had made its way to the diocese , meyer complained . hopes for cultural cooperation in fact , given the number of active construction sites in the city , it appears that pecs is having problems putting its ambitious culture capital plans into action .
nonetheless , the diocese is kicking off its anniversary year with a special church service .
and there has been church-to-church contact between the diocese in pecs and in the city of essen , germany - along with istanbul , another cultural capital for 2010 . " we had a music school from essen here recently .
and i wrote to the auxiliary bishop there that we should make a partnership between the catholic school in pecs and the music school , " meyer said . " it would be nice if we could finish up that agreement in 2010 and take the next step in our relationship .
so we can stress the idea that our students are n't going to europe or that european students are n't coming to us , but that we live in europe . sigrid hoff -lrb- jen -rrb- editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but 2009 is also giving pecs a reason to celebrate , as diocese pecs plans to toast its 1000-year anniversary . one of the main landmarks in the western hungarian town of pecs is the church of st. maria , in the main square .
the building alone speaks volumes about the long history of this turbulent region . the now-church was once a turkish mosque - which in turn was built on the remains of a 16th century romanesque church .
today , it features features a grand green-copper cupola , prayer niches , keel-arch windows , and the remains of an ottoman painting that includes verses from the koran . from church , to mosque , and back again bishop mihaly mayer says that many catholics still call the downtown church a mosque . “ i always say : ‘ you can say that but its not entirely true , ’ ” mayer said .
“ half of it was built as a christian church , and if you look back even earlier , it was the holy church of bartholomew that was built as a mosque .
i stress that because no one ever mentioned this cathedral in the communist past . ” bishop mayer has been at the head of the pecs diocese for 20 years .
he remembers how the church was stifled under hungary ’ s communist rule , despite the long christian tradition in the region . several decades ago , early christian burial chambers were discovered beneath the church ; they date back to the fourth century , when pecs was a roman city .
today , these are a designated unesco world heritage site . the dioscese of pecs is also referred to as the diocese quinque ecclesia , a name that refers to the fact that the city was originally built around five old christian chapels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city is busy planning for 2010 , but 2009 need not be forgotten these five chapels no longer exist , and no one knows where they once stood .
what is clear is that king stephan founded of the diocese , laying the ground stone for the ancient cathedral in 1009 .
the church was changed and destroyed many times over in the ensuing years . the neo-romanesque cathedral , with its green copper domed roof and four corner towers that rise above the city , was built between 1882 and 1891 .
in places , the cathedral shows signs of its former life as a mosque .
this is especially true in the reliefs in the passageway leading to the lower church , where the heads of the statues of apostles have been broken off . for the 1000th anniversary of the diocese , the church has been restored both inside and out .
the restoration was helped along with state funding , and the state is expected to pick up the tab for the anniversary celebrations as well .
some 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 358,000 -rrb- in culture capital 2010 financing are expected - though by the end of july none of that money had made its way to the diocese , meyer complained . hopes for cultural cooperation in fact , given the number of active construction sites in the city , it appears that pecs is having problems putting its ambitious culture capital plans into action .
nonetheless , the diocese is kicking off its anniversary year with a special church service .
and there has been church-to-church contact between the diocese in pecs and in the city of essen , germany - along with istanbul , another cultural capital for 2010 . " we had a music school from essen here recently .
and i wrote to the auxiliary bishop there that we should make a partnership between the catholic school in pecs and the music school , " meyer said . " it would be nice if we could finish up that agreement in 2010 and take the next step in our relationship .

today , it features features a grand green-copper cupola , prayer niches , keel-arch windows , and the remains of an ottoman painting that includes verses from the koran . from church , to mosque , and back again bishop mihaly mayer says that many catholics still call the downtown church a mosque . “ i always say : ‘ you can say that but its not entirely true , ’ ” mayer said .
“ half of it was built as a christian church , and if you look back even earlier , it was the holy church of bartholomew that was built as a mosque .
i stress that because no one ever mentioned this cathedral in the communist past . ” bishop mayer has been at the head of the pecs diocese for 20 years .
he remembers how the church was stifled under hungary ’ s communist rule , despite the long christian tradition in the region . several decades ago , early christian burial chambers were discovered beneath the church ; they date back to the fourth century , when pecs was a roman city .
today , these are a designated unesco world heritage site . the dioscese of pecs is also referred to as the diocese quinque ecclesia , a name that refers to the fact that the city was originally built around five old christian chapels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city is busy planning for 2010 , but 2009 need not be forgotten these five chapels no longer exist , and no one knows where they once stood .
what is clear is that king stephan founded of the diocese , laying the ground stone for the ancient cathedral in 1009 .
the church was changed and destroyed many times over in the ensuing years . the neo-romanesque cathedral , with its green copper domed roof and four corner towers that rise above the city , was built between 1882 and 1891 .
in places , the cathedral shows signs of its former life as a mosque .
this is especially true in the reliefs in the passageway leading to the lower church , where the heads of the statues of apostles have been broken off . for the 1000th anniversary of the diocese , the church has been restored both inside and out .
the restoration was helped along with state funding , and the state is expected to pick up the tab for the anniversary celebrations as well .
some 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 358,000 -rrb- in culture capital 2010 financing are expected - though by the end of july none of that money had made its way to the diocese , meyer complained . hopes for cultural cooperation in fact , given the number of active construction sites in the city , it appears that pecs is having problems putting its ambitious culture capital plans into action .
nonetheless , the diocese is kicking off its anniversary year with a special church service .
and there has been church-to-church contact between the diocese in pecs and in the city of essen , germany - along with istanbul , another cultural capital for 2010 . " we had a music school from essen here recently .
and i wrote to the auxiliary bishop there that we should make a partnership between the catholic school in pecs and the music school , " meyer said . " it would be nice if we could finish up that agreement in 2010 and take the next step in our relationship .
so we can stress the idea that our students are n't going to europe or that european students are n't coming to us , but that we live in europe . sigrid hoff -lrb- jen -rrb- editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after months of negotiations , his foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop flew to moscow and met with his counterpart vyacheslav molotov .
on aug .
23 , they signed an agreement , most commonly known as the molotov-ribbentrop pact . the negotiations took place in secret , at the same time as france and britain negotiated an alliance with stalin . though primarily a non-aggression pact , the document incorporated some economic components . provisions under the agreement included : arbitration in the event of a disagreement , consultation and neutrality if either russia or germany went to war against a third power .
the pact also stipulated that neither party could join a group or alliance " directly or indirectly aimed at the other . " only after germany 's defeat in 1945 did details of the secret protocols of the pact emerge . bildunterschrift : as this 1939 cartoon shows , many saw stalin as the butcher of the baltic states secret protocols envisaged carve-up of europe the protocols divided europe into german and soviet spheres of control .
latvia and estonia were to be in the soviet sphere .
lithuania , the part that was adjacent to east prussia , was to come under german control .
later the protocol was altered , assigning lithuania to the soviets as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler and stalin helped each other prepare for wwii to the north , finland was to be carved off for stalin .
poland was to be partitioned , and soon after the pact was signed , both powers invaded the country to take their respective pieces . immediately afterwards , russia invaded finland , but the red army were repelled in the famous " winter war " of 1939/1940 .
after holding their ground for four months and inflicting terrible casualties on the russians , the heavily outnumbered finns were militarily exhausted , and they sued for peace . stalin annexed finland 's eastern province of karelia , which led eventually to finland and germany signing an alliance .
that alliance was to become a key element in hitler 's invasion of russia . quarrelling between germany and the soviets escalated during the summer of 1940 , as the soviet union refused to fulfill its economic commitments under the molotov-ribbentrop pact , and both parties carried out military operations without informing the other . the german war effort was heavily reliant on the russian raw materials that the pact had aimed to secure , and hitler 's plans were increasingly frustrated .
in august , nazi germany annexed part of romania to gain access to oil fields . hitler tears up pact , invades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany attacked the soviet union in 1941 on june 22 , 1941 , hitler abrogated the molotov-ribbentrop pact and launched operation barbarossa .
the multifaceted invasion involved attacks along the entire eastern front , from finland in the north to the black sea in the south . the eventual failure of barbarossa , the largest military operation in history , became the turning point in the nazi 's fortunes . after germany was defeated in 1945 , soviet troops remained in occupation across much of eastern europe , and the baltic states .
what the allies did n't give stalin as war reparations , he annexed anyway , until ending up with much of what the soviets had claimed in the secret protocols of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . details of the secret protocols dividing up europe surfaced during the nuremberg trials in 1945-46 even though the soviets continued to deny their existence .
after the war , they justified their occupation of the baltic states by claiming that the parliaments of latvia , lithuania and estonia had petitioned to join the ussr . the baltic pro-independence movement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two million balts protested against the soviet union in 1989 in the early 1980s , as the soviet union embraced glasnost , the baltic states ' pro-independence protest movement gathered strength .
on aug .
23 , 1986 , large street protests were held across latvia , lithuania and estonia to mark the anniversary of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . in 1989 , the fourth consecutive year of the protests , and the 50th anniversary of the pact , an especially large protest was planned , resulting in the so-called " baltic way " .
two million lithuanians , latvians and estonians linked arms to form a 671-kilometer -lrb- 417-mile -rrb- long human chain , connecting the three capitals , vilnius , riga and tallinn . the baltic pro-independence movements issued a joint declaration to the world and european community , condemning the molotov – ribbentrop pact , and calling it a criminal act . the declaration said independence for the baltics was a question of " inalienable human rights , " and accused the european community of ignoring the last colonies of the hitler – stalin era . in december 1989 , soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and the soviet congress of people 's deputies signed a report condemning the molotov-ribbentrop pact . on march 11 , 1990 , less than six months after the baltic way , lithuania declared independence , the first soviet state to do so .
within a year , all three baltic states had declared independence and were internationally recognized as sovereign states . ch / av / afp / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after months of negotiations , his foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop flew to moscow and met with his counterpart vyacheslav molotov .
on aug .
23 , they signed an agreement , most commonly known as the molotov-ribbentrop pact . the negotiations took place in secret , at the same time as france and britain negotiated an alliance with stalin . though primarily a non-aggression pact , the document incorporated some economic components . provisions under the agreement included : arbitration in the event of a disagreement , consultation and neutrality if either russia or germany went to war against a third power .
the pact also stipulated that neither party could join a group or alliance " directly or indirectly aimed at the other . " only after germany 's defeat in 1945 did details of the secret protocols of the pact emerge . bildunterschrift : as this 1939 cartoon shows , many saw stalin as the butcher of the baltic states secret protocols envisaged carve-up of europe the protocols divided europe into german and soviet spheres of control .
latvia and estonia were to be in the soviet sphere .
lithuania , the part that was adjacent to east prussia , was to come under german control .
later the protocol was altered , assigning lithuania to the soviets as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler and stalin helped each other prepare for wwii to the north , finland was to be carved off for stalin .
poland was to be partitioned , and soon after the pact was signed , both powers invaded the country to take their respective pieces . immediately afterwards , russia invaded finland , but the red army were repelled in the famous " winter war " of 1939/1940 .
after holding their ground for four months and inflicting terrible casualties on the russians , the heavily outnumbered finns were militarily exhausted , and they sued for peace . stalin annexed finland 's eastern province of karelia , which led eventually to finland and germany signing an alliance .
that alliance was to become a key element in hitler 's invasion of russia . quarrelling between germany and the soviets escalated during the summer of 1940 , as the soviet union refused to fulfill its economic commitments under the molotov-ribbentrop pact , and both parties carried out military operations without informing the other . the german war effort was heavily reliant on the russian raw materials that the pact had aimed to secure , and hitler 's plans were increasingly frustrated .
in august , nazi germany annexed part of romania to gain access to oil fields . hitler tears up pact , invades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany attacked the soviet union in 1941 on june 22 , 1941 , hitler abrogated the molotov-ribbentrop pact and launched operation barbarossa .
the multifaceted invasion involved attacks along the entire eastern front , from finland in the north to the black sea in the south . the eventual failure of barbarossa , the largest military operation in history , became the turning point in the nazi 's fortunes . after germany was defeated in 1945 , soviet troops remained in occupation across much of eastern europe , and the baltic states .
what the allies did n't give stalin as war reparations , he annexed anyway , until ending up with much of what the soviets had claimed in the secret protocols of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . details of the secret protocols dividing up europe surfaced during the nuremberg trials in 1945-46 even though the soviets continued to deny their existence .
after the war , they justified their occupation of the baltic states by claiming that the parliaments of latvia , lithuania and estonia had petitioned to join the ussr . the baltic pro-independence movement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two million balts protested against the soviet union in 1989 in the early 1980s , as the soviet union embraced glasnost , the baltic states ' pro-independence protest movement gathered strength .
on aug .
23 , 1986 , large street protests were held across latvia , lithuania and estonia to mark the anniversary of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . in 1989 , the fourth consecutive year of the protests , and the 50th anniversary of the pact , an especially large protest was planned , resulting in the so-called " baltic way " .
two million lithuanians , latvians and estonians linked arms to form a 671-kilometer -lrb- 417-mile -rrb- long human chain , connecting the three capitals , vilnius , riga and tallinn . the baltic pro-independence movements issued a joint declaration to the world and european community , condemning the molotov – ribbentrop pact , and calling it a criminal act . the declaration said independence for the baltics was a question of " inalienable human rights , " and accused the european community of ignoring the last colonies of the hitler – stalin era . in december 1989 , soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and the soviet congress of people 's deputies signed a report condemning the molotov-ribbentrop pact . on march 11 , 1990 , less than six months after the baltic way , lithuania declared independence , the first soviet state to do so .

after months of negotiations , his foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop flew to moscow and met with his counterpart vyacheslav molotov .
on aug .
23 , they signed an agreement , most commonly known as the molotov-ribbentrop pact . the negotiations took place in secret , at the same time as france and britain negotiated an alliance with stalin . though primarily a non-aggression pact , the document incorporated some economic components . provisions under the agreement included : arbitration in the event of a disagreement , consultation and neutrality if either russia or germany went to war against a third power .
the pact also stipulated that neither party could join a group or alliance " directly or indirectly aimed at the other . " only after germany 's defeat in 1945 did details of the secret protocols of the pact emerge . bildunterschrift : as this 1939 cartoon shows , many saw stalin as the butcher of the baltic states secret protocols envisaged carve-up of europe the protocols divided europe into german and soviet spheres of control .
latvia and estonia were to be in the soviet sphere .
lithuania , the part that was adjacent to east prussia , was to come under german control .
later the protocol was altered , assigning lithuania to the soviets as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler and stalin helped each other prepare for wwii to the north , finland was to be carved off for stalin .
poland was to be partitioned , and soon after the pact was signed , both powers invaded the country to take their respective pieces . immediately afterwards , russia invaded finland , but the red army were repelled in the famous " winter war " of 1939/1940 .
after holding their ground for four months and inflicting terrible casualties on the russians , the heavily outnumbered finns were militarily exhausted , and they sued for peace . stalin annexed finland 's eastern province of karelia , which led eventually to finland and germany signing an alliance .
that alliance was to become a key element in hitler 's invasion of russia . quarrelling between germany and the soviets escalated during the summer of 1940 , as the soviet union refused to fulfill its economic commitments under the molotov-ribbentrop pact , and both parties carried out military operations without informing the other . the german war effort was heavily reliant on the russian raw materials that the pact had aimed to secure , and hitler 's plans were increasingly frustrated .
in august , nazi germany annexed part of romania to gain access to oil fields . hitler tears up pact , invades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany attacked the soviet union in 1941 on june 22 , 1941 , hitler abrogated the molotov-ribbentrop pact and launched operation barbarossa .
the multifaceted invasion involved attacks along the entire eastern front , from finland in the north to the black sea in the south . the eventual failure of barbarossa , the largest military operation in history , became the turning point in the nazi 's fortunes . after germany was defeated in 1945 , soviet troops remained in occupation across much of eastern europe , and the baltic states .
what the allies did n't give stalin as war reparations , he annexed anyway , until ending up with much of what the soviets had claimed in the secret protocols of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . details of the secret protocols dividing up europe surfaced during the nuremberg trials in 1945-46 even though the soviets continued to deny their existence .
after the war , they justified their occupation of the baltic states by claiming that the parliaments of latvia , lithuania and estonia had petitioned to join the ussr . the baltic pro-independence movement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two million balts protested against the soviet union in 1989 in the early 1980s , as the soviet union embraced glasnost , the baltic states ' pro-independence protest movement gathered strength .
on aug .
23 , 1986 , large street protests were held across latvia , lithuania and estonia to mark the anniversary of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . in 1989 , the fourth consecutive year of the protests , and the 50th anniversary of the pact , an especially large protest was planned , resulting in the so-called " baltic way " .
two million lithuanians , latvians and estonians linked arms to form a 671-kilometer -lrb- 417-mile -rrb- long human chain , connecting the three capitals , vilnius , riga and tallinn . the baltic pro-independence movements issued a joint declaration to the world and european community , condemning the molotov – ribbentrop pact , and calling it a criminal act . the declaration said independence for the baltics was a question of " inalienable human rights , " and accused the european community of ignoring the last colonies of the hitler – stalin era . in december 1989 , soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and the soviet congress of people 's deputies signed a report condemning the molotov-ribbentrop pact . on march 11 , 1990 , less than six months after the baltic way , lithuania declared independence , the first soviet state to do so .
within a year , all three baltic states had declared independence and were internationally recognized as sovereign states . ch / av / afp / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 23.08.2009 bayern munich 's indifferent start becomes a nightmare großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz goalscorer aristide bance finished off bayern bayern 's new coach louis van gaal is still waiting for his first bundesliga win since taking charge in july .
he was also visibly angry when he faced the press after watching his team lose 2-1 to newly-promoted mainz . three games into the new bundesliga season bayern munich remain without a win after goals saturday from andreas ivanschitz and aristide bance helped newly-promoted mainz 05 to a shock 2-1 victory over the german giants .
meanwhile as a bayern team missing franck ribery and luca toni continued to struggle under new coach louis van gaal , bayer leverkusen maintained their strong start and go to the top on goal difference courtesy of a 5-0 mauling of sc freiburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's tranquillo barnetta leverkusen are the new pacesetters with seven points from three games , level with schalke 04 , who dropped their first points of the season when they were held to a goalless draw on friday at hoffenheim .
vfb stuttgart and borussia dortmund both lost ground on the top of the table after playing out a 1-1 draw while a surprise victory for mainz sees them move up to fourth on five points , level with eintracht frankfurt , who played out a scoreless draw with cologne .
champions vfl wolfsburg sit third on six points ahead of their visit to sv hamburg on sunday while munich now languishes in 12th on just two points .
bayern 's boss not happy " that was very disappointing and i am asking myself what we have done incorrectly in our preparations , " said a notably disappointed van gaal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's louis van gaal is not happy mainz were every bit bayern 's equals in the early stages and took a deserved lead on 25 minutes when austrian ivanschitz sent in a shot from 25 metres that slipped in under bayern goalkeeper michael rensing 's outstretched arm .
" that was absolutely terrible and a serious wake-up call for us .
we should n't have lost like that , " rensing said .
things got even worse for louis van gaal 's side seven minutes before the break when bance rose above daniel van buyten to head home from 10 metres and make it 2-0 to thomas tuchel 's side .
with bayern now looking to pull back from a two-goal deficit , van gaal immediately brought on croatian striker ivica olic for midfielder danijel pranijic .
" normally i would n't make a substitution so early but i could have taken off a lot more players , " said an angry van gaal .
mainz did give bayern a lifeline on 47 minutes when nikolce noveski headed a thomas mueller cross into his own net and mueller subsequently had a glorious opportunity to equalize on the hour-mark but his header of van buyten 's pinpoint cross was wide .
van gaal brought on jose sosa for miroslav klose with 18 minutes left as bayern continued to press for an equalizer but the argentine could n't make good a free-kick opportunity four minutes later .
mario gomez hit the side-netting as bayern got ever more desperate but mainz held on for a stunning win .
elsewhere in the league while bayern struggled , bayer leverkusen went top of the table after three games when they hammered freiburg .
" for us it was a very strange game , because freiburg were clearly the better team during the first 35 minutes , " said bayer coach jupp heynckes .
stefan kiessling scored his third goal of the season on 35 minutes to open the scoring at freiburg 's badenova stadium , firing home after being found by simon rolfes .
swiss international tranquillo barnetta doubled leverkusen 's lead two minutes after the restart with a nicely-struck shot from the edge of the area , while a further brace from eren deriyok , sandwiched by barnetta 's second , completed the rout .
" being top of the table means nothing to me , " said leverkusen 's jupp heynckes .
" the way we played in the first half was still unacceptable . "
stuttgart lost ground despite coming back from a goal down at borussia dortmund to salvage a 1-1 draw .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's georg niedermeier , center , celebrates his goal nelson valdez put dortmund ahead on 27 minutes , nuri sahin setting the paraguayan up to finish clinically , placing the ball beyond the reach of jens lehmann .
julian schieber could have drawn stuttgart level on the stroke of half-time after playing a combination with cacau but dortmund goalkeeper roman weidenfeller saved the 20-year-old 's shot well .
dortmund paid the price almost immediately after the restart as georg niedermeier headed in from five metres .
in the day 's other game , jiri stajner scored twice and could also afford to miss a penalty as hanover 96 beat nuremberg 2-0 .

he was also visibly angry when he faced the press after watching his team lose 2-1 to newly-promoted mainz . three games into the new bundesliga season bayern munich remain without a win after goals saturday from andreas ivanschitz and aristide bance helped newly-promoted mainz 05 to a shock 2-1 victory over the german giants .
meanwhile as a bayern team missing franck ribery and luca toni continued to struggle under new coach louis van gaal , bayer leverkusen maintained their strong start and go to the top on goal difference courtesy of a 5-0 mauling of sc freiburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's tranquillo barnetta leverkusen are the new pacesetters with seven points from three games , level with schalke 04 , who dropped their first points of the season when they were held to a goalless draw on friday at hoffenheim .
vfb stuttgart and borussia dortmund both lost ground on the top of the table after playing out a 1-1 draw while a surprise victory for mainz sees them move up to fourth on five points , level with eintracht frankfurt , who played out a scoreless draw with cologne .
champions vfl wolfsburg sit third on six points ahead of their visit to sv hamburg on sunday while munich now languishes in 12th on just two points .
bayern 's boss not happy " that was very disappointing and i am asking myself what we have done incorrectly in our preparations , " said a notably disappointed van gaal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's louis van gaal is not happy mainz were every bit bayern 's equals in the early stages and took a deserved lead on 25 minutes when austrian ivanschitz sent in a shot from 25 metres that slipped in under bayern goalkeeper michael rensing 's outstretched arm .
" that was absolutely terrible and a serious wake-up call for us .
we should n't have lost like that , " rensing said .
things got even worse for louis van gaal 's side seven minutes before the break when bance rose above daniel van buyten to head home from 10 metres and make it 2-0 to thomas tuchel 's side .
with bayern now looking to pull back from a two-goal deficit , van gaal immediately brought on croatian striker ivica olic for midfielder danijel pranijic .
" normally i would n't make a substitution so early but i could have taken off a lot more players , " said an angry van gaal .
mainz did give bayern a lifeline on 47 minutes when nikolce noveski headed a thomas mueller cross into his own net and mueller subsequently had a glorious opportunity to equalize on the hour-mark but his header of van buyten 's pinpoint cross was wide .
van gaal brought on jose sosa for miroslav klose with 18 minutes left as bayern continued to press for an equalizer but the argentine could n't make good a free-kick opportunity four minutes later .
mario gomez hit the side-netting as bayern got ever more desperate but mainz held on for a stunning win .
elsewhere in the league while bayern struggled , bayer leverkusen went top of the table after three games when they hammered freiburg .
" for us it was a very strange game , because freiburg were clearly the better team during the first 35 minutes , " said bayer coach jupp heynckes .
stefan kiessling scored his third goal of the season on 35 minutes to open the scoring at freiburg 's badenova stadium , firing home after being found by simon rolfes .
swiss international tranquillo barnetta doubled leverkusen 's lead two minutes after the restart with a nicely-struck shot from the edge of the area , while a further brace from eren deriyok , sandwiched by barnetta 's second , completed the rout .
" being top of the table means nothing to me , " said leverkusen 's jupp heynckes .
" the way we played in the first half was still unacceptable . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : 70 years since germany invaded poland , sparking wwii poland remembers the outbreak of world war ii merkel reiterates support for expellees ' memorial controversial museum planned in poland at site of first nazi invasion berlin exhibit traces german-polish ties on anniversary of nazi invasion world war ii -pipe- 23.08.2009 70 years ago , soviet-nazi pact called for division of europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german-soviet pact had wide-ranging effects by dividing europe into german and soviet spheres of influence , the molotov-ribbentrop pact gave hitler a free hand to attack western europe and consigned much of eastern europe to stalin - with tragic consequences . it was 1939 , and although europe was still at peace , storm clouds were on the horizon . german war planners had already estimated that without a steady supply of raw materials from the soviet union , germany would be hard pressed to sustain any sort of protracted conflict . the last thing hitler needed was a war with the soviets .
after months of negotiations , his foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop flew to moscow and met with his counterpart vyacheslav molotov .
on aug .
23 , they signed an agreement , most commonly known as the molotov-ribbentrop pact . the negotiations took place in secret , at the same time as france and britain negotiated an alliance with stalin . though primarily a non-aggression pact , the document incorporated some economic components . provisions under the agreement included : arbitration in the event of a disagreement , consultation and neutrality if either russia or germany went to war against a third power .
the pact also stipulated that neither party could join a group or alliance " directly or indirectly aimed at the other . " only after germany 's defeat in 1945 did details of the secret protocols of the pact emerge . bildunterschrift : as this 1939 cartoon shows , many saw stalin as the butcher of the baltic states secret protocols envisaged carve-up of europe the protocols divided europe into german and soviet spheres of control .
latvia and estonia were to be in the soviet sphere .
lithuania , the part that was adjacent to east prussia , was to come under german control .
later the protocol was altered , assigning lithuania to the soviets as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler and stalin helped each other prepare for wwii to the north , finland was to be carved off for stalin .
poland was to be partitioned , and soon after the pact was signed , both powers invaded the country to take their respective pieces . immediately afterwards , russia invaded finland , but the red army were repelled in the famous " winter war " of 1939/1940 .
after holding their ground for four months and inflicting terrible casualties on the russians , the heavily outnumbered finns were militarily exhausted , and they sued for peace . stalin annexed finland 's eastern province of karelia , which led eventually to finland and germany signing an alliance .
that alliance was to become a key element in hitler 's invasion of russia . quarrelling between germany and the soviets escalated during the summer of 1940 , as the soviet union refused to fulfill its economic commitments under the molotov-ribbentrop pact , and both parties carried out military operations without informing the other . the german war effort was heavily reliant on the russian raw materials that the pact had aimed to secure , and hitler 's plans were increasingly frustrated .
in august , nazi germany annexed part of romania to gain access to oil fields . hitler tears up pact , invades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany attacked the soviet union in 1941 on june 22 , 1941 , hitler abrogated the molotov-ribbentrop pact and launched operation barbarossa .
the multifaceted invasion involved attacks along the entire eastern front , from finland in the north to the black sea in the south . the eventual failure of barbarossa , the largest military operation in history , became the turning point in the nazi 's fortunes . after germany was defeated in 1945 , soviet troops remained in occupation across much of eastern europe , and the baltic states .
what the allies did n't give stalin as war reparations , he annexed anyway , until ending up with much of what the soviets had claimed in the secret protocols of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . details of the secret protocols dividing up europe surfaced during the nuremberg trials in 1945-46 even though the soviets continued to deny their existence .
after the war , they justified their occupation of the baltic states by claiming that the parliaments of latvia , lithuania and estonia had petitioned to join the ussr . the baltic pro-independence movement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two million balts protested against the soviet union in 1989 in the early 1980s , as the soviet union embraced glasnost , the baltic states ' pro-independence protest movement gathered strength .
on aug .
23 , 1986 , large street protests were held across latvia , lithuania and estonia to mark the anniversary of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . in 1989 , the fourth consecutive year of the protests , and the 50th anniversary of the pact , an especially large protest was planned , resulting in the so-called " baltic way " .
two million lithuanians , latvians and estonians linked arms to form a 671-kilometer -lrb- 417-mile -rrb- long human chain , connecting the three capitals , vilnius , riga and tallinn . the baltic pro-independence movements issued a joint declaration to the world and european community , condemning the molotov – ribbentrop pact , and calling it a criminal act . the declaration said independence for the baltics was a question of " inalienable human rights , " and accused the european community of ignoring the last colonies of the hitler – stalin era . in december 1989 , soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and the soviet congress of people 's deputies signed a report condemning the molotov-ribbentrop pact . on march 11 , 1990 , less than six months after the baltic way , lithuania declared independence , the first soviet state to do so .
within a year , all three baltic states had declared independence and were internationally recognized as sovereign states . ch / av / afp / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but 2009 is also giving pecs a reason to celebrate , as diocese pecs plans to toast its 1000-year anniversary . one of the main landmarks in the western hungarian town of pecs is the church of st. maria , in the main square .
the building alone speaks volumes about the long history of this turbulent region . the now-church was once a turkish mosque - which in turn was built on the remains of a 16th century romanesque church .
today , it features features a grand green-copper cupola , prayer niches , keel-arch windows , and the remains of an ottoman painting that includes verses from the koran . from church , to mosque , and back again bishop mihaly mayer says that many catholics still call the downtown church a mosque . “ i always say : ‘ you can say that but its not entirely true , ’ ” mayer said .
“ half of it was built as a christian church , and if you look back even earlier , it was the holy church of bartholomew that was built as a mosque .
i stress that because no one ever mentioned this cathedral in the communist past . ” bishop mayer has been at the head of the pecs diocese for 20 years .
he remembers how the church was stifled under hungary ’ s communist rule , despite the long christian tradition in the region . several decades ago , early christian burial chambers were discovered beneath the church ; they date back to the fourth century , when pecs was a roman city .
today , these are a designated unesco world heritage site . the dioscese of pecs is also referred to as the diocese quinque ecclesia , a name that refers to the fact that the city was originally built around five old christian chapels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city is busy planning for 2010 , but 2009 need not be forgotten these five chapels no longer exist , and no one knows where they once stood .
what is clear is that king stephan founded of the diocese , laying the ground stone for the ancient cathedral in 1009 .
the church was changed and destroyed many times over in the ensuing years . the neo-romanesque cathedral , with its green copper domed roof and four corner towers that rise above the city , was built between 1882 and 1891 .
in places , the cathedral shows signs of its former life as a mosque .
this is especially true in the reliefs in the passageway leading to the lower church , where the heads of the statues of apostles have been broken off . for the 1000th anniversary of the diocese , the church has been restored both inside and out .
the restoration was helped along with state funding , and the state is expected to pick up the tab for the anniversary celebrations as well .
some 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 358,000 -rrb- in culture capital 2010 financing are expected - though by the end of july none of that money had made its way to the diocese , meyer complained . hopes for cultural cooperation in fact , given the number of active construction sites in the city , it appears that pecs is having problems putting its ambitious culture capital plans into action .
nonetheless , the diocese is kicking off its anniversary year with a special church service .
and there has been church-to-church contact between the diocese in pecs and in the city of essen , germany - along with istanbul , another cultural capital for 2010 . " we had a music school from essen here recently .
and i wrote to the auxiliary bishop there that we should make a partnership between the catholic school in pecs and the music school , " meyer said . " it would be nice if we could finish up that agreement in 2010 and take the next step in our relationship .
so we can stress the idea that our students are n't going to europe or that european students are n't coming to us , but that we live in europe . sigrid hoff -lrb- jen -rrb- editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after months of negotiations , his foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop flew to moscow and met with his counterpart vyacheslav molotov .
on aug .
23 , they signed an agreement , most commonly known as the molotov-ribbentrop pact . the negotiations took place in secret , at the same time as france and britain negotiated an alliance with stalin . though primarily a non-aggression pact , the document incorporated some economic components . provisions under the agreement included : arbitration in the event of a disagreement , consultation and neutrality if either russia or germany went to war against a third power .
the pact also stipulated that neither party could join a group or alliance " directly or indirectly aimed at the other . " only after germany 's defeat in 1945 did details of the secret protocols of the pact emerge . bildunterschrift : as this 1939 cartoon shows , many saw stalin as the butcher of the baltic states secret protocols envisaged carve-up of europe the protocols divided europe into german and soviet spheres of control .
latvia and estonia were to be in the soviet sphere .
lithuania , the part that was adjacent to east prussia , was to come under german control .
later the protocol was altered , assigning lithuania to the soviets as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler and stalin helped each other prepare for wwii to the north , finland was to be carved off for stalin .
poland was to be partitioned , and soon after the pact was signed , both powers invaded the country to take their respective pieces . immediately afterwards , russia invaded finland , but the red army were repelled in the famous " winter war " of 1939/1940 .
after holding their ground for four months and inflicting terrible casualties on the russians , the heavily outnumbered finns were militarily exhausted , and they sued for peace . stalin annexed finland 's eastern province of karelia , which led eventually to finland and germany signing an alliance .
that alliance was to become a key element in hitler 's invasion of russia . quarrelling between germany and the soviets escalated during the summer of 1940 , as the soviet union refused to fulfill its economic commitments under the molotov-ribbentrop pact , and both parties carried out military operations without informing the other . the german war effort was heavily reliant on the russian raw materials that the pact had aimed to secure , and hitler 's plans were increasingly frustrated .
in august , nazi germany annexed part of romania to gain access to oil fields . hitler tears up pact , invades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany attacked the soviet union in 1941 on june 22 , 1941 , hitler abrogated the molotov-ribbentrop pact and launched operation barbarossa .
the multifaceted invasion involved attacks along the entire eastern front , from finland in the north to the black sea in the south . the eventual failure of barbarossa , the largest military operation in history , became the turning point in the nazi 's fortunes . after germany was defeated in 1945 , soviet troops remained in occupation across much of eastern europe , and the baltic states .
what the allies did n't give stalin as war reparations , he annexed anyway , until ending up with much of what the soviets had claimed in the secret protocols of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . details of the secret protocols dividing up europe surfaced during the nuremberg trials in 1945-46 even though the soviets continued to deny their existence .
after the war , they justified their occupation of the baltic states by claiming that the parliaments of latvia , lithuania and estonia had petitioned to join the ussr . the baltic pro-independence movement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two million balts protested against the soviet union in 1989 in the early 1980s , as the soviet union embraced glasnost , the baltic states ' pro-independence protest movement gathered strength .
on aug .
23 , 1986 , large street protests were held across latvia , lithuania and estonia to mark the anniversary of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . in 1989 , the fourth consecutive year of the protests , and the 50th anniversary of the pact , an especially large protest was planned , resulting in the so-called " baltic way " .
two million lithuanians , latvians and estonians linked arms to form a 671-kilometer -lrb- 417-mile -rrb- long human chain , connecting the three capitals , vilnius , riga and tallinn . the baltic pro-independence movements issued a joint declaration to the world and european community , condemning the molotov – ribbentrop pact , and calling it a criminal act . the declaration said independence for the baltics was a question of " inalienable human rights , " and accused the european community of ignoring the last colonies of the hitler – stalin era . in december 1989 , soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and the soviet congress of people 's deputies signed a report condemning the molotov-ribbentrop pact . on march 11 , 1990 , less than six months after the baltic way , lithuania declared independence , the first soviet state to do so .
within a year , all three baltic states had declared independence and were internationally recognized as sovereign states . ch / av / afp / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 23.08.2009 bayern munich 's indifferent start becomes a nightmare großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz goalscorer aristide bance finished off bayern bayern 's new coach louis van gaal is still waiting for his first bundesliga win since taking charge in july .
he was also visibly angry when he faced the press after watching his team lose 2-1 to newly-promoted mainz . three games into the new bundesliga season bayern munich remain without a win after goals saturday from andreas ivanschitz and aristide bance helped newly-promoted mainz 05 to a shock 2-1 victory over the german giants .
meanwhile as a bayern team missing franck ribery and luca toni continued to struggle under new coach louis van gaal , bayer leverkusen maintained their strong start and go to the top on goal difference courtesy of a 5-0 mauling of sc freiburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's tranquillo barnetta leverkusen are the new pacesetters with seven points from three games , level with schalke 04 , who dropped their first points of the season when they were held to a goalless draw on friday at hoffenheim .
vfb stuttgart and borussia dortmund both lost ground on the top of the table after playing out a 1-1 draw while a surprise victory for mainz sees them move up to fourth on five points , level with eintracht frankfurt , who played out a scoreless draw with cologne .
champions vfl wolfsburg sit third on six points ahead of their visit to sv hamburg on sunday while munich now languishes in 12th on just two points .
bayern 's boss not happy " that was very disappointing and i am asking myself what we have done incorrectly in our preparations , " said a notably disappointed van gaal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's louis van gaal is not happy mainz were every bit bayern 's equals in the early stages and took a deserved lead on 25 minutes when austrian ivanschitz sent in a shot from 25 metres that slipped in under bayern goalkeeper michael rensing 's outstretched arm .
" that was absolutely terrible and a serious wake-up call for us .
we should n't have lost like that , " rensing said .
things got even worse for louis van gaal 's side seven minutes before the break when bance rose above daniel van buyten to head home from 10 metres and make it 2-0 to thomas tuchel 's side .
with bayern now looking to pull back from a two-goal deficit , van gaal immediately brought on croatian striker ivica olic for midfielder danijel pranijic .
" normally i would n't make a substitution so early but i could have taken off a lot more players , " said an angry van gaal .
mainz did give bayern a lifeline on 47 minutes when nikolce noveski headed a thomas mueller cross into his own net and mueller subsequently had a glorious opportunity to equalize on the hour-mark but his header of van buyten 's pinpoint cross was wide .
van gaal brought on jose sosa for miroslav klose with 18 minutes left as bayern continued to press for an equalizer but the argentine could n't make good a free-kick opportunity four minutes later .
mario gomez hit the side-netting as bayern got ever more desperate but mainz held on for a stunning win .
elsewhere in the league while bayern struggled , bayer leverkusen went top of the table after three games when they hammered freiburg .
" for us it was a very strange game , because freiburg were clearly the better team during the first 35 minutes , " said bayer coach jupp heynckes .
stefan kiessling scored his third goal of the season on 35 minutes to open the scoring at freiburg 's badenova stadium , firing home after being found by simon rolfes .
swiss international tranquillo barnetta doubled leverkusen 's lead two minutes after the restart with a nicely-struck shot from the edge of the area , while a further brace from eren deriyok , sandwiched by barnetta 's second , completed the rout .
" being top of the table means nothing to me , " said leverkusen 's jupp heynckes .
" the way we played in the first half was still unacceptable . "
stuttgart lost ground despite coming back from a goal down at borussia dortmund to salvage a 1-1 draw .

julian schieber could have drawn stuttgart level on the stroke of half-time after playing a combination with cacau but dortmund goalkeeper roman weidenfeller saved the 20-year-old 's shot well .
dortmund paid the price almost immediately after the restart as georg niedermeier headed in from five metres .
in the day 's other game , jiri stajner scored twice and could also afford to miss a penalty as hanover 96 beat nuremberg 2-0 .

superenalotto draws are held three times a week , but no one had chosen the correct six numbers since jan .
31 .
with each week without a winner the jackpot continued to grow , ultimately attracting players from neighboring countries , such as germany and switzerland .
the winning six-number combination was 10 - 11- 27 - 45 - 79 - 88 , and the national lottery agency said the chances of getting all of those digits right were 1 in 622 .
the identity of the winner is still unknown , but the winning ticket was purchased at the bar biffi in the central piazza roma where celebrators gathered saturday night .
" we were watching the football match where milan were playing when someone came in saying that we had won the superenalotto , " said the bar 's manager , annamaria ciampini .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 23.08.2009 bayern munich 's indifferent start becomes a nightmare großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz goalscorer aristide bance finished off bayern bayern 's new coach louis van gaal is still waiting for his first bundesliga win since taking charge in july .
he was also visibly angry when he faced the press after watching his team lose 2-1 to newly-promoted mainz . three games into the new bundesliga season bayern munich remain without a win after goals saturday from andreas ivanschitz and aristide bance helped newly-promoted mainz 05 to a shock 2-1 victory over the german giants .
meanwhile as a bayern team missing franck ribery and luca toni continued to struggle under new coach louis van gaal , bayer leverkusen maintained their strong start and go to the top on goal difference courtesy of a 5-0 mauling of sc freiburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's tranquillo barnetta leverkusen are the new pacesetters with seven points from three games , level with schalke 04 , who dropped their first points of the season when they were held to a goalless draw on friday at hoffenheim .
vfb stuttgart and borussia dortmund both lost ground on the top of the table after playing out a 1-1 draw while a surprise victory for mainz sees them move up to fourth on five points , level with eintracht frankfurt , who played out a scoreless draw with cologne .
champions vfl wolfsburg sit third on six points ahead of their visit to sv hamburg on sunday while munich now languishes in 12th on just two points .
bayern 's boss not happy " that was very disappointing and i am asking myself what we have done incorrectly in our preparations , " said a notably disappointed van gaal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's louis van gaal is not happy mainz were every bit bayern 's equals in the early stages and took a deserved lead on 25 minutes when austrian ivanschitz sent in a shot from 25 metres that slipped in under bayern goalkeeper michael rensing 's outstretched arm .
" that was absolutely terrible and a serious wake-up call for us .
we should n't have lost like that , " rensing said .
things got even worse for louis van gaal 's side seven minutes before the break when bance rose above daniel van buyten to head home from 10 metres and make it 2-0 to thomas tuchel 's side .
with bayern now looking to pull back from a two-goal deficit , van gaal immediately brought on croatian striker ivica olic for midfielder danijel pranijic .
" normally i would n't make a substitution so early but i could have taken off a lot more players , " said an angry van gaal .
mainz did give bayern a lifeline on 47 minutes when nikolce noveski headed a thomas mueller cross into his own net and mueller subsequently had a glorious opportunity to equalize on the hour-mark but his header of van buyten 's pinpoint cross was wide .
van gaal brought on jose sosa for miroslav klose with 18 minutes left as bayern continued to press for an equalizer but the argentine could n't make good a free-kick opportunity four minutes later .
mario gomez hit the side-netting as bayern got ever more desperate but mainz held on for a stunning win .
elsewhere in the league while bayern struggled , bayer leverkusen went top of the table after three games when they hammered freiburg .
" for us it was a very strange game , because freiburg were clearly the better team during the first 35 minutes , " said bayer coach jupp heynckes .
stefan kiessling scored his third goal of the season on 35 minutes to open the scoring at freiburg 's badenova stadium , firing home after being found by simon rolfes .
swiss international tranquillo barnetta doubled leverkusen 's lead two minutes after the restart with a nicely-struck shot from the edge of the area , while a further brace from eren deriyok , sandwiched by barnetta 's second , completed the rout .
" being top of the table means nothing to me , " said leverkusen 's jupp heynckes .
" the way we played in the first half was still unacceptable . "
stuttgart lost ground despite coming back from a goal down at borussia dortmund to salvage a 1-1 draw .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's georg niedermeier , center , celebrates his goal nelson valdez put dortmund ahead on 27 minutes , nuri sahin setting the paraguayan up to finish clinically , placing the ball beyond the reach of jens lehmann .
julian schieber could have drawn stuttgart level on the stroke of half-time after playing a combination with cacau but dortmund goalkeeper roman weidenfeller saved the 20-year-old 's shot well .
dortmund paid the price almost immediately after the restart as georg niedermeier headed in from five metres .
in the day 's other game , jiri stajner scored twice and could also afford to miss a penalty as hanover 96 beat nuremberg 2-0 .

superenalotto draws are held three times a week , but no one had chosen the correct six numbers since jan .
31 .
with each week without a winner the jackpot continued to grow , ultimately attracting players from neighboring countries , such as germany and switzerland .
the winning six-number combination was 10 - 11- 27 - 45 - 79 - 88 , and the national lottery agency said the chances of getting all of those digits right were 1 in 622 .
the identity of the winner is still unknown , but the winning ticket was purchased at the bar biffi in the central piazza roma where celebrators gathered saturday night .
" we were watching the football match where milan were playing when someone came in saying that we had won the superenalotto , " said the bar 's manager , annamaria ciampini .
" we immediately changed the channel and we started to hear the name of the village , " she added .
" what more can i say ?
i did n't win and i do n't know who did . "

after months of negotiations , his foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop flew to moscow and met with his counterpart vyacheslav molotov .
on aug .
23 , they signed an agreement , most commonly known as the molotov-ribbentrop pact . the negotiations took place in secret , at the same time as france and britain negotiated an alliance with stalin . though primarily a non-aggression pact , the document incorporated some economic components . provisions under the agreement included : arbitration in the event of a disagreement , consultation and neutrality if either russia or germany went to war against a third power .
the pact also stipulated that neither party could join a group or alliance " directly or indirectly aimed at the other . " only after germany 's defeat in 1945 did details of the secret protocols of the pact emerge . bildunterschrift : as this 1939 cartoon shows , many saw stalin as the butcher of the baltic states secret protocols envisaged carve-up of europe the protocols divided europe into german and soviet spheres of control .
latvia and estonia were to be in the soviet sphere .
lithuania , the part that was adjacent to east prussia , was to come under german control .
later the protocol was altered , assigning lithuania to the soviets as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler and stalin helped each other prepare for wwii to the north , finland was to be carved off for stalin .
poland was to be partitioned , and soon after the pact was signed , both powers invaded the country to take their respective pieces . immediately afterwards , russia invaded finland , but the red army were repelled in the famous " winter war " of 1939/1940 .
after holding their ground for four months and inflicting terrible casualties on the russians , the heavily outnumbered finns were militarily exhausted , and they sued for peace . stalin annexed finland 's eastern province of karelia , which led eventually to finland and germany signing an alliance .
that alliance was to become a key element in hitler 's invasion of russia . quarrelling between germany and the soviets escalated during the summer of 1940 , as the soviet union refused to fulfill its economic commitments under the molotov-ribbentrop pact , and both parties carried out military operations without informing the other . the german war effort was heavily reliant on the russian raw materials that the pact had aimed to secure , and hitler 's plans were increasingly frustrated .
in august , nazi germany annexed part of romania to gain access to oil fields . hitler tears up pact , invades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany attacked the soviet union in 1941 on june 22 , 1941 , hitler abrogated the molotov-ribbentrop pact and launched operation barbarossa .
the multifaceted invasion involved attacks along the entire eastern front , from finland in the north to the black sea in the south . the eventual failure of barbarossa , the largest military operation in history , became the turning point in the nazi 's fortunes . after germany was defeated in 1945 , soviet troops remained in occupation across much of eastern europe , and the baltic states .
what the allies did n't give stalin as war reparations , he annexed anyway , until ending up with much of what the soviets had claimed in the secret protocols of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . details of the secret protocols dividing up europe surfaced during the nuremberg trials in 1945-46 even though the soviets continued to deny their existence .
after the war , they justified their occupation of the baltic states by claiming that the parliaments of latvia , lithuania and estonia had petitioned to join the ussr . the baltic pro-independence movement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two million balts protested against the soviet union in 1989 in the early 1980s , as the soviet union embraced glasnost , the baltic states ' pro-independence protest movement gathered strength .
on aug .
23 , 1986 , large street protests were held across latvia , lithuania and estonia to mark the anniversary of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . in 1989 , the fourth consecutive year of the protests , and the 50th anniversary of the pact , an especially large protest was planned , resulting in the so-called " baltic way " .
two million lithuanians , latvians and estonians linked arms to form a 671-kilometer -lrb- 417-mile -rrb- long human chain , connecting the three capitals , vilnius , riga and tallinn . the baltic pro-independence movements issued a joint declaration to the world and european community , condemning the molotov – ribbentrop pact , and calling it a criminal act . the declaration said independence for the baltics was a question of " inalienable human rights , " and accused the european community of ignoring the last colonies of the hitler – stalin era . in december 1989 , soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and the soviet congress of people 's deputies signed a report condemning the molotov-ribbentrop pact . on march 11 , 1990 , less than six months after the baltic way , lithuania declared independence , the first soviet state to do so .
within a year , all three baltic states had declared independence and were internationally recognized as sovereign states . ch / av / afp / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : 70 years since germany invaded poland , sparking wwii poland remembers the outbreak of world war ii merkel reiterates support for expellees ' memorial controversial museum planned in poland at site of first nazi invasion berlin exhibit traces german-polish ties on anniversary of nazi invasion world war ii -pipe- 23.08.2009 70 years ago , soviet-nazi pact called for division of europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german-soviet pact had wide-ranging effects by dividing europe into german and soviet spheres of influence , the molotov-ribbentrop pact gave hitler a free hand to attack western europe and consigned much of eastern europe to stalin - with tragic consequences . it was 1939 , and although europe was still at peace , storm clouds were on the horizon . german war planners had already estimated that without a steady supply of raw materials from the soviet union , germany would be hard pressed to sustain any sort of protracted conflict . the last thing hitler needed was a war with the soviets .
after months of negotiations , his foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop flew to moscow and met with his counterpart vyacheslav molotov .
on aug .
23 , they signed an agreement , most commonly known as the molotov-ribbentrop pact . the negotiations took place in secret , at the same time as france and britain negotiated an alliance with stalin . though primarily a non-aggression pact , the document incorporated some economic components . provisions under the agreement included : arbitration in the event of a disagreement , consultation and neutrality if either russia or germany went to war against a third power .
the pact also stipulated that neither party could join a group or alliance " directly or indirectly aimed at the other . " only after germany 's defeat in 1945 did details of the secret protocols of the pact emerge . bildunterschrift : as this 1939 cartoon shows , many saw stalin as the butcher of the baltic states secret protocols envisaged carve-up of europe the protocols divided europe into german and soviet spheres of control .
latvia and estonia were to be in the soviet sphere .
lithuania , the part that was adjacent to east prussia , was to come under german control .
later the protocol was altered , assigning lithuania to the soviets as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler and stalin helped each other prepare for wwii to the north , finland was to be carved off for stalin .
poland was to be partitioned , and soon after the pact was signed , both powers invaded the country to take their respective pieces . immediately afterwards , russia invaded finland , but the red army were repelled in the famous " winter war " of 1939/1940 .
after holding their ground for four months and inflicting terrible casualties on the russians , the heavily outnumbered finns were militarily exhausted , and they sued for peace . stalin annexed finland 's eastern province of karelia , which led eventually to finland and germany signing an alliance .
that alliance was to become a key element in hitler 's invasion of russia . quarrelling between germany and the soviets escalated during the summer of 1940 , as the soviet union refused to fulfill its economic commitments under the molotov-ribbentrop pact , and both parties carried out military operations without informing the other . the german war effort was heavily reliant on the russian raw materials that the pact had aimed to secure , and hitler 's plans were increasingly frustrated .
in august , nazi germany annexed part of romania to gain access to oil fields . hitler tears up pact , invades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany attacked the soviet union in 1941 on june 22 , 1941 , hitler abrogated the molotov-ribbentrop pact and launched operation barbarossa .
the multifaceted invasion involved attacks along the entire eastern front , from finland in the north to the black sea in the south . the eventual failure of barbarossa , the largest military operation in history , became the turning point in the nazi 's fortunes . after germany was defeated in 1945 , soviet troops remained in occupation across much of eastern europe , and the baltic states .
what the allies did n't give stalin as war reparations , he annexed anyway , until ending up with much of what the soviets had claimed in the secret protocols of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . details of the secret protocols dividing up europe surfaced during the nuremberg trials in 1945-46 even though the soviets continued to deny their existence .
after the war , they justified their occupation of the baltic states by claiming that the parliaments of latvia , lithuania and estonia had petitioned to join the ussr . the baltic pro-independence movement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two million balts protested against the soviet union in 1989 in the early 1980s , as the soviet union embraced glasnost , the baltic states ' pro-independence protest movement gathered strength .
on aug .
23 , 1986 , large street protests were held across latvia , lithuania and estonia to mark the anniversary of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . in 1989 , the fourth consecutive year of the protests , and the 50th anniversary of the pact , an especially large protest was planned , resulting in the so-called " baltic way " .
two million lithuanians , latvians and estonians linked arms to form a 671-kilometer -lrb- 417-mile -rrb- long human chain , connecting the three capitals , vilnius , riga and tallinn . the baltic pro-independence movements issued a joint declaration to the world and european community , condemning the molotov – ribbentrop pact , and calling it a criminal act . the declaration said independence for the baltics was a question of " inalienable human rights , " and accused the european community of ignoring the last colonies of the hitler – stalin era . in december 1989 , soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and the soviet congress of people 's deputies signed a report condemning the molotov-ribbentrop pact . on march 11 , 1990 , less than six months after the baltic way , lithuania declared independence , the first soviet state to do so .
within a year , all three baltic states had declared independence and were internationally recognized as sovereign states . ch / av / afp / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 23.08.2009 bayern munich 's indifferent start becomes a nightmare großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz goalscorer aristide bance finished off bayern bayern 's new coach louis van gaal is still waiting for his first bundesliga win since taking charge in july .
he was also visibly angry when he faced the press after watching his team lose 2-1 to newly-promoted mainz . three games into the new bundesliga season bayern munich remain without a win after goals saturday from andreas ivanschitz and aristide bance helped newly-promoted mainz 05 to a shock 2-1 victory over the german giants .
meanwhile as a bayern team missing franck ribery and luca toni continued to struggle under new coach louis van gaal , bayer leverkusen maintained their strong start and go to the top on goal difference courtesy of a 5-0 mauling of sc freiburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's tranquillo barnetta leverkusen are the new pacesetters with seven points from three games , level with schalke 04 , who dropped their first points of the season when they were held to a goalless draw on friday at hoffenheim .
vfb stuttgart and borussia dortmund both lost ground on the top of the table after playing out a 1-1 draw while a surprise victory for mainz sees them move up to fourth on five points , level with eintracht frankfurt , who played out a scoreless draw with cologne .
champions vfl wolfsburg sit third on six points ahead of their visit to sv hamburg on sunday while munich now languishes in 12th on just two points .
bayern 's boss not happy " that was very disappointing and i am asking myself what we have done incorrectly in our preparations , " said a notably disappointed van gaal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's louis van gaal is not happy mainz were every bit bayern 's equals in the early stages and took a deserved lead on 25 minutes when austrian ivanschitz sent in a shot from 25 metres that slipped in under bayern goalkeeper michael rensing 's outstretched arm .
" that was absolutely terrible and a serious wake-up call for us .
we should n't have lost like that , " rensing said .
things got even worse for louis van gaal 's side seven minutes before the break when bance rose above daniel van buyten to head home from 10 metres and make it 2-0 to thomas tuchel 's side .
with bayern now looking to pull back from a two-goal deficit , van gaal immediately brought on croatian striker ivica olic for midfielder danijel pranijic .
" normally i would n't make a substitution so early but i could have taken off a lot more players , " said an angry van gaal .
mainz did give bayern a lifeline on 47 minutes when nikolce noveski headed a thomas mueller cross into his own net and mueller subsequently had a glorious opportunity to equalize on the hour-mark but his header of van buyten 's pinpoint cross was wide .
van gaal brought on jose sosa for miroslav klose with 18 minutes left as bayern continued to press for an equalizer but the argentine could n't make good a free-kick opportunity four minutes later .
mario gomez hit the side-netting as bayern got ever more desperate but mainz held on for a stunning win .
elsewhere in the league while bayern struggled , bayer leverkusen went top of the table after three games when they hammered freiburg .
" for us it was a very strange game , because freiburg were clearly the better team during the first 35 minutes , " said bayer coach jupp heynckes .
stefan kiessling scored his third goal of the season on 35 minutes to open the scoring at freiburg 's badenova stadium , firing home after being found by simon rolfes .
swiss international tranquillo barnetta doubled leverkusen 's lead two minutes after the restart with a nicely-struck shot from the edge of the area , while a further brace from eren deriyok , sandwiched by barnetta 's second , completed the rout .
" being top of the table means nothing to me , " said leverkusen 's jupp heynckes .
" the way we played in the first half was still unacceptable . "
stuttgart lost ground despite coming back from a goal down at borussia dortmund to salvage a 1-1 draw .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's georg niedermeier , center , celebrates his goal nelson valdez put dortmund ahead on 27 minutes , nuri sahin setting the paraguayan up to finish clinically , placing the ball beyond the reach of jens lehmann .
julian schieber could have drawn stuttgart level on the stroke of half-time after playing a combination with cacau but dortmund goalkeeper roman weidenfeller saved the 20-year-old 's shot well .
dortmund paid the price almost immediately after the restart as georg niedermeier headed in from five metres .
in the day 's other game , jiri stajner scored twice and could also afford to miss a penalty as hanover 96 beat nuremberg 2-0 .

after months of negotiations , his foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop flew to moscow and met with his counterpart vyacheslav molotov .
on aug .
23 , they signed an agreement , most commonly known as the molotov-ribbentrop pact . the negotiations took place in secret , at the same time as france and britain negotiated an alliance with stalin . though primarily a non-aggression pact , the document incorporated some economic components . provisions under the agreement included : arbitration in the event of a disagreement , consultation and neutrality if either russia or germany went to war against a third power .
the pact also stipulated that neither party could join a group or alliance " directly or indirectly aimed at the other . " only after germany 's defeat in 1945 did details of the secret protocols of the pact emerge . bildunterschrift : as this 1939 cartoon shows , many saw stalin as the butcher of the baltic states secret protocols envisaged carve-up of europe the protocols divided europe into german and soviet spheres of control .
latvia and estonia were to be in the soviet sphere .
lithuania , the part that was adjacent to east prussia , was to come under german control .
later the protocol was altered , assigning lithuania to the soviets as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler and stalin helped each other prepare for wwii to the north , finland was to be carved off for stalin .
poland was to be partitioned , and soon after the pact was signed , both powers invaded the country to take their respective pieces . immediately afterwards , russia invaded finland , but the red army were repelled in the famous " winter war " of 1939/1940 .
after holding their ground for four months and inflicting terrible casualties on the russians , the heavily outnumbered finns were militarily exhausted , and they sued for peace . stalin annexed finland 's eastern province of karelia , which led eventually to finland and germany signing an alliance .
that alliance was to become a key element in hitler 's invasion of russia . quarrelling between germany and the soviets escalated during the summer of 1940 , as the soviet union refused to fulfill its economic commitments under the molotov-ribbentrop pact , and both parties carried out military operations without informing the other . the german war effort was heavily reliant on the russian raw materials that the pact had aimed to secure , and hitler 's plans were increasingly frustrated .
in august , nazi germany annexed part of romania to gain access to oil fields . hitler tears up pact , invades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany attacked the soviet union in 1941 on june 22 , 1941 , hitler abrogated the molotov-ribbentrop pact and launched operation barbarossa .
the multifaceted invasion involved attacks along the entire eastern front , from finland in the north to the black sea in the south . the eventual failure of barbarossa , the largest military operation in history , became the turning point in the nazi 's fortunes . after germany was defeated in 1945 , soviet troops remained in occupation across much of eastern europe , and the baltic states .
what the allies did n't give stalin as war reparations , he annexed anyway , until ending up with much of what the soviets had claimed in the secret protocols of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . details of the secret protocols dividing up europe surfaced during the nuremberg trials in 1945-46 even though the soviets continued to deny their existence .
after the war , they justified their occupation of the baltic states by claiming that the parliaments of latvia , lithuania and estonia had petitioned to join the ussr . the baltic pro-independence movement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two million balts protested against the soviet union in 1989 in the early 1980s , as the soviet union embraced glasnost , the baltic states ' pro-independence protest movement gathered strength .
on aug .
23 , 1986 , large street protests were held across latvia , lithuania and estonia to mark the anniversary of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . in 1989 , the fourth consecutive year of the protests , and the 50th anniversary of the pact , an especially large protest was planned , resulting in the so-called " baltic way " .
two million lithuanians , latvians and estonians linked arms to form a 671-kilometer -lrb- 417-mile -rrb- long human chain , connecting the three capitals , vilnius , riga and tallinn . the baltic pro-independence movements issued a joint declaration to the world and european community , condemning the molotov – ribbentrop pact , and calling it a criminal act . the declaration said independence for the baltics was a question of " inalienable human rights , " and accused the european community of ignoring the last colonies of the hitler – stalin era . in december 1989 , soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and the soviet congress of people 's deputies signed a report condemning the molotov-ribbentrop pact . on march 11 , 1990 , less than six months after the baltic way , lithuania declared independence , the first soviet state to do so .
within a year , all three baltic states had declared independence and were internationally recognized as sovereign states . ch / av / afp / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but 2009 is also giving pecs a reason to celebrate , as diocese pecs plans to toast its 1000-year anniversary . one of the main landmarks in the western hungarian town of pecs is the church of st. maria , in the main square .
the building alone speaks volumes about the long history of this turbulent region . the now-church was once a turkish mosque - which in turn was built on the remains of a 16th century romanesque church .
today , it features features a grand green-copper cupola , prayer niches , keel-arch windows , and the remains of an ottoman painting that includes verses from the koran . from church , to mosque , and back again bishop mihaly mayer says that many catholics still call the downtown church a mosque . “ i always say : ‘ you can say that but its not entirely true , ’ ” mayer said .
“ half of it was built as a christian church , and if you look back even earlier , it was the holy church of bartholomew that was built as a mosque .
i stress that because no one ever mentioned this cathedral in the communist past . ” bishop mayer has been at the head of the pecs diocese for 20 years .
he remembers how the church was stifled under hungary ’ s communist rule , despite the long christian tradition in the region . several decades ago , early christian burial chambers were discovered beneath the church ; they date back to the fourth century , when pecs was a roman city .
today , these are a designated unesco world heritage site . the dioscese of pecs is also referred to as the diocese quinque ecclesia , a name that refers to the fact that the city was originally built around five old christian chapels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city is busy planning for 2010 , but 2009 need not be forgotten these five chapels no longer exist , and no one knows where they once stood .
what is clear is that king stephan founded of the diocese , laying the ground stone for the ancient cathedral in 1009 .
the church was changed and destroyed many times over in the ensuing years . the neo-romanesque cathedral , with its green copper domed roof and four corner towers that rise above the city , was built between 1882 and 1891 .
in places , the cathedral shows signs of its former life as a mosque .
this is especially true in the reliefs in the passageway leading to the lower church , where the heads of the statues of apostles have been broken off . for the 1000th anniversary of the diocese , the church has been restored both inside and out .
the restoration was helped along with state funding , and the state is expected to pick up the tab for the anniversary celebrations as well .
some 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 358,000 -rrb- in culture capital 2010 financing are expected - though by the end of july none of that money had made its way to the diocese , meyer complained . hopes for cultural cooperation in fact , given the number of active construction sites in the city , it appears that pecs is having problems putting its ambitious culture capital plans into action .
nonetheless , the diocese is kicking off its anniversary year with a special church service .
and there has been church-to-church contact between the diocese in pecs and in the city of essen , germany - along with istanbul , another cultural capital for 2010 . " we had a music school from essen here recently .
and i wrote to the auxiliary bishop there that we should make a partnership between the catholic school in pecs and the music school , " meyer said . " it would be nice if we could finish up that agreement in 2010 and take the next step in our relationship .

but 2009 is also giving pecs a reason to celebrate , as diocese pecs plans to toast its 1000-year anniversary . one of the main landmarks in the western hungarian town of pecs is the church of st. maria , in the main square .
the building alone speaks volumes about the long history of this turbulent region . the now-church was once a turkish mosque - which in turn was built on the remains of a 16th century romanesque church .
today , it features features a grand green-copper cupola , prayer niches , keel-arch windows , and the remains of an ottoman painting that includes verses from the koran . from church , to mosque , and back again bishop mihaly mayer says that many catholics still call the downtown church a mosque . “ i always say : ‘ you can say that but its not entirely true , ’ ” mayer said .
“ half of it was built as a christian church , and if you look back even earlier , it was the holy church of bartholomew that was built as a mosque .
i stress that because no one ever mentioned this cathedral in the communist past . ” bishop mayer has been at the head of the pecs diocese for 20 years .
he remembers how the church was stifled under hungary ’ s communist rule , despite the long christian tradition in the region . several decades ago , early christian burial chambers were discovered beneath the church ; they date back to the fourth century , when pecs was a roman city .
today , these are a designated unesco world heritage site . the dioscese of pecs is also referred to as the diocese quinque ecclesia , a name that refers to the fact that the city was originally built around five old christian chapels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city is busy planning for 2010 , but 2009 need not be forgotten these five chapels no longer exist , and no one knows where they once stood .
what is clear is that king stephan founded of the diocese , laying the ground stone for the ancient cathedral in 1009 .
the church was changed and destroyed many times over in the ensuing years . the neo-romanesque cathedral , with its green copper domed roof and four corner towers that rise above the city , was built between 1882 and 1891 .
in places , the cathedral shows signs of its former life as a mosque .
this is especially true in the reliefs in the passageway leading to the lower church , where the heads of the statues of apostles have been broken off . for the 1000th anniversary of the diocese , the church has been restored both inside and out .
the restoration was helped along with state funding , and the state is expected to pick up the tab for the anniversary celebrations as well .
some 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 358,000 -rrb- in culture capital 2010 financing are expected - though by the end of july none of that money had made its way to the diocese , meyer complained . hopes for cultural cooperation in fact , given the number of active construction sites in the city , it appears that pecs is having problems putting its ambitious culture capital plans into action .
nonetheless , the diocese is kicking off its anniversary year with a special church service .
and there has been church-to-church contact between the diocese in pecs and in the city of essen , germany - along with istanbul , another cultural capital for 2010 . " we had a music school from essen here recently .
and i wrote to the auxiliary bishop there that we should make a partnership between the catholic school in pecs and the music school , " meyer said . " it would be nice if we could finish up that agreement in 2010 and take the next step in our relationship .

after months of negotiations , his foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop flew to moscow and met with his counterpart vyacheslav molotov .
on aug .
23 , they signed an agreement , most commonly known as the molotov-ribbentrop pact . the negotiations took place in secret , at the same time as france and britain negotiated an alliance with stalin . though primarily a non-aggression pact , the document incorporated some economic components . provisions under the agreement included : arbitration in the event of a disagreement , consultation and neutrality if either russia or germany went to war against a third power .
the pact also stipulated that neither party could join a group or alliance " directly or indirectly aimed at the other . " only after germany 's defeat in 1945 did details of the secret protocols of the pact emerge . bildunterschrift : as this 1939 cartoon shows , many saw stalin as the butcher of the baltic states secret protocols envisaged carve-up of europe the protocols divided europe into german and soviet spheres of control .
latvia and estonia were to be in the soviet sphere .
lithuania , the part that was adjacent to east prussia , was to come under german control .
later the protocol was altered , assigning lithuania to the soviets as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler and stalin helped each other prepare for wwii to the north , finland was to be carved off for stalin .
poland was to be partitioned , and soon after the pact was signed , both powers invaded the country to take their respective pieces . immediately afterwards , russia invaded finland , but the red army were repelled in the famous " winter war " of 1939/1940 .
after holding their ground for four months and inflicting terrible casualties on the russians , the heavily outnumbered finns were militarily exhausted , and they sued for peace . stalin annexed finland 's eastern province of karelia , which led eventually to finland and germany signing an alliance .
that alliance was to become a key element in hitler 's invasion of russia . quarrelling between germany and the soviets escalated during the summer of 1940 , as the soviet union refused to fulfill its economic commitments under the molotov-ribbentrop pact , and both parties carried out military operations without informing the other . the german war effort was heavily reliant on the russian raw materials that the pact had aimed to secure , and hitler 's plans were increasingly frustrated .
in august , nazi germany annexed part of romania to gain access to oil fields . hitler tears up pact , invades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany attacked the soviet union in 1941 on june 22 , 1941 , hitler abrogated the molotov-ribbentrop pact and launched operation barbarossa .
the multifaceted invasion involved attacks along the entire eastern front , from finland in the north to the black sea in the south . the eventual failure of barbarossa , the largest military operation in history , became the turning point in the nazi 's fortunes . after germany was defeated in 1945 , soviet troops remained in occupation across much of eastern europe , and the baltic states .
what the allies did n't give stalin as war reparations , he annexed anyway , until ending up with much of what the soviets had claimed in the secret protocols of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . details of the secret protocols dividing up europe surfaced during the nuremberg trials in 1945-46 even though the soviets continued to deny their existence .
after the war , they justified their occupation of the baltic states by claiming that the parliaments of latvia , lithuania and estonia had petitioned to join the ussr . the baltic pro-independence movement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two million balts protested against the soviet union in 1989 in the early 1980s , as the soviet union embraced glasnost , the baltic states ' pro-independence protest movement gathered strength .
on aug .
23 , 1986 , large street protests were held across latvia , lithuania and estonia to mark the anniversary of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . in 1989 , the fourth consecutive year of the protests , and the 50th anniversary of the pact , an especially large protest was planned , resulting in the so-called " baltic way " .
two million lithuanians , latvians and estonians linked arms to form a 671-kilometer -lrb- 417-mile -rrb- long human chain , connecting the three capitals , vilnius , riga and tallinn . the baltic pro-independence movements issued a joint declaration to the world and european community , condemning the molotov – ribbentrop pact , and calling it a criminal act . the declaration said independence for the baltics was a question of " inalienable human rights , " and accused the european community of ignoring the last colonies of the hitler – stalin era . in december 1989 , soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and the soviet congress of people 's deputies signed a report condemning the molotov-ribbentrop pact . on march 11 , 1990 , less than six months after the baltic way , lithuania declared independence , the first soviet state to do so .
within a year , all three baltic states had declared independence and were internationally recognized as sovereign states . ch / av / afp / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 23.08.2009 bayern munich 's indifferent start becomes a nightmare großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz goalscorer aristide bance finished off bayern bayern 's new coach louis van gaal is still waiting for his first bundesliga win since taking charge in july .
he was also visibly angry when he faced the press after watching his team lose 2-1 to newly-promoted mainz . three games into the new bundesliga season bayern munich remain without a win after goals saturday from andreas ivanschitz and aristide bance helped newly-promoted mainz 05 to a shock 2-1 victory over the german giants .
meanwhile as a bayern team missing franck ribery and luca toni continued to struggle under new coach louis van gaal , bayer leverkusen maintained their strong start and go to the top on goal difference courtesy of a 5-0 mauling of sc freiburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's tranquillo barnetta leverkusen are the new pacesetters with seven points from three games , level with schalke 04 , who dropped their first points of the season when they were held to a goalless draw on friday at hoffenheim .
vfb stuttgart and borussia dortmund both lost ground on the top of the table after playing out a 1-1 draw while a surprise victory for mainz sees them move up to fourth on five points , level with eintracht frankfurt , who played out a scoreless draw with cologne .
champions vfl wolfsburg sit third on six points ahead of their visit to sv hamburg on sunday while munich now languishes in 12th on just two points .
bayern 's boss not happy " that was very disappointing and i am asking myself what we have done incorrectly in our preparations , " said a notably disappointed van gaal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's louis van gaal is not happy mainz were every bit bayern 's equals in the early stages and took a deserved lead on 25 minutes when austrian ivanschitz sent in a shot from 25 metres that slipped in under bayern goalkeeper michael rensing 's outstretched arm .
" that was absolutely terrible and a serious wake-up call for us .
we should n't have lost like that , " rensing said .
things got even worse for louis van gaal 's side seven minutes before the break when bance rose above daniel van buyten to head home from 10 metres and make it 2-0 to thomas tuchel 's side .
with bayern now looking to pull back from a two-goal deficit , van gaal immediately brought on croatian striker ivica olic for midfielder danijel pranijic .
" normally i would n't make a substitution so early but i could have taken off a lot more players , " said an angry van gaal .
mainz did give bayern a lifeline on 47 minutes when nikolce noveski headed a thomas mueller cross into his own net and mueller subsequently had a glorious opportunity to equalize on the hour-mark but his header of van buyten 's pinpoint cross was wide .
van gaal brought on jose sosa for miroslav klose with 18 minutes left as bayern continued to press for an equalizer but the argentine could n't make good a free-kick opportunity four minutes later .
mario gomez hit the side-netting as bayern got ever more desperate but mainz held on for a stunning win .
elsewhere in the league while bayern struggled , bayer leverkusen went top of the table after three games when they hammered freiburg .
" for us it was a very strange game , because freiburg were clearly the better team during the first 35 minutes , " said bayer coach jupp heynckes .
stefan kiessling scored his third goal of the season on 35 minutes to open the scoring at freiburg 's badenova stadium , firing home after being found by simon rolfes .
swiss international tranquillo barnetta doubled leverkusen 's lead two minutes after the restart with a nicely-struck shot from the edge of the area , while a further brace from eren deriyok , sandwiched by barnetta 's second , completed the rout .
" being top of the table means nothing to me , " said leverkusen 's jupp heynckes .
" the way we played in the first half was still unacceptable . "
stuttgart lost ground despite coming back from a goal down at borussia dortmund to salvage a 1-1 draw .

julian schieber could have drawn stuttgart level on the stroke of half-time after playing a combination with cacau but dortmund goalkeeper roman weidenfeller saved the 20-year-old 's shot well .
dortmund paid the price almost immediately after the restart as georg niedermeier headed in from five metres .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 23.08.2009 bayern munich 's indifferent start becomes a nightmare großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz goalscorer aristide bance finished off bayern bayern 's new coach louis van gaal is still waiting for his first bundesliga win since taking charge in july .
he was also visibly angry when he faced the press after watching his team lose 2-1 to newly-promoted mainz . three games into the new bundesliga season bayern munich remain without a win after goals saturday from andreas ivanschitz and aristide bance helped newly-promoted mainz 05 to a shock 2-1 victory over the german giants .
meanwhile as a bayern team missing franck ribery and luca toni continued to struggle under new coach louis van gaal , bayer leverkusen maintained their strong start and go to the top on goal difference courtesy of a 5-0 mauling of sc freiburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's tranquillo barnetta leverkusen are the new pacesetters with seven points from three games , level with schalke 04 , who dropped their first points of the season when they were held to a goalless draw on friday at hoffenheim .
vfb stuttgart and borussia dortmund both lost ground on the top of the table after playing out a 1-1 draw while a surprise victory for mainz sees them move up to fourth on five points , level with eintracht frankfurt , who played out a scoreless draw with cologne .
champions vfl wolfsburg sit third on six points ahead of their visit to sv hamburg on sunday while munich now languishes in 12th on just two points .
bayern 's boss not happy " that was very disappointing and i am asking myself what we have done incorrectly in our preparations , " said a notably disappointed van gaal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's louis van gaal is not happy mainz were every bit bayern 's equals in the early stages and took a deserved lead on 25 minutes when austrian ivanschitz sent in a shot from 25 metres that slipped in under bayern goalkeeper michael rensing 's outstretched arm .
" that was absolutely terrible and a serious wake-up call for us .
we should n't have lost like that , " rensing said .
things got even worse for louis van gaal 's side seven minutes before the break when bance rose above daniel van buyten to head home from 10 metres and make it 2-0 to thomas tuchel 's side .
with bayern now looking to pull back from a two-goal deficit , van gaal immediately brought on croatian striker ivica olic for midfielder danijel pranijic .
" normally i would n't make a substitution so early but i could have taken off a lot more players , " said an angry van gaal .
mainz did give bayern a lifeline on 47 minutes when nikolce noveski headed a thomas mueller cross into his own net and mueller subsequently had a glorious opportunity to equalize on the hour-mark but his header of van buyten 's pinpoint cross was wide .
van gaal brought on jose sosa for miroslav klose with 18 minutes left as bayern continued to press for an equalizer but the argentine could n't make good a free-kick opportunity four minutes later .
mario gomez hit the side-netting as bayern got ever more desperate but mainz held on for a stunning win .
elsewhere in the league while bayern struggled , bayer leverkusen went top of the table after three games when they hammered freiburg .
" for us it was a very strange game , because freiburg were clearly the better team during the first 35 minutes , " said bayer coach jupp heynckes .
stefan kiessling scored his third goal of the season on 35 minutes to open the scoring at freiburg 's badenova stadium , firing home after being found by simon rolfes .
swiss international tranquillo barnetta doubled leverkusen 's lead two minutes after the restart with a nicely-struck shot from the edge of the area , while a further brace from eren deriyok , sandwiched by barnetta 's second , completed the rout .
" being top of the table means nothing to me , " said leverkusen 's jupp heynckes .
" the way we played in the first half was still unacceptable . "
stuttgart lost ground despite coming back from a goal down at borussia dortmund to salvage a 1-1 draw .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's georg niedermeier , center , celebrates his goal nelson valdez put dortmund ahead on 27 minutes , nuri sahin setting the paraguayan up to finish clinically , placing the ball beyond the reach of jens lehmann .
julian schieber could have drawn stuttgart level on the stroke of half-time after playing a combination with cacau but dortmund goalkeeper roman weidenfeller saved the 20-year-old 's shot well .
dortmund paid the price almost immediately after the restart as georg niedermeier headed in from five metres .
in the day 's other game , jiri stajner scored twice and could also afford to miss a penalty as hanover 96 beat nuremberg 2-0 .

but 2009 is also giving pecs a reason to celebrate , as diocese pecs plans to toast its 1000-year anniversary . one of the main landmarks in the western hungarian town of pecs is the church of st. maria , in the main square .
the building alone speaks volumes about the long history of this turbulent region . the now-church was once a turkish mosque - which in turn was built on the remains of a 16th century romanesque church .
today , it features features a grand green-copper cupola , prayer niches , keel-arch windows , and the remains of an ottoman painting that includes verses from the koran . from church , to mosque , and back again bishop mihaly mayer says that many catholics still call the downtown church a mosque . “ i always say : ‘ you can say that but its not entirely true , ’ ” mayer said .
“ half of it was built as a christian church , and if you look back even earlier , it was the holy church of bartholomew that was built as a mosque .
i stress that because no one ever mentioned this cathedral in the communist past . ” bishop mayer has been at the head of the pecs diocese for 20 years .
he remembers how the church was stifled under hungary ’ s communist rule , despite the long christian tradition in the region . several decades ago , early christian burial chambers were discovered beneath the church ; they date back to the fourth century , when pecs was a roman city .
today , these are a designated unesco world heritage site . the dioscese of pecs is also referred to as the diocese quinque ecclesia , a name that refers to the fact that the city was originally built around five old christian chapels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city is busy planning for 2010 , but 2009 need not be forgotten these five chapels no longer exist , and no one knows where they once stood .
what is clear is that king stephan founded of the diocese , laying the ground stone for the ancient cathedral in 1009 .
the church was changed and destroyed many times over in the ensuing years . the neo-romanesque cathedral , with its green copper domed roof and four corner towers that rise above the city , was built between 1882 and 1891 .
in places , the cathedral shows signs of its former life as a mosque .
this is especially true in the reliefs in the passageway leading to the lower church , where the heads of the statues of apostles have been broken off . for the 1000th anniversary of the diocese , the church has been restored both inside and out .
the restoration was helped along with state funding , and the state is expected to pick up the tab for the anniversary celebrations as well .
some 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 358,000 -rrb- in culture capital 2010 financing are expected - though by the end of july none of that money had made its way to the diocese , meyer complained . hopes for cultural cooperation in fact , given the number of active construction sites in the city , it appears that pecs is having problems putting its ambitious culture capital plans into action .
nonetheless , the diocese is kicking off its anniversary year with a special church service .
and there has been church-to-church contact between the diocese in pecs and in the city of essen , germany - along with istanbul , another cultural capital for 2010 . " we had a music school from essen here recently .
and i wrote to the auxiliary bishop there that we should make a partnership between the catholic school in pecs and the music school , " meyer said . " it would be nice if we could finish up that agreement in 2010 and take the next step in our relationship .
so we can stress the idea that our students are n't going to europe or that european students are n't coming to us , but that we live in europe . sigrid hoff -lrb- jen -rrb- editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after months of negotiations , his foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop flew to moscow and met with his counterpart vyacheslav molotov .
on aug .
23 , they signed an agreement , most commonly known as the molotov-ribbentrop pact . the negotiations took place in secret , at the same time as france and britain negotiated an alliance with stalin . though primarily a non-aggression pact , the document incorporated some economic components . provisions under the agreement included : arbitration in the event of a disagreement , consultation and neutrality if either russia or germany went to war against a third power .
the pact also stipulated that neither party could join a group or alliance " directly or indirectly aimed at the other . " only after germany 's defeat in 1945 did details of the secret protocols of the pact emerge . bildunterschrift : as this 1939 cartoon shows , many saw stalin as the butcher of the baltic states secret protocols envisaged carve-up of europe the protocols divided europe into german and soviet spheres of control .
latvia and estonia were to be in the soviet sphere .
lithuania , the part that was adjacent to east prussia , was to come under german control .
later the protocol was altered , assigning lithuania to the soviets as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler and stalin helped each other prepare for wwii to the north , finland was to be carved off for stalin .
poland was to be partitioned , and soon after the pact was signed , both powers invaded the country to take their respective pieces . immediately afterwards , russia invaded finland , but the red army were repelled in the famous " winter war " of 1939/1940 .
after holding their ground for four months and inflicting terrible casualties on the russians , the heavily outnumbered finns were militarily exhausted , and they sued for peace . stalin annexed finland 's eastern province of karelia , which led eventually to finland and germany signing an alliance .
that alliance was to become a key element in hitler 's invasion of russia . quarrelling between germany and the soviets escalated during the summer of 1940 , as the soviet union refused to fulfill its economic commitments under the molotov-ribbentrop pact , and both parties carried out military operations without informing the other . the german war effort was heavily reliant on the russian raw materials that the pact had aimed to secure , and hitler 's plans were increasingly frustrated .
in august , nazi germany annexed part of romania to gain access to oil fields . hitler tears up pact , invades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany attacked the soviet union in 1941 on june 22 , 1941 , hitler abrogated the molotov-ribbentrop pact and launched operation barbarossa .
the multifaceted invasion involved attacks along the entire eastern front , from finland in the north to the black sea in the south . the eventual failure of barbarossa , the largest military operation in history , became the turning point in the nazi 's fortunes . after germany was defeated in 1945 , soviet troops remained in occupation across much of eastern europe , and the baltic states .
what the allies did n't give stalin as war reparations , he annexed anyway , until ending up with much of what the soviets had claimed in the secret protocols of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . details of the secret protocols dividing up europe surfaced during the nuremberg trials in 1945-46 even though the soviets continued to deny their existence .
after the war , they justified their occupation of the baltic states by claiming that the parliaments of latvia , lithuania and estonia had petitioned to join the ussr . the baltic pro-independence movement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two million balts protested against the soviet union in 1989 in the early 1980s , as the soviet union embraced glasnost , the baltic states ' pro-independence protest movement gathered strength .
on aug .
23 , 1986 , large street protests were held across latvia , lithuania and estonia to mark the anniversary of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . in 1989 , the fourth consecutive year of the protests , and the 50th anniversary of the pact , an especially large protest was planned , resulting in the so-called " baltic way " .
two million lithuanians , latvians and estonians linked arms to form a 671-kilometer -lrb- 417-mile -rrb- long human chain , connecting the three capitals , vilnius , riga and tallinn . the baltic pro-independence movements issued a joint declaration to the world and european community , condemning the molotov – ribbentrop pact , and calling it a criminal act . the declaration said independence for the baltics was a question of " inalienable human rights , " and accused the european community of ignoring the last colonies of the hitler – stalin era . in december 1989 , soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and the soviet congress of people 's deputies signed a report condemning the molotov-ribbentrop pact . on march 11 , 1990 , less than six months after the baltic way , lithuania declared independence , the first soviet state to do so .
within a year , all three baltic states had declared independence and were internationally recognized as sovereign states . ch / av / afp / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 23.08.2009 bayern munich 's indifferent start becomes a nightmare großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz goalscorer aristide bance finished off bayern bayern 's new coach louis van gaal is still waiting for his first bundesliga win since taking charge in july .
he was also visibly angry when he faced the press after watching his team lose 2-1 to newly-promoted mainz . three games into the new bundesliga season bayern munich remain without a win after goals saturday from andreas ivanschitz and aristide bance helped newly-promoted mainz 05 to a shock 2-1 victory over the german giants .
meanwhile as a bayern team missing franck ribery and luca toni continued to struggle under new coach louis van gaal , bayer leverkusen maintained their strong start and go to the top on goal difference courtesy of a 5-0 mauling of sc freiburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's tranquillo barnetta leverkusen are the new pacesetters with seven points from three games , level with schalke 04 , who dropped their first points of the season when they were held to a goalless draw on friday at hoffenheim .
vfb stuttgart and borussia dortmund both lost ground on the top of the table after playing out a 1-1 draw while a surprise victory for mainz sees them move up to fourth on five points , level with eintracht frankfurt , who played out a scoreless draw with cologne .
champions vfl wolfsburg sit third on six points ahead of their visit to sv hamburg on sunday while munich now languishes in 12th on just two points .
bayern 's boss not happy " that was very disappointing and i am asking myself what we have done incorrectly in our preparations , " said a notably disappointed van gaal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's louis van gaal is not happy mainz were every bit bayern 's equals in the early stages and took a deserved lead on 25 minutes when austrian ivanschitz sent in a shot from 25 metres that slipped in under bayern goalkeeper michael rensing 's outstretched arm .
" that was absolutely terrible and a serious wake-up call for us .
we should n't have lost like that , " rensing said .
things got even worse for louis van gaal 's side seven minutes before the break when bance rose above daniel van buyten to head home from 10 metres and make it 2-0 to thomas tuchel 's side .
with bayern now looking to pull back from a two-goal deficit , van gaal immediately brought on croatian striker ivica olic for midfielder danijel pranijic .
" normally i would n't make a substitution so early but i could have taken off a lot more players , " said an angry van gaal .
mainz did give bayern a lifeline on 47 minutes when nikolce noveski headed a thomas mueller cross into his own net and mueller subsequently had a glorious opportunity to equalize on the hour-mark but his header of van buyten 's pinpoint cross was wide .
van gaal brought on jose sosa for miroslav klose with 18 minutes left as bayern continued to press for an equalizer but the argentine could n't make good a free-kick opportunity four minutes later .
mario gomez hit the side-netting as bayern got ever more desperate but mainz held on for a stunning win .
elsewhere in the league while bayern struggled , bayer leverkusen went top of the table after three games when they hammered freiburg .
" for us it was a very strange game , because freiburg were clearly the better team during the first 35 minutes , " said bayer coach jupp heynckes .
stefan kiessling scored his third goal of the season on 35 minutes to open the scoring at freiburg 's badenova stadium , firing home after being found by simon rolfes .
swiss international tranquillo barnetta doubled leverkusen 's lead two minutes after the restart with a nicely-struck shot from the edge of the area , while a further brace from eren deriyok , sandwiched by barnetta 's second , completed the rout .
" being top of the table means nothing to me , " said leverkusen 's jupp heynckes .
" the way we played in the first half was still unacceptable . "
stuttgart lost ground despite coming back from a goal down at borussia dortmund to salvage a 1-1 draw .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's georg niedermeier , center , celebrates his goal nelson valdez put dortmund ahead on 27 minutes , nuri sahin setting the paraguayan up to finish clinically , placing the ball beyond the reach of jens lehmann .
julian schieber could have drawn stuttgart level on the stroke of half-time after playing a combination with cacau but dortmund goalkeeper roman weidenfeller saved the 20-year-old 's shot well .

after months of negotiations , his foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop flew to moscow and met with his counterpart vyacheslav molotov .
on aug .
23 , they signed an agreement , most commonly known as the molotov-ribbentrop pact . the negotiations took place in secret , at the same time as france and britain negotiated an alliance with stalin . though primarily a non-aggression pact , the document incorporated some economic components . provisions under the agreement included : arbitration in the event of a disagreement , consultation and neutrality if either russia or germany went to war against a third power .
the pact also stipulated that neither party could join a group or alliance " directly or indirectly aimed at the other . " only after germany 's defeat in 1945 did details of the secret protocols of the pact emerge . bildunterschrift : as this 1939 cartoon shows , many saw stalin as the butcher of the baltic states secret protocols envisaged carve-up of europe the protocols divided europe into german and soviet spheres of control .
latvia and estonia were to be in the soviet sphere .
lithuania , the part that was adjacent to east prussia , was to come under german control .
later the protocol was altered , assigning lithuania to the soviets as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler and stalin helped each other prepare for wwii to the north , finland was to be carved off for stalin .
poland was to be partitioned , and soon after the pact was signed , both powers invaded the country to take their respective pieces . immediately afterwards , russia invaded finland , but the red army were repelled in the famous " winter war " of 1939/1940 .
after holding their ground for four months and inflicting terrible casualties on the russians , the heavily outnumbered finns were militarily exhausted , and they sued for peace . stalin annexed finland 's eastern province of karelia , which led eventually to finland and germany signing an alliance .
that alliance was to become a key element in hitler 's invasion of russia . quarrelling between germany and the soviets escalated during the summer of 1940 , as the soviet union refused to fulfill its economic commitments under the molotov-ribbentrop pact , and both parties carried out military operations without informing the other . the german war effort was heavily reliant on the russian raw materials that the pact had aimed to secure , and hitler 's plans were increasingly frustrated .
in august , nazi germany annexed part of romania to gain access to oil fields . hitler tears up pact , invades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany attacked the soviet union in 1941 on june 22 , 1941 , hitler abrogated the molotov-ribbentrop pact and launched operation barbarossa .
the multifaceted invasion involved attacks along the entire eastern front , from finland in the north to the black sea in the south . the eventual failure of barbarossa , the largest military operation in history , became the turning point in the nazi 's fortunes . after germany was defeated in 1945 , soviet troops remained in occupation across much of eastern europe , and the baltic states .
what the allies did n't give stalin as war reparations , he annexed anyway , until ending up with much of what the soviets had claimed in the secret protocols of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . details of the secret protocols dividing up europe surfaced during the nuremberg trials in 1945-46 even though the soviets continued to deny their existence .
after the war , they justified their occupation of the baltic states by claiming that the parliaments of latvia , lithuania and estonia had petitioned to join the ussr . the baltic pro-independence movement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two million balts protested against the soviet union in 1989 in the early 1980s , as the soviet union embraced glasnost , the baltic states ' pro-independence protest movement gathered strength .
on aug .
23 , 1986 , large street protests were held across latvia , lithuania and estonia to mark the anniversary of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . in 1989 , the fourth consecutive year of the protests , and the 50th anniversary of the pact , an especially large protest was planned , resulting in the so-called " baltic way " .
two million lithuanians , latvians and estonians linked arms to form a 671-kilometer -lrb- 417-mile -rrb- long human chain , connecting the three capitals , vilnius , riga and tallinn . the baltic pro-independence movements issued a joint declaration to the world and european community , condemning the molotov – ribbentrop pact , and calling it a criminal act . the declaration said independence for the baltics was a question of " inalienable human rights , " and accused the european community of ignoring the last colonies of the hitler – stalin era . in december 1989 , soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and the soviet congress of people 's deputies signed a report condemning the molotov-ribbentrop pact . on march 11 , 1990 , less than six months after the baltic way , lithuania declared independence , the first soviet state to do so .
within a year , all three baltic states had declared independence and were internationally recognized as sovereign states . ch / av / afp / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but 2009 is also giving pecs a reason to celebrate , as diocese pecs plans to toast its 1000-year anniversary . one of the main landmarks in the western hungarian town of pecs is the church of st. maria , in the main square .
the building alone speaks volumes about the long history of this turbulent region . the now-church was once a turkish mosque - which in turn was built on the remains of a 16th century romanesque church .
today , it features features a grand green-copper cupola , prayer niches , keel-arch windows , and the remains of an ottoman painting that includes verses from the koran . from church , to mosque , and back again bishop mihaly mayer says that many catholics still call the downtown church a mosque . “ i always say : ‘ you can say that but its not entirely true , ’ ” mayer said .
“ half of it was built as a christian church , and if you look back even earlier , it was the holy church of bartholomew that was built as a mosque .
i stress that because no one ever mentioned this cathedral in the communist past . ” bishop mayer has been at the head of the pecs diocese for 20 years .
he remembers how the church was stifled under hungary ’ s communist rule , despite the long christian tradition in the region . several decades ago , early christian burial chambers were discovered beneath the church ; they date back to the fourth century , when pecs was a roman city .
today , these are a designated unesco world heritage site . the dioscese of pecs is also referred to as the diocese quinque ecclesia , a name that refers to the fact that the city was originally built around five old christian chapels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city is busy planning for 2010 , but 2009 need not be forgotten these five chapels no longer exist , and no one knows where they once stood .
what is clear is that king stephan founded of the diocese , laying the ground stone for the ancient cathedral in 1009 .
the church was changed and destroyed many times over in the ensuing years . the neo-romanesque cathedral , with its green copper domed roof and four corner towers that rise above the city , was built between 1882 and 1891 .
in places , the cathedral shows signs of its former life as a mosque .
this is especially true in the reliefs in the passageway leading to the lower church , where the heads of the statues of apostles have been broken off . for the 1000th anniversary of the diocese , the church has been restored both inside and out .
the restoration was helped along with state funding , and the state is expected to pick up the tab for the anniversary celebrations as well .
some 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 358,000 -rrb- in culture capital 2010 financing are expected - though by the end of july none of that money had made its way to the diocese , meyer complained . hopes for cultural cooperation in fact , given the number of active construction sites in the city , it appears that pecs is having problems putting its ambitious culture capital plans into action .
nonetheless , the diocese is kicking off its anniversary year with a special church service .
and there has been church-to-church contact between the diocese in pecs and in the city of essen , germany - along with istanbul , another cultural capital for 2010 . " we had a music school from essen here recently .
and i wrote to the auxiliary bishop there that we should make a partnership between the catholic school in pecs and the music school , " meyer said . " it would be nice if we could finish up that agreement in 2010 and take the next step in our relationship .
so we can stress the idea that our students are n't going to europe or that european students are n't coming to us , but that we live in europe . sigrid hoff -lrb- jen -rrb- editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was also visibly angry when he faced the press after watching his team lose 2-1 to newly-promoted mainz . three games into the new bundesliga season bayern munich remain without a win after goals saturday from andreas ivanschitz and aristide bance helped newly-promoted mainz 05 to a shock 2-1 victory over the german giants .
meanwhile as a bayern team missing franck ribery and luca toni continued to struggle under new coach louis van gaal , bayer leverkusen maintained their strong start and go to the top on goal difference courtesy of a 5-0 mauling of sc freiburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's tranquillo barnetta leverkusen are the new pacesetters with seven points from three games , level with schalke 04 , who dropped their first points of the season when they were held to a goalless draw on friday at hoffenheim .
vfb stuttgart and borussia dortmund both lost ground on the top of the table after playing out a 1-1 draw while a surprise victory for mainz sees them move up to fourth on five points , level with eintracht frankfurt , who played out a scoreless draw with cologne .
champions vfl wolfsburg sit third on six points ahead of their visit to sv hamburg on sunday while munich now languishes in 12th on just two points .
bayern 's boss not happy " that was very disappointing and i am asking myself what we have done incorrectly in our preparations , " said a notably disappointed van gaal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's louis van gaal is not happy mainz were every bit bayern 's equals in the early stages and took a deserved lead on 25 minutes when austrian ivanschitz sent in a shot from 25 metres that slipped in under bayern goalkeeper michael rensing 's outstretched arm .
" that was absolutely terrible and a serious wake-up call for us .
we should n't have lost like that , " rensing said .
things got even worse for louis van gaal 's side seven minutes before the break when bance rose above daniel van buyten to head home from 10 metres and make it 2-0 to thomas tuchel 's side .
with bayern now looking to pull back from a two-goal deficit , van gaal immediately brought on croatian striker ivica olic for midfielder danijel pranijic .
" normally i would n't make a substitution so early but i could have taken off a lot more players , " said an angry van gaal .
mainz did give bayern a lifeline on 47 minutes when nikolce noveski headed a thomas mueller cross into his own net and mueller subsequently had a glorious opportunity to equalize on the hour-mark but his header of van buyten 's pinpoint cross was wide .
van gaal brought on jose sosa for miroslav klose with 18 minutes left as bayern continued to press for an equalizer but the argentine could n't make good a free-kick opportunity four minutes later .
mario gomez hit the side-netting as bayern got ever more desperate but mainz held on for a stunning win .
elsewhere in the league while bayern struggled , bayer leverkusen went top of the table after three games when they hammered freiburg .
" for us it was a very strange game , because freiburg were clearly the better team during the first 35 minutes , " said bayer coach jupp heynckes .
stefan kiessling scored his third goal of the season on 35 minutes to open the scoring at freiburg 's badenova stadium , firing home after being found by simon rolfes .
swiss international tranquillo barnetta doubled leverkusen 's lead two minutes after the restart with a nicely-struck shot from the edge of the area , while a further brace from eren deriyok , sandwiched by barnetta 's second , completed the rout .
" being top of the table means nothing to me , " said leverkusen 's jupp heynckes .
" the way we played in the first half was still unacceptable . "
stuttgart lost ground despite coming back from a goal down at borussia dortmund to salvage a 1-1 draw .

julian schieber could have drawn stuttgart level on the stroke of half-time after playing a combination with cacau but dortmund goalkeeper roman weidenfeller saved the 20-year-old 's shot well .
dortmund paid the price almost immediately after the restart as georg niedermeier headed in from five metres .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 23.08.2009 hungary 's pecs celebrates colorful past and bright future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the town , built around five churches , is known for beautiful architecture one of the cities named as a european capital of culture for 2010 is pecs , hungary .
but 2009 is also giving pecs a reason to celebrate , as diocese pecs plans to toast its 1000-year anniversary . one of the main landmarks in the western hungarian town of pecs is the church of st. maria , in the main square .
the building alone speaks volumes about the long history of this turbulent region . the now-church was once a turkish mosque - which in turn was built on the remains of a 16th century romanesque church .
today , it features features a grand green-copper cupola , prayer niches , keel-arch windows , and the remains of an ottoman painting that includes verses from the koran . from church , to mosque , and back again bishop mihaly mayer says that many catholics still call the downtown church a mosque . “ i always say : ‘ you can say that but its not entirely true , ’ ” mayer said .
“ half of it was built as a christian church , and if you look back even earlier , it was the holy church of bartholomew that was built as a mosque .
i stress that because no one ever mentioned this cathedral in the communist past . ” bishop mayer has been at the head of the pecs diocese for 20 years .
he remembers how the church was stifled under hungary ’ s communist rule , despite the long christian tradition in the region . several decades ago , early christian burial chambers were discovered beneath the church ; they date back to the fourth century , when pecs was a roman city .
today , these are a designated unesco world heritage site . the dioscese of pecs is also referred to as the diocese quinque ecclesia , a name that refers to the fact that the city was originally built around five old christian chapels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city is busy planning for 2010 , but 2009 need not be forgotten these five chapels no longer exist , and no one knows where they once stood .
what is clear is that king stephan founded of the diocese , laying the ground stone for the ancient cathedral in 1009 .
the church was changed and destroyed many times over in the ensuing years . the neo-romanesque cathedral , with its green copper domed roof and four corner towers that rise above the city , was built between 1882 and 1891 .
in places , the cathedral shows signs of its former life as a mosque .
this is especially true in the reliefs in the passageway leading to the lower church , where the heads of the statues of apostles have been broken off . for the 1000th anniversary of the diocese , the church has been restored both inside and out .
the restoration was helped along with state funding , and the state is expected to pick up the tab for the anniversary celebrations as well .
some 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 358,000 -rrb- in culture capital 2010 financing are expected - though by the end of july none of that money had made its way to the diocese , meyer complained . hopes for cultural cooperation in fact , given the number of active construction sites in the city , it appears that pecs is having problems putting its ambitious culture capital plans into action .
nonetheless , the diocese is kicking off its anniversary year with a special church service .
and there has been church-to-church contact between the diocese in pecs and in the city of essen , germany - along with istanbul , another cultural capital for 2010 . " we had a music school from essen here recently .
and i wrote to the auxiliary bishop there that we should make a partnership between the catholic school in pecs and the music school , " meyer said . " it would be nice if we could finish up that agreement in 2010 and take the next step in our relationship .
so we can stress the idea that our students are n't going to europe or that european students are n't coming to us , but that we live in europe . sigrid hoff -lrb- jen -rrb- editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but 2009 is also giving pecs a reason to celebrate , as diocese pecs plans to toast its 1000-year anniversary . one of the main landmarks in the western hungarian town of pecs is the church of st. maria , in the main square .
the building alone speaks volumes about the long history of this turbulent region . the now-church was once a turkish mosque - which in turn was built on the remains of a 16th century romanesque church .
today , it features features a grand green-copper cupola , prayer niches , keel-arch windows , and the remains of an ottoman painting that includes verses from the koran . from church , to mosque , and back again bishop mihaly mayer says that many catholics still call the downtown church a mosque . “ i always say : ‘ you can say that but its not entirely true , ’ ” mayer said .
“ half of it was built as a christian church , and if you look back even earlier , it was the holy church of bartholomew that was built as a mosque .
i stress that because no one ever mentioned this cathedral in the communist past . ” bishop mayer has been at the head of the pecs diocese for 20 years .
he remembers how the church was stifled under hungary ’ s communist rule , despite the long christian tradition in the region . several decades ago , early christian burial chambers were discovered beneath the church ; they date back to the fourth century , when pecs was a roman city .
today , these are a designated unesco world heritage site . the dioscese of pecs is also referred to as the diocese quinque ecclesia , a name that refers to the fact that the city was originally built around five old christian chapels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city is busy planning for 2010 , but 2009 need not be forgotten these five chapels no longer exist , and no one knows where they once stood .

the church was changed and destroyed many times over in the ensuing years . the neo-romanesque cathedral , with its green copper domed roof and four corner towers that rise above the city , was built between 1882 and 1891 .
in places , the cathedral shows signs of its former life as a mosque .
this is especially true in the reliefs in the passageway leading to the lower church , where the heads of the statues of apostles have been broken off . for the 1000th anniversary of the diocese , the church has been restored both inside and out .
the restoration was helped along with state funding , and the state is expected to pick up the tab for the anniversary celebrations as well .
some 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 358,000 -rrb- in culture capital 2010 financing are expected - though by the end of july none of that money had made its way to the diocese , meyer complained . hopes for cultural cooperation in fact , given the number of active construction sites in the city , it appears that pecs is having problems putting its ambitious culture capital plans into action .
nonetheless , the diocese is kicking off its anniversary year with a special church service .
and there has been church-to-church contact between the diocese in pecs and in the city of essen , germany - along with istanbul , another cultural capital for 2010 . " we had a music school from essen here recently .
and i wrote to the auxiliary bishop there that we should make a partnership between the catholic school in pecs and the music school , " meyer said . " it would be nice if we could finish up that agreement in 2010 and take the next step in our relationship .

superenalotto draws are held three times a week , but no one had chosen the correct six numbers since jan .
31 .
with each week without a winner the jackpot continued to grow , ultimately attracting players from neighboring countries , such as germany and switzerland .
the winning six-number combination was 10 - 11- 27 - 45 - 79 - 88 , and the national lottery agency said the chances of getting all of those digits right were 1 in 622 .
the identity of the winner is still unknown , but the winning ticket was purchased at the bar biffi in the central piazza roma where celebrators gathered saturday night .
" we were watching the football match where milan were playing when someone came in saying that we had won the superenalotto , " said the bar 's manager , annamaria ciampini .
" we immediately changed the channel and we started to hear the name of the village , " she added .
" what more can i say ?
i did n't win and i do n't know who did . "
the roughly one billion euros the italian treasury will get from the bets made since the last payout will be a welcome windfall for the cash-strapped government , which has seen tax revenues drop in the worst recession to hit italy since world war ii. hf / ap / afp / dpa / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after months of negotiations , his foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop flew to moscow and met with his counterpart vyacheslav molotov .
on aug .
23 , they signed an agreement , most commonly known as the molotov-ribbentrop pact . the negotiations took place in secret , at the same time as france and britain negotiated an alliance with stalin . though primarily a non-aggression pact , the document incorporated some economic components . provisions under the agreement included : arbitration in the event of a disagreement , consultation and neutrality if either russia or germany went to war against a third power .
the pact also stipulated that neither party could join a group or alliance " directly or indirectly aimed at the other . " only after germany 's defeat in 1945 did details of the secret protocols of the pact emerge . bildunterschrift : as this 1939 cartoon shows , many saw stalin as the butcher of the baltic states secret protocols envisaged carve-up of europe the protocols divided europe into german and soviet spheres of control .
latvia and estonia were to be in the soviet sphere .
lithuania , the part that was adjacent to east prussia , was to come under german control .
later the protocol was altered , assigning lithuania to the soviets as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler and stalin helped each other prepare for wwii to the north , finland was to be carved off for stalin .
poland was to be partitioned , and soon after the pact was signed , both powers invaded the country to take their respective pieces . immediately afterwards , russia invaded finland , but the red army were repelled in the famous " winter war " of 1939/1940 .
after holding their ground for four months and inflicting terrible casualties on the russians , the heavily outnumbered finns were militarily exhausted , and they sued for peace . stalin annexed finland 's eastern province of karelia , which led eventually to finland and germany signing an alliance .
that alliance was to become a key element in hitler 's invasion of russia . quarrelling between germany and the soviets escalated during the summer of 1940 , as the soviet union refused to fulfill its economic commitments under the molotov-ribbentrop pact , and both parties carried out military operations without informing the other . the german war effort was heavily reliant on the russian raw materials that the pact had aimed to secure , and hitler 's plans were increasingly frustrated .
in august , nazi germany annexed part of romania to gain access to oil fields . hitler tears up pact , invades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany attacked the soviet union in 1941 on june 22 , 1941 , hitler abrogated the molotov-ribbentrop pact and launched operation barbarossa .
the multifaceted invasion involved attacks along the entire eastern front , from finland in the north to the black sea in the south . the eventual failure of barbarossa , the largest military operation in history , became the turning point in the nazi 's fortunes . after germany was defeated in 1945 , soviet troops remained in occupation across much of eastern europe , and the baltic states .
what the allies did n't give stalin as war reparations , he annexed anyway , until ending up with much of what the soviets had claimed in the secret protocols of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . details of the secret protocols dividing up europe surfaced during the nuremberg trials in 1945-46 even though the soviets continued to deny their existence .
after the war , they justified their occupation of the baltic states by claiming that the parliaments of latvia , lithuania and estonia had petitioned to join the ussr . the baltic pro-independence movement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two million balts protested against the soviet union in 1989 in the early 1980s , as the soviet union embraced glasnost , the baltic states ' pro-independence protest movement gathered strength .
on aug .
23 , 1986 , large street protests were held across latvia , lithuania and estonia to mark the anniversary of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . in 1989 , the fourth consecutive year of the protests , and the 50th anniversary of the pact , an especially large protest was planned , resulting in the so-called " baltic way " .
two million lithuanians , latvians and estonians linked arms to form a 671-kilometer -lrb- 417-mile -rrb- long human chain , connecting the three capitals , vilnius , riga and tallinn . the baltic pro-independence movements issued a joint declaration to the world and european community , condemning the molotov – ribbentrop pact , and calling it a criminal act . the declaration said independence for the baltics was a question of " inalienable human rights , " and accused the european community of ignoring the last colonies of the hitler – stalin era . in december 1989 , soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and the soviet congress of people 's deputies signed a report condemning the molotov-ribbentrop pact . on march 11 , 1990 , less than six months after the baltic way , lithuania declared independence , the first soviet state to do so .

after months of negotiations , his foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop flew to moscow and met with his counterpart vyacheslav molotov .
on aug .
23 , they signed an agreement , most commonly known as the molotov-ribbentrop pact . the negotiations took place in secret , at the same time as france and britain negotiated an alliance with stalin . though primarily a non-aggression pact , the document incorporated some economic components . provisions under the agreement included : arbitration in the event of a disagreement , consultation and neutrality if either russia or germany went to war against a third power .
the pact also stipulated that neither party could join a group or alliance " directly or indirectly aimed at the other . " only after germany 's defeat in 1945 did details of the secret protocols of the pact emerge . bildunterschrift : as this 1939 cartoon shows , many saw stalin as the butcher of the baltic states secret protocols envisaged carve-up of europe the protocols divided europe into german and soviet spheres of control .
latvia and estonia were to be in the soviet sphere .
lithuania , the part that was adjacent to east prussia , was to come under german control .
later the protocol was altered , assigning lithuania to the soviets as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler and stalin helped each other prepare for wwii to the north , finland was to be carved off for stalin .
poland was to be partitioned , and soon after the pact was signed , both powers invaded the country to take their respective pieces . immediately afterwards , russia invaded finland , but the red army were repelled in the famous " winter war " of 1939/1940 .
after holding their ground for four months and inflicting terrible casualties on the russians , the heavily outnumbered finns were militarily exhausted , and they sued for peace . stalin annexed finland 's eastern province of karelia , which led eventually to finland and germany signing an alliance .
that alliance was to become a key element in hitler 's invasion of russia . quarrelling between germany and the soviets escalated during the summer of 1940 , as the soviet union refused to fulfill its economic commitments under the molotov-ribbentrop pact , and both parties carried out military operations without informing the other . the german war effort was heavily reliant on the russian raw materials that the pact had aimed to secure , and hitler 's plans were increasingly frustrated .
in august , nazi germany annexed part of romania to gain access to oil fields . hitler tears up pact , invades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany attacked the soviet union in 1941 on june 22 , 1941 , hitler abrogated the molotov-ribbentrop pact and launched operation barbarossa .
the multifaceted invasion involved attacks along the entire eastern front , from finland in the north to the black sea in the south . the eventual failure of barbarossa , the largest military operation in history , became the turning point in the nazi 's fortunes . after germany was defeated in 1945 , soviet troops remained in occupation across much of eastern europe , and the baltic states .
what the allies did n't give stalin as war reparations , he annexed anyway , until ending up with much of what the soviets had claimed in the secret protocols of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . details of the secret protocols dividing up europe surfaced during the nuremberg trials in 1945-46 even though the soviets continued to deny their existence .
after the war , they justified their occupation of the baltic states by claiming that the parliaments of latvia , lithuania and estonia had petitioned to join the ussr . the baltic pro-independence movement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two million balts protested against the soviet union in 1989 in the early 1980s , as the soviet union embraced glasnost , the baltic states ' pro-independence protest movement gathered strength .
on aug .
23 , 1986 , large street protests were held across latvia , lithuania and estonia to mark the anniversary of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . in 1989 , the fourth consecutive year of the protests , and the 50th anniversary of the pact , an especially large protest was planned , resulting in the so-called " baltic way " .
two million lithuanians , latvians and estonians linked arms to form a 671-kilometer -lrb- 417-mile -rrb- long human chain , connecting the three capitals , vilnius , riga and tallinn . the baltic pro-independence movements issued a joint declaration to the world and european community , condemning the molotov – ribbentrop pact , and calling it a criminal act . the declaration said independence for the baltics was a question of " inalienable human rights , " and accused the european community of ignoring the last colonies of the hitler – stalin era . in december 1989 , soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and the soviet congress of people 's deputies signed a report condemning the molotov-ribbentrop pact . on march 11 , 1990 , less than six months after the baltic way , lithuania declared independence , the first soviet state to do so .
within a year , all three baltic states had declared independence and were internationally recognized as sovereign states . ch / av / afp / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 23.08.2009 bayern munich 's indifferent start becomes a nightmare großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz goalscorer aristide bance finished off bayern bayern 's new coach louis van gaal is still waiting for his first bundesliga win since taking charge in july .
he was also visibly angry when he faced the press after watching his team lose 2-1 to newly-promoted mainz . three games into the new bundesliga season bayern munich remain without a win after goals saturday from andreas ivanschitz and aristide bance helped newly-promoted mainz 05 to a shock 2-1 victory over the german giants .
meanwhile as a bayern team missing franck ribery and luca toni continued to struggle under new coach louis van gaal , bayer leverkusen maintained their strong start and go to the top on goal difference courtesy of a 5-0 mauling of sc freiburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's tranquillo barnetta leverkusen are the new pacesetters with seven points from three games , level with schalke 04 , who dropped their first points of the season when they were held to a goalless draw on friday at hoffenheim .
vfb stuttgart and borussia dortmund both lost ground on the top of the table after playing out a 1-1 draw while a surprise victory for mainz sees them move up to fourth on five points , level with eintracht frankfurt , who played out a scoreless draw with cologne .
champions vfl wolfsburg sit third on six points ahead of their visit to sv hamburg on sunday while munich now languishes in 12th on just two points .
bayern 's boss not happy " that was very disappointing and i am asking myself what we have done incorrectly in our preparations , " said a notably disappointed van gaal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's louis van gaal is not happy mainz were every bit bayern 's equals in the early stages and took a deserved lead on 25 minutes when austrian ivanschitz sent in a shot from 25 metres that slipped in under bayern goalkeeper michael rensing 's outstretched arm .
" that was absolutely terrible and a serious wake-up call for us .
we should n't have lost like that , " rensing said .
things got even worse for louis van gaal 's side seven minutes before the break when bance rose above daniel van buyten to head home from 10 metres and make it 2-0 to thomas tuchel 's side .
with bayern now looking to pull back from a two-goal deficit , van gaal immediately brought on croatian striker ivica olic for midfielder danijel pranijic .
" normally i would n't make a substitution so early but i could have taken off a lot more players , " said an angry van gaal .
mainz did give bayern a lifeline on 47 minutes when nikolce noveski headed a thomas mueller cross into his own net and mueller subsequently had a glorious opportunity to equalize on the hour-mark but his header of van buyten 's pinpoint cross was wide .
van gaal brought on jose sosa for miroslav klose with 18 minutes left as bayern continued to press for an equalizer but the argentine could n't make good a free-kick opportunity four minutes later .
mario gomez hit the side-netting as bayern got ever more desperate but mainz held on for a stunning win .
elsewhere in the league while bayern struggled , bayer leverkusen went top of the table after three games when they hammered freiburg .
" for us it was a very strange game , because freiburg were clearly the better team during the first 35 minutes , " said bayer coach jupp heynckes .
stefan kiessling scored his third goal of the season on 35 minutes to open the scoring at freiburg 's badenova stadium , firing home after being found by simon rolfes .
swiss international tranquillo barnetta doubled leverkusen 's lead two minutes after the restart with a nicely-struck shot from the edge of the area , while a further brace from eren deriyok , sandwiched by barnetta 's second , completed the rout .
" being top of the table means nothing to me , " said leverkusen 's jupp heynckes .
" the way we played in the first half was still unacceptable . "
stuttgart lost ground despite coming back from a goal down at borussia dortmund to salvage a 1-1 draw .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's georg niedermeier , center , celebrates his goal nelson valdez put dortmund ahead on 27 minutes , nuri sahin setting the paraguayan up to finish clinically , placing the ball beyond the reach of jens lehmann .
julian schieber could have drawn stuttgart level on the stroke of half-time after playing a combination with cacau but dortmund goalkeeper roman weidenfeller saved the 20-year-old 's shot well .
dortmund paid the price almost immediately after the restart as georg niedermeier headed in from five metres .
in the day 's other game , jiri stajner scored twice and could also afford to miss a penalty as hanover 96 beat nuremberg 2-0 .

he remembers how the church was stifled under hungary ’ s communist rule , despite the long christian tradition in the region . several decades ago , early christian burial chambers were discovered beneath the church ; they date back to the fourth century , when pecs was a roman city .

but 2009 is also giving pecs a reason to celebrate , as diocese pecs plans to toast its 1000-year anniversary . one of the main landmarks in the western hungarian town of pecs is the church of st. maria , in the main square .
the building alone speaks volumes about the long history of this turbulent region . the now-church was once a turkish mosque - which in turn was built on the remains of a 16th century romanesque church .
today , it features features a grand green-copper cupola , prayer niches , keel-arch windows , and the remains of an ottoman painting that includes verses from the koran . from church , to mosque , and back again bishop mihaly mayer says that many catholics still call the downtown church a mosque . “ i always say : ‘ you can say that but its not entirely true , ’ ” mayer said .
“ half of it was built as a christian church , and if you look back even earlier , it was the holy church of bartholomew that was built as a mosque .
i stress that because no one ever mentioned this cathedral in the communist past . ” bishop mayer has been at the head of the pecs diocese for 20 years .
he remembers how the church was stifled under hungary ’ s communist rule , despite the long christian tradition in the region . several decades ago , early christian burial chambers were discovered beneath the church ; they date back to the fourth century , when pecs was a roman city .
today , these are a designated unesco world heritage site . the dioscese of pecs is also referred to as the diocese quinque ecclesia , a name that refers to the fact that the city was originally built around five old christian chapels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city is busy planning for 2010 , but 2009 need not be forgotten these five chapels no longer exist , and no one knows where they once stood .
what is clear is that king stephan founded of the diocese , laying the ground stone for the ancient cathedral in 1009 .
the church was changed and destroyed many times over in the ensuing years . the neo-romanesque cathedral , with its green copper domed roof and four corner towers that rise above the city , was built between 1882 and 1891 .
in places , the cathedral shows signs of its former life as a mosque .
this is especially true in the reliefs in the passageway leading to the lower church , where the heads of the statues of apostles have been broken off . for the 1000th anniversary of the diocese , the church has been restored both inside and out .
the restoration was helped along with state funding , and the state is expected to pick up the tab for the anniversary celebrations as well .
some 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 358,000 -rrb- in culture capital 2010 financing are expected - though by the end of july none of that money had made its way to the diocese , meyer complained . hopes for cultural cooperation in fact , given the number of active construction sites in the city , it appears that pecs is having problems putting its ambitious culture capital plans into action .
nonetheless , the diocese is kicking off its anniversary year with a special church service .
and there has been church-to-church contact between the diocese in pecs and in the city of essen , germany - along with istanbul , another cultural capital for 2010 . " we had a music school from essen here recently .
and i wrote to the auxiliary bishop there that we should make a partnership between the catholic school in pecs and the music school , " meyer said . " it would be nice if we could finish up that agreement in 2010 and take the next step in our relationship .

he remembers how the church was stifled under hungary ’ s communist rule , despite the long christian tradition in the region . several decades ago , early christian burial chambers were discovered beneath the church ; they date back to the fourth century , when pecs was a roman city .
today , these are a designated unesco world heritage site . the dioscese of pecs is also referred to as the diocese quinque ecclesia , a name that refers to the fact that the city was originally built around five old christian chapels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city is busy planning for 2010 , but 2009 need not be forgotten these five chapels no longer exist , and no one knows where they once stood .
what is clear is that king stephan founded of the diocese , laying the ground stone for the ancient cathedral in 1009 .
the church was changed and destroyed many times over in the ensuing years . the neo-romanesque cathedral , with its green copper domed roof and four corner towers that rise above the city , was built between 1882 and 1891 .
in places , the cathedral shows signs of its former life as a mosque .
this is especially true in the reliefs in the passageway leading to the lower church , where the heads of the statues of apostles have been broken off . for the 1000th anniversary of the diocese , the church has been restored both inside and out .
the restoration was helped along with state funding , and the state is expected to pick up the tab for the anniversary celebrations as well .

nonetheless , the diocese is kicking off its anniversary year with a special church service .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 23.08.2009 bayern munich 's indifferent start becomes a nightmare großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz goalscorer aristide bance finished off bayern bayern 's new coach louis van gaal is still waiting for his first bundesliga win since taking charge in july .
he was also visibly angry when he faced the press after watching his team lose 2-1 to newly-promoted mainz . three games into the new bundesliga season bayern munich remain without a win after goals saturday from andreas ivanschitz and aristide bance helped newly-promoted mainz 05 to a shock 2-1 victory over the german giants .
meanwhile as a bayern team missing franck ribery and luca toni continued to struggle under new coach louis van gaal , bayer leverkusen maintained their strong start and go to the top on goal difference courtesy of a 5-0 mauling of sc freiburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's tranquillo barnetta leverkusen are the new pacesetters with seven points from three games , level with schalke 04 , who dropped their first points of the season when they were held to a goalless draw on friday at hoffenheim .
vfb stuttgart and borussia dortmund both lost ground on the top of the table after playing out a 1-1 draw while a surprise victory for mainz sees them move up to fourth on five points , level with eintracht frankfurt , who played out a scoreless draw with cologne .
champions vfl wolfsburg sit third on six points ahead of their visit to sv hamburg on sunday while munich now languishes in 12th on just two points .
bayern 's boss not happy " that was very disappointing and i am asking myself what we have done incorrectly in our preparations , " said a notably disappointed van gaal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's louis van gaal is not happy mainz were every bit bayern 's equals in the early stages and took a deserved lead on 25 minutes when austrian ivanschitz sent in a shot from 25 metres that slipped in under bayern goalkeeper michael rensing 's outstretched arm .
" that was absolutely terrible and a serious wake-up call for us .
we should n't have lost like that , " rensing said .
things got even worse for louis van gaal 's side seven minutes before the break when bance rose above daniel van buyten to head home from 10 metres and make it 2-0 to thomas tuchel 's side .
with bayern now looking to pull back from a two-goal deficit , van gaal immediately brought on croatian striker ivica olic for midfielder danijel pranijic .
" normally i would n't make a substitution so early but i could have taken off a lot more players , " said an angry van gaal .
mainz did give bayern a lifeline on 47 minutes when nikolce noveski headed a thomas mueller cross into his own net and mueller subsequently had a glorious opportunity to equalize on the hour-mark but his header of van buyten 's pinpoint cross was wide .
van gaal brought on jose sosa for miroslav klose with 18 minutes left as bayern continued to press for an equalizer but the argentine could n't make good a free-kick opportunity four minutes later .
mario gomez hit the side-netting as bayern got ever more desperate but mainz held on for a stunning win .
elsewhere in the league while bayern struggled , bayer leverkusen went top of the table after three games when they hammered freiburg .
" for us it was a very strange game , because freiburg were clearly the better team during the first 35 minutes , " said bayer coach jupp heynckes .
stefan kiessling scored his third goal of the season on 35 minutes to open the scoring at freiburg 's badenova stadium , firing home after being found by simon rolfes .
swiss international tranquillo barnetta doubled leverkusen 's lead two minutes after the restart with a nicely-struck shot from the edge of the area , while a further brace from eren deriyok , sandwiched by barnetta 's second , completed the rout .
" being top of the table means nothing to me , " said leverkusen 's jupp heynckes .
" the way we played in the first half was still unacceptable . "
stuttgart lost ground despite coming back from a goal down at borussia dortmund to salvage a 1-1 draw .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's georg niedermeier , center , celebrates his goal nelson valdez put dortmund ahead on 27 minutes , nuri sahin setting the paraguayan up to finish clinically , placing the ball beyond the reach of jens lehmann .
julian schieber could have drawn stuttgart level on the stroke of half-time after playing a combination with cacau but dortmund goalkeeper roman weidenfeller saved the 20-year-old 's shot well .
dortmund paid the price almost immediately after the restart as georg niedermeier headed in from five metres .
in the day 's other game , jiri stajner scored twice and could also afford to miss a penalty as hanover 96 beat nuremberg 2-0 .

after months of negotiations , his foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop flew to moscow and met with his counterpart vyacheslav molotov .
on aug .
23 , they signed an agreement , most commonly known as the molotov-ribbentrop pact . the negotiations took place in secret , at the same time as france and britain negotiated an alliance with stalin . though primarily a non-aggression pact , the document incorporated some economic components . provisions under the agreement included : arbitration in the event of a disagreement , consultation and neutrality if either russia or germany went to war against a third power .
the pact also stipulated that neither party could join a group or alliance " directly or indirectly aimed at the other . " only after germany 's defeat in 1945 did details of the secret protocols of the pact emerge . bildunterschrift : as this 1939 cartoon shows , many saw stalin as the butcher of the baltic states secret protocols envisaged carve-up of europe the protocols divided europe into german and soviet spheres of control .
latvia and estonia were to be in the soviet sphere .
lithuania , the part that was adjacent to east prussia , was to come under german control .
later the protocol was altered , assigning lithuania to the soviets as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler and stalin helped each other prepare for wwii to the north , finland was to be carved off for stalin .
poland was to be partitioned , and soon after the pact was signed , both powers invaded the country to take their respective pieces . immediately afterwards , russia invaded finland , but the red army were repelled in the famous " winter war " of 1939/1940 .
after holding their ground for four months and inflicting terrible casualties on the russians , the heavily outnumbered finns were militarily exhausted , and they sued for peace . stalin annexed finland 's eastern province of karelia , which led eventually to finland and germany signing an alliance .
that alliance was to become a key element in hitler 's invasion of russia . quarrelling between germany and the soviets escalated during the summer of 1940 , as the soviet union refused to fulfill its economic commitments under the molotov-ribbentrop pact , and both parties carried out military operations without informing the other . the german war effort was heavily reliant on the russian raw materials that the pact had aimed to secure , and hitler 's plans were increasingly frustrated .
in august , nazi germany annexed part of romania to gain access to oil fields . hitler tears up pact , invades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany attacked the soviet union in 1941 on june 22 , 1941 , hitler abrogated the molotov-ribbentrop pact and launched operation barbarossa .
the multifaceted invasion involved attacks along the entire eastern front , from finland in the north to the black sea in the south . the eventual failure of barbarossa , the largest military operation in history , became the turning point in the nazi 's fortunes . after germany was defeated in 1945 , soviet troops remained in occupation across much of eastern europe , and the baltic states .
what the allies did n't give stalin as war reparations , he annexed anyway , until ending up with much of what the soviets had claimed in the secret protocols of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . details of the secret protocols dividing up europe surfaced during the nuremberg trials in 1945-46 even though the soviets continued to deny their existence .
after the war , they justified their occupation of the baltic states by claiming that the parliaments of latvia , lithuania and estonia had petitioned to join the ussr . the baltic pro-independence movement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two million balts protested against the soviet union in 1989 in the early 1980s , as the soviet union embraced glasnost , the baltic states ' pro-independence protest movement gathered strength .
on aug .
23 , 1986 , large street protests were held across latvia , lithuania and estonia to mark the anniversary of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . in 1989 , the fourth consecutive year of the protests , and the 50th anniversary of the pact , an especially large protest was planned , resulting in the so-called " baltic way " .
two million lithuanians , latvians and estonians linked arms to form a 671-kilometer -lrb- 417-mile -rrb- long human chain , connecting the three capitals , vilnius , riga and tallinn . the baltic pro-independence movements issued a joint declaration to the world and european community , condemning the molotov – ribbentrop pact , and calling it a criminal act . the declaration said independence for the baltics was a question of " inalienable human rights , " and accused the european community of ignoring the last colonies of the hitler – stalin era . in december 1989 , soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and the soviet congress of people 's deputies signed a report condemning the molotov-ribbentrop pact . on march 11 , 1990 , less than six months after the baltic way , lithuania declared independence , the first soviet state to do so .
within a year , all three baltic states had declared independence and were internationally recognized as sovereign states . ch / av / afp / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but 2009 is also giving pecs a reason to celebrate , as diocese pecs plans to toast its 1000-year anniversary . one of the main landmarks in the western hungarian town of pecs is the church of st. maria , in the main square .
the building alone speaks volumes about the long history of this turbulent region . the now-church was once a turkish mosque - which in turn was built on the remains of a 16th century romanesque church .
today , it features features a grand green-copper cupola , prayer niches , keel-arch windows , and the remains of an ottoman painting that includes verses from the koran . from church , to mosque , and back again bishop mihaly mayer says that many catholics still call the downtown church a mosque . “ i always say : ‘ you can say that but its not entirely true , ’ ” mayer said .
“ half of it was built as a christian church , and if you look back even earlier , it was the holy church of bartholomew that was built as a mosque .
i stress that because no one ever mentioned this cathedral in the communist past . ” bishop mayer has been at the head of the pecs diocese for 20 years .
he remembers how the church was stifled under hungary ’ s communist rule , despite the long christian tradition in the region . several decades ago , early christian burial chambers were discovered beneath the church ; they date back to the fourth century , when pecs was a roman city .
today , these are a designated unesco world heritage site . the dioscese of pecs is also referred to as the diocese quinque ecclesia , a name that refers to the fact that the city was originally built around five old christian chapels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city is busy planning for 2010 , but 2009 need not be forgotten these five chapels no longer exist , and no one knows where they once stood .
what is clear is that king stephan founded of the diocese , laying the ground stone for the ancient cathedral in 1009 .
the church was changed and destroyed many times over in the ensuing years . the neo-romanesque cathedral , with its green copper domed roof and four corner towers that rise above the city , was built between 1882 and 1891 .
in places , the cathedral shows signs of its former life as a mosque .
this is especially true in the reliefs in the passageway leading to the lower church , where the heads of the statues of apostles have been broken off . for the 1000th anniversary of the diocese , the church has been restored both inside and out .
the restoration was helped along with state funding , and the state is expected to pick up the tab for the anniversary celebrations as well .
some 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 358,000 -rrb- in culture capital 2010 financing are expected - though by the end of july none of that money had made its way to the diocese , meyer complained . hopes for cultural cooperation in fact , given the number of active construction sites in the city , it appears that pecs is having problems putting its ambitious culture capital plans into action .
nonetheless , the diocese is kicking off its anniversary year with a special church service .
and there has been church-to-church contact between the diocese in pecs and in the city of essen , germany - along with istanbul , another cultural capital for 2010 . " we had a music school from essen here recently .
and i wrote to the auxiliary bishop there that we should make a partnership between the catholic school in pecs and the music school , " meyer said . " it would be nice if we could finish up that agreement in 2010 and take the next step in our relationship .
so we can stress the idea that our students are n't going to europe or that european students are n't coming to us , but that we live in europe . sigrid hoff -lrb- jen -rrb- editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after months of negotiations , his foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop flew to moscow and met with his counterpart vyacheslav molotov .
on aug .

23 , they signed an agreement , most commonly known as the molotov-ribbentrop pact . the negotiations took place in secret , at the same time as france and britain negotiated an alliance with stalin . though primarily a non-aggression pact , the document incorporated some economic components . provisions under the agreement included : arbitration in the event of a disagreement , consultation and neutrality if either russia or germany went to war against a third power .
the pact also stipulated that neither party could join a group or alliance " directly or indirectly aimed at the other . " only after germany 's defeat in 1945 did details of the secret protocols of the pact emerge . bildunterschrift : as this 1939 cartoon shows , many saw stalin as the butcher of the baltic states secret protocols envisaged carve-up of europe the protocols divided europe into german and soviet spheres of control .
latvia and estonia were to be in the soviet sphere .
lithuania , the part that was adjacent to east prussia , was to come under german control .
later the protocol was altered , assigning lithuania to the soviets as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler and stalin helped each other prepare for wwii to the north , finland was to be carved off for stalin .
poland was to be partitioned , and soon after the pact was signed , both powers invaded the country to take their respective pieces . immediately afterwards , russia invaded finland , but the red army were repelled in the famous " winter war " of 1939/1940 .
after holding their ground for four months and inflicting terrible casualties on the russians , the heavily outnumbered finns were militarily exhausted , and they sued for peace . stalin annexed finland 's eastern province of karelia , which led eventually to finland and germany signing an alliance .
that alliance was to become a key element in hitler 's invasion of russia . quarrelling between germany and the soviets escalated during the summer of 1940 , as the soviet union refused to fulfill its economic commitments under the molotov-ribbentrop pact , and both parties carried out military operations without informing the other . the german war effort was heavily reliant on the russian raw materials that the pact had aimed to secure , and hitler 's plans were increasingly frustrated .
in august , nazi germany annexed part of romania to gain access to oil fields . hitler tears up pact , invades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany attacked the soviet union in 1941 on june 22 , 1941 , hitler abrogated the molotov-ribbentrop pact and launched operation barbarossa .
the multifaceted invasion involved attacks along the entire eastern front , from finland in the north to the black sea in the south . the eventual failure of barbarossa , the largest military operation in history , became the turning point in the nazi 's fortunes . after germany was defeated in 1945 , soviet troops remained in occupation across much of eastern europe , and the baltic states .
what the allies did n't give stalin as war reparations , he annexed anyway , until ending up with much of what the soviets had claimed in the secret protocols of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . details of the secret protocols dividing up europe surfaced during the nuremberg trials in 1945-46 even though the soviets continued to deny their existence .
after the war , they justified their occupation of the baltic states by claiming that the parliaments of latvia , lithuania and estonia had petitioned to join the ussr . the baltic pro-independence movement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two million balts protested against the soviet union in 1989 in the early 1980s , as the soviet union embraced glasnost , the baltic states ' pro-independence protest movement gathered strength .
on aug .
23 , 1986 , large street protests were held across latvia , lithuania and estonia to mark the anniversary of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . in 1989 , the fourth consecutive year of the protests , and the 50th anniversary of the pact , an especially large protest was planned , resulting in the so-called " baltic way " .
two million lithuanians , latvians and estonians linked arms to form a 671-kilometer -lrb- 417-mile -rrb- long human chain , connecting the three capitals , vilnius , riga and tallinn . the baltic pro-independence movements issued a joint declaration to the world and european community , condemning the molotov – ribbentrop pact , and calling it a criminal act . the declaration said independence for the baltics was a question of " inalienable human rights , " and accused the european community of ignoring the last colonies of the hitler – stalin era . in december 1989 , soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and the soviet congress of people 's deputies signed a report condemning the molotov-ribbentrop pact . on march 11 , 1990 , less than six months after the baltic way , lithuania declared independence , the first soviet state to do so .
within a year , all three baltic states had declared independence and were internationally recognized as sovereign states . ch / av / afp / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 23.08.2009 bayern munich 's indifferent start becomes a nightmare großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz goalscorer aristide bance finished off bayern bayern 's new coach louis van gaal is still waiting for his first bundesliga win since taking charge in july .
he was also visibly angry when he faced the press after watching his team lose 2-1 to newly-promoted mainz . three games into the new bundesliga season bayern munich remain without a win after goals saturday from andreas ivanschitz and aristide bance helped newly-promoted mainz 05 to a shock 2-1 victory over the german giants .
meanwhile as a bayern team missing franck ribery and luca toni continued to struggle under new coach louis van gaal , bayer leverkusen maintained their strong start and go to the top on goal difference courtesy of a 5-0 mauling of sc freiburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's tranquillo barnetta leverkusen are the new pacesetters with seven points from three games , level with schalke 04 , who dropped their first points of the season when they were held to a goalless draw on friday at hoffenheim .
vfb stuttgart and borussia dortmund both lost ground on the top of the table after playing out a 1-1 draw while a surprise victory for mainz sees them move up to fourth on five points , level with eintracht frankfurt , who played out a scoreless draw with cologne .
champions vfl wolfsburg sit third on six points ahead of their visit to sv hamburg on sunday while munich now languishes in 12th on just two points .
bayern 's boss not happy " that was very disappointing and i am asking myself what we have done incorrectly in our preparations , " said a notably disappointed van gaal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's louis van gaal is not happy mainz were every bit bayern 's equals in the early stages and took a deserved lead on 25 minutes when austrian ivanschitz sent in a shot from 25 metres that slipped in under bayern goalkeeper michael rensing 's outstretched arm .
" that was absolutely terrible and a serious wake-up call for us .
we should n't have lost like that , " rensing said .
things got even worse for louis van gaal 's side seven minutes before the break when bance rose above daniel van buyten to head home from 10 metres and make it 2-0 to thomas tuchel 's side .
with bayern now looking to pull back from a two-goal deficit , van gaal immediately brought on croatian striker ivica olic for midfielder danijel pranijic .
" normally i would n't make a substitution so early but i could have taken off a lot more players , " said an angry van gaal .
mainz did give bayern a lifeline on 47 minutes when nikolce noveski headed a thomas mueller cross into his own net and mueller subsequently had a glorious opportunity to equalize on the hour-mark but his header of van buyten 's pinpoint cross was wide .
van gaal brought on jose sosa for miroslav klose with 18 minutes left as bayern continued to press for an equalizer but the argentine could n't make good a free-kick opportunity four minutes later .
mario gomez hit the side-netting as bayern got ever more desperate but mainz held on for a stunning win .
elsewhere in the league while bayern struggled , bayer leverkusen went top of the table after three games when they hammered freiburg .
" for us it was a very strange game , because freiburg were clearly the better team during the first 35 minutes , " said bayer coach jupp heynckes .
stefan kiessling scored his third goal of the season on 35 minutes to open the scoring at freiburg 's badenova stadium , firing home after being found by simon rolfes .
swiss international tranquillo barnetta doubled leverkusen 's lead two minutes after the restart with a nicely-struck shot from the edge of the area , while a further brace from eren deriyok , sandwiched by barnetta 's second , completed the rout .
" being top of the table means nothing to me , " said leverkusen 's jupp heynckes .
" the way we played in the first half was still unacceptable . "
stuttgart lost ground despite coming back from a goal down at borussia dortmund to salvage a 1-1 draw .

julian schieber could have drawn stuttgart level on the stroke of half-time after playing a combination with cacau but dortmund goalkeeper roman weidenfeller saved the 20-year-old 's shot well .
dortmund paid the price almost immediately after the restart as georg niedermeier headed in from five metres .
in the day 's other game , jiri stajner scored twice and could also afford to miss a penalty as hanover 96 beat nuremberg 2-0 .

superenalotto draws are held three times a week , but no one had chosen the correct six numbers since jan .

the identity of the winner is still unknown , but the winning ticket was purchased at the bar biffi in the central piazza roma where celebrators gathered saturday night .
" we were watching the football match where milan were playing when someone came in saying that we had won the superenalotto , " said the bar 's manager , annamaria ciampini .

after months of negotiations , his foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop flew to moscow and met with his counterpart vyacheslav molotov .
on aug .
23 , they signed an agreement , most commonly known as the molotov-ribbentrop pact . the negotiations took place in secret , at the same time as france and britain negotiated an alliance with stalin . though primarily a non-aggression pact , the document incorporated some economic components . provisions under the agreement included : arbitration in the event of a disagreement , consultation and neutrality if either russia or germany went to war against a third power .
the pact also stipulated that neither party could join a group or alliance " directly or indirectly aimed at the other . " only after germany 's defeat in 1945 did details of the secret protocols of the pact emerge . bildunterschrift : as this 1939 cartoon shows , many saw stalin as the butcher of the baltic states secret protocols envisaged carve-up of europe the protocols divided europe into german and soviet spheres of control .
latvia and estonia were to be in the soviet sphere .
lithuania , the part that was adjacent to east prussia , was to come under german control .
later the protocol was altered , assigning lithuania to the soviets as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler and stalin helped each other prepare for wwii to the north , finland was to be carved off for stalin .
poland was to be partitioned , and soon after the pact was signed , both powers invaded the country to take their respective pieces . immediately afterwards , russia invaded finland , but the red army were repelled in the famous " winter war " of 1939/1940 .
after holding their ground for four months and inflicting terrible casualties on the russians , the heavily outnumbered finns were militarily exhausted , and they sued for peace . stalin annexed finland 's eastern province of karelia , which led eventually to finland and germany signing an alliance .
that alliance was to become a key element in hitler 's invasion of russia . quarrelling between germany and the soviets escalated during the summer of 1940 , as the soviet union refused to fulfill its economic commitments under the molotov-ribbentrop pact , and both parties carried out military operations without informing the other . the german war effort was heavily reliant on the russian raw materials that the pact had aimed to secure , and hitler 's plans were increasingly frustrated .
in august , nazi germany annexed part of romania to gain access to oil fields . hitler tears up pact , invades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany attacked the soviet union in 1941 on june 22 , 1941 , hitler abrogated the molotov-ribbentrop pact and launched operation barbarossa .
the multifaceted invasion involved attacks along the entire eastern front , from finland in the north to the black sea in the south . the eventual failure of barbarossa , the largest military operation in history , became the turning point in the nazi 's fortunes . after germany was defeated in 1945 , soviet troops remained in occupation across much of eastern europe , and the baltic states .
what the allies did n't give stalin as war reparations , he annexed anyway , until ending up with much of what the soviets had claimed in the secret protocols of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . details of the secret protocols dividing up europe surfaced during the nuremberg trials in 1945-46 even though the soviets continued to deny their existence .
after the war , they justified their occupation of the baltic states by claiming that the parliaments of latvia , lithuania and estonia had petitioned to join the ussr . the baltic pro-independence movement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two million balts protested against the soviet union in 1989 in the early 1980s , as the soviet union embraced glasnost , the baltic states ' pro-independence protest movement gathered strength .
on aug .
23 , 1986 , large street protests were held across latvia , lithuania and estonia to mark the anniversary of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . in 1989 , the fourth consecutive year of the protests , and the 50th anniversary of the pact , an especially large protest was planned , resulting in the so-called " baltic way " .
two million lithuanians , latvians and estonians linked arms to form a 671-kilometer -lrb- 417-mile -rrb- long human chain , connecting the three capitals , vilnius , riga and tallinn . the baltic pro-independence movements issued a joint declaration to the world and european community , condemning the molotov – ribbentrop pact , and calling it a criminal act . the declaration said independence for the baltics was a question of " inalienable human rights , " and accused the european community of ignoring the last colonies of the hitler – stalin era . in december 1989 , soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and the soviet congress of people 's deputies signed a report condemning the molotov-ribbentrop pact . on march 11 , 1990 , less than six months after the baltic way , lithuania declared independence , the first soviet state to do so .
within a year , all three baltic states had declared independence and were internationally recognized as sovereign states . ch / av / afp / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after months of negotiations , his foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop flew to moscow and met with his counterpart vyacheslav molotov .
on aug .
23 , they signed an agreement , most commonly known as the molotov-ribbentrop pact . the negotiations took place in secret , at the same time as france and britain negotiated an alliance with stalin . though primarily a non-aggression pact , the document incorporated some economic components . provisions under the agreement included : arbitration in the event of a disagreement , consultation and neutrality if either russia or germany went to war against a third power .
the pact also stipulated that neither party could join a group or alliance " directly or indirectly aimed at the other . " only after germany 's defeat in 1945 did details of the secret protocols of the pact emerge . bildunterschrift : as this 1939 cartoon shows , many saw stalin as the butcher of the baltic states secret protocols envisaged carve-up of europe the protocols divided europe into german and soviet spheres of control .
latvia and estonia were to be in the soviet sphere .
lithuania , the part that was adjacent to east prussia , was to come under german control .
later the protocol was altered , assigning lithuania to the soviets as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler and stalin helped each other prepare for wwii to the north , finland was to be carved off for stalin .
poland was to be partitioned , and soon after the pact was signed , both powers invaded the country to take their respective pieces . immediately afterwards , russia invaded finland , but the red army were repelled in the famous " winter war " of 1939/1940 .
after holding their ground for four months and inflicting terrible casualties on the russians , the heavily outnumbered finns were militarily exhausted , and they sued for peace . stalin annexed finland 's eastern province of karelia , which led eventually to finland and germany signing an alliance .
that alliance was to become a key element in hitler 's invasion of russia . quarrelling between germany and the soviets escalated during the summer of 1940 , as the soviet union refused to fulfill its economic commitments under the molotov-ribbentrop pact , and both parties carried out military operations without informing the other . the german war effort was heavily reliant on the russian raw materials that the pact had aimed to secure , and hitler 's plans were increasingly frustrated .
in august , nazi germany annexed part of romania to gain access to oil fields . hitler tears up pact , invades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany attacked the soviet union in 1941 on june 22 , 1941 , hitler abrogated the molotov-ribbentrop pact and launched operation barbarossa .
the multifaceted invasion involved attacks along the entire eastern front , from finland in the north to the black sea in the south . the eventual failure of barbarossa , the largest military operation in history , became the turning point in the nazi 's fortunes . after germany was defeated in 1945 , soviet troops remained in occupation across much of eastern europe , and the baltic states .
what the allies did n't give stalin as war reparations , he annexed anyway , until ending up with much of what the soviets had claimed in the secret protocols of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . details of the secret protocols dividing up europe surfaced during the nuremberg trials in 1945-46 even though the soviets continued to deny their existence .
after the war , they justified their occupation of the baltic states by claiming that the parliaments of latvia , lithuania and estonia had petitioned to join the ussr . the baltic pro-independence movement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two million balts protested against the soviet union in 1989 in the early 1980s , as the soviet union embraced glasnost , the baltic states ' pro-independence protest movement gathered strength .
on aug .
23 , 1986 , large street protests were held across latvia , lithuania and estonia to mark the anniversary of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . in 1989 , the fourth consecutive year of the protests , and the 50th anniversary of the pact , an especially large protest was planned , resulting in the so-called " baltic way " .
two million lithuanians , latvians and estonians linked arms to form a 671-kilometer -lrb- 417-mile -rrb- long human chain , connecting the three capitals , vilnius , riga and tallinn . the baltic pro-independence movements issued a joint declaration to the world and european community , condemning the molotov – ribbentrop pact , and calling it a criminal act . the declaration said independence for the baltics was a question of " inalienable human rights , " and accused the european community of ignoring the last colonies of the hitler – stalin era . in december 1989 , soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and the soviet congress of people 's deputies signed a report condemning the molotov-ribbentrop pact . on march 11 , 1990 , less than six months after the baltic way , lithuania declared independence , the first soviet state to do so .
within a year , all three baltic states had declared independence and were internationally recognized as sovereign states . ch / av / afp / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 23.08.2009 bayern munich 's indifferent start becomes a nightmare großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz goalscorer aristide bance finished off bayern bayern 's new coach louis van gaal is still waiting for his first bundesliga win since taking charge in july .
he was also visibly angry when he faced the press after watching his team lose 2-1 to newly-promoted mainz . three games into the new bundesliga season bayern munich remain without a win after goals saturday from andreas ivanschitz and aristide bance helped newly-promoted mainz 05 to a shock 2-1 victory over the german giants .
meanwhile as a bayern team missing franck ribery and luca toni continued to struggle under new coach louis van gaal , bayer leverkusen maintained their strong start and go to the top on goal difference courtesy of a 5-0 mauling of sc freiburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's tranquillo barnetta leverkusen are the new pacesetters with seven points from three games , level with schalke 04 , who dropped their first points of the season when they were held to a goalless draw on friday at hoffenheim .
vfb stuttgart and borussia dortmund both lost ground on the top of the table after playing out a 1-1 draw while a surprise victory for mainz sees them move up to fourth on five points , level with eintracht frankfurt , who played out a scoreless draw with cologne .
champions vfl wolfsburg sit third on six points ahead of their visit to sv hamburg on sunday while munich now languishes in 12th on just two points .
bayern 's boss not happy " that was very disappointing and i am asking myself what we have done incorrectly in our preparations , " said a notably disappointed van gaal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's louis van gaal is not happy mainz were every bit bayern 's equals in the early stages and took a deserved lead on 25 minutes when austrian ivanschitz sent in a shot from 25 metres that slipped in under bayern goalkeeper michael rensing 's outstretched arm .
" that was absolutely terrible and a serious wake-up call for us .
we should n't have lost like that , " rensing said .
things got even worse for louis van gaal 's side seven minutes before the break when bance rose above daniel van buyten to head home from 10 metres and make it 2-0 to thomas tuchel 's side .
with bayern now looking to pull back from a two-goal deficit , van gaal immediately brought on croatian striker ivica olic for midfielder danijel pranijic .
" normally i would n't make a substitution so early but i could have taken off a lot more players , " said an angry van gaal .
mainz did give bayern a lifeline on 47 minutes when nikolce noveski headed a thomas mueller cross into his own net and mueller subsequently had a glorious opportunity to equalize on the hour-mark but his header of van buyten 's pinpoint cross was wide .
van gaal brought on jose sosa for miroslav klose with 18 minutes left as bayern continued to press for an equalizer but the argentine could n't make good a free-kick opportunity four minutes later .
mario gomez hit the side-netting as bayern got ever more desperate but mainz held on for a stunning win .
elsewhere in the league while bayern struggled , bayer leverkusen went top of the table after three games when they hammered freiburg .
" for us it was a very strange game , because freiburg were clearly the better team during the first 35 minutes , " said bayer coach jupp heynckes .
stefan kiessling scored his third goal of the season on 35 minutes to open the scoring at freiburg 's badenova stadium , firing home after being found by simon rolfes .
swiss international tranquillo barnetta doubled leverkusen 's lead two minutes after the restart with a nicely-struck shot from the edge of the area , while a further brace from eren deriyok , sandwiched by barnetta 's second , completed the rout .
" being top of the table means nothing to me , " said leverkusen 's jupp heynckes .
" the way we played in the first half was still unacceptable . "
stuttgart lost ground despite coming back from a goal down at borussia dortmund to salvage a 1-1 draw .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's georg niedermeier , center , celebrates his goal nelson valdez put dortmund ahead on 27 minutes , nuri sahin setting the paraguayan up to finish clinically , placing the ball beyond the reach of jens lehmann .
julian schieber could have drawn stuttgart level on the stroke of half-time after playing a combination with cacau but dortmund goalkeeper roman weidenfeller saved the 20-year-old 's shot well .
dortmund paid the price almost immediately after the restart as georg niedermeier headed in from five metres .
in the day 's other game , jiri stajner scored twice and could also afford to miss a penalty as hanover 96 beat nuremberg 2-0 .

after months of negotiations , his foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop flew to moscow and met with his counterpart vyacheslav molotov .
on aug .
23 , they signed an agreement , most commonly known as the molotov-ribbentrop pact . the negotiations took place in secret , at the same time as france and britain negotiated an alliance with stalin . though primarily a non-aggression pact , the document incorporated some economic components . provisions under the agreement included : arbitration in the event of a disagreement , consultation and neutrality if either russia or germany went to war against a third power .
the pact also stipulated that neither party could join a group or alliance " directly or indirectly aimed at the other . " only after germany 's defeat in 1945 did details of the secret protocols of the pact emerge . bildunterschrift : as this 1939 cartoon shows , many saw stalin as the butcher of the baltic states secret protocols envisaged carve-up of europe the protocols divided europe into german and soviet spheres of control .
latvia and estonia were to be in the soviet sphere .
lithuania , the part that was adjacent to east prussia , was to come under german control .
later the protocol was altered , assigning lithuania to the soviets as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler and stalin helped each other prepare for wwii to the north , finland was to be carved off for stalin .
poland was to be partitioned , and soon after the pact was signed , both powers invaded the country to take their respective pieces . immediately afterwards , russia invaded finland , but the red army were repelled in the famous " winter war " of 1939/1940 .
after holding their ground for four months and inflicting terrible casualties on the russians , the heavily outnumbered finns were militarily exhausted , and they sued for peace . stalin annexed finland 's eastern province of karelia , which led eventually to finland and germany signing an alliance .
that alliance was to become a key element in hitler 's invasion of russia . quarrelling between germany and the soviets escalated during the summer of 1940 , as the soviet union refused to fulfill its economic commitments under the molotov-ribbentrop pact , and both parties carried out military operations without informing the other . the german war effort was heavily reliant on the russian raw materials that the pact had aimed to secure , and hitler 's plans were increasingly frustrated .
in august , nazi germany annexed part of romania to gain access to oil fields . hitler tears up pact , invades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany attacked the soviet union in 1941 on june 22 , 1941 , hitler abrogated the molotov-ribbentrop pact and launched operation barbarossa .
the multifaceted invasion involved attacks along the entire eastern front , from finland in the north to the black sea in the south . the eventual failure of barbarossa , the largest military operation in history , became the turning point in the nazi 's fortunes . after germany was defeated in 1945 , soviet troops remained in occupation across much of eastern europe , and the baltic states .
what the allies did n't give stalin as war reparations , he annexed anyway , until ending up with much of what the soviets had claimed in the secret protocols of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . details of the secret protocols dividing up europe surfaced during the nuremberg trials in 1945-46 even though the soviets continued to deny their existence .
after the war , they justified their occupation of the baltic states by claiming that the parliaments of latvia , lithuania and estonia had petitioned to join the ussr . the baltic pro-independence movement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two million balts protested against the soviet union in 1989 in the early 1980s , as the soviet union embraced glasnost , the baltic states ' pro-independence protest movement gathered strength .
on aug .
23 , 1986 , large street protests were held across latvia , lithuania and estonia to mark the anniversary of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . in 1989 , the fourth consecutive year of the protests , and the 50th anniversary of the pact , an especially large protest was planned , resulting in the so-called " baltic way " .
two million lithuanians , latvians and estonians linked arms to form a 671-kilometer -lrb- 417-mile -rrb- long human chain , connecting the three capitals , vilnius , riga and tallinn . the baltic pro-independence movements issued a joint declaration to the world and european community , condemning the molotov – ribbentrop pact , and calling it a criminal act . the declaration said independence for the baltics was a question of " inalienable human rights , " and accused the european community of ignoring the last colonies of the hitler – stalin era . in december 1989 , soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and the soviet congress of people 's deputies signed a report condemning the molotov-ribbentrop pact . on march 11 , 1990 , less than six months after the baltic way , lithuania declared independence , the first soviet state to do so .
within a year , all three baltic states had declared independence and were internationally recognized as sovereign states . ch / av / afp / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he remembers how the church was stifled under hungary ’ s communist rule , despite the long christian tradition in the region . several decades ago , early christian burial chambers were discovered beneath the church ; they date back to the fourth century , when pecs was a roman city .

in places , the cathedral shows signs of its former life as a mosque .
this is especially true in the reliefs in the passageway leading to the lower church , where the heads of the statues of apostles have been broken off . for the 1000th anniversary of the diocese , the church has been restored both inside and out .
the restoration was helped along with state funding , and the state is expected to pick up the tab for the anniversary celebrations as well .

nonetheless , the diocese is kicking off its anniversary year with a special church service .

but 2009 is also giving pecs a reason to celebrate , as diocese pecs plans to toast its 1000-year anniversary . one of the main landmarks in the western hungarian town of pecs is the church of st. maria , in the main square .
the building alone speaks volumes about the long history of this turbulent region . the now-church was once a turkish mosque - which in turn was built on the remains of a 16th century romanesque church .
today , it features features a grand green-copper cupola , prayer niches , keel-arch windows , and the remains of an ottoman painting that includes verses from the koran . from church , to mosque , and back again bishop mihaly mayer says that many catholics still call the downtown church a mosque . “ i always say : ‘ you can say that but its not entirely true , ’ ” mayer said .
“ half of it was built as a christian church , and if you look back even earlier , it was the holy church of bartholomew that was built as a mosque .
i stress that because no one ever mentioned this cathedral in the communist past . ” bishop mayer has been at the head of the pecs diocese for 20 years .
he remembers how the church was stifled under hungary ’ s communist rule , despite the long christian tradition in the region . several decades ago , early christian burial chambers were discovered beneath the church ; they date back to the fourth century , when pecs was a roman city .
today , these are a designated unesco world heritage site . the dioscese of pecs is also referred to as the diocese quinque ecclesia , a name that refers to the fact that the city was originally built around five old christian chapels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city is busy planning for 2010 , but 2009 need not be forgotten these five chapels no longer exist , and no one knows where they once stood .
what is clear is that king stephan founded of the diocese , laying the ground stone for the ancient cathedral in 1009 .
the church was changed and destroyed many times over in the ensuing years . the neo-romanesque cathedral , with its green copper domed roof and four corner towers that rise above the city , was built between 1882 and 1891 .
in places , the cathedral shows signs of its former life as a mosque .
this is especially true in the reliefs in the passageway leading to the lower church , where the heads of the statues of apostles have been broken off . for the 1000th anniversary of the diocese , the church has been restored both inside and out .
the restoration was helped along with state funding , and the state is expected to pick up the tab for the anniversary celebrations as well .
some 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 358,000 -rrb- in culture capital 2010 financing are expected - though by the end of july none of that money had made its way to the diocese , meyer complained . hopes for cultural cooperation in fact , given the number of active construction sites in the city , it appears that pecs is having problems putting its ambitious culture capital plans into action .
nonetheless , the diocese is kicking off its anniversary year with a special church service .
and there has been church-to-church contact between the diocese in pecs and in the city of essen , germany - along with istanbul , another cultural capital for 2010 . " we had a music school from essen here recently .
and i wrote to the auxiliary bishop there that we should make a partnership between the catholic school in pecs and the music school , " meyer said . " it would be nice if we could finish up that agreement in 2010 and take the next step in our relationship .

he was also visibly angry when he faced the press after watching his team lose 2-1 to newly-promoted mainz . three games into the new bundesliga season bayern munich remain without a win after goals saturday from andreas ivanschitz and aristide bance helped newly-promoted mainz 05 to a shock 2-1 victory over the german giants .
meanwhile as a bayern team missing franck ribery and luca toni continued to struggle under new coach louis van gaal , bayer leverkusen maintained their strong start and go to the top on goal difference courtesy of a 5-0 mauling of sc freiburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's tranquillo barnetta leverkusen are the new pacesetters with seven points from three games , level with schalke 04 , who dropped their first points of the season when they were held to a goalless draw on friday at hoffenheim .
vfb stuttgart and borussia dortmund both lost ground on the top of the table after playing out a 1-1 draw while a surprise victory for mainz sees them move up to fourth on five points , level with eintracht frankfurt , who played out a scoreless draw with cologne .
champions vfl wolfsburg sit third on six points ahead of their visit to sv hamburg on sunday while munich now languishes in 12th on just two points .
bayern 's boss not happy " that was very disappointing and i am asking myself what we have done incorrectly in our preparations , " said a notably disappointed van gaal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's louis van gaal is not happy mainz were every bit bayern 's equals in the early stages and took a deserved lead on 25 minutes when austrian ivanschitz sent in a shot from 25 metres that slipped in under bayern goalkeeper michael rensing 's outstretched arm .
" that was absolutely terrible and a serious wake-up call for us .
we should n't have lost like that , " rensing said .
things got even worse for louis van gaal 's side seven minutes before the break when bance rose above daniel van buyten to head home from 10 metres and make it 2-0 to thomas tuchel 's side .
with bayern now looking to pull back from a two-goal deficit , van gaal immediately brought on croatian striker ivica olic for midfielder danijel pranijic .
" normally i would n't make a substitution so early but i could have taken off a lot more players , " said an angry van gaal .
mainz did give bayern a lifeline on 47 minutes when nikolce noveski headed a thomas mueller cross into his own net and mueller subsequently had a glorious opportunity to equalize on the hour-mark but his header of van buyten 's pinpoint cross was wide .
van gaal brought on jose sosa for miroslav klose with 18 minutes left as bayern continued to press for an equalizer but the argentine could n't make good a free-kick opportunity four minutes later .
mario gomez hit the side-netting as bayern got ever more desperate but mainz held on for a stunning win .
elsewhere in the league while bayern struggled , bayer leverkusen went top of the table after three games when they hammered freiburg .
" for us it was a very strange game , because freiburg were clearly the better team during the first 35 minutes , " said bayer coach jupp heynckes .
stefan kiessling scored his third goal of the season on 35 minutes to open the scoring at freiburg 's badenova stadium , firing home after being found by simon rolfes .
swiss international tranquillo barnetta doubled leverkusen 's lead two minutes after the restart with a nicely-struck shot from the edge of the area , while a further brace from eren deriyok , sandwiched by barnetta 's second , completed the rout .
" being top of the table means nothing to me , " said leverkusen 's jupp heynckes .
" the way we played in the first half was still unacceptable . "

he was also visibly angry when he faced the press after watching his team lose 2-1 to newly-promoted mainz . three games into the new bundesliga season bayern munich remain without a win after goals saturday from andreas ivanschitz and aristide bance helped newly-promoted mainz 05 to a shock 2-1 victory over the german giants .
meanwhile as a bayern team missing franck ribery and luca toni continued to struggle under new coach louis van gaal , bayer leverkusen maintained their strong start and go to the top on goal difference courtesy of a 5-0 mauling of sc freiburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's tranquillo barnetta leverkusen are the new pacesetters with seven points from three games , level with schalke 04 , who dropped their first points of the season when they were held to a goalless draw on friday at hoffenheim .
vfb stuttgart and borussia dortmund both lost ground on the top of the table after playing out a 1-1 draw while a surprise victory for mainz sees them move up to fourth on five points , level with eintracht frankfurt , who played out a scoreless draw with cologne .
champions vfl wolfsburg sit third on six points ahead of their visit to sv hamburg on sunday while munich now languishes in 12th on just two points .
bayern 's boss not happy " that was very disappointing and i am asking myself what we have done incorrectly in our preparations , " said a notably disappointed van gaal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's louis van gaal is not happy mainz were every bit bayern 's equals in the early stages and took a deserved lead on 25 minutes when austrian ivanschitz sent in a shot from 25 metres that slipped in under bayern goalkeeper michael rensing 's outstretched arm .
" that was absolutely terrible and a serious wake-up call for us .
we should n't have lost like that , " rensing said .
things got even worse for louis van gaal 's side seven minutes before the break when bance rose above daniel van buyten to head home from 10 metres and make it 2-0 to thomas tuchel 's side .
with bayern now looking to pull back from a two-goal deficit , van gaal immediately brought on croatian striker ivica olic for midfielder danijel pranijic .
" normally i would n't make a substitution so early but i could have taken off a lot more players , " said an angry van gaal .
mainz did give bayern a lifeline on 47 minutes when nikolce noveski headed a thomas mueller cross into his own net and mueller subsequently had a glorious opportunity to equalize on the hour-mark but his header of van buyten 's pinpoint cross was wide .
van gaal brought on jose sosa for miroslav klose with 18 minutes left as bayern continued to press for an equalizer but the argentine could n't make good a free-kick opportunity four minutes later .
mario gomez hit the side-netting as bayern got ever more desperate but mainz held on for a stunning win .
elsewhere in the league while bayern struggled , bayer leverkusen went top of the table after three games when they hammered freiburg .
" for us it was a very strange game , because freiburg were clearly the better team during the first 35 minutes , " said bayer coach jupp heynckes .
stefan kiessling scored his third goal of the season on 35 minutes to open the scoring at freiburg 's badenova stadium , firing home after being found by simon rolfes .
swiss international tranquillo barnetta doubled leverkusen 's lead two minutes after the restart with a nicely-struck shot from the edge of the area , while a further brace from eren deriyok , sandwiched by barnetta 's second , completed the rout .
" being top of the table means nothing to me , " said leverkusen 's jupp heynckes .
" the way we played in the first half was still unacceptable . "
stuttgart lost ground despite coming back from a goal down at borussia dortmund to salvage a 1-1 draw .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's georg niedermeier , center , celebrates his goal nelson valdez put dortmund ahead on 27 minutes , nuri sahin setting the paraguayan up to finish clinically , placing the ball beyond the reach of jens lehmann .
julian schieber could have drawn stuttgart level on the stroke of half-time after playing a combination with cacau but dortmund goalkeeper roman weidenfeller saved the 20-year-old 's shot well .
dortmund paid the price almost immediately after the restart as georg niedermeier headed in from five metres .
in the day 's other game , jiri stajner scored twice and could also afford to miss a penalty as hanover 96 beat nuremberg 2-0 .

up to 10,000 passengers daily are facing disruption after a section of the line near malahide collapsed .
the company expects the line to be closed for up to three months .
belfast enterprise services to dublin are running with passengers being transferred by bus between drogheda and connolly station in dublin .
