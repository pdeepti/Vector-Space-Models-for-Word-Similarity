thousands took to the streets on saturday to urge leaders at un talks to agree on a deal to fight global warming . danish police say they have released nearly all of the 968 people detained during a climate rally which drew an estimated 40,000 people in the danish capital on saturday . law enforcement authorities said only 13 demonstrators were still in custody on sunday and of those , three are set to be arraigned on preliminary charges of fighting with the police . on saturday , the heart of the danish capital became a sea of blue as environmentalists and anti-capitalist demonstrators gathered in front of parliament at the start of a six-kilometer -lrb- four-mile -rrb- march that took them to the venue of the ongoing united nations climate summit . the protesters ' aim was to pressure united nations negotiators to take concrete action on climate change .
an estimated 40,000 people attended the march which was jointly organized by over 500 groups from 67 countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were scuffles in copenhagen as police detained hundreds for throwing bottles and smashing windows the procession wound its way from the folketing , the danish parliament , to the conference site , the massive bella center on the outskirts of the city center . demonstrators wore sky blue raincoats or carried blue umbrellas following a call by the environmental group , friends of the earth . activists slam rich nations nigerian nnimmo bassey , chairman of friends of the earth international , delivered a fiery speech to the crowd . " we can not allow carbon traders to damage the world .
there is no such thing as clean coal or clean crude .
leave the oil in the soil , leave the coal in the hole , " he said .
" to those who want to pollute at home and plant a tree somewhere we say no , " he added .
the demonstrations come as delegates to the un climate summit currently under way in copenhagen wrangle over a draft blueprint for a global pact .
at the un conference itself , developing nations on friday rejected as " insignificant " an eu pledge of 7.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- to help them tackle global warming .
the accord , which would see the money paid over three years , came a week before 110 heads of state and government convene in copenhagen for the finale of the 12-day conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel was criticized by greenpeace for not doing enough the head of greenpeace , kumi naidoo , strongly criticized german chancellor angela merkel for doing too little to help poorer nations cope with the effects of climate change .
" angela merkel can steer the rudder in copenhagen , " naidoo told the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday .
" but her behavior in the current debate is more than disappointing . " in an interview to be published in the sunday edition of the tabloid daily bild , merkel chided the developing countries for expecting richer ones to shoulder more of the burden . " we will not allow germany and the other european industrial states to lead the way on climate change , while others do nothing and then poach jobs from us , using the argument of lower costs for environmental protection , " merkel said . tight security the danish capital had resembled a military zone as authorities prepared for the arrival of activists from all over the world .
helicopters buzzed in the skies while armored police vans and canine squads patrolled the streets , amid fears that saturday 's march could be joined by violent far-left groups .
police also beefed up security at denmark 's land and sea borders to prevent troublemakers from entering the country .
shopkeepers and businesses were warned of a possible outbreak of violence .
those warnings unfortunately came to fruition to a small degree , as police arrested nearly a thousand people who had been throwing rocks and fireworks at police and smashing storefront windows .
on friday , authorities had rounded up 75 anti-capitalist demonstrators , 13 from germany , who were suspected of trying to set up an unauthorized blockade of companies they thought were emitting greenhouse gases .
protests worldwide protests and marches supporting a new climate covenant took place in more than 100 other countries as well , including greece , spain , and germany .
hours before the demonstration was due to kick off in copenhagen , protesters were out in force around asia , waving banners and chanting slogans urging action from the climate conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists march in sydney , australia as part of worldwide climate demonstrations in australia , organizers said around 50,000 people had taken to the streets nationwide , wearing sky-blue shoelaces in a call for a strong and binding agreement at the un talks .
" we want -lrb- world leaders -rrb- to bring home a treaty , we want them to stand by the pacific and our neighbors there .
and we want them to deliver and ensure a safe climate future for us all , " said james dannenberg , one of the organizers .
thousands of activists gathered in front of the parliament house in canberra , while 10,000-strong crowds marched through sydney , melbourne and other major cities .
protesters in hong kong – some dressed as pandas – and the philippines also took to the streets , while in indonesia , demonstrators rallied in front of the us embassy in the capital jakarta , calling for help for developing nations in reducing greenhouse gases. rb / svs / afp / reuters / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" being the champions of the first half means nothing to me , " said jupp heynckes , coach of first place bayer leverkusen , after his team 's 2-2 draw against last place hertha berlin .
the single point from the draw left the door open for other teams in the bundesliga to close in on leverkusen 's top spot with one game to go before the winter break .
if being in first place at the end of the first half is irrelevant for heynckes , then there are two other teams in the league who would gladly celebrate the holidays from the top of the standings in leverkusen 's stead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes is unconcerned with being crowned the first half champs those teams would be schalke and bayern munich , who both won their matches in the bundesliga to narrow the gap to heynckes ' team .

kevin kuranyi put the first goal in the net for schalke just after the second half got underway , and jan moravek , coming off the bench , took a pass from kuranyi and sealed the victory for schalke with the final goal in the 72nd minute .

bayern continues to win fresh off their convincing 4-0 thrashing of juventus that advanced them to the knock-out stage of the champions league , munich won again in the bundesliga with another feast of goals .

" we are only two points off the top spot and that is very satisfying . "
bad luck for hanover it may have been a memorable day for louis van gaal , but saturday 's game between borussia moenchengladbach and hanover 96 is one that hanover defender karim haggui would probably rather forget after putting two goals into his own net .
the first came after hanover florian fromlowitz slipped while attempting to clear the ball and kicked it into haggui 's leg , which deflected the ball back into the net .
the second was a back pass that missed fromlowitz and landed in the goal in stoppage time .

" i would still have thought it right to remove him .
obviously you would have had to use and deploy different arguments , about the nature of the threat , " blair told the broadcaster in comments released saturday .
the interview for the show " fern britton meets ... " airs on sunday .
blair said hussein and his government were " a threat to the region , " and that his decision was also influenced by hussein 's willingness to use chemical weapons on " his own people " and by the stalling tactics he used against weapons inspectors .
comments spark criticism but blair 's comments have attracted strong criticism . hans blix , the head of the un team that conducted weapons inspections in iraq before the war , said he thought blair used wmd as a " convenient justification " for war .
" saddam 's removal was a gain but it 's the only gain that i can see from the war , " blix said .
the former un weapons inspector said he believed blair 's statement had a " strong impression of a lack of sincerity . "
the peace activism group stop the war coalition called blair 's remarks " an admission of war crimes ...
it is an illegal act of aggression under international law to attack another country for the purposes of regime change . "
according to the uk 's defense ministry , 179 british soldiers have died in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair , left , was a major supporter of then-president george w. bush 's war plan " legal but questionable " blair 's statements come ahead of his expected testimony before a public inquiry about britain 's role in the iraq war between 2001 and 2009 .
the " chilcot inquiry , " named after a longtime civil servant who is overseeing it , began in november , shortly after almost all of the country 's troops were withdrawn from iraq .
blair is expected to appear as a witness in january .
britain 's former un ambassador , jeremy greenstock , testified on nov .
27 that the us-led invasion in march 2003 was " legal but of questionable legitimacy , in that it did n't have the democratically observable backing of the great majority of member states . "
greenstock said the un security council had passed a resolution in late 2002 that gave iraq a " final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations , " but the council never passed a resolution authorizing the invasion .
sympathy , but no regrets the war has also been met with widespread opposition among the british public .
hundreds of thousands of people marched to protest in the run-up to the war in february 2003 .
" i sympathize with the people who were against it for perfectly good reasons and are against it now , but for me you know , in the end i had to take the decision , " blair said .
" there is no point in going into a situation of conflict and not understanding there is going to be a price paid . " svs / afp / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a russian-norwegian consortium won a bid to develop iraq 's biggest oil field . russia 's oil company lukoil and the norwegian statoilhydro won a joint bid on saturday to develop iraq 's largest undeveloped oil field .
on the second day of the largest iraqi postwar auction , the west qurna-2 reservoir , with 12.86 billion barrels of oil in reserves , went to the norwegian-russian consortium after the preceding day had seen auctions won by shell and china 's cnpc .
located in relatively calm and secure southern iraq , west qurna is expected to produce 1.8 billion barrels per day . lukoil and statoilhydro requested 1.15 dollars for each barrel extracted from the giant field .
lukoil will take 85 percent and statoilhydro 15 percent .
the deals reached so far in the two-day auction promise to increase iraq 's oil production by more than 4.2 million barrels per day .
underbidding the competition the prices to develop the largest fields bid by oil companies have been lower than many expected .
" they were astonishingly low figures .
but 2009 will be remembered as the year that iraq opened its door to the international oil companies and then shut it .
it 's 10 fields and that 's it , " a senior oil executive told reuters .
" so it 's strategic for the oil firms , either you are here or you are n't and this is the chance .
you have to think about it like that . "
oil fields were auctioned off to multiple firms , including a consortium led by the russian firm gazprom , france 's total and the malaysia 's petronas .
but some fields near baghdad and the northern city of mosul were still considered too risky for the international firms and received no bids during the auction .
security for the auction at the oil ministry in baghdad was extremely tight after a string of bombings targeted various government buildings around the city on tuesday .
iraq has the world 's third largest oil reserves at 115 billion barrels , behind saudi arabia and iran .
oil sales make up 85 percent of iraq 's revenue. sjt / afp / reuters / ap editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think that we are looking at a very significant reorganization of the church in ireland , " said dublin archbishop diarmuid martin after the meeting .
the meeting was called by the pope to discuss the widespread sexual abuse of children by clergymen in ireland , which was reportedly covered up by the church in ireland for decades .
in a statement released by the vatican , the pope said he shares the " outrage , betrayal and shame felt by so many of the faithful in ireland -lrb- over -rrb- these heinous crimes . "
decades of abuse the investigation , known as the murphy report , revealed that not only was sexual abuse of children by priests in ireland prevalent from 1975-2004 , but that the archdiocese of dublin was aware of the situation and maintained a policy of " do n't ask , do n't tell . "
in the vatican 's statement , it said the pope felt " profound regret at the actions of some members of the clergy who have betrayed their solemn promises to god , as well as the trust placed in them by the victims and their families , and by society at large . "
the pope is reportedly planning to issue a letter to irish catholics .
it would be the first time the pope had delivered an official document on the issue of child abuse within the church .
previously , the pope has issued apologies to victims of sexual abuse from clergy members in the united states , canada , and australia. mz / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead of creating new concepts of nation building , leaders should read lawrence of arabia , argues a foreign policy expert . john hulsman is the author of the recently released " to begin the world over again : lawrence of arabia from damascus to baghdad . "
he is president of john hulsman enterprises , an international relations consulting firm , and a member of the council on foreign relations .
he is based in germany .
deutsche welle : in your new book you argue that instead of trying to develop new strategies for counterinsurgency and nation building in afghanistan , western leaders should read t. e. lawrence 's " 27 articles " written in 1917 during the so-called arab revolt as a guide for british officers .
what can we learn from lawrence of arabia that would help us today in afghanistan ?
john hulsman : the thing that was missing in barack obama 's speech was of course the most important piece from a lawrence point of view which is what are the locals going to do if you do these other things .
the problem with modern nation building is that it 's always about what 's going on in washington and other capitals , what the strategy should be for outsiders rather than what the strategy should be actually in these places that we are trying to nation build . lawrence realized that the key to success in the arab revolt was n't him , was n't the british , was n't the turks - it was the arabs .
could he make the arabs stakeholders in a settlement whereby he built a nation organically using the pieces there .
and so rather than create a nation where none had existed he worked with tribal leaders building something from the bottom up , seeing them as the key to the story , making them stakeholders in the assessment , realizing how their culture worked .
in other words it was entirely different than the failed efforts in bosnia , somalia , haiti , kosovo , afghanistan and iraq where we 've done this exactly the wrong way with the wrong philosophy .
if you are going to build a people you have to make sure you do n't liberate them from themselves .
probably the most famous advice given by t.e. lawrence in his " 27 articles " postulates " better the arabs do it tolerably than that you do it perfectly . "
has the international community heeded that advice so far in its mission in afghanistan ?
one of the things people say is " is n't it terrible that we 're working with these warlords . "
who do these people think has been running afghanistan for the last 1,000 years ?
not thomas jefferson and not james madison .
i wish that were the case , but it 's just not .
better that they be given control in terms of money - of course we should account for it because there is a lot of corruption in afghanistan - better they be given control over the building projects that they 're doing rather than we tell them what to build .
and of course they wo n't do it as well if we would do it by western standards .
but the key is n't how well they do it , but that they will be made stakeholders in the process so that they see that they are rebuilding their nation , they are building their country , not that we are imposing some sort of diktat from outside .
i think that is actually the key piece of advice from the " 27 articles , " because it encapsulates what 's wrong with what we are doing .
what we are doing should be mainly psychological and political , and then only secondarily military .
in the arab revolt in 1917 , lawrence figured out that if the arabs were on his side he could n't lose and if they were n't on his side that he could n't win . and that 's what 's missing from obama 's plan .
there was precious little mention of local politics and working with localities .
the problem with the afghan constitution that we imposed on the country after installing karzai is that it 's centralized , that we 've made kabul the center of the political decision making when in afghanistan the tribe and localism has been the center of the afghan experience of a 1,000 years . lawrence would understand this in a heartbeat .
and that 's why in a sense what 's happening in afghanistan is so tragic and why i was really desperately impelled to write this book .
it comes out of a practical experience of working in washington on iraq and afghanistan and then i read this guy and i immediately said that 's it , that 's what 's missing . bildunterschrift : isaf commander stanley mcchrystal is trying to work closer with the afghan people lawrence of arabia , as the name and the popular movie about him suggest , was famous for his knowledge of and closeness to the arabs that contributed to his success .
do the current military and civilian leaders in charge of the afghan mission know enough about the country and its people ?
no , i do n't think they do .
i give general mcchrystal real credit , because he is aware that this is an area where they are falling behind .
in iraq , one of the most important things that explained to me why we failed there was when i read at the time that of the 200 senior staffers that viceroy paul bremer brought in under george w. bush to look after iraq , only one had an advanced degree in anything relating to iraq or the middle east .
and lawrence would say you ca n't transform a society you do n't know anything about , that 's just common sense . i laud mcchrystal for realizing that something is missing , but intellectually these guys do n't know anything near what lawrence did .
lawrence had worked before the war in an archeological dig with the arabs in karkemish , he spoke their language , he knew their tribal structure , he knew their feuds , he knew who liked whom and why .
cultural knowledge is far more important than military knowledge if you are going to do anything successful on counterinsurgency and nation building .
of course lawrence of arabia is perhaps most well-known for his military achievements , i.e. the arab revolt , the battle of aqaba and the fall of damascus .
what military lessons can the isaf troops in afghanistan learn from lawrence ?
what they can learn is actually an old german saying and they could read their clausewitz again .
clausewitz got it right that military matters are only an extension of doing things politically . if we clear the taliban somehow through a miracle from afghanistan , which we of course ca n't do because they are locals and not some foreign outside force , but even if we could get rid of all the taliban by some miracle we still would n't have stability in afghanistan because there is n't anything political to build on .
that is the key .
despite his successes , lawrence of arabia 's grand vision of arab self-determination failed in the end when the british and the french decided to divide the middle east between them .
is n't that a stark reminder that in afghanistan , realpolitik ultimately might trump visionary politics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban have steadily gained ground in afghanistan yes it definitely could .
we need to go from bottom up rather than from top down .
the british and french went top down .
they said what matters most on the great power level .
the reason why it is better to start with the micro level and then go to the macro level is really old-fashioned burkean thinking .
if you get the stuff on the ground locally right you can then build something .
if we get the various tribal leaders to buy into our settlement , then you can go to the chinese , the russians , the indians and the pakistanis and say , we can promise you stability , but only if we all do n't intervene and meddle , including the united states .
going bottom up leads to that stability .
without that local component it wo n't work as was seen in the case of lawrence , that is absolutely right .

the shipment was worth 16 million euros and reportedly part of a larger order dispatched by a swedish subsidiary of siemens to an iranian company .
in the other case , the magazine reported that the british navy stopped a chinese ship containing computers near dubai .
the shipment was intended for an iranian company .
the computers , which are used to control nuclear reactors , were thought to have been sent to china by siemens .
siemens would not give specific details about the shipments .
but the company told der spiegel that it did not break any german foreign trade laws .
“ our business activities in iran serve purely civil purposes and are in accord with international legal regulations , ” a siemens spokesperson told the magazine .
not the first controversy with iran the latest allegations come months after criticism that siemens , along with its finnish partner nokia , sold technology to iran that was thought to be capable of monitoring phone calls and e-mails .
this was in the wake of iran 's widespread post-election protests , where the iranian government was accused of censoring public dissent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens was criticized for selling eavesdropping technology to iran during election protests a spokesperson for nokia siemens networks -lrb- nsn -rrb- , ben roome , said the technology could be used to monitor calls , but denied claims it was capable of censoring web content .

the shipment was worth 16 million euros and reportedly part of a larger order dispatched by a swedish subsidiary of siemens to an iranian company .
in the other case , the magazine reported that the british navy stopped a chinese ship containing computers near dubai .
the shipment was intended for an iranian company .
the computers , which are used to control nuclear reactors , were thought to have been sent to china by siemens .
siemens would not give specific details about the shipments .
but the company told der spiegel that it did not break any german foreign trade laws .
“ our business activities in iran serve purely civil purposes and are in accord with international legal regulations , ” a siemens spokesperson told the magazine .
not the first controversy with iran the latest allegations come months after criticism that siemens , along with its finnish partner nokia , sold technology to iran that was thought to be capable of monitoring phone calls and e-mails .
this was in the wake of iran 's widespread post-election protests , where the iranian government was accused of censoring public dissent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens was criticized for selling eavesdropping technology to iran during election protests a spokesperson for nokia siemens networks -lrb- nsn -rrb- , ben roome , said the technology could be used to monitor calls , but denied claims it was capable of censoring web content .
" voice call monitoring is required by the courts to listen to phone calls coming from a particular phone number , the telecommunication systems have an ability to do that , " roome said .
he added that the technology provided by nsn allows millions of iranians to communicate every day. mk / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think that we are looking at a very significant reorganization of the church in ireland , " said dublin archbishop diarmuid martin after the meeting .
the meeting was called by the pope to discuss the widespread sexual abuse of children by clergymen in ireland , which was reportedly covered up by the church in ireland for decades .
in a statement released by the vatican , the pope said he shares the " outrage , betrayal and shame felt by so many of the faithful in ireland -lrb- over -rrb- these heinous crimes . "
decades of abuse the investigation , known as the murphy report , revealed that not only was sexual abuse of children by priests in ireland prevalent from 1975-2004 , but that the archdiocese of dublin was aware of the situation and maintained a policy of " do n't ask , do n't tell . "
in the vatican 's statement , it said the pope felt " profound regret at the actions of some members of the clergy who have betrayed their solemn promises to god , as well as the trust placed in them by the victims and their families , and by society at large . "

instead of creating new concepts of nation building , leaders should read lawrence of arabia , argues a foreign policy expert . john hulsman is the author of the recently released " to begin the world over again : lawrence of arabia from damascus to baghdad . "
he is president of john hulsman enterprises , an international relations consulting firm , and a member of the council on foreign relations .
he is based in germany .
deutsche welle : in your new book you argue that instead of trying to develop new strategies for counterinsurgency and nation building in afghanistan , western leaders should read t. e. lawrence 's " 27 articles " written in 1917 during the so-called arab revolt as a guide for british officers .
what can we learn from lawrence of arabia that would help us today in afghanistan ?
john hulsman : the thing that was missing in barack obama 's speech was of course the most important piece from a lawrence point of view which is what are the locals going to do if you do these other things .
the problem with modern nation building is that it 's always about what 's going on in washington and other capitals , what the strategy should be for outsiders rather than what the strategy should be actually in these places that we are trying to nation build . lawrence realized that the key to success in the arab revolt was n't him , was n't the british , was n't the turks - it was the arabs .
could he make the arabs stakeholders in a settlement whereby he built a nation organically using the pieces there .
and so rather than create a nation where none had existed he worked with tribal leaders building something from the bottom up , seeing them as the key to the story , making them stakeholders in the assessment , realizing how their culture worked .
in other words it was entirely different than the failed efforts in bosnia , somalia , haiti , kosovo , afghanistan and iraq where we 've done this exactly the wrong way with the wrong philosophy .
if you are going to build a people you have to make sure you do n't liberate them from themselves .
probably the most famous advice given by t.e. lawrence in his " 27 articles " postulates " better the arabs do it tolerably than that you do it perfectly . "
has the international community heeded that advice so far in its mission in afghanistan ?
one of the things people say is " is n't it terrible that we 're working with these warlords . "
who do these people think has been running afghanistan for the last 1,000 years ?
not thomas jefferson and not james madison .
i wish that were the case , but it 's just not .
better that they be given control in terms of money - of course we should account for it because there is a lot of corruption in afghanistan - better they be given control over the building projects that they 're doing rather than we tell them what to build .
and of course they wo n't do it as well if we would do it by western standards .
but the key is n't how well they do it , but that they will be made stakeholders in the process so that they see that they are rebuilding their nation , they are building their country , not that we are imposing some sort of diktat from outside .
i think that is actually the key piece of advice from the " 27 articles , " because it encapsulates what 's wrong with what we are doing .
what we are doing should be mainly psychological and political , and then only secondarily military .
in the arab revolt in 1917 , lawrence figured out that if the arabs were on his side he could n't lose and if they were n't on his side that he could n't win . and that 's what 's missing from obama 's plan .
there was precious little mention of local politics and working with localities .
the problem with the afghan constitution that we imposed on the country after installing karzai is that it 's centralized , that we 've made kabul the center of the political decision making when in afghanistan the tribe and localism has been the center of the afghan experience of a 1,000 years . lawrence would understand this in a heartbeat .
and that 's why in a sense what 's happening in afghanistan is so tragic and why i was really desperately impelled to write this book .
it comes out of a practical experience of working in washington on iraq and afghanistan and then i read this guy and i immediately said that 's it , that 's what 's missing . bildunterschrift : isaf commander stanley mcchrystal is trying to work closer with the afghan people lawrence of arabia , as the name and the popular movie about him suggest , was famous for his knowledge of and closeness to the arabs that contributed to his success .
do the current military and civilian leaders in charge of the afghan mission know enough about the country and its people ?
no , i do n't think they do .
i give general mcchrystal real credit , because he is aware that this is an area where they are falling behind .
in iraq , one of the most important things that explained to me why we failed there was when i read at the time that of the 200 senior staffers that viceroy paul bremer brought in under george w. bush to look after iraq , only one had an advanced degree in anything relating to iraq or the middle east .
and lawrence would say you ca n't transform a society you do n't know anything about , that 's just common sense . i laud mcchrystal for realizing that something is missing , but intellectually these guys do n't know anything near what lawrence did .
lawrence had worked before the war in an archeological dig with the arabs in karkemish , he spoke their language , he knew their tribal structure , he knew their feuds , he knew who liked whom and why .
cultural knowledge is far more important than military knowledge if you are going to do anything successful on counterinsurgency and nation building .
of course lawrence of arabia is perhaps most well-known for his military achievements , i.e. the arab revolt , the battle of aqaba and the fall of damascus .
what military lessons can the isaf troops in afghanistan learn from lawrence ?
what they can learn is actually an old german saying and they could read their clausewitz again .
clausewitz got it right that military matters are only an extension of doing things politically . if we clear the taliban somehow through a miracle from afghanistan , which we of course ca n't do because they are locals and not some foreign outside force , but even if we could get rid of all the taliban by some miracle we still would n't have stability in afghanistan because there is n't anything political to build on .
that is the key .
despite his successes , lawrence of arabia 's grand vision of arab self-determination failed in the end when the british and the french decided to divide the middle east between them .
is n't that a stark reminder that in afghanistan , realpolitik ultimately might trump visionary politics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban have steadily gained ground in afghanistan yes it definitely could .
we need to go from bottom up rather than from top down .
the british and french went top down .
they said what matters most on the great power level .
the reason why it is better to start with the micro level and then go to the macro level is really old-fashioned burkean thinking .
if you get the stuff on the ground locally right you can then build something .
if we get the various tribal leaders to buy into our settlement , then you can go to the chinese , the russians , the indians and the pakistanis and say , we can promise you stability , but only if we all do n't intervene and meddle , including the united states .
going bottom up leads to that stability .
without that local component it wo n't work as was seen in the case of lawrence , that is absolutely right .

and that 's why in a sense what 's happening in afghanistan is so tragic and why i was really desperately impelled to write this book .
it comes out of a practical experience of working in washington on iraq and afghanistan and then i read this guy and i immediately said that 's it , that 's what 's missing . bildunterschrift : isaf commander stanley mcchrystal is trying to work closer with the afghan people lawrence of arabia , as the name and the popular movie about him suggest , was famous for his knowledge of and closeness to the arabs that contributed to his success .
do the current military and civilian leaders in charge of the afghan mission know enough about the country and its people ?
no , i do n't think they do .
i give general mcchrystal real credit , because he is aware that this is an area where they are falling behind .
in iraq , one of the most important things that explained to me why we failed there was when i read at the time that of the 200 senior staffers that viceroy paul bremer brought in under george w. bush to look after iraq , only one had an advanced degree in anything relating to iraq or the middle east .
and lawrence would say you ca n't transform a society you do n't know anything about , that 's just common sense . i laud mcchrystal for realizing that something is missing , but intellectually these guys do n't know anything near what lawrence did .
lawrence had worked before the war in an archeological dig with the arabs in karkemish , he spoke their language , he knew their tribal structure , he knew their feuds , he knew who liked whom and why .
cultural knowledge is far more important than military knowledge if you are going to do anything successful on counterinsurgency and nation building .
of course lawrence of arabia is perhaps most well-known for his military achievements , i.e. the arab revolt , the battle of aqaba and the fall of damascus .
what military lessons can the isaf troops in afghanistan learn from lawrence ?
what they can learn is actually an old german saying and they could read their clausewitz again .
clausewitz got it right that military matters are only an extension of doing things politically . if we clear the taliban somehow through a miracle from afghanistan , which we of course ca n't do because they are locals and not some foreign outside force , but even if we could get rid of all the taliban by some miracle we still would n't have stability in afghanistan because there is n't anything political to build on .
that is the key .
despite his successes , lawrence of arabia 's grand vision of arab self-determination failed in the end when the british and the french decided to divide the middle east between them .
is n't that a stark reminder that in afghanistan , realpolitik ultimately might trump visionary politics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban have steadily gained ground in afghanistan yes it definitely could .
we need to go from bottom up rather than from top down .
the british and french went top down .
they said what matters most on the great power level .
the reason why it is better to start with the micro level and then go to the macro level is really old-fashioned burkean thinking .
if you get the stuff on the ground locally right you can then build something .
if we get the various tribal leaders to buy into our settlement , then you can go to the chinese , the russians , the indians and the pakistanis and say , we can promise you stability , but only if we all do n't intervene and meddle , including the united states .
going bottom up leads to that stability .
without that local component it wo n't work as was seen in the case of lawrence , that is absolutely right .

" i would still have thought it right to remove him .
obviously you would have had to use and deploy different arguments , about the nature of the threat , " blair told the broadcaster in comments released saturday .
the interview for the show " fern britton meets ... " airs on sunday .
blair said hussein and his government were " a threat to the region , " and that his decision was also influenced by hussein 's willingness to use chemical weapons on " his own people " and by the stalling tactics he used against weapons inspectors .
comments spark criticism but blair 's comments have attracted strong criticism . hans blix , the head of the un team that conducted weapons inspections in iraq before the war , said he thought blair used wmd as a " convenient justification " for war .
" saddam 's removal was a gain but it 's the only gain that i can see from the war , " blix said .
the former un weapons inspector said he believed blair 's statement had a " strong impression of a lack of sincerity . "

vogel had been due to attend an islamic rally in the swiss capital berne on saturday against a ban on the construction of new minarets . switzerland voted to ban the building of new minarets in a referendum two weeks ago .
the surprise result provoked condemnation across the world . reports said vogel objected to not being allowed into switzerland , but that he cooperated with border guards and signed the order banning his entry into the country .
he then returned to germany .
a report on the swiss broadcasting corporation 's web site said that vogel was not allowed in as the federal migration office said his presence could pose a threat to public law and order .
vogel , a former professional boxer who converted to islam in 2001 , told swiss newspapers that he wanted to encourage muslims in switzerland to come out of their social isolation and help lessen mistrust , the site said .
over 57 percent of voters and all but four of the country 's 26 cantons approved the proposal to ban new minarets .
the right-wing swiss people 's party was the driving force behind the november 29 referendum .
the government said it would respect the people 's decision and would no longer permit construction of minarets .
however , it tried to assure the country 's 400,000-strong muslim community that the ban did not amount to “ a rejection of the muslim community , religion or culture . ” rb / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a russian-norwegian consortium won a bid to develop iraq 's biggest oil field . russia 's oil company lukoil and the norwegian statoilhydro won a joint bid on saturday to develop iraq 's largest undeveloped oil field .
on the second day of the largest iraqi postwar auction , the west qurna-2 reservoir , with 12.86 billion barrels of oil in reserves , went to the norwegian-russian consortium after the preceding day had seen auctions won by shell and china 's cnpc .
located in relatively calm and secure southern iraq , west qurna is expected to produce 1.8 billion barrels per day . lukoil and statoilhydro requested 1.15 dollars for each barrel extracted from the giant field .
lukoil will take 85 percent and statoilhydro 15 percent .
the deals reached so far in the two-day auction promise to increase iraq 's oil production by more than 4.2 million barrels per day .
underbidding the competition the prices to develop the largest fields bid by oil companies have been lower than many expected .
" they were astonishingly low figures .
but 2009 will be remembered as the year that iraq opened its door to the international oil companies and then shut it .
it 's 10 fields and that 's it , " a senior oil executive told reuters .
" so it 's strategic for the oil firms , either you are here or you are n't and this is the chance .
you have to think about it like that . "
oil fields were auctioned off to multiple firms , including a consortium led by the russian firm gazprom , france 's total and the malaysia 's petronas .
but some fields near baghdad and the northern city of mosul were still considered too risky for the international firms and received no bids during the auction .
security for the auction at the oil ministry in baghdad was extremely tight after a string of bombings targeted various government buildings around the city on tuesday .
iraq has the world 's third largest oil reserves at 115 billion barrels , behind saudi arabia and iran .

a russian-norwegian consortium won a bid to develop iraq 's biggest oil field . russia 's oil company lukoil and the norwegian statoilhydro won a joint bid on saturday to develop iraq 's largest undeveloped oil field .
on the second day of the largest iraqi postwar auction , the west qurna-2 reservoir , with 12.86 billion barrels of oil in reserves , went to the norwegian-russian consortium after the preceding day had seen auctions won by shell and china 's cnpc .
located in relatively calm and secure southern iraq , west qurna is expected to produce 1.8 billion barrels per day . lukoil and statoilhydro requested 1.15 dollars for each barrel extracted from the giant field .
lukoil will take 85 percent and statoilhydro 15 percent .
the deals reached so far in the two-day auction promise to increase iraq 's oil production by more than 4.2 million barrels per day .
underbidding the competition the prices to develop the largest fields bid by oil companies have been lower than many expected .
" they were astonishingly low figures .
but 2009 will be remembered as the year that iraq opened its door to the international oil companies and then shut it .
it 's 10 fields and that 's it , " a senior oil executive told reuters .
" so it 's strategic for the oil firms , either you are here or you are n't and this is the chance .
you have to think about it like that . "
oil fields were auctioned off to multiple firms , including a consortium led by the russian firm gazprom , france 's total and the malaysia 's petronas .
but some fields near baghdad and the northern city of mosul were still considered too risky for the international firms and received no bids during the auction .
security for the auction at the oil ministry in baghdad was extremely tight after a string of bombings targeted various government buildings around the city on tuesday .
iraq has the world 's third largest oil reserves at 115 billion barrels , behind saudi arabia and iran .
oil sales make up 85 percent of iraq 's revenue. sjt / afp / reuters / ap editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead of creating new concepts of nation building , leaders should read lawrence of arabia , argues a foreign policy expert . john hulsman is the author of the recently released " to begin the world over again : lawrence of arabia from damascus to baghdad . "
he is president of john hulsman enterprises , an international relations consulting firm , and a member of the council on foreign relations .
he is based in germany .
deutsche welle : in your new book you argue that instead of trying to develop new strategies for counterinsurgency and nation building in afghanistan , western leaders should read t. e. lawrence 's " 27 articles " written in 1917 during the so-called arab revolt as a guide for british officers .
what can we learn from lawrence of arabia that would help us today in afghanistan ?
john hulsman : the thing that was missing in barack obama 's speech was of course the most important piece from a lawrence point of view which is what are the locals going to do if you do these other things .
the problem with modern nation building is that it 's always about what 's going on in washington and other capitals , what the strategy should be for outsiders rather than what the strategy should be actually in these places that we are trying to nation build . lawrence realized that the key to success in the arab revolt was n't him , was n't the british , was n't the turks - it was the arabs .
could he make the arabs stakeholders in a settlement whereby he built a nation organically using the pieces there .
and so rather than create a nation where none had existed he worked with tribal leaders building something from the bottom up , seeing them as the key to the story , making them stakeholders in the assessment , realizing how their culture worked .
in other words it was entirely different than the failed efforts in bosnia , somalia , haiti , kosovo , afghanistan and iraq where we 've done this exactly the wrong way with the wrong philosophy .
if you are going to build a people you have to make sure you do n't liberate them from themselves .
probably the most famous advice given by t.e. lawrence in his " 27 articles " postulates " better the arabs do it tolerably than that you do it perfectly . "
has the international community heeded that advice so far in its mission in afghanistan ?
one of the things people say is " is n't it terrible that we 're working with these warlords . "
who do these people think has been running afghanistan for the last 1,000 years ?
not thomas jefferson and not james madison .
i wish that were the case , but it 's just not .
better that they be given control in terms of money - of course we should account for it because there is a lot of corruption in afghanistan - better they be given control over the building projects that they 're doing rather than we tell them what to build .
and of course they wo n't do it as well if we would do it by western standards .
but the key is n't how well they do it , but that they will be made stakeholders in the process so that they see that they are rebuilding their nation , they are building their country , not that we are imposing some sort of diktat from outside .
i think that is actually the key piece of advice from the " 27 articles , " because it encapsulates what 's wrong with what we are doing .
what we are doing should be mainly psychological and political , and then only secondarily military .
in the arab revolt in 1917 , lawrence figured out that if the arabs were on his side he could n't lose and if they were n't on his side that he could n't win . and that 's what 's missing from obama 's plan .
there was precious little mention of local politics and working with localities .
the problem with the afghan constitution that we imposed on the country after installing karzai is that it 's centralized , that we 've made kabul the center of the political decision making when in afghanistan the tribe and localism has been the center of the afghan experience of a 1,000 years . lawrence would understand this in a heartbeat .
and that 's why in a sense what 's happening in afghanistan is so tragic and why i was really desperately impelled to write this book .
it comes out of a practical experience of working in washington on iraq and afghanistan and then i read this guy and i immediately said that 's it , that 's what 's missing . bildunterschrift : isaf commander stanley mcchrystal is trying to work closer with the afghan people lawrence of arabia , as the name and the popular movie about him suggest , was famous for his knowledge of and closeness to the arabs that contributed to his success .
do the current military and civilian leaders in charge of the afghan mission know enough about the country and its people ?
no , i do n't think they do .
i give general mcchrystal real credit , because he is aware that this is an area where they are falling behind .
in iraq , one of the most important things that explained to me why we failed there was when i read at the time that of the 200 senior staffers that viceroy paul bremer brought in under george w. bush to look after iraq , only one had an advanced degree in anything relating to iraq or the middle east .
and lawrence would say you ca n't transform a society you do n't know anything about , that 's just common sense . i laud mcchrystal for realizing that something is missing , but intellectually these guys do n't know anything near what lawrence did .
lawrence had worked before the war in an archeological dig with the arabs in karkemish , he spoke their language , he knew their tribal structure , he knew their feuds , he knew who liked whom and why .
cultural knowledge is far more important than military knowledge if you are going to do anything successful on counterinsurgency and nation building .
of course lawrence of arabia is perhaps most well-known for his military achievements , i.e. the arab revolt , the battle of aqaba and the fall of damascus .
what military lessons can the isaf troops in afghanistan learn from lawrence ?
what they can learn is actually an old german saying and they could read their clausewitz again .
clausewitz got it right that military matters are only an extension of doing things politically . if we clear the taliban somehow through a miracle from afghanistan , which we of course ca n't do because they are locals and not some foreign outside force , but even if we could get rid of all the taliban by some miracle we still would n't have stability in afghanistan because there is n't anything political to build on .
that is the key .
despite his successes , lawrence of arabia 's grand vision of arab self-determination failed in the end when the british and the french decided to divide the middle east between them .
is n't that a stark reminder that in afghanistan , realpolitik ultimately might trump visionary politics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban have steadily gained ground in afghanistan yes it definitely could .
we need to go from bottom up rather than from top down .
the british and french went top down .
they said what matters most on the great power level .
the reason why it is better to start with the micro level and then go to the macro level is really old-fashioned burkean thinking .
if you get the stuff on the ground locally right you can then build something .
if we get the various tribal leaders to buy into our settlement , then you can go to the chinese , the russians , the indians and the pakistanis and say , we can promise you stability , but only if we all do n't intervene and meddle , including the united states .
going bottom up leads to that stability .
without that local component it wo n't work as was seen in the case of lawrence , that is absolutely right .

" being the champions of the first half means nothing to me , " said jupp heynckes , coach of first place bayer leverkusen , after his team 's 2-2 draw against last place hertha berlin .
the single point from the draw left the door open for other teams in the bundesliga to close in on leverkusen 's top spot with one game to go before the winter break .
if being in first place at the end of the first half is irrelevant for heynckes , then there are two other teams in the league who would gladly celebrate the holidays from the top of the standings in leverkusen 's stead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes is unconcerned with being crowned the first half champs those teams would be schalke and bayern munich , who both won their matches in the bundesliga to narrow the gap to heynckes ' team .
leverkusen leads the league with 32 points , just one ahead of second place schalke and two in front of munich .
battle for second goes to schalke despite playing with the home-field advantage , werder bremen was forced to concede second place and any hopes of leading the league before the break after losing 2-0 in schalke .
heading into the match , the two were tied on points , with schalke trailing on goal differential .
kevin kuranyi put the first goal in the net for schalke just after the second half got underway , and jan moravek , coming off the bench , took a pass from kuranyi and sealed the victory for schalke with the final goal in the 72nd minute .
the loss ended bremen 's undefeated streak of 23 matches and left them in fourth place , four points off the top and two shy of third place bayern .
bayern continues to win fresh off their convincing 4-0 thrashing of juventus that advanced them to the knock-out stage of the champions league , munich won again in the bundesliga with another feast of goals .
the final tally for bayern , playing on the road against bochum , was 5-1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's ivica olic scored three goals agains bochum mario gomez got things started for the bavarians , scoring his fourth goal in four matches in the 23rd minute .
ivica olic added a pair of goals on either side of the break , and danijel prandic scored munich 's final goal ten minutes after half-time .
bochum 's mergim marvic put the fifth goal on the board for bayern , misdirecting a clearance attempt into his own goal .
christian fuchs prevented a bayern shutout with a free kick in the 76th minute .
" it 's been a great week , the best since i have been in munich , " said a pleased munich coach louis van gaal .
" we are only two points off the top spot and that is very satisfying . "
bad luck for hanover it may have been a memorable day for louis van gaal , but saturday 's game between borussia moenchengladbach and hanover 96 is one that hanover defender karim haggui would probably rather forget after putting two goals into his own net .
the first came after hanover florian fromlowitz slipped while attempting to clear the ball and kicked it into haggui 's leg , which deflected the ball back into the net .
the second was a back pass that missed fromlowitz and landed in the goal in stoppage time .
huggui could n't help but grin over his terrible luck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanover scored three own goals incredibly , haggui was n't the only one to score at the wrong end for hanover .
in the 58th minute , constant djakpa gave moenchengladbach their third early christmas present of the match .
moenchengladbach did manage to score two goals of their own , with rob friend scoring in the 22nd minute and michael bradley sending a free kick to the back of the net in the 68th .
hanover put three goals in the correct goal as well , including two from didier ya konan , for a final score of 5-3 for moenchengladbach .
" we saw a crazy , curious match , " said hanover coach andreas bergmann .
" it 's unbelievable we scored six goals and lost the match .
i do n't think we 'll forget this match any time soon . "
hamburg still contenders while schalke and bayern are closing in on leverkusen as the first half of the season comes to a close , hamburg has kept itself in a good position for when play resumes in january with a 4-0 road win over nuremburg .
eljero elia scored twice for the visiting side , and marcel jansen and tunay torun added 1 goal each .

vogel had been due to attend an islamic rally in the swiss capital berne on saturday against a ban on the construction of new minarets . switzerland voted to ban the building of new minarets in a referendum two weeks ago .
the surprise result provoked condemnation across the world . reports said vogel objected to not being allowed into switzerland , but that he cooperated with border guards and signed the order banning his entry into the country .
he then returned to germany .
a report on the swiss broadcasting corporation 's web site said that vogel was not allowed in as the federal migration office said his presence could pose a threat to public law and order .
vogel , a former professional boxer who converted to islam in 2001 , told swiss newspapers that he wanted to encourage muslims in switzerland to come out of their social isolation and help lessen mistrust , the site said .
over 57 percent of voters and all but four of the country 's 26 cantons approved the proposal to ban new minarets .
the right-wing swiss people 's party was the driving force behind the november 29 referendum .
the government said it would respect the people 's decision and would no longer permit construction of minarets .
however , it tried to assure the country 's 400,000-strong muslim community that the ban did not amount to “ a rejection of the muslim community , religion or culture . ” rb / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the official bulgarian reaction so far has been noncommittal . bulgaria is in talks with the united states to host some of the inmates from guantanamo bay , the country 's interior minister said on saturday .
tsvetan tsvetanov confirmed his country was considering a request from the obama administration for an arrangement to host former detainees .
the government in sofia had received a letter addressed to prime minister boyko borisov , tsvetanov said in a national radio interview " we have not taken a decision yet , " he said .
" in any case , bulgaria 's participation would be small and we would not accept people who might pose a threat to our national security . "
the issue was due to be discussed before parliament , he added .
gesture of soldarity bulgarian prime minister borisov said he thinks taking an inmate would be a strong gesture of cooperation between europe and the united states .
" there is european and nato solidarity .
just like we seek support for everything from our euro-atlantic partners , president obama is now seeking this from all of us , " borisov told reporters .
" my personal opinion is that we should accept one person . "
his center-right administration , which replaced its socialist predecessor in july , is conscious of the balkan country 's image that was marred by the previous government 's failure to tame corruption and crime .
ongoing effort to close prison the united states embassy in sofia confirmed to afp late friday that : " us special envoy for guantanamo closure , daniel fried , visited bulgaria from december 2-3 and met with bulgarian officials . "
" while we do not comment on our bilateral discussions with foreign governments , we are encouraged by the continued willingness of many of our close friends and allies to consider resettling detainees and help our effort to close the guantanamo bay detention facility , " it added in a statement .
the us continues to seek out potential hosts for former guantanamo inmates as part of president barack obama 's initiative to shut down the controversial detention camp .
obama had promised to shut down the facility within a year of taking office but , because of diplomatic and political obstacles , there are still more than 200 inmates who need to be relocated .
earlier this month , the french foreign ministry said two detainees at guantanamo were sent to france and to hungary .

instead of creating new concepts of nation building , leaders should read lawrence of arabia , argues a foreign policy expert . john hulsman is the author of the recently released " to begin the world over again : lawrence of arabia from damascus to baghdad . "
he is president of john hulsman enterprises , an international relations consulting firm , and a member of the council on foreign relations .
he is based in germany .
deutsche welle : in your new book you argue that instead of trying to develop new strategies for counterinsurgency and nation building in afghanistan , western leaders should read t. e. lawrence 's " 27 articles " written in 1917 during the so-called arab revolt as a guide for british officers .
what can we learn from lawrence of arabia that would help us today in afghanistan ?
john hulsman : the thing that was missing in barack obama 's speech was of course the most important piece from a lawrence point of view which is what are the locals going to do if you do these other things .
the problem with modern nation building is that it 's always about what 's going on in washington and other capitals , what the strategy should be for outsiders rather than what the strategy should be actually in these places that we are trying to nation build . lawrence realized that the key to success in the arab revolt was n't him , was n't the british , was n't the turks - it was the arabs .
could he make the arabs stakeholders in a settlement whereby he built a nation organically using the pieces there .
and so rather than create a nation where none had existed he worked with tribal leaders building something from the bottom up , seeing them as the key to the story , making them stakeholders in the assessment , realizing how their culture worked .
in other words it was entirely different than the failed efforts in bosnia , somalia , haiti , kosovo , afghanistan and iraq where we 've done this exactly the wrong way with the wrong philosophy .
if you are going to build a people you have to make sure you do n't liberate them from themselves .
probably the most famous advice given by t.e. lawrence in his " 27 articles " postulates " better the arabs do it tolerably than that you do it perfectly . "
has the international community heeded that advice so far in its mission in afghanistan ?
one of the things people say is " is n't it terrible that we 're working with these warlords . "
who do these people think has been running afghanistan for the last 1,000 years ?
not thomas jefferson and not james madison .
i wish that were the case , but it 's just not .
better that they be given control in terms of money - of course we should account for it because there is a lot of corruption in afghanistan - better they be given control over the building projects that they 're doing rather than we tell them what to build .
and of course they wo n't do it as well if we would do it by western standards .
but the key is n't how well they do it , but that they will be made stakeholders in the process so that they see that they are rebuilding their nation , they are building their country , not that we are imposing some sort of diktat from outside .
i think that is actually the key piece of advice from the " 27 articles , " because it encapsulates what 's wrong with what we are doing .
what we are doing should be mainly psychological and political , and then only secondarily military .
in the arab revolt in 1917 , lawrence figured out that if the arabs were on his side he could n't lose and if they were n't on his side that he could n't win . and that 's what 's missing from obama 's plan .
there was precious little mention of local politics and working with localities .
the problem with the afghan constitution that we imposed on the country after installing karzai is that it 's centralized , that we 've made kabul the center of the political decision making when in afghanistan the tribe and localism has been the center of the afghan experience of a 1,000 years . lawrence would understand this in a heartbeat .
and that 's why in a sense what 's happening in afghanistan is so tragic and why i was really desperately impelled to write this book .
it comes out of a practical experience of working in washington on iraq and afghanistan and then i read this guy and i immediately said that 's it , that 's what 's missing . bildunterschrift : isaf commander stanley mcchrystal is trying to work closer with the afghan people lawrence of arabia , as the name and the popular movie about him suggest , was famous for his knowledge of and closeness to the arabs that contributed to his success .
do the current military and civilian leaders in charge of the afghan mission know enough about the country and its people ?
no , i do n't think they do .
i give general mcchrystal real credit , because he is aware that this is an area where they are falling behind .
in iraq , one of the most important things that explained to me why we failed there was when i read at the time that of the 200 senior staffers that viceroy paul bremer brought in under george w. bush to look after iraq , only one had an advanced degree in anything relating to iraq or the middle east .
and lawrence would say you ca n't transform a society you do n't know anything about , that 's just common sense . i laud mcchrystal for realizing that something is missing , but intellectually these guys do n't know anything near what lawrence did .
lawrence had worked before the war in an archeological dig with the arabs in karkemish , he spoke their language , he knew their tribal structure , he knew their feuds , he knew who liked whom and why .
cultural knowledge is far more important than military knowledge if you are going to do anything successful on counterinsurgency and nation building .
of course lawrence of arabia is perhaps most well-known for his military achievements , i.e. the arab revolt , the battle of aqaba and the fall of damascus .
what military lessons can the isaf troops in afghanistan learn from lawrence ?
what they can learn is actually an old german saying and they could read their clausewitz again .
clausewitz got it right that military matters are only an extension of doing things politically . if we clear the taliban somehow through a miracle from afghanistan , which we of course ca n't do because they are locals and not some foreign outside force , but even if we could get rid of all the taliban by some miracle we still would n't have stability in afghanistan because there is n't anything political to build on .
that is the key .
despite his successes , lawrence of arabia 's grand vision of arab self-determination failed in the end when the british and the french decided to divide the middle east between them .
is n't that a stark reminder that in afghanistan , realpolitik ultimately might trump visionary politics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban have steadily gained ground in afghanistan yes it definitely could .
we need to go from bottom up rather than from top down .
the british and french went top down .
they said what matters most on the great power level .
the reason why it is better to start with the micro level and then go to the macro level is really old-fashioned burkean thinking .
if you get the stuff on the ground locally right you can then build something .
if we get the various tribal leaders to buy into our settlement , then you can go to the chinese , the russians , the indians and the pakistanis and say , we can promise you stability , but only if we all do n't intervene and meddle , including the united states .
going bottom up leads to that stability .
without that local component it wo n't work as was seen in the case of lawrence , that is absolutely right .

thousands took to the streets on saturday to urge leaders at un talks to agree on a deal to fight global warming . danish police say they have released nearly all of the 968 people detained during a climate rally which drew an estimated 40,000 people in the danish capital on saturday . law enforcement authorities said only 13 demonstrators were still in custody on sunday and of those , three are set to be arraigned on preliminary charges of fighting with the police . on saturday , the heart of the danish capital became a sea of blue as environmentalists and anti-capitalist demonstrators gathered in front of parliament at the start of a six-kilometer -lrb- four-mile -rrb- march that took them to the venue of the ongoing united nations climate summit . the protesters ' aim was to pressure united nations negotiators to take concrete action on climate change .
an estimated 40,000 people attended the march which was jointly organized by over 500 groups from 67 countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were scuffles in copenhagen as police detained hundreds for throwing bottles and smashing windows the procession wound its way from the folketing , the danish parliament , to the conference site , the massive bella center on the outskirts of the city center . demonstrators wore sky blue raincoats or carried blue umbrellas following a call by the environmental group , friends of the earth . activists slam rich nations nigerian nnimmo bassey , chairman of friends of the earth international , delivered a fiery speech to the crowd . " we can not allow carbon traders to damage the world .
there is no such thing as clean coal or clean crude .
leave the oil in the soil , leave the coal in the hole , " he said .
" to those who want to pollute at home and plant a tree somewhere we say no , " he added .
the demonstrations come as delegates to the un climate summit currently under way in copenhagen wrangle over a draft blueprint for a global pact .
at the un conference itself , developing nations on friday rejected as " insignificant " an eu pledge of 7.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- to help them tackle global warming .
the accord , which would see the money paid over three years , came a week before 110 heads of state and government convene in copenhagen for the finale of the 12-day conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel was criticized by greenpeace for not doing enough the head of greenpeace , kumi naidoo , strongly criticized german chancellor angela merkel for doing too little to help poorer nations cope with the effects of climate change .
" angela merkel can steer the rudder in copenhagen , " naidoo told the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday .
" but her behavior in the current debate is more than disappointing . " in an interview to be published in the sunday edition of the tabloid daily bild , merkel chided the developing countries for expecting richer ones to shoulder more of the burden . " we will not allow germany and the other european industrial states to lead the way on climate change , while others do nothing and then poach jobs from us , using the argument of lower costs for environmental protection , " merkel said . tight security the danish capital had resembled a military zone as authorities prepared for the arrival of activists from all over the world .
helicopters buzzed in the skies while armored police vans and canine squads patrolled the streets , amid fears that saturday 's march could be joined by violent far-left groups .
police also beefed up security at denmark 's land and sea borders to prevent troublemakers from entering the country .
shopkeepers and businesses were warned of a possible outbreak of violence .
those warnings unfortunately came to fruition to a small degree , as police arrested nearly a thousand people who had been throwing rocks and fireworks at police and smashing storefront windows .
on friday , authorities had rounded up 75 anti-capitalist demonstrators , 13 from germany , who were suspected of trying to set up an unauthorized blockade of companies they thought were emitting greenhouse gases .
protests worldwide protests and marches supporting a new climate covenant took place in more than 100 other countries as well , including greece , spain , and germany .
hours before the demonstration was due to kick off in copenhagen , protesters were out in force around asia , waving banners and chanting slogans urging action from the climate conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists march in sydney , australia as part of worldwide climate demonstrations in australia , organizers said around 50,000 people had taken to the streets nationwide , wearing sky-blue shoelaces in a call for a strong and binding agreement at the un talks .
" we want -lrb- world leaders -rrb- to bring home a treaty , we want them to stand by the pacific and our neighbors there .
and we want them to deliver and ensure a safe climate future for us all , " said james dannenberg , one of the organizers .

vogel had been due to attend an islamic rally in the swiss capital berne on saturday against a ban on the construction of new minarets . switzerland voted to ban the building of new minarets in a referendum two weeks ago .
the surprise result provoked condemnation across the world . reports said vogel objected to not being allowed into switzerland , but that he cooperated with border guards and signed the order banning his entry into the country .
he then returned to germany .
a report on the swiss broadcasting corporation 's web site said that vogel was not allowed in as the federal migration office said his presence could pose a threat to public law and order .
vogel , a former professional boxer who converted to islam in 2001 , told swiss newspapers that he wanted to encourage muslims in switzerland to come out of their social isolation and help lessen mistrust , the site said .
over 57 percent of voters and all but four of the country 's 26 cantons approved the proposal to ban new minarets .
the right-wing swiss people 's party was the driving force behind the november 29 referendum .
the government said it would respect the people 's decision and would no longer permit construction of minarets .
however , it tried to assure the country 's 400,000-strong muslim community that the ban did not amount to “ a rejection of the muslim community , religion or culture . ” rb / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the official bulgarian reaction so far has been noncommittal . bulgaria is in talks with the united states to host some of the inmates from guantanamo bay , the country 's interior minister said on saturday .
tsvetan tsvetanov confirmed his country was considering a request from the obama administration for an arrangement to host former detainees .
the government in sofia had received a letter addressed to prime minister boyko borisov , tsvetanov said in a national radio interview " we have not taken a decision yet , " he said .
" in any case , bulgaria 's participation would be small and we would not accept people who might pose a threat to our national security . "
the issue was due to be discussed before parliament , he added .
gesture of soldarity bulgarian prime minister borisov said he thinks taking an inmate would be a strong gesture of cooperation between europe and the united states .
" there is european and nato solidarity .
just like we seek support for everything from our euro-atlantic partners , president obama is now seeking this from all of us , " borisov told reporters .
" my personal opinion is that we should accept one person . "
his center-right administration , which replaced its socialist predecessor in july , is conscious of the balkan country 's image that was marred by the previous government 's failure to tame corruption and crime .
ongoing effort to close prison the united states embassy in sofia confirmed to afp late friday that : " us special envoy for guantanamo closure , daniel fried , visited bulgaria from december 2-3 and met with bulgarian officials . "
" while we do not comment on our bilateral discussions with foreign governments , we are encouraged by the continued willingness of many of our close friends and allies to consider resettling detainees and help our effort to close the guantanamo bay detention facility , " it added in a statement .
the us continues to seek out potential hosts for former guantanamo inmates as part of president barack obama 's initiative to shut down the controversial detention camp .
obama had promised to shut down the facility within a year of taking office but , because of diplomatic and political obstacles , there are still more than 200 inmates who need to be relocated .
earlier this month , the french foreign ministry said two detainees at guantanamo were sent to france and to hungary .
overall , however , the international response to us requests for inmate hosting has been muted. sjt / dpa / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the shipment was worth 16 million euros and reportedly part of a larger order dispatched by a swedish subsidiary of siemens to an iranian company .
in the other case , the magazine reported that the british navy stopped a chinese ship containing computers near dubai .
the shipment was intended for an iranian company .
the computers , which are used to control nuclear reactors , were thought to have been sent to china by siemens .
siemens would not give specific details about the shipments .
but the company told der spiegel that it did not break any german foreign trade laws .
“ our business activities in iran serve purely civil purposes and are in accord with international legal regulations , ” a siemens spokesperson told the magazine .
not the first controversy with iran the latest allegations come months after criticism that siemens , along with its finnish partner nokia , sold technology to iran that was thought to be capable of monitoring phone calls and e-mails .
this was in the wake of iran 's widespread post-election protests , where the iranian government was accused of censoring public dissent .

" voice call monitoring is required by the courts to listen to phone calls coming from a particular phone number , the telecommunication systems have an ability to do that , " roome said .
he added that the technology provided by nsn allows millions of iranians to communicate every day. mk / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead of creating new concepts of nation building , leaders should read lawrence of arabia , argues a foreign policy expert . john hulsman is the author of the recently released " to begin the world over again : lawrence of arabia from damascus to baghdad . "
he is president of john hulsman enterprises , an international relations consulting firm , and a member of the council on foreign relations .
he is based in germany .
deutsche welle : in your new book you argue that instead of trying to develop new strategies for counterinsurgency and nation building in afghanistan , western leaders should read t. e. lawrence 's " 27 articles " written in 1917 during the so-called arab revolt as a guide for british officers .
what can we learn from lawrence of arabia that would help us today in afghanistan ?
john hulsman : the thing that was missing in barack obama 's speech was of course the most important piece from a lawrence point of view which is what are the locals going to do if you do these other things .
the problem with modern nation building is that it 's always about what 's going on in washington and other capitals , what the strategy should be for outsiders rather than what the strategy should be actually in these places that we are trying to nation build . lawrence realized that the key to success in the arab revolt was n't him , was n't the british , was n't the turks - it was the arabs .
could he make the arabs stakeholders in a settlement whereby he built a nation organically using the pieces there .
and so rather than create a nation where none had existed he worked with tribal leaders building something from the bottom up , seeing them as the key to the story , making them stakeholders in the assessment , realizing how their culture worked .
in other words it was entirely different than the failed efforts in bosnia , somalia , haiti , kosovo , afghanistan and iraq where we 've done this exactly the wrong way with the wrong philosophy .
if you are going to build a people you have to make sure you do n't liberate them from themselves .
probably the most famous advice given by t.e. lawrence in his " 27 articles " postulates " better the arabs do it tolerably than that you do it perfectly . "
has the international community heeded that advice so far in its mission in afghanistan ?
one of the things people say is " is n't it terrible that we 're working with these warlords . "
who do these people think has been running afghanistan for the last 1,000 years ?
not thomas jefferson and not james madison .
i wish that were the case , but it 's just not .
better that they be given control in terms of money - of course we should account for it because there is a lot of corruption in afghanistan - better they be given control over the building projects that they 're doing rather than we tell them what to build .
and of course they wo n't do it as well if we would do it by western standards .
but the key is n't how well they do it , but that they will be made stakeholders in the process so that they see that they are rebuilding their nation , they are building their country , not that we are imposing some sort of diktat from outside .
i think that is actually the key piece of advice from the " 27 articles , " because it encapsulates what 's wrong with what we are doing .
what we are doing should be mainly psychological and political , and then only secondarily military .
in the arab revolt in 1917 , lawrence figured out that if the arabs were on his side he could n't lose and if they were n't on his side that he could n't win . and that 's what 's missing from obama 's plan .
there was precious little mention of local politics and working with localities .
the problem with the afghan constitution that we imposed on the country after installing karzai is that it 's centralized , that we 've made kabul the center of the political decision making when in afghanistan the tribe and localism has been the center of the afghan experience of a 1,000 years . lawrence would understand this in a heartbeat .
and that 's why in a sense what 's happening in afghanistan is so tragic and why i was really desperately impelled to write this book .
it comes out of a practical experience of working in washington on iraq and afghanistan and then i read this guy and i immediately said that 's it , that 's what 's missing . bildunterschrift : isaf commander stanley mcchrystal is trying to work closer with the afghan people lawrence of arabia , as the name and the popular movie about him suggest , was famous for his knowledge of and closeness to the arabs that contributed to his success .
do the current military and civilian leaders in charge of the afghan mission know enough about the country and its people ?
no , i do n't think they do .
i give general mcchrystal real credit , because he is aware that this is an area where they are falling behind .
in iraq , one of the most important things that explained to me why we failed there was when i read at the time that of the 200 senior staffers that viceroy paul bremer brought in under george w. bush to look after iraq , only one had an advanced degree in anything relating to iraq or the middle east .
and lawrence would say you ca n't transform a society you do n't know anything about , that 's just common sense . i laud mcchrystal for realizing that something is missing , but intellectually these guys do n't know anything near what lawrence did .
lawrence had worked before the war in an archeological dig with the arabs in karkemish , he spoke their language , he knew their tribal structure , he knew their feuds , he knew who liked whom and why .
cultural knowledge is far more important than military knowledge if you are going to do anything successful on counterinsurgency and nation building .
of course lawrence of arabia is perhaps most well-known for his military achievements , i.e. the arab revolt , the battle of aqaba and the fall of damascus .
what military lessons can the isaf troops in afghanistan learn from lawrence ?
what they can learn is actually an old german saying and they could read their clausewitz again .
clausewitz got it right that military matters are only an extension of doing things politically . if we clear the taliban somehow through a miracle from afghanistan , which we of course ca n't do because they are locals and not some foreign outside force , but even if we could get rid of all the taliban by some miracle we still would n't have stability in afghanistan because there is n't anything political to build on .
that is the key .
despite his successes , lawrence of arabia 's grand vision of arab self-determination failed in the end when the british and the french decided to divide the middle east between them .
is n't that a stark reminder that in afghanistan , realpolitik ultimately might trump visionary politics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban have steadily gained ground in afghanistan yes it definitely could .
we need to go from bottom up rather than from top down .
the british and french went top down .
they said what matters most on the great power level .
the reason why it is better to start with the micro level and then go to the macro level is really old-fashioned burkean thinking .
if you get the stuff on the ground locally right you can then build something .
if we get the various tribal leaders to buy into our settlement , then you can go to the chinese , the russians , the indians and the pakistanis and say , we can promise you stability , but only if we all do n't intervene and meddle , including the united states .
going bottom up leads to that stability .
without that local component it wo n't work as was seen in the case of lawrence , that is absolutely right .

a russian-norwegian consortium won a bid to develop iraq 's biggest oil field . russia 's oil company lukoil and the norwegian statoilhydro won a joint bid on saturday to develop iraq 's largest undeveloped oil field .
on the second day of the largest iraqi postwar auction , the west qurna-2 reservoir , with 12.86 billion barrels of oil in reserves , went to the norwegian-russian consortium after the preceding day had seen auctions won by shell and china 's cnpc .
located in relatively calm and secure southern iraq , west qurna is expected to produce 1.8 billion barrels per day . lukoil and statoilhydro requested 1.15 dollars for each barrel extracted from the giant field .
lukoil will take 85 percent and statoilhydro 15 percent .
the deals reached so far in the two-day auction promise to increase iraq 's oil production by more than 4.2 million barrels per day .
underbidding the competition the prices to develop the largest fields bid by oil companies have been lower than many expected .
" they were astonishingly low figures .
but 2009 will be remembered as the year that iraq opened its door to the international oil companies and then shut it .
it 's 10 fields and that 's it , " a senior oil executive told reuters .
" so it 's strategic for the oil firms , either you are here or you are n't and this is the chance .
you have to think about it like that . "
oil fields were auctioned off to multiple firms , including a consortium led by the russian firm gazprom , france 's total and the malaysia 's petronas .
but some fields near baghdad and the northern city of mosul were still considered too risky for the international firms and received no bids during the auction .
security for the auction at the oil ministry in baghdad was extremely tight after a string of bombings targeted various government buildings around the city on tuesday .

instead of creating new concepts of nation building , leaders should read lawrence of arabia , argues a foreign policy expert . john hulsman is the author of the recently released " to begin the world over again : lawrence of arabia from damascus to baghdad . "
he is president of john hulsman enterprises , an international relations consulting firm , and a member of the council on foreign relations .
he is based in germany .
deutsche welle : in your new book you argue that instead of trying to develop new strategies for counterinsurgency and nation building in afghanistan , western leaders should read t. e. lawrence 's " 27 articles " written in 1917 during the so-called arab revolt as a guide for british officers .
what can we learn from lawrence of arabia that would help us today in afghanistan ?
john hulsman : the thing that was missing in barack obama 's speech was of course the most important piece from a lawrence point of view which is what are the locals going to do if you do these other things .
the problem with modern nation building is that it 's always about what 's going on in washington and other capitals , what the strategy should be for outsiders rather than what the strategy should be actually in these places that we are trying to nation build . lawrence realized that the key to success in the arab revolt was n't him , was n't the british , was n't the turks - it was the arabs .
could he make the arabs stakeholders in a settlement whereby he built a nation organically using the pieces there .
and so rather than create a nation where none had existed he worked with tribal leaders building something from the bottom up , seeing them as the key to the story , making them stakeholders in the assessment , realizing how their culture worked .
in other words it was entirely different than the failed efforts in bosnia , somalia , haiti , kosovo , afghanistan and iraq where we 've done this exactly the wrong way with the wrong philosophy .
if you are going to build a people you have to make sure you do n't liberate them from themselves .
probably the most famous advice given by t.e. lawrence in his " 27 articles " postulates " better the arabs do it tolerably than that you do it perfectly . "
has the international community heeded that advice so far in its mission in afghanistan ?
one of the things people say is " is n't it terrible that we 're working with these warlords . "
who do these people think has been running afghanistan for the last 1,000 years ?
not thomas jefferson and not james madison .
i wish that were the case , but it 's just not .
better that they be given control in terms of money - of course we should account for it because there is a lot of corruption in afghanistan - better they be given control over the building projects that they 're doing rather than we tell them what to build .
and of course they wo n't do it as well if we would do it by western standards .
but the key is n't how well they do it , but that they will be made stakeholders in the process so that they see that they are rebuilding their nation , they are building their country , not that we are imposing some sort of diktat from outside .
i think that is actually the key piece of advice from the " 27 articles , " because it encapsulates what 's wrong with what we are doing .
what we are doing should be mainly psychological and political , and then only secondarily military .
in the arab revolt in 1917 , lawrence figured out that if the arabs were on his side he could n't lose and if they were n't on his side that he could n't win . and that 's what 's missing from obama 's plan .
there was precious little mention of local politics and working with localities .
the problem with the afghan constitution that we imposed on the country after installing karzai is that it 's centralized , that we 've made kabul the center of the political decision making when in afghanistan the tribe and localism has been the center of the afghan experience of a 1,000 years . lawrence would understand this in a heartbeat .
and that 's why in a sense what 's happening in afghanistan is so tragic and why i was really desperately impelled to write this book .
it comes out of a practical experience of working in washington on iraq and afghanistan and then i read this guy and i immediately said that 's it , that 's what 's missing . bildunterschrift : isaf commander stanley mcchrystal is trying to work closer with the afghan people lawrence of arabia , as the name and the popular movie about him suggest , was famous for his knowledge of and closeness to the arabs that contributed to his success .
do the current military and civilian leaders in charge of the afghan mission know enough about the country and its people ?
no , i do n't think they do .
i give general mcchrystal real credit , because he is aware that this is an area where they are falling behind .
in iraq , one of the most important things that explained to me why we failed there was when i read at the time that of the 200 senior staffers that viceroy paul bremer brought in under george w. bush to look after iraq , only one had an advanced degree in anything relating to iraq or the middle east .
and lawrence would say you ca n't transform a society you do n't know anything about , that 's just common sense . i laud mcchrystal for realizing that something is missing , but intellectually these guys do n't know anything near what lawrence did .
lawrence had worked before the war in an archeological dig with the arabs in karkemish , he spoke their language , he knew their tribal structure , he knew their feuds , he knew who liked whom and why .
cultural knowledge is far more important than military knowledge if you are going to do anything successful on counterinsurgency and nation building .
of course lawrence of arabia is perhaps most well-known for his military achievements , i.e. the arab revolt , the battle of aqaba and the fall of damascus .
what military lessons can the isaf troops in afghanistan learn from lawrence ?
what they can learn is actually an old german saying and they could read their clausewitz again .
clausewitz got it right that military matters are only an extension of doing things politically . if we clear the taliban somehow through a miracle from afghanistan , which we of course ca n't do because they are locals and not some foreign outside force , but even if we could get rid of all the taliban by some miracle we still would n't have stability in afghanistan because there is n't anything political to build on .
that is the key .
despite his successes , lawrence of arabia 's grand vision of arab self-determination failed in the end when the british and the french decided to divide the middle east between them .
is n't that a stark reminder that in afghanistan , realpolitik ultimately might trump visionary politics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban have steadily gained ground in afghanistan yes it definitely could .
we need to go from bottom up rather than from top down .
the british and french went top down .
they said what matters most on the great power level .
the reason why it is better to start with the micro level and then go to the macro level is really old-fashioned burkean thinking .
if you get the stuff on the ground locally right you can then build something .
if we get the various tribal leaders to buy into our settlement , then you can go to the chinese , the russians , the indians and the pakistanis and say , we can promise you stability , but only if we all do n't intervene and meddle , including the united states .
going bottom up leads to that stability .
without that local component it wo n't work as was seen in the case of lawrence , that is absolutely right .

police have interviewed three , but are still short of clues . the body of former greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos was dug up by vandals on late thursday or early friday , say police .
three people helped with inquiries into the macabre theft , but no arrests were made , said a police spokesman .
there has been no claim of responsibility , no sign of the corpse and the vandals ' motives for stealing it remain unclear .
whoever took the body , just before the first anniversary of papadopoulos ' death on saturday , appears to have worked overnight through torrential rain .
a former bodyguard found earth beside the grave , along with an empty casket , when he visited the cemetery on the outskirts of nicosia to light a candle on friday morning .
act was ' sacrilege ' cypriot president demetris christofias appealed for calm from brussels , where he was attending the eu summit , but also voiced his outrage . " i am appealing to the public to remain calm in the light of this provocation .
i can not describe this act any other way , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tassos papadopoulos after being elected president " this is a sacrilege .
it is an immoral and condemnable act which is a blight to our culture and respect for our dead . "
papadopoulos died a year ago on saturday , aged 74 , and was celebrated by many greek cypriots for rejecting a united nations reunification plan for the island in 2004 .
the turkish population of the island , which was divided in a 1974 turkish invasion after a greek-inspired coup , had voted in favor of the proposals .
service to go ahead papadopoulos 's family said it would go ahead with a planned commemoration service on saturday .
" this sacrilege , apart from the sadness and anger it has caused , can not in any way bury the politics and the legacy which tassos papadopoulos left behind , " read a family statement .
" wherever he is now , his voice will continue to be heard . "
papadopoulos was president from 2003 until 2008 , when he lost his bid at re-election to christofias , a former coalition partner in his center-left government .

" i think that we are looking at a very significant reorganization of the church in ireland , " said dublin archbishop diarmuid martin after the meeting .
the meeting was called by the pope to discuss the widespread sexual abuse of children by clergymen in ireland , which was reportedly covered up by the church in ireland for decades .
in a statement released by the vatican , the pope said he shares the " outrage , betrayal and shame felt by so many of the faithful in ireland -lrb- over -rrb- these heinous crimes . "
decades of abuse the investigation , known as the murphy report , revealed that not only was sexual abuse of children by priests in ireland prevalent from 1975-2004 , but that the archdiocese of dublin was aware of the situation and maintained a policy of " do n't ask , do n't tell . "
in the vatican 's statement , it said the pope felt " profound regret at the actions of some members of the clergy who have betrayed their solemn promises to god , as well as the trust placed in them by the victims and their families , and by society at large . "
the pope is reportedly planning to issue a letter to irish catholics .
it would be the first time the pope had delivered an official document on the issue of child abuse within the church .

a russian-norwegian consortium won a bid to develop iraq 's biggest oil field . russia 's oil company lukoil and the norwegian statoilhydro won a joint bid on saturday to develop iraq 's largest undeveloped oil field .
on the second day of the largest iraqi postwar auction , the west qurna-2 reservoir , with 12.86 billion barrels of oil in reserves , went to the norwegian-russian consortium after the preceding day had seen auctions won by shell and china 's cnpc .
located in relatively calm and secure southern iraq , west qurna is expected to produce 1.8 billion barrels per day . lukoil and statoilhydro requested 1.15 dollars for each barrel extracted from the giant field .
lukoil will take 85 percent and statoilhydro 15 percent .
the deals reached so far in the two-day auction promise to increase iraq 's oil production by more than 4.2 million barrels per day .
underbidding the competition the prices to develop the largest fields bid by oil companies have been lower than many expected .
" they were astonishingly low figures .
but 2009 will be remembered as the year that iraq opened its door to the international oil companies and then shut it .
it 's 10 fields and that 's it , " a senior oil executive told reuters .
" so it 's strategic for the oil firms , either you are here or you are n't and this is the chance .
you have to think about it like that . "
oil fields were auctioned off to multiple firms , including a consortium led by the russian firm gazprom , france 's total and the malaysia 's petronas .
but some fields near baghdad and the northern city of mosul were still considered too risky for the international firms and received no bids during the auction .
security for the auction at the oil ministry in baghdad was extremely tight after a string of bombings targeted various government buildings around the city on tuesday .

a russian-norwegian consortium won a bid to develop iraq 's biggest oil field . russia 's oil company lukoil and the norwegian statoilhydro won a joint bid on saturday to develop iraq 's largest undeveloped oil field .
on the second day of the largest iraqi postwar auction , the west qurna-2 reservoir , with 12.86 billion barrels of oil in reserves , went to the norwegian-russian consortium after the preceding day had seen auctions won by shell and china 's cnpc .
located in relatively calm and secure southern iraq , west qurna is expected to produce 1.8 billion barrels per day . lukoil and statoilhydro requested 1.15 dollars for each barrel extracted from the giant field .
lukoil will take 85 percent and statoilhydro 15 percent .
the deals reached so far in the two-day auction promise to increase iraq 's oil production by more than 4.2 million barrels per day .

vogel had been due to attend an islamic rally in the swiss capital berne on saturday against a ban on the construction of new minarets . switzerland voted to ban the building of new minarets in a referendum two weeks ago .
the surprise result provoked condemnation across the world . reports said vogel objected to not being allowed into switzerland , but that he cooperated with border guards and signed the order banning his entry into the country .
he then returned to germany .
a report on the swiss broadcasting corporation 's web site said that vogel was not allowed in as the federal migration office said his presence could pose a threat to public law and order .
vogel , a former professional boxer who converted to islam in 2001 , told swiss newspapers that he wanted to encourage muslims in switzerland to come out of their social isolation and help lessen mistrust , the site said .
over 57 percent of voters and all but four of the country 's 26 cantons approved the proposal to ban new minarets .
the right-wing swiss people 's party was the driving force behind the november 29 referendum .
the government said it would respect the people 's decision and would no longer permit construction of minarets .
however , it tried to assure the country 's 400,000-strong muslim community that the ban did not amount to “ a rejection of the muslim community , religion or culture . ” rb / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the official bulgarian reaction so far has been noncommittal . bulgaria is in talks with the united states to host some of the inmates from guantanamo bay , the country 's interior minister said on saturday .
tsvetan tsvetanov confirmed his country was considering a request from the obama administration for an arrangement to host former detainees .
the government in sofia had received a letter addressed to prime minister boyko borisov , tsvetanov said in a national radio interview " we have not taken a decision yet , " he said .
" in any case , bulgaria 's participation would be small and we would not accept people who might pose a threat to our national security . "
the issue was due to be discussed before parliament , he added .
gesture of soldarity bulgarian prime minister borisov said he thinks taking an inmate would be a strong gesture of cooperation between europe and the united states .
" there is european and nato solidarity .
just like we seek support for everything from our euro-atlantic partners , president obama is now seeking this from all of us , " borisov told reporters .
" my personal opinion is that we should accept one person . "
his center-right administration , which replaced its socialist predecessor in july , is conscious of the balkan country 's image that was marred by the previous government 's failure to tame corruption and crime .
ongoing effort to close prison the united states embassy in sofia confirmed to afp late friday that : " us special envoy for guantanamo closure , daniel fried , visited bulgaria from december 2-3 and met with bulgarian officials . "
" while we do not comment on our bilateral discussions with foreign governments , we are encouraged by the continued willingness of many of our close friends and allies to consider resettling detainees and help our effort to close the guantanamo bay detention facility , " it added in a statement .
the us continues to seek out potential hosts for former guantanamo inmates as part of president barack obama 's initiative to shut down the controversial detention camp .
obama had promised to shut down the facility within a year of taking office but , because of diplomatic and political obstacles , there are still more than 200 inmates who need to be relocated .
earlier this month , the french foreign ministry said two detainees at guantanamo were sent to france and to hungary .

the official bulgarian reaction so far has been noncommittal . bulgaria is in talks with the united states to host some of the inmates from guantanamo bay , the country 's interior minister said on saturday .
tsvetan tsvetanov confirmed his country was considering a request from the obama administration for an arrangement to host former detainees .
the government in sofia had received a letter addressed to prime minister boyko borisov , tsvetanov said in a national radio interview " we have not taken a decision yet , " he said .
" in any case , bulgaria 's participation would be small and we would not accept people who might pose a threat to our national security . "
the issue was due to be discussed before parliament , he added .
gesture of soldarity bulgarian prime minister borisov said he thinks taking an inmate would be a strong gesture of cooperation between europe and the united states .
" there is european and nato solidarity .

the us continues to seek out potential hosts for former guantanamo inmates as part of president barack obama 's initiative to shut down the controversial detention camp .
obama had promised to shut down the facility within a year of taking office but , because of diplomatic and political obstacles , there are still more than 200 inmates who need to be relocated .

the shipment was worth 16 million euros and reportedly part of a larger order dispatched by a swedish subsidiary of siemens to an iranian company .
in the other case , the magazine reported that the british navy stopped a chinese ship containing computers near dubai .
the shipment was intended for an iranian company .
the computers , which are used to control nuclear reactors , were thought to have been sent to china by siemens .
siemens would not give specific details about the shipments .
but the company told der spiegel that it did not break any german foreign trade laws .
“ our business activities in iran serve purely civil purposes and are in accord with international legal regulations , ” a siemens spokesperson told the magazine .
not the first controversy with iran the latest allegations come months after criticism that siemens , along with its finnish partner nokia , sold technology to iran that was thought to be capable of monitoring phone calls and e-mails .
this was in the wake of iran 's widespread post-election protests , where the iranian government was accused of censoring public dissent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens was criticized for selling eavesdropping technology to iran during election protests a spokesperson for nokia siemens networks -lrb- nsn -rrb- , ben roome , said the technology could be used to monitor calls , but denied claims it was capable of censoring web content .
" voice call monitoring is required by the courts to listen to phone calls coming from a particular phone number , the telecommunication systems have an ability to do that , " roome said .
he added that the technology provided by nsn allows millions of iranians to communicate every day. mk / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead of creating new concepts of nation building , leaders should read lawrence of arabia , argues a foreign policy expert . john hulsman is the author of the recently released " to begin the world over again : lawrence of arabia from damascus to baghdad . "
he is president of john hulsman enterprises , an international relations consulting firm , and a member of the council on foreign relations .
he is based in germany .
deutsche welle : in your new book you argue that instead of trying to develop new strategies for counterinsurgency and nation building in afghanistan , western leaders should read t. e. lawrence 's " 27 articles " written in 1917 during the so-called arab revolt as a guide for british officers .
what can we learn from lawrence of arabia that would help us today in afghanistan ?
john hulsman : the thing that was missing in barack obama 's speech was of course the most important piece from a lawrence point of view which is what are the locals going to do if you do these other things .
the problem with modern nation building is that it 's always about what 's going on in washington and other capitals , what the strategy should be for outsiders rather than what the strategy should be actually in these places that we are trying to nation build . lawrence realized that the key to success in the arab revolt was n't him , was n't the british , was n't the turks - it was the arabs .
could he make the arabs stakeholders in a settlement whereby he built a nation organically using the pieces there .
and so rather than create a nation where none had existed he worked with tribal leaders building something from the bottom up , seeing them as the key to the story , making them stakeholders in the assessment , realizing how their culture worked .
in other words it was entirely different than the failed efforts in bosnia , somalia , haiti , kosovo , afghanistan and iraq where we 've done this exactly the wrong way with the wrong philosophy .
if you are going to build a people you have to make sure you do n't liberate them from themselves .
probably the most famous advice given by t.e. lawrence in his " 27 articles " postulates " better the arabs do it tolerably than that you do it perfectly . "
has the international community heeded that advice so far in its mission in afghanistan ?
one of the things people say is " is n't it terrible that we 're working with these warlords . "
who do these people think has been running afghanistan for the last 1,000 years ?
not thomas jefferson and not james madison .
i wish that were the case , but it 's just not .
better that they be given control in terms of money - of course we should account for it because there is a lot of corruption in afghanistan - better they be given control over the building projects that they 're doing rather than we tell them what to build .
and of course they wo n't do it as well if we would do it by western standards .
but the key is n't how well they do it , but that they will be made stakeholders in the process so that they see that they are rebuilding their nation , they are building their country , not that we are imposing some sort of diktat from outside .
i think that is actually the key piece of advice from the " 27 articles , " because it encapsulates what 's wrong with what we are doing .
what we are doing should be mainly psychological and political , and then only secondarily military .
in the arab revolt in 1917 , lawrence figured out that if the arabs were on his side he could n't lose and if they were n't on his side that he could n't win . and that 's what 's missing from obama 's plan .
there was precious little mention of local politics and working with localities .
the problem with the afghan constitution that we imposed on the country after installing karzai is that it 's centralized , that we 've made kabul the center of the political decision making when in afghanistan the tribe and localism has been the center of the afghan experience of a 1,000 years . lawrence would understand this in a heartbeat .
and that 's why in a sense what 's happening in afghanistan is so tragic and why i was really desperately impelled to write this book .
it comes out of a practical experience of working in washington on iraq and afghanistan and then i read this guy and i immediately said that 's it , that 's what 's missing . bildunterschrift : isaf commander stanley mcchrystal is trying to work closer with the afghan people lawrence of arabia , as the name and the popular movie about him suggest , was famous for his knowledge of and closeness to the arabs that contributed to his success .
do the current military and civilian leaders in charge of the afghan mission know enough about the country and its people ?
no , i do n't think they do .
i give general mcchrystal real credit , because he is aware that this is an area where they are falling behind .
in iraq , one of the most important things that explained to me why we failed there was when i read at the time that of the 200 senior staffers that viceroy paul bremer brought in under george w. bush to look after iraq , only one had an advanced degree in anything relating to iraq or the middle east .
and lawrence would say you ca n't transform a society you do n't know anything about , that 's just common sense . i laud mcchrystal for realizing that something is missing , but intellectually these guys do n't know anything near what lawrence did .
lawrence had worked before the war in an archeological dig with the arabs in karkemish , he spoke their language , he knew their tribal structure , he knew their feuds , he knew who liked whom and why .
cultural knowledge is far more important than military knowledge if you are going to do anything successful on counterinsurgency and nation building .
of course lawrence of arabia is perhaps most well-known for his military achievements , i.e. the arab revolt , the battle of aqaba and the fall of damascus .
what military lessons can the isaf troops in afghanistan learn from lawrence ?
what they can learn is actually an old german saying and they could read their clausewitz again .
clausewitz got it right that military matters are only an extension of doing things politically . if we clear the taliban somehow through a miracle from afghanistan , which we of course ca n't do because they are locals and not some foreign outside force , but even if we could get rid of all the taliban by some miracle we still would n't have stability in afghanistan because there is n't anything political to build on .
that is the key .
despite his successes , lawrence of arabia 's grand vision of arab self-determination failed in the end when the british and the french decided to divide the middle east between them .
is n't that a stark reminder that in afghanistan , realpolitik ultimately might trump visionary politics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban have steadily gained ground in afghanistan yes it definitely could .
we need to go from bottom up rather than from top down .
the british and french went top down .
they said what matters most on the great power level .
the reason why it is better to start with the micro level and then go to the macro level is really old-fashioned burkean thinking .
if you get the stuff on the ground locally right you can then build something .
if we get the various tribal leaders to buy into our settlement , then you can go to the chinese , the russians , the indians and the pakistanis and say , we can promise you stability , but only if we all do n't intervene and meddle , including the united states .
going bottom up leads to that stability .
without that local component it wo n't work as was seen in the case of lawrence , that is absolutely right .

the problem with the afghan constitution that we imposed on the country after installing karzai is that it 's centralized , that we 've made kabul the center of the political decision making when in afghanistan the tribe and localism has been the center of the afghan experience of a 1,000 years . lawrence would understand this in a heartbeat .
and that 's why in a sense what 's happening in afghanistan is so tragic and why i was really desperately impelled to write this book .
it comes out of a practical experience of working in washington on iraq and afghanistan and then i read this guy and i immediately said that 's it , that 's what 's missing . bildunterschrift : isaf commander stanley mcchrystal is trying to work closer with the afghan people lawrence of arabia , as the name and the popular movie about him suggest , was famous for his knowledge of and closeness to the arabs that contributed to his success .
do the current military and civilian leaders in charge of the afghan mission know enough about the country and its people ?
no , i do n't think they do .
i give general mcchrystal real credit , because he is aware that this is an area where they are falling behind .
in iraq , one of the most important things that explained to me why we failed there was when i read at the time that of the 200 senior staffers that viceroy paul bremer brought in under george w. bush to look after iraq , only one had an advanced degree in anything relating to iraq or the middle east .
and lawrence would say you ca n't transform a society you do n't know anything about , that 's just common sense . i laud mcchrystal for realizing that something is missing , but intellectually these guys do n't know anything near what lawrence did .
lawrence had worked before the war in an archeological dig with the arabs in karkemish , he spoke their language , he knew their tribal structure , he knew their feuds , he knew who liked whom and why .
cultural knowledge is far more important than military knowledge if you are going to do anything successful on counterinsurgency and nation building .
of course lawrence of arabia is perhaps most well-known for his military achievements , i.e. the arab revolt , the battle of aqaba and the fall of damascus .
what military lessons can the isaf troops in afghanistan learn from lawrence ?
what they can learn is actually an old german saying and they could read their clausewitz again .
clausewitz got it right that military matters are only an extension of doing things politically . if we clear the taliban somehow through a miracle from afghanistan , which we of course ca n't do because they are locals and not some foreign outside force , but even if we could get rid of all the taliban by some miracle we still would n't have stability in afghanistan because there is n't anything political to build on .
that is the key .
despite his successes , lawrence of arabia 's grand vision of arab self-determination failed in the end when the british and the french decided to divide the middle east between them .
is n't that a stark reminder that in afghanistan , realpolitik ultimately might trump visionary politics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban have steadily gained ground in afghanistan yes it definitely could .
we need to go from bottom up rather than from top down .
the british and french went top down .
they said what matters most on the great power level .
the reason why it is better to start with the micro level and then go to the macro level is really old-fashioned burkean thinking .
if you get the stuff on the ground locally right you can then build something .
if we get the various tribal leaders to buy into our settlement , then you can go to the chinese , the russians , the indians and the pakistanis and say , we can promise you stability , but only if we all do n't intervene and meddle , including the united states .
going bottom up leads to that stability .
without that local component it wo n't work as was seen in the case of lawrence , that is absolutely right .

instead of creating new concepts of nation building , leaders should read lawrence of arabia , argues a foreign policy expert . john hulsman is the author of the recently released " to begin the world over again : lawrence of arabia from damascus to baghdad . "
he is president of john hulsman enterprises , an international relations consulting firm , and a member of the council on foreign relations .
he is based in germany .
deutsche welle : in your new book you argue that instead of trying to develop new strategies for counterinsurgency and nation building in afghanistan , western leaders should read t. e. lawrence 's " 27 articles " written in 1917 during the so-called arab revolt as a guide for british officers .
what can we learn from lawrence of arabia that would help us today in afghanistan ?
john hulsman : the thing that was missing in barack obama 's speech was of course the most important piece from a lawrence point of view which is what are the locals going to do if you do these other things .
the problem with modern nation building is that it 's always about what 's going on in washington and other capitals , what the strategy should be for outsiders rather than what the strategy should be actually in these places that we are trying to nation build . lawrence realized that the key to success in the arab revolt was n't him , was n't the british , was n't the turks - it was the arabs .
could he make the arabs stakeholders in a settlement whereby he built a nation organically using the pieces there .
and so rather than create a nation where none had existed he worked with tribal leaders building something from the bottom up , seeing them as the key to the story , making them stakeholders in the assessment , realizing how their culture worked .
in other words it was entirely different than the failed efforts in bosnia , somalia , haiti , kosovo , afghanistan and iraq where we 've done this exactly the wrong way with the wrong philosophy .
if you are going to build a people you have to make sure you do n't liberate them from themselves .
probably the most famous advice given by t.e. lawrence in his " 27 articles " postulates " better the arabs do it tolerably than that you do it perfectly . "
has the international community heeded that advice so far in its mission in afghanistan ?
one of the things people say is " is n't it terrible that we 're working with these warlords . "
who do these people think has been running afghanistan for the last 1,000 years ?
not thomas jefferson and not james madison .
i wish that were the case , but it 's just not .
better that they be given control in terms of money - of course we should account for it because there is a lot of corruption in afghanistan - better they be given control over the building projects that they 're doing rather than we tell them what to build .
and of course they wo n't do it as well if we would do it by western standards .
but the key is n't how well they do it , but that they will be made stakeholders in the process so that they see that they are rebuilding their nation , they are building their country , not that we are imposing some sort of diktat from outside .
i think that is actually the key piece of advice from the " 27 articles , " because it encapsulates what 's wrong with what we are doing .
what we are doing should be mainly psychological and political , and then only secondarily military .
in the arab revolt in 1917 , lawrence figured out that if the arabs were on his side he could n't lose and if they were n't on his side that he could n't win . and that 's what 's missing from obama 's plan .

if you are going to build a people you have to make sure you do n't liberate them from themselves .
probably the most famous advice given by t.e. lawrence in his " 27 articles " postulates " better the arabs do it tolerably than that you do it perfectly . "
has the international community heeded that advice so far in its mission in afghanistan ?
one of the things people say is " is n't it terrible that we 're working with these warlords . "
who do these people think has been running afghanistan for the last 1,000 years ?
not thomas jefferson and not james madison .
i wish that were the case , but it 's just not .
better that they be given control in terms of money - of course we should account for it because there is a lot of corruption in afghanistan - better they be given control over the building projects that they 're doing rather than we tell them what to build .
and of course they wo n't do it as well if we would do it by western standards .
but the key is n't how well they do it , but that they will be made stakeholders in the process so that they see that they are rebuilding their nation , they are building their country , not that we are imposing some sort of diktat from outside .
i think that is actually the key piece of advice from the " 27 articles , " because it encapsulates what 's wrong with what we are doing .
what we are doing should be mainly psychological and political , and then only secondarily military .
in the arab revolt in 1917 , lawrence figured out that if the arabs were on his side he could n't lose and if they were n't on his side that he could n't win . and that 's what 's missing from obama 's plan .
there was precious little mention of local politics and working with localities .
the problem with the afghan constitution that we imposed on the country after installing karzai is that it 's centralized , that we 've made kabul the center of the political decision making when in afghanistan the tribe and localism has been the center of the afghan experience of a 1,000 years . lawrence would understand this in a heartbeat .
and that 's why in a sense what 's happening in afghanistan is so tragic and why i was really desperately impelled to write this book .
it comes out of a practical experience of working in washington on iraq and afghanistan and then i read this guy and i immediately said that 's it , that 's what 's missing . bildunterschrift : isaf commander stanley mcchrystal is trying to work closer with the afghan people lawrence of arabia , as the name and the popular movie about him suggest , was famous for his knowledge of and closeness to the arabs that contributed to his success .
do the current military and civilian leaders in charge of the afghan mission know enough about the country and its people ?
no , i do n't think they do .
i give general mcchrystal real credit , because he is aware that this is an area where they are falling behind .
in iraq , one of the most important things that explained to me why we failed there was when i read at the time that of the 200 senior staffers that viceroy paul bremer brought in under george w. bush to look after iraq , only one had an advanced degree in anything relating to iraq or the middle east .
and lawrence would say you ca n't transform a society you do n't know anything about , that 's just common sense . i laud mcchrystal for realizing that something is missing , but intellectually these guys do n't know anything near what lawrence did .
lawrence had worked before the war in an archeological dig with the arabs in karkemish , he spoke their language , he knew their tribal structure , he knew their feuds , he knew who liked whom and why .
cultural knowledge is far more important than military knowledge if you are going to do anything successful on counterinsurgency and nation building .
of course lawrence of arabia is perhaps most well-known for his military achievements , i.e. the arab revolt , the battle of aqaba and the fall of damascus .
what military lessons can the isaf troops in afghanistan learn from lawrence ?
what they can learn is actually an old german saying and they could read their clausewitz again .
clausewitz got it right that military matters are only an extension of doing things politically . if we clear the taliban somehow through a miracle from afghanistan , which we of course ca n't do because they are locals and not some foreign outside force , but even if we could get rid of all the taliban by some miracle we still would n't have stability in afghanistan because there is n't anything political to build on .
that is the key .
despite his successes , lawrence of arabia 's grand vision of arab self-determination failed in the end when the british and the french decided to divide the middle east between them .
is n't that a stark reminder that in afghanistan , realpolitik ultimately might trump visionary politics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban have steadily gained ground in afghanistan yes it definitely could .
we need to go from bottom up rather than from top down .
the british and french went top down .
they said what matters most on the great power level .
the reason why it is better to start with the micro level and then go to the macro level is really old-fashioned burkean thinking .
if you get the stuff on the ground locally right you can then build something .
if we get the various tribal leaders to buy into our settlement , then you can go to the chinese , the russians , the indians and the pakistanis and say , we can promise you stability , but only if we all do n't intervene and meddle , including the united states .
going bottom up leads to that stability .
without that local component it wo n't work as was seen in the case of lawrence , that is absolutely right .

" i would still have thought it right to remove him .
obviously you would have had to use and deploy different arguments , about the nature of the threat , " blair told the broadcaster in comments released saturday .
the interview for the show " fern britton meets ... " airs on sunday .
blair said hussein and his government were " a threat to the region , " and that his decision was also influenced by hussein 's willingness to use chemical weapons on " his own people " and by the stalling tactics he used against weapons inspectors .
comments spark criticism but blair 's comments have attracted strong criticism . hans blix , the head of the un team that conducted weapons inspections in iraq before the war , said he thought blair used wmd as a " convenient justification " for war .
" saddam 's removal was a gain but it 's the only gain that i can see from the war , " blix said .
the former un weapons inspector said he believed blair 's statement had a " strong impression of a lack of sincerity . "

the single point from the draw left the door open for other teams in the bundesliga to close in on leverkusen 's top spot with one game to go before the winter break .
if being in first place at the end of the first half is irrelevant for heynckes , then there are two other teams in the league who would gladly celebrate the holidays from the top of the standings in leverkusen 's stead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes is unconcerned with being crowned the first half champs those teams would be schalke and bayern munich , who both won their matches in the bundesliga to narrow the gap to heynckes ' team .
leverkusen leads the league with 32 points , just one ahead of second place schalke and two in front of munich .
battle for second goes to schalke despite playing with the home-field advantage , werder bremen was forced to concede second place and any hopes of leading the league before the break after losing 2-0 in schalke .
heading into the match , the two were tied on points , with schalke trailing on goal differential .
kevin kuranyi put the first goal in the net for schalke just after the second half got underway , and jan moravek , coming off the bench , took a pass from kuranyi and sealed the victory for schalke with the final goal in the 72nd minute .
the loss ended bremen 's undefeated streak of 23 matches and left them in fourth place , four points off the top and two shy of third place bayern .
bayern continues to win fresh off their convincing 4-0 thrashing of juventus that advanced them to the knock-out stage of the champions league , munich won again in the bundesliga with another feast of goals .

bochum 's mergim marvic put the fifth goal on the board for bayern , misdirecting a clearance attempt into his own goal .
christian fuchs prevented a bayern shutout with a free kick in the 76th minute .
" it 's been a great week , the best since i have been in munich , " said a pleased munich coach louis van gaal .
" we are only two points off the top spot and that is very satisfying . "
bad luck for hanover it may have been a memorable day for louis van gaal , but saturday 's game between borussia moenchengladbach and hanover 96 is one that hanover defender karim haggui would probably rather forget after putting two goals into his own net .
the first came after hanover florian fromlowitz slipped while attempting to clear the ball and kicked it into haggui 's leg , which deflected the ball back into the net .
the second was a back pass that missed fromlowitz and landed in the goal in stoppage time .
huggui could n't help but grin over his terrible luck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanover scored three own goals incredibly , haggui was n't the only one to score at the wrong end for hanover .

moenchengladbach did manage to score two goals of their own , with rob friend scoring in the 22nd minute and michael bradley sending a free kick to the back of the net in the 68th .
hanover put three goals in the correct goal as well , including two from didier ya konan , for a final score of 5-3 for moenchengladbach .

instead of creating new concepts of nation building , leaders should read lawrence of arabia , argues a foreign policy expert . john hulsman is the author of the recently released " to begin the world over again : lawrence of arabia from damascus to baghdad . "
he is president of john hulsman enterprises , an international relations consulting firm , and a member of the council on foreign relations .
he is based in germany .
deutsche welle : in your new book you argue that instead of trying to develop new strategies for counterinsurgency and nation building in afghanistan , western leaders should read t. e. lawrence 's " 27 articles " written in 1917 during the so-called arab revolt as a guide for british officers .
what can we learn from lawrence of arabia that would help us today in afghanistan ?
john hulsman : the thing that was missing in barack obama 's speech was of course the most important piece from a lawrence point of view which is what are the locals going to do if you do these other things .
the problem with modern nation building is that it 's always about what 's going on in washington and other capitals , what the strategy should be for outsiders rather than what the strategy should be actually in these places that we are trying to nation build . lawrence realized that the key to success in the arab revolt was n't him , was n't the british , was n't the turks - it was the arabs .
could he make the arabs stakeholders in a settlement whereby he built a nation organically using the pieces there .
and so rather than create a nation where none had existed he worked with tribal leaders building something from the bottom up , seeing them as the key to the story , making them stakeholders in the assessment , realizing how their culture worked .
in other words it was entirely different than the failed efforts in bosnia , somalia , haiti , kosovo , afghanistan and iraq where we 've done this exactly the wrong way with the wrong philosophy .
if you are going to build a people you have to make sure you do n't liberate them from themselves .
probably the most famous advice given by t.e. lawrence in his " 27 articles " postulates " better the arabs do it tolerably than that you do it perfectly . "
has the international community heeded that advice so far in its mission in afghanistan ?
one of the things people say is " is n't it terrible that we 're working with these warlords . "
who do these people think has been running afghanistan for the last 1,000 years ?
not thomas jefferson and not james madison .
i wish that were the case , but it 's just not .
better that they be given control in terms of money - of course we should account for it because there is a lot of corruption in afghanistan - better they be given control over the building projects that they 're doing rather than we tell them what to build .
and of course they wo n't do it as well if we would do it by western standards .
but the key is n't how well they do it , but that they will be made stakeholders in the process so that they see that they are rebuilding their nation , they are building their country , not that we are imposing some sort of diktat from outside .
i think that is actually the key piece of advice from the " 27 articles , " because it encapsulates what 's wrong with what we are doing .
what we are doing should be mainly psychological and political , and then only secondarily military .
in the arab revolt in 1917 , lawrence figured out that if the arabs were on his side he could n't lose and if they were n't on his side that he could n't win . and that 's what 's missing from obama 's plan .
there was precious little mention of local politics and working with localities .
the problem with the afghan constitution that we imposed on the country after installing karzai is that it 's centralized , that we 've made kabul the center of the political decision making when in afghanistan the tribe and localism has been the center of the afghan experience of a 1,000 years . lawrence would understand this in a heartbeat .
and that 's why in a sense what 's happening in afghanistan is so tragic and why i was really desperately impelled to write this book .
it comes out of a practical experience of working in washington on iraq and afghanistan and then i read this guy and i immediately said that 's it , that 's what 's missing . bildunterschrift : isaf commander stanley mcchrystal is trying to work closer with the afghan people lawrence of arabia , as the name and the popular movie about him suggest , was famous for his knowledge of and closeness to the arabs that contributed to his success .
do the current military and civilian leaders in charge of the afghan mission know enough about the country and its people ?
no , i do n't think they do .
i give general mcchrystal real credit , because he is aware that this is an area where they are falling behind .
in iraq , one of the most important things that explained to me why we failed there was when i read at the time that of the 200 senior staffers that viceroy paul bremer brought in under george w. bush to look after iraq , only one had an advanced degree in anything relating to iraq or the middle east .
and lawrence would say you ca n't transform a society you do n't know anything about , that 's just common sense . i laud mcchrystal for realizing that something is missing , but intellectually these guys do n't know anything near what lawrence did .
lawrence had worked before the war in an archeological dig with the arabs in karkemish , he spoke their language , he knew their tribal structure , he knew their feuds , he knew who liked whom and why .
cultural knowledge is far more important than military knowledge if you are going to do anything successful on counterinsurgency and nation building .
of course lawrence of arabia is perhaps most well-known for his military achievements , i.e. the arab revolt , the battle of aqaba and the fall of damascus .
what military lessons can the isaf troops in afghanistan learn from lawrence ?
what they can learn is actually an old german saying and they could read their clausewitz again .
clausewitz got it right that military matters are only an extension of doing things politically . if we clear the taliban somehow through a miracle from afghanistan , which we of course ca n't do because they are locals and not some foreign outside force , but even if we could get rid of all the taliban by some miracle we still would n't have stability in afghanistan because there is n't anything political to build on .
that is the key .
despite his successes , lawrence of arabia 's grand vision of arab self-determination failed in the end when the british and the french decided to divide the middle east between them .
is n't that a stark reminder that in afghanistan , realpolitik ultimately might trump visionary politics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban have steadily gained ground in afghanistan yes it definitely could .
we need to go from bottom up rather than from top down .
the british and french went top down .
they said what matters most on the great power level .
the reason why it is better to start with the micro level and then go to the macro level is really old-fashioned burkean thinking .
if you get the stuff on the ground locally right you can then build something .
if we get the various tribal leaders to buy into our settlement , then you can go to the chinese , the russians , the indians and the pakistanis and say , we can promise you stability , but only if we all do n't intervene and meddle , including the united states .
going bottom up leads to that stability .
without that local component it wo n't work as was seen in the case of lawrence , that is absolutely right .

and lawrence would say you ca n't transform a society you do n't know anything about , that 's just common sense . i laud mcchrystal for realizing that something is missing , but intellectually these guys do n't know anything near what lawrence did .
lawrence had worked before the war in an archeological dig with the arabs in karkemish , he spoke their language , he knew their tribal structure , he knew their feuds , he knew who liked whom and why .
cultural knowledge is far more important than military knowledge if you are going to do anything successful on counterinsurgency and nation building .
of course lawrence of arabia is perhaps most well-known for his military achievements , i.e. the arab revolt , the battle of aqaba and the fall of damascus .
what military lessons can the isaf troops in afghanistan learn from lawrence ?
what they can learn is actually an old german saying and they could read their clausewitz again .
clausewitz got it right that military matters are only an extension of doing things politically . if we clear the taliban somehow through a miracle from afghanistan , which we of course ca n't do because they are locals and not some foreign outside force , but even if we could get rid of all the taliban by some miracle we still would n't have stability in afghanistan because there is n't anything political to build on .
that is the key .
despite his successes , lawrence of arabia 's grand vision of arab self-determination failed in the end when the british and the french decided to divide the middle east between them .
is n't that a stark reminder that in afghanistan , realpolitik ultimately might trump visionary politics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban have steadily gained ground in afghanistan yes it definitely could .
we need to go from bottom up rather than from top down .
the british and french went top down .
they said what matters most on the great power level .
the reason why it is better to start with the micro level and then go to the macro level is really old-fashioned burkean thinking .
if you get the stuff on the ground locally right you can then build something .
if we get the various tribal leaders to buy into our settlement , then you can go to the chinese , the russians , the indians and the pakistanis and say , we can promise you stability , but only if we all do n't intervene and meddle , including the united states .
going bottom up leads to that stability .
without that local component it wo n't work as was seen in the case of lawrence , that is absolutely right .

instead of creating new concepts of nation building , leaders should read lawrence of arabia , argues a foreign policy expert . john hulsman is the author of the recently released " to begin the world over again : lawrence of arabia from damascus to baghdad . "
he is president of john hulsman enterprises , an international relations consulting firm , and a member of the council on foreign relations .
he is based in germany .
deutsche welle : in your new book you argue that instead of trying to develop new strategies for counterinsurgency and nation building in afghanistan , western leaders should read t. e. lawrence 's " 27 articles " written in 1917 during the so-called arab revolt as a guide for british officers .
what can we learn from lawrence of arabia that would help us today in afghanistan ?
john hulsman : the thing that was missing in barack obama 's speech was of course the most important piece from a lawrence point of view which is what are the locals going to do if you do these other things .
the problem with modern nation building is that it 's always about what 's going on in washington and other capitals , what the strategy should be for outsiders rather than what the strategy should be actually in these places that we are trying to nation build . lawrence realized that the key to success in the arab revolt was n't him , was n't the british , was n't the turks - it was the arabs .
could he make the arabs stakeholders in a settlement whereby he built a nation organically using the pieces there .
and so rather than create a nation where none had existed he worked with tribal leaders building something from the bottom up , seeing them as the key to the story , making them stakeholders in the assessment , realizing how their culture worked .
in other words it was entirely different than the failed efforts in bosnia , somalia , haiti , kosovo , afghanistan and iraq where we 've done this exactly the wrong way with the wrong philosophy .
if you are going to build a people you have to make sure you do n't liberate them from themselves .
probably the most famous advice given by t.e. lawrence in his " 27 articles " postulates " better the arabs do it tolerably than that you do it perfectly . "
has the international community heeded that advice so far in its mission in afghanistan ?
one of the things people say is " is n't it terrible that we 're working with these warlords . "
who do these people think has been running afghanistan for the last 1,000 years ?
not thomas jefferson and not james madison .
i wish that were the case , but it 's just not .
better that they be given control in terms of money - of course we should account for it because there is a lot of corruption in afghanistan - better they be given control over the building projects that they 're doing rather than we tell them what to build .
and of course they wo n't do it as well if we would do it by western standards .
but the key is n't how well they do it , but that they will be made stakeholders in the process so that they see that they are rebuilding their nation , they are building their country , not that we are imposing some sort of diktat from outside .
i think that is actually the key piece of advice from the " 27 articles , " because it encapsulates what 's wrong with what we are doing .
what we are doing should be mainly psychological and political , and then only secondarily military .
in the arab revolt in 1917 , lawrence figured out that if the arabs were on his side he could n't lose and if they were n't on his side that he could n't win . and that 's what 's missing from obama 's plan .
there was precious little mention of local politics and working with localities .
the problem with the afghan constitution that we imposed on the country after installing karzai is that it 's centralized , that we 've made kabul the center of the political decision making when in afghanistan the tribe and localism has been the center of the afghan experience of a 1,000 years . lawrence would understand this in a heartbeat .
and that 's why in a sense what 's happening in afghanistan is so tragic and why i was really desperately impelled to write this book .
it comes out of a practical experience of working in washington on iraq and afghanistan and then i read this guy and i immediately said that 's it , that 's what 's missing . bildunterschrift : isaf commander stanley mcchrystal is trying to work closer with the afghan people lawrence of arabia , as the name and the popular movie about him suggest , was famous for his knowledge of and closeness to the arabs that contributed to his success .
do the current military and civilian leaders in charge of the afghan mission know enough about the country and its people ?
no , i do n't think they do .
i give general mcchrystal real credit , because he is aware that this is an area where they are falling behind .
in iraq , one of the most important things that explained to me why we failed there was when i read at the time that of the 200 senior staffers that viceroy paul bremer brought in under george w. bush to look after iraq , only one had an advanced degree in anything relating to iraq or the middle east .

the problem with modern nation building is that it 's always about what 's going on in washington and other capitals , what the strategy should be for outsiders rather than what the strategy should be actually in these places that we are trying to nation build . lawrence realized that the key to success in the arab revolt was n't him , was n't the british , was n't the turks - it was the arabs .
could he make the arabs stakeholders in a settlement whereby he built a nation organically using the pieces there .
and so rather than create a nation where none had existed he worked with tribal leaders building something from the bottom up , seeing them as the key to the story , making them stakeholders in the assessment , realizing how their culture worked .
in other words it was entirely different than the failed efforts in bosnia , somalia , haiti , kosovo , afghanistan and iraq where we 've done this exactly the wrong way with the wrong philosophy .
if you are going to build a people you have to make sure you do n't liberate them from themselves .
probably the most famous advice given by t.e. lawrence in his " 27 articles " postulates " better the arabs do it tolerably than that you do it perfectly . "
has the international community heeded that advice so far in its mission in afghanistan ?
one of the things people say is " is n't it terrible that we 're working with these warlords . "
who do these people think has been running afghanistan for the last 1,000 years ?
not thomas jefferson and not james madison .
i wish that were the case , but it 's just not .
better that they be given control in terms of money - of course we should account for it because there is a lot of corruption in afghanistan - better they be given control over the building projects that they 're doing rather than we tell them what to build .
and of course they wo n't do it as well if we would do it by western standards .
but the key is n't how well they do it , but that they will be made stakeholders in the process so that they see that they are rebuilding their nation , they are building their country , not that we are imposing some sort of diktat from outside .
i think that is actually the key piece of advice from the " 27 articles , " because it encapsulates what 's wrong with what we are doing .
what we are doing should be mainly psychological and political , and then only secondarily military .
in the arab revolt in 1917 , lawrence figured out that if the arabs were on his side he could n't lose and if they were n't on his side that he could n't win . and that 's what 's missing from obama 's plan .
there was precious little mention of local politics and working with localities .
the problem with the afghan constitution that we imposed on the country after installing karzai is that it 's centralized , that we 've made kabul the center of the political decision making when in afghanistan the tribe and localism has been the center of the afghan experience of a 1,000 years . lawrence would understand this in a heartbeat .
and that 's why in a sense what 's happening in afghanistan is so tragic and why i was really desperately impelled to write this book .
it comes out of a practical experience of working in washington on iraq and afghanistan and then i read this guy and i immediately said that 's it , that 's what 's missing . bildunterschrift : isaf commander stanley mcchrystal is trying to work closer with the afghan people lawrence of arabia , as the name and the popular movie about him suggest , was famous for his knowledge of and closeness to the arabs that contributed to his success .
do the current military and civilian leaders in charge of the afghan mission know enough about the country and its people ?
no , i do n't think they do .
i give general mcchrystal real credit , because he is aware that this is an area where they are falling behind .
in iraq , one of the most important things that explained to me why we failed there was when i read at the time that of the 200 senior staffers that viceroy paul bremer brought in under george w. bush to look after iraq , only one had an advanced degree in anything relating to iraq or the middle east .
and lawrence would say you ca n't transform a society you do n't know anything about , that 's just common sense . i laud mcchrystal for realizing that something is missing , but intellectually these guys do n't know anything near what lawrence did .
lawrence had worked before the war in an archeological dig with the arabs in karkemish , he spoke their language , he knew their tribal structure , he knew their feuds , he knew who liked whom and why .
cultural knowledge is far more important than military knowledge if you are going to do anything successful on counterinsurgency and nation building .
of course lawrence of arabia is perhaps most well-known for his military achievements , i.e. the arab revolt , the battle of aqaba and the fall of damascus .
what military lessons can the isaf troops in afghanistan learn from lawrence ?
what they can learn is actually an old german saying and they could read their clausewitz again .
clausewitz got it right that military matters are only an extension of doing things politically . if we clear the taliban somehow through a miracle from afghanistan , which we of course ca n't do because they are locals and not some foreign outside force , but even if we could get rid of all the taliban by some miracle we still would n't have stability in afghanistan because there is n't anything political to build on .
that is the key .
despite his successes , lawrence of arabia 's grand vision of arab self-determination failed in the end when the british and the french decided to divide the middle east between them .
is n't that a stark reminder that in afghanistan , realpolitik ultimately might trump visionary politics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban have steadily gained ground in afghanistan yes it definitely could .
we need to go from bottom up rather than from top down .
the british and french went top down .
they said what matters most on the great power level .
the reason why it is better to start with the micro level and then go to the macro level is really old-fashioned burkean thinking .
if you get the stuff on the ground locally right you can then build something .
if we get the various tribal leaders to buy into our settlement , then you can go to the chinese , the russians , the indians and the pakistanis and say , we can promise you stability , but only if we all do n't intervene and meddle , including the united states .
going bottom up leads to that stability .
without that local component it wo n't work as was seen in the case of lawrence , that is absolutely right .

instead of creating new concepts of nation building , leaders should read lawrence of arabia , argues a foreign policy expert . john hulsman is the author of the recently released " to begin the world over again : lawrence of arabia from damascus to baghdad . "

instead of creating new concepts of nation building , leaders should read lawrence of arabia , argues a foreign policy expert . john hulsman is the author of the recently released " to begin the world over again : lawrence of arabia from damascus to baghdad . "
he is president of john hulsman enterprises , an international relations consulting firm , and a member of the council on foreign relations .
he is based in germany .
deutsche welle : in your new book you argue that instead of trying to develop new strategies for counterinsurgency and nation building in afghanistan , western leaders should read t. e. lawrence 's " 27 articles " written in 1917 during the so-called arab revolt as a guide for british officers .
what can we learn from lawrence of arabia that would help us today in afghanistan ?
john hulsman : the thing that was missing in barack obama 's speech was of course the most important piece from a lawrence point of view which is what are the locals going to do if you do these other things .
the problem with modern nation building is that it 's always about what 's going on in washington and other capitals , what the strategy should be for outsiders rather than what the strategy should be actually in these places that we are trying to nation build . lawrence realized that the key to success in the arab revolt was n't him , was n't the british , was n't the turks - it was the arabs .
could he make the arabs stakeholders in a settlement whereby he built a nation organically using the pieces there .
and so rather than create a nation where none had existed he worked with tribal leaders building something from the bottom up , seeing them as the key to the story , making them stakeholders in the assessment , realizing how their culture worked .
in other words it was entirely different than the failed efforts in bosnia , somalia , haiti , kosovo , afghanistan and iraq where we 've done this exactly the wrong way with the wrong philosophy .
if you are going to build a people you have to make sure you do n't liberate them from themselves .
probably the most famous advice given by t.e. lawrence in his " 27 articles " postulates " better the arabs do it tolerably than that you do it perfectly . "
has the international community heeded that advice so far in its mission in afghanistan ?
one of the things people say is " is n't it terrible that we 're working with these warlords . "
who do these people think has been running afghanistan for the last 1,000 years ?
not thomas jefferson and not james madison .
i wish that were the case , but it 's just not .
better that they be given control in terms of money - of course we should account for it because there is a lot of corruption in afghanistan - better they be given control over the building projects that they 're doing rather than we tell them what to build .
and of course they wo n't do it as well if we would do it by western standards .
but the key is n't how well they do it , but that they will be made stakeholders in the process so that they see that they are rebuilding their nation , they are building their country , not that we are imposing some sort of diktat from outside .
i think that is actually the key piece of advice from the " 27 articles , " because it encapsulates what 's wrong with what we are doing .
what we are doing should be mainly psychological and political , and then only secondarily military .
in the arab revolt in 1917 , lawrence figured out that if the arabs were on his side he could n't lose and if they were n't on his side that he could n't win . and that 's what 's missing from obama 's plan .
there was precious little mention of local politics and working with localities .
the problem with the afghan constitution that we imposed on the country after installing karzai is that it 's centralized , that we 've made kabul the center of the political decision making when in afghanistan the tribe and localism has been the center of the afghan experience of a 1,000 years . lawrence would understand this in a heartbeat .
and that 's why in a sense what 's happening in afghanistan is so tragic and why i was really desperately impelled to write this book .
it comes out of a practical experience of working in washington on iraq and afghanistan and then i read this guy and i immediately said that 's it , that 's what 's missing . bildunterschrift : isaf commander stanley mcchrystal is trying to work closer with the afghan people lawrence of arabia , as the name and the popular movie about him suggest , was famous for his knowledge of and closeness to the arabs that contributed to his success .
do the current military and civilian leaders in charge of the afghan mission know enough about the country and its people ?
no , i do n't think they do .
i give general mcchrystal real credit , because he is aware that this is an area where they are falling behind .
in iraq , one of the most important things that explained to me why we failed there was when i read at the time that of the 200 senior staffers that viceroy paul bremer brought in under george w. bush to look after iraq , only one had an advanced degree in anything relating to iraq or the middle east .
and lawrence would say you ca n't transform a society you do n't know anything about , that 's just common sense . i laud mcchrystal for realizing that something is missing , but intellectually these guys do n't know anything near what lawrence did .
lawrence had worked before the war in an archeological dig with the arabs in karkemish , he spoke their language , he knew their tribal structure , he knew their feuds , he knew who liked whom and why .
cultural knowledge is far more important than military knowledge if you are going to do anything successful on counterinsurgency and nation building .
of course lawrence of arabia is perhaps most well-known for his military achievements , i.e. the arab revolt , the battle of aqaba and the fall of damascus .
what military lessons can the isaf troops in afghanistan learn from lawrence ?
what they can learn is actually an old german saying and they could read their clausewitz again .
clausewitz got it right that military matters are only an extension of doing things politically . if we clear the taliban somehow through a miracle from afghanistan , which we of course ca n't do because they are locals and not some foreign outside force , but even if we could get rid of all the taliban by some miracle we still would n't have stability in afghanistan because there is n't anything political to build on .
that is the key .
despite his successes , lawrence of arabia 's grand vision of arab self-determination failed in the end when the british and the french decided to divide the middle east between them .
is n't that a stark reminder that in afghanistan , realpolitik ultimately might trump visionary politics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban have steadily gained ground in afghanistan yes it definitely could .
we need to go from bottom up rather than from top down .
the british and french went top down .
they said what matters most on the great power level .
the reason why it is better to start with the micro level and then go to the macro level is really old-fashioned burkean thinking .
if you get the stuff on the ground locally right you can then build something .
if we get the various tribal leaders to buy into our settlement , then you can go to the chinese , the russians , the indians and the pakistanis and say , we can promise you stability , but only if we all do n't intervene and meddle , including the united states .
going bottom up leads to that stability .
without that local component it wo n't work as was seen in the case of lawrence , that is absolutely right .

thousands took to the streets on saturday to urge leaders at un talks to agree on a deal to fight global warming . danish police say they have released nearly all of the 968 people detained during a climate rally which drew an estimated 40,000 people in the danish capital on saturday . law enforcement authorities said only 13 demonstrators were still in custody on sunday and of those , three are set to be arraigned on preliminary charges of fighting with the police . on saturday , the heart of the danish capital became a sea of blue as environmentalists and anti-capitalist demonstrators gathered in front of parliament at the start of a six-kilometer -lrb- four-mile -rrb- march that took them to the venue of the ongoing united nations climate summit . the protesters ' aim was to pressure united nations negotiators to take concrete action on climate change .
an estimated 40,000 people attended the march which was jointly organized by over 500 groups from 67 countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were scuffles in copenhagen as police detained hundreds for throwing bottles and smashing windows the procession wound its way from the folketing , the danish parliament , to the conference site , the massive bella center on the outskirts of the city center . demonstrators wore sky blue raincoats or carried blue umbrellas following a call by the environmental group , friends of the earth . activists slam rich nations nigerian nnimmo bassey , chairman of friends of the earth international , delivered a fiery speech to the crowd . " we can not allow carbon traders to damage the world .
there is no such thing as clean coal or clean crude .
leave the oil in the soil , leave the coal in the hole , " he said .
" to those who want to pollute at home and plant a tree somewhere we say no , " he added .
the demonstrations come as delegates to the un climate summit currently under way in copenhagen wrangle over a draft blueprint for a global pact .
at the un conference itself , developing nations on friday rejected as " insignificant " an eu pledge of 7.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- to help them tackle global warming .
the accord , which would see the money paid over three years , came a week before 110 heads of state and government convene in copenhagen for the finale of the 12-day conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel was criticized by greenpeace for not doing enough the head of greenpeace , kumi naidoo , strongly criticized german chancellor angela merkel for doing too little to help poorer nations cope with the effects of climate change .
" angela merkel can steer the rudder in copenhagen , " naidoo told the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday .
" but her behavior in the current debate is more than disappointing . " in an interview to be published in the sunday edition of the tabloid daily bild , merkel chided the developing countries for expecting richer ones to shoulder more of the burden . " we will not allow germany and the other european industrial states to lead the way on climate change , while others do nothing and then poach jobs from us , using the argument of lower costs for environmental protection , " merkel said . tight security the danish capital had resembled a military zone as authorities prepared for the arrival of activists from all over the world .
helicopters buzzed in the skies while armored police vans and canine squads patrolled the streets , amid fears that saturday 's march could be joined by violent far-left groups .
police also beefed up security at denmark 's land and sea borders to prevent troublemakers from entering the country .
shopkeepers and businesses were warned of a possible outbreak of violence .
those warnings unfortunately came to fruition to a small degree , as police arrested nearly a thousand people who had been throwing rocks and fireworks at police and smashing storefront windows .
on friday , authorities had rounded up 75 anti-capitalist demonstrators , 13 from germany , who were suspected of trying to set up an unauthorized blockade of companies they thought were emitting greenhouse gases .
protests worldwide protests and marches supporting a new climate covenant took place in more than 100 other countries as well , including greece , spain , and germany .
hours before the demonstration was due to kick off in copenhagen , protesters were out in force around asia , waving banners and chanting slogans urging action from the climate conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists march in sydney , australia as part of worldwide climate demonstrations in australia , organizers said around 50,000 people had taken to the streets nationwide , wearing sky-blue shoelaces in a call for a strong and binding agreement at the un talks .
" we want -lrb- world leaders -rrb- to bring home a treaty , we want them to stand by the pacific and our neighbors there .
and we want them to deliver and ensure a safe climate future for us all , " said james dannenberg , one of the organizers .
thousands of activists gathered in front of the parliament house in canberra , while 10,000-strong crowds marched through sydney , melbourne and other major cities .
protesters in hong kong – some dressed as pandas – and the philippines also took to the streets , while in indonesia , demonstrators rallied in front of the us embassy in the capital jakarta , calling for help for developing nations in reducing greenhouse gases. rb / svs / afp / reuters / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an estimated 40,000 people attended the march which was jointly organized by over 500 groups from 67 countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were scuffles in copenhagen as police detained hundreds for throwing bottles and smashing windows the procession wound its way from the folketing , the danish parliament , to the conference site , the massive bella center on the outskirts of the city center . demonstrators wore sky blue raincoats or carried blue umbrellas following a call by the environmental group , friends of the earth . activists slam rich nations nigerian nnimmo bassey , chairman of friends of the earth international , delivered a fiery speech to the crowd .

there is no such thing as clean coal or clean crude .
leave the oil in the soil , leave the coal in the hole , " he said .
" to those who want to pollute at home and plant a tree somewhere we say no , " he added .
the demonstrations come as delegates to the un climate summit currently under way in copenhagen wrangle over a draft blueprint for a global pact .
at the un conference itself , developing nations on friday rejected as " insignificant " an eu pledge of 7.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- to help them tackle global warming .

" angela merkel can steer the rudder in copenhagen , " naidoo told the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday .
" but her behavior in the current debate is more than disappointing . " in an interview to be published in the sunday edition of the tabloid daily bild , merkel chided the developing countries for expecting richer ones to shoulder more of the burden . " we will not allow germany and the other european industrial states to lead the way on climate change , while others do nothing and then poach jobs from us , using the argument of lower costs for environmental protection , " merkel said . tight security the danish capital had resembled a military zone as authorities prepared for the arrival of activists from all over the world .
helicopters buzzed in the skies while armored police vans and canine squads patrolled the streets , amid fears that saturday 's march could be joined by violent far-left groups .
police also beefed up security at denmark 's land and sea borders to prevent troublemakers from entering the country .
shopkeepers and businesses were warned of a possible outbreak of violence .
those warnings unfortunately came to fruition to a small degree , as police arrested nearly a thousand people who had been throwing rocks and fireworks at police and smashing storefront windows .
on friday , authorities had rounded up 75 anti-capitalist demonstrators , 13 from germany , who were suspected of trying to set up an unauthorized blockade of companies they thought were emitting greenhouse gases .
protests worldwide protests and marches supporting a new climate covenant took place in more than 100 other countries as well , including greece , spain , and germany .
hours before the demonstration was due to kick off in copenhagen , protesters were out in force around asia , waving banners and chanting slogans urging action from the climate conference .

" we want -lrb- world leaders -rrb- to bring home a treaty , we want them to stand by the pacific and our neighbors there .
and we want them to deliver and ensure a safe climate future for us all , " said james dannenberg , one of the organizers .
thousands of activists gathered in front of the parliament house in canberra , while 10,000-strong crowds marched through sydney , melbourne and other major cities .
protesters in hong kong – some dressed as pandas – and the philippines also took to the streets , while in indonesia , demonstrators rallied in front of the us embassy in the capital jakarta , calling for help for developing nations in reducing greenhouse gases. rb / svs / afp / reuters / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i would still have thought it right to remove him .
obviously you would have had to use and deploy different arguments , about the nature of the threat , " blair told the broadcaster in comments released saturday .
the interview for the show " fern britton meets ... " airs on sunday .
blair said hussein and his government were " a threat to the region , " and that his decision was also influenced by hussein 's willingness to use chemical weapons on " his own people " and by the stalling tactics he used against weapons inspectors .
comments spark criticism but blair 's comments have attracted strong criticism . hans blix , the head of the un team that conducted weapons inspections in iraq before the war , said he thought blair used wmd as a " convenient justification " for war .
" saddam 's removal was a gain but it 's the only gain that i can see from the war , " blix said .
the former un weapons inspector said he believed blair 's statement had a " strong impression of a lack of sincerity . "
the peace activism group stop the war coalition called blair 's remarks " an admission of war crimes ...
it is an illegal act of aggression under international law to attack another country for the purposes of regime change . "
according to the uk 's defense ministry , 179 british soldiers have died in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair , left , was a major supporter of then-president george w. bush 's war plan " legal but questionable " blair 's statements come ahead of his expected testimony before a public inquiry about britain 's role in the iraq war between 2001 and 2009 .
the " chilcot inquiry , " named after a longtime civil servant who is overseeing it , began in november , shortly after almost all of the country 's troops were withdrawn from iraq .
blair is expected to appear as a witness in january .
britain 's former un ambassador , jeremy greenstock , testified on nov .
27 that the us-led invasion in march 2003 was " legal but of questionable legitimacy , in that it did n't have the democratically observable backing of the great majority of member states . "
greenstock said the un security council had passed a resolution in late 2002 that gave iraq a " final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations , " but the council never passed a resolution authorizing the invasion .

vogel had been due to attend an islamic rally in the swiss capital berne on saturday against a ban on the construction of new minarets . switzerland voted to ban the building of new minarets in a referendum two weeks ago .
the surprise result provoked condemnation across the world . reports said vogel objected to not being allowed into switzerland , but that he cooperated with border guards and signed the order banning his entry into the country .
he then returned to germany .
a report on the swiss broadcasting corporation 's web site said that vogel was not allowed in as the federal migration office said his presence could pose a threat to public law and order .
vogel , a former professional boxer who converted to islam in 2001 , told swiss newspapers that he wanted to encourage muslims in switzerland to come out of their social isolation and help lessen mistrust , the site said .
over 57 percent of voters and all but four of the country 's 26 cantons approved the proposal to ban new minarets .
the right-wing swiss people 's party was the driving force behind the november 29 referendum .
the government said it would respect the people 's decision and would no longer permit construction of minarets .
however , it tried to assure the country 's 400,000-strong muslim community that the ban did not amount to “ a rejection of the muslim community , religion or culture . ” rb / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" being the champions of the first half means nothing to me , " said jupp heynckes , coach of first place bayer leverkusen , after his team 's 2-2 draw against last place hertha berlin .
the single point from the draw left the door open for other teams in the bundesliga to close in on leverkusen 's top spot with one game to go before the winter break .
if being in first place at the end of the first half is irrelevant for heynckes , then there are two other teams in the league who would gladly celebrate the holidays from the top of the standings in leverkusen 's stead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes is unconcerned with being crowned the first half champs those teams would be schalke and bayern munich , who both won their matches in the bundesliga to narrow the gap to heynckes ' team .
leverkusen leads the league with 32 points , just one ahead of second place schalke and two in front of munich .
battle for second goes to schalke despite playing with the home-field advantage , werder bremen was forced to concede second place and any hopes of leading the league before the break after losing 2-0 in schalke .
heading into the match , the two were tied on points , with schalke trailing on goal differential .
kevin kuranyi put the first goal in the net for schalke just after the second half got underway , and jan moravek , coming off the bench , took a pass from kuranyi and sealed the victory for schalke with the final goal in the 72nd minute .
the loss ended bremen 's undefeated streak of 23 matches and left them in fourth place , four points off the top and two shy of third place bayern .
bayern continues to win fresh off their convincing 4-0 thrashing of juventus that advanced them to the knock-out stage of the champions league , munich won again in the bundesliga with another feast of goals .
the final tally for bayern , playing on the road against bochum , was 5-1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's ivica olic scored three goals agains bochum mario gomez got things started for the bavarians , scoring his fourth goal in four matches in the 23rd minute .
ivica olic added a pair of goals on either side of the break , and danijel prandic scored munich 's final goal ten minutes after half-time .
bochum 's mergim marvic put the fifth goal on the board for bayern , misdirecting a clearance attempt into his own goal .
christian fuchs prevented a bayern shutout with a free kick in the 76th minute .
" it 's been a great week , the best since i have been in munich , " said a pleased munich coach louis van gaal .
" we are only two points off the top spot and that is very satisfying . "
bad luck for hanover it may have been a memorable day for louis van gaal , but saturday 's game between borussia moenchengladbach and hanover 96 is one that hanover defender karim haggui would probably rather forget after putting two goals into his own net .
the first came after hanover florian fromlowitz slipped while attempting to clear the ball and kicked it into haggui 's leg , which deflected the ball back into the net .
the second was a back pass that missed fromlowitz and landed in the goal in stoppage time .
huggui could n't help but grin over his terrible luck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanover scored three own goals incredibly , haggui was n't the only one to score at the wrong end for hanover .
in the 58th minute , constant djakpa gave moenchengladbach their third early christmas present of the match .
moenchengladbach did manage to score two goals of their own , with rob friend scoring in the 22nd minute and michael bradley sending a free kick to the back of the net in the 68th .
hanover put three goals in the correct goal as well , including two from didier ya konan , for a final score of 5-3 for moenchengladbach .
" we saw a crazy , curious match , " said hanover coach andreas bergmann .
" it 's unbelievable we scored six goals and lost the match .
i do n't think we 'll forget this match any time soon . "

vogel had been due to attend an islamic rally in the swiss capital berne on saturday against a ban on the construction of new minarets . switzerland voted to ban the building of new minarets in a referendum two weeks ago .
the surprise result provoked condemnation across the world . reports said vogel objected to not being allowed into switzerland , but that he cooperated with border guards and signed the order banning his entry into the country .
he then returned to germany .
a report on the swiss broadcasting corporation 's web site said that vogel was not allowed in as the federal migration office said his presence could pose a threat to public law and order .
vogel , a former professional boxer who converted to islam in 2001 , told swiss newspapers that he wanted to encourage muslims in switzerland to come out of their social isolation and help lessen mistrust , the site said .
over 57 percent of voters and all but four of the country 's 26 cantons approved the proposal to ban new minarets .
the right-wing swiss people 's party was the driving force behind the november 29 referendum .
the government said it would respect the people 's decision and would no longer permit construction of minarets .
however , it tried to assure the country 's 400,000-strong muslim community that the ban did not amount to “ a rejection of the muslim community , religion or culture . ” rb / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the official bulgarian reaction so far has been noncommittal . bulgaria is in talks with the united states to host some of the inmates from guantanamo bay , the country 's interior minister said on saturday .
tsvetan tsvetanov confirmed his country was considering a request from the obama administration for an arrangement to host former detainees .
the government in sofia had received a letter addressed to prime minister boyko borisov , tsvetanov said in a national radio interview " we have not taken a decision yet , " he said .
" in any case , bulgaria 's participation would be small and we would not accept people who might pose a threat to our national security . "
the issue was due to be discussed before parliament , he added .
gesture of soldarity bulgarian prime minister borisov said he thinks taking an inmate would be a strong gesture of cooperation between europe and the united states .

the us continues to seek out potential hosts for former guantanamo inmates as part of president barack obama 's initiative to shut down the controversial detention camp .
obama had promised to shut down the facility within a year of taking office but , because of diplomatic and political obstacles , there are still more than 200 inmates who need to be relocated .
earlier this month , the french foreign ministry said two detainees at guantanamo were sent to france and to hungary .

vogel had been due to attend an islamic rally in the swiss capital berne on saturday against a ban on the construction of new minarets . switzerland voted to ban the building of new minarets in a referendum two weeks ago .
the surprise result provoked condemnation across the world . reports said vogel objected to not being allowed into switzerland , but that he cooperated with border guards and signed the order banning his entry into the country .
he then returned to germany .
a report on the swiss broadcasting corporation 's web site said that vogel was not allowed in as the federal migration office said his presence could pose a threat to public law and order .
vogel , a former professional boxer who converted to islam in 2001 , told swiss newspapers that he wanted to encourage muslims in switzerland to come out of their social isolation and help lessen mistrust , the site said .
over 57 percent of voters and all but four of the country 's 26 cantons approved the proposal to ban new minarets .
the right-wing swiss people 's party was the driving force behind the november 29 referendum .
the government said it would respect the people 's decision and would no longer permit construction of minarets .
however , it tried to assure the country 's 400,000-strong muslim community that the ban did not amount to “ a rejection of the muslim community , religion or culture . ” rb / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think that we are looking at a very significant reorganization of the church in ireland , " said dublin archbishop diarmuid martin after the meeting .
the meeting was called by the pope to discuss the widespread sexual abuse of children by clergymen in ireland , which was reportedly covered up by the church in ireland for decades .
in a statement released by the vatican , the pope said he shares the " outrage , betrayal and shame felt by so many of the faithful in ireland -lrb- over -rrb- these heinous crimes . "
decades of abuse the investigation , known as the murphy report , revealed that not only was sexual abuse of children by priests in ireland prevalent from 1975-2004 , but that the archdiocese of dublin was aware of the situation and maintained a policy of " do n't ask , do n't tell . "
in the vatican 's statement , it said the pope felt " profound regret at the actions of some members of the clergy who have betrayed their solemn promises to god , as well as the trust placed in them by the victims and their families , and by society at large . "
the pope is reportedly planning to issue a letter to irish catholics .

" being the champions of the first half means nothing to me , " said jupp heynckes , coach of first place bayer leverkusen , after his team 's 2-2 draw against last place hertha berlin .
the single point from the draw left the door open for other teams in the bundesliga to close in on leverkusen 's top spot with one game to go before the winter break .
if being in first place at the end of the first half is irrelevant for heynckes , then there are two other teams in the league who would gladly celebrate the holidays from the top of the standings in leverkusen 's stead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes is unconcerned with being crowned the first half champs those teams would be schalke and bayern munich , who both won their matches in the bundesliga to narrow the gap to heynckes ' team .
leverkusen leads the league with 32 points , just one ahead of second place schalke and two in front of munich .
battle for second goes to schalke despite playing with the home-field advantage , werder bremen was forced to concede second place and any hopes of leading the league before the break after losing 2-0 in schalke .
heading into the match , the two were tied on points , with schalke trailing on goal differential .
kevin kuranyi put the first goal in the net for schalke just after the second half got underway , and jan moravek , coming off the bench , took a pass from kuranyi and sealed the victory for schalke with the final goal in the 72nd minute .
the loss ended bremen 's undefeated streak of 23 matches and left them in fourth place , four points off the top and two shy of third place bayern .
bayern continues to win fresh off their convincing 4-0 thrashing of juventus that advanced them to the knock-out stage of the champions league , munich won again in the bundesliga with another feast of goals .
the final tally for bayern , playing on the road against bochum , was 5-1 .

bochum 's mergim marvic put the fifth goal on the board for bayern , misdirecting a clearance attempt into his own goal .
christian fuchs prevented a bayern shutout with a free kick in the 76th minute .
" it 's been a great week , the best since i have been in munich , " said a pleased munich coach louis van gaal .
" we are only two points off the top spot and that is very satisfying . "
bad luck for hanover it may have been a memorable day for louis van gaal , but saturday 's game between borussia moenchengladbach and hanover 96 is one that hanover defender karim haggui would probably rather forget after putting two goals into his own net .
the first came after hanover florian fromlowitz slipped while attempting to clear the ball and kicked it into haggui 's leg , which deflected the ball back into the net .
the second was a back pass that missed fromlowitz and landed in the goal in stoppage time .
huggui could n't help but grin over his terrible luck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanover scored three own goals incredibly , haggui was n't the only one to score at the wrong end for hanover .
in the 58th minute , constant djakpa gave moenchengladbach their third early christmas present of the match .
moenchengladbach did manage to score two goals of their own , with rob friend scoring in the 22nd minute and michael bradley sending a free kick to the back of the net in the 68th .
hanover put three goals in the correct goal as well , including two from didier ya konan , for a final score of 5-3 for moenchengladbach .
" we saw a crazy , curious match , " said hanover coach andreas bergmann .
" it 's unbelievable we scored six goals and lost the match .
i do n't think we 'll forget this match any time soon . "

bad luck for hanover it may have been a memorable day for louis van gaal , but saturday 's game between borussia moenchengladbach and hanover 96 is one that hanover defender karim haggui would probably rather forget after putting two goals into his own net .
the first came after hanover florian fromlowitz slipped while attempting to clear the ball and kicked it into haggui 's leg , which deflected the ball back into the net .
the second was a back pass that missed fromlowitz and landed in the goal in stoppage time .
huggui could n't help but grin over his terrible luck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanover scored three own goals incredibly , haggui was n't the only one to score at the wrong end for hanover .
in the 58th minute , constant djakpa gave moenchengladbach their third early christmas present of the match .
moenchengladbach did manage to score two goals of their own , with rob friend scoring in the 22nd minute and michael bradley sending a free kick to the back of the net in the 68th .
hanover put three goals in the correct goal as well , including two from didier ya konan , for a final score of 5-3 for moenchengladbach .
" we saw a crazy , curious match , " said hanover coach andreas bergmann .
" it 's unbelievable we scored six goals and lost the match .

the official bulgarian reaction so far has been noncommittal . bulgaria is in talks with the united states to host some of the inmates from guantanamo bay , the country 's interior minister said on saturday .
tsvetan tsvetanov confirmed his country was considering a request from the obama administration for an arrangement to host former detainees .
the government in sofia had received a letter addressed to prime minister boyko borisov , tsvetanov said in a national radio interview " we have not taken a decision yet , " he said .
" in any case , bulgaria 's participation would be small and we would not accept people who might pose a threat to our national security . "
the issue was due to be discussed before parliament , he added .
gesture of soldarity bulgarian prime minister borisov said he thinks taking an inmate would be a strong gesture of cooperation between europe and the united states .
" there is european and nato solidarity .
just like we seek support for everything from our euro-atlantic partners , president obama is now seeking this from all of us , " borisov told reporters .
" my personal opinion is that we should accept one person . "
his center-right administration , which replaced its socialist predecessor in july , is conscious of the balkan country 's image that was marred by the previous government 's failure to tame corruption and crime .
ongoing effort to close prison the united states embassy in sofia confirmed to afp late friday that : " us special envoy for guantanamo closure , daniel fried , visited bulgaria from december 2-3 and met with bulgarian officials . "
" while we do not comment on our bilateral discussions with foreign governments , we are encouraged by the continued willingness of many of our close friends and allies to consider resettling detainees and help our effort to close the guantanamo bay detention facility , " it added in a statement .
the us continues to seek out potential hosts for former guantanamo inmates as part of president barack obama 's initiative to shut down the controversial detention camp .
obama had promised to shut down the facility within a year of taking office but , because of diplomatic and political obstacles , there are still more than 200 inmates who need to be relocated .
earlier this month , the french foreign ministry said two detainees at guantanamo were sent to france and to hungary .
overall , however , the international response to us requests for inmate hosting has been muted. sjt / dpa / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead of creating new concepts of nation building , leaders should read lawrence of arabia , argues a foreign policy expert . john hulsman is the author of the recently released " to begin the world over again : lawrence of arabia from damascus to baghdad . "
he is president of john hulsman enterprises , an international relations consulting firm , and a member of the council on foreign relations .
he is based in germany .
deutsche welle : in your new book you argue that instead of trying to develop new strategies for counterinsurgency and nation building in afghanistan , western leaders should read t. e. lawrence 's " 27 articles " written in 1917 during the so-called arab revolt as a guide for british officers .
what can we learn from lawrence of arabia that would help us today in afghanistan ?
john hulsman : the thing that was missing in barack obama 's speech was of course the most important piece from a lawrence point of view which is what are the locals going to do if you do these other things .
the problem with modern nation building is that it 's always about what 's going on in washington and other capitals , what the strategy should be for outsiders rather than what the strategy should be actually in these places that we are trying to nation build . lawrence realized that the key to success in the arab revolt was n't him , was n't the british , was n't the turks - it was the arabs .
could he make the arabs stakeholders in a settlement whereby he built a nation organically using the pieces there .
and so rather than create a nation where none had existed he worked with tribal leaders building something from the bottom up , seeing them as the key to the story , making them stakeholders in the assessment , realizing how their culture worked .
in other words it was entirely different than the failed efforts in bosnia , somalia , haiti , kosovo , afghanistan and iraq where we 've done this exactly the wrong way with the wrong philosophy .
if you are going to build a people you have to make sure you do n't liberate them from themselves .
probably the most famous advice given by t.e. lawrence in his " 27 articles " postulates " better the arabs do it tolerably than that you do it perfectly . "
has the international community heeded that advice so far in its mission in afghanistan ?
one of the things people say is " is n't it terrible that we 're working with these warlords . "
who do these people think has been running afghanistan for the last 1,000 years ?
not thomas jefferson and not james madison .
i wish that were the case , but it 's just not .
better that they be given control in terms of money - of course we should account for it because there is a lot of corruption in afghanistan - better they be given control over the building projects that they 're doing rather than we tell them what to build .
and of course they wo n't do it as well if we would do it by western standards .
but the key is n't how well they do it , but that they will be made stakeholders in the process so that they see that they are rebuilding their nation , they are building their country , not that we are imposing some sort of diktat from outside .
i think that is actually the key piece of advice from the " 27 articles , " because it encapsulates what 's wrong with what we are doing .
what we are doing should be mainly psychological and political , and then only secondarily military .
in the arab revolt in 1917 , lawrence figured out that if the arabs were on his side he could n't lose and if they were n't on his side that he could n't win . and that 's what 's missing from obama 's plan .
there was precious little mention of local politics and working with localities .
the problem with the afghan constitution that we imposed on the country after installing karzai is that it 's centralized , that we 've made kabul the center of the political decision making when in afghanistan the tribe and localism has been the center of the afghan experience of a 1,000 years . lawrence would understand this in a heartbeat .
and that 's why in a sense what 's happening in afghanistan is so tragic and why i was really desperately impelled to write this book .
it comes out of a practical experience of working in washington on iraq and afghanistan and then i read this guy and i immediately said that 's it , that 's what 's missing . bildunterschrift : isaf commander stanley mcchrystal is trying to work closer with the afghan people lawrence of arabia , as the name and the popular movie about him suggest , was famous for his knowledge of and closeness to the arabs that contributed to his success .
do the current military and civilian leaders in charge of the afghan mission know enough about the country and its people ?
no , i do n't think they do .
i give general mcchrystal real credit , because he is aware that this is an area where they are falling behind .
in iraq , one of the most important things that explained to me why we failed there was when i read at the time that of the 200 senior staffers that viceroy paul bremer brought in under george w. bush to look after iraq , only one had an advanced degree in anything relating to iraq or the middle east .
and lawrence would say you ca n't transform a society you do n't know anything about , that 's just common sense . i laud mcchrystal for realizing that something is missing , but intellectually these guys do n't know anything near what lawrence did .
lawrence had worked before the war in an archeological dig with the arabs in karkemish , he spoke their language , he knew their tribal structure , he knew their feuds , he knew who liked whom and why .
cultural knowledge is far more important than military knowledge if you are going to do anything successful on counterinsurgency and nation building .
of course lawrence of arabia is perhaps most well-known for his military achievements , i.e. the arab revolt , the battle of aqaba and the fall of damascus .
what military lessons can the isaf troops in afghanistan learn from lawrence ?
what they can learn is actually an old german saying and they could read their clausewitz again .
clausewitz got it right that military matters are only an extension of doing things politically . if we clear the taliban somehow through a miracle from afghanistan , which we of course ca n't do because they are locals and not some foreign outside force , but even if we could get rid of all the taliban by some miracle we still would n't have stability in afghanistan because there is n't anything political to build on .
that is the key .
despite his successes , lawrence of arabia 's grand vision of arab self-determination failed in the end when the british and the french decided to divide the middle east between them .
is n't that a stark reminder that in afghanistan , realpolitik ultimately might trump visionary politics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban have steadily gained ground in afghanistan yes it definitely could .
we need to go from bottom up rather than from top down .
the british and french went top down .
they said what matters most on the great power level .
the reason why it is better to start with the micro level and then go to the macro level is really old-fashioned burkean thinking .
if you get the stuff on the ground locally right you can then build something .
if we get the various tribal leaders to buy into our settlement , then you can go to the chinese , the russians , the indians and the pakistanis and say , we can promise you stability , but only if we all do n't intervene and meddle , including the united states .
going bottom up leads to that stability .
without that local component it wo n't work as was seen in the case of lawrence , that is absolutely right .

instead of creating new concepts of nation building , leaders should read lawrence of arabia , argues a foreign policy expert . john hulsman is the author of the recently released " to begin the world over again : lawrence of arabia from damascus to baghdad . "
he is president of john hulsman enterprises , an international relations consulting firm , and a member of the council on foreign relations .
he is based in germany .
deutsche welle : in your new book you argue that instead of trying to develop new strategies for counterinsurgency and nation building in afghanistan , western leaders should read t. e. lawrence 's " 27 articles " written in 1917 during the so-called arab revolt as a guide for british officers .

a russian-norwegian consortium won a bid to develop iraq 's biggest oil field . russia 's oil company lukoil and the norwegian statoilhydro won a joint bid on saturday to develop iraq 's largest undeveloped oil field .
on the second day of the largest iraqi postwar auction , the west qurna-2 reservoir , with 12.86 billion barrels of oil in reserves , went to the norwegian-russian consortium after the preceding day had seen auctions won by shell and china 's cnpc .
located in relatively calm and secure southern iraq , west qurna is expected to produce 1.8 billion barrels per day . lukoil and statoilhydro requested 1.15 dollars for each barrel extracted from the giant field .
lukoil will take 85 percent and statoilhydro 15 percent .
the deals reached so far in the two-day auction promise to increase iraq 's oil production by more than 4.2 million barrels per day .

a russian-norwegian consortium won a bid to develop iraq 's biggest oil field . russia 's oil company lukoil and the norwegian statoilhydro won a joint bid on saturday to develop iraq 's largest undeveloped oil field .
on the second day of the largest iraqi postwar auction , the west qurna-2 reservoir , with 12.86 billion barrels of oil in reserves , went to the norwegian-russian consortium after the preceding day had seen auctions won by shell and china 's cnpc .
located in relatively calm and secure southern iraq , west qurna is expected to produce 1.8 billion barrels per day . lukoil and statoilhydro requested 1.15 dollars for each barrel extracted from the giant field .
lukoil will take 85 percent and statoilhydro 15 percent .
the deals reached so far in the two-day auction promise to increase iraq 's oil production by more than 4.2 million barrels per day .

thousands took to the streets on saturday to urge leaders at un talks to agree on a deal to fight global warming . danish police say they have released nearly all of the 968 people detained during a climate rally which drew an estimated 40,000 people in the danish capital on saturday . law enforcement authorities said only 13 demonstrators were still in custody on sunday and of those , three are set to be arraigned on preliminary charges of fighting with the police . on saturday , the heart of the danish capital became a sea of blue as environmentalists and anti-capitalist demonstrators gathered in front of parliament at the start of a six-kilometer -lrb- four-mile -rrb- march that took them to the venue of the ongoing united nations climate summit . the protesters ' aim was to pressure united nations negotiators to take concrete action on climate change .
an estimated 40,000 people attended the march which was jointly organized by over 500 groups from 67 countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were scuffles in copenhagen as police detained hundreds for throwing bottles and smashing windows the procession wound its way from the folketing , the danish parliament , to the conference site , the massive bella center on the outskirts of the city center . demonstrators wore sky blue raincoats or carried blue umbrellas following a call by the environmental group , friends of the earth . activists slam rich nations nigerian nnimmo bassey , chairman of friends of the earth international , delivered a fiery speech to the crowd . " we can not allow carbon traders to damage the world .
there is no such thing as clean coal or clean crude .
leave the oil in the soil , leave the coal in the hole , " he said .
" to those who want to pollute at home and plant a tree somewhere we say no , " he added .
the demonstrations come as delegates to the un climate summit currently under way in copenhagen wrangle over a draft blueprint for a global pact .
at the un conference itself , developing nations on friday rejected as " insignificant " an eu pledge of 7.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- to help them tackle global warming .
the accord , which would see the money paid over three years , came a week before 110 heads of state and government convene in copenhagen for the finale of the 12-day conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel was criticized by greenpeace for not doing enough the head of greenpeace , kumi naidoo , strongly criticized german chancellor angela merkel for doing too little to help poorer nations cope with the effects of climate change .
" angela merkel can steer the rudder in copenhagen , " naidoo told the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday .
" but her behavior in the current debate is more than disappointing . " in an interview to be published in the sunday edition of the tabloid daily bild , merkel chided the developing countries for expecting richer ones to shoulder more of the burden . " we will not allow germany and the other european industrial states to lead the way on climate change , while others do nothing and then poach jobs from us , using the argument of lower costs for environmental protection , " merkel said . tight security the danish capital had resembled a military zone as authorities prepared for the arrival of activists from all over the world .
helicopters buzzed in the skies while armored police vans and canine squads patrolled the streets , amid fears that saturday 's march could be joined by violent far-left groups .
police also beefed up security at denmark 's land and sea borders to prevent troublemakers from entering the country .
shopkeepers and businesses were warned of a possible outbreak of violence .
those warnings unfortunately came to fruition to a small degree , as police arrested nearly a thousand people who had been throwing rocks and fireworks at police and smashing storefront windows .
on friday , authorities had rounded up 75 anti-capitalist demonstrators , 13 from germany , who were suspected of trying to set up an unauthorized blockade of companies they thought were emitting greenhouse gases .
protests worldwide protests and marches supporting a new climate covenant took place in more than 100 other countries as well , including greece , spain , and germany .
hours before the demonstration was due to kick off in copenhagen , protesters were out in force around asia , waving banners and chanting slogans urging action from the climate conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists march in sydney , australia as part of worldwide climate demonstrations in australia , organizers said around 50,000 people had taken to the streets nationwide , wearing sky-blue shoelaces in a call for a strong and binding agreement at the un talks .
" we want -lrb- world leaders -rrb- to bring home a treaty , we want them to stand by the pacific and our neighbors there .
and we want them to deliver and ensure a safe climate future for us all , " said james dannenberg , one of the organizers .
thousands of activists gathered in front of the parliament house in canberra , while 10,000-strong crowds marched through sydney , melbourne and other major cities .
protesters in hong kong – some dressed as pandas – and the philippines also took to the streets , while in indonesia , demonstrators rallied in front of the us embassy in the capital jakarta , calling for help for developing nations in reducing greenhouse gases. rb / svs / afp / reuters / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead of creating new concepts of nation building , leaders should read lawrence of arabia , argues a foreign policy expert . john hulsman is the author of the recently released " to begin the world over again : lawrence of arabia from damascus to baghdad . "
he is president of john hulsman enterprises , an international relations consulting firm , and a member of the council on foreign relations .
he is based in germany .
deutsche welle : in your new book you argue that instead of trying to develop new strategies for counterinsurgency and nation building in afghanistan , western leaders should read t. e. lawrence 's " 27 articles " written in 1917 during the so-called arab revolt as a guide for british officers .
what can we learn from lawrence of arabia that would help us today in afghanistan ?
john hulsman : the thing that was missing in barack obama 's speech was of course the most important piece from a lawrence point of view which is what are the locals going to do if you do these other things .
the problem with modern nation building is that it 's always about what 's going on in washington and other capitals , what the strategy should be for outsiders rather than what the strategy should be actually in these places that we are trying to nation build . lawrence realized that the key to success in the arab revolt was n't him , was n't the british , was n't the turks - it was the arabs .
could he make the arabs stakeholders in a settlement whereby he built a nation organically using the pieces there .
and so rather than create a nation where none had existed he worked with tribal leaders building something from the bottom up , seeing them as the key to the story , making them stakeholders in the assessment , realizing how their culture worked .
in other words it was entirely different than the failed efforts in bosnia , somalia , haiti , kosovo , afghanistan and iraq where we 've done this exactly the wrong way with the wrong philosophy .
if you are going to build a people you have to make sure you do n't liberate them from themselves .
probably the most famous advice given by t.e. lawrence in his " 27 articles " postulates " better the arabs do it tolerably than that you do it perfectly . "
has the international community heeded that advice so far in its mission in afghanistan ?
one of the things people say is " is n't it terrible that we 're working with these warlords . "
who do these people think has been running afghanistan for the last 1,000 years ?
not thomas jefferson and not james madison .
i wish that were the case , but it 's just not .
better that they be given control in terms of money - of course we should account for it because there is a lot of corruption in afghanistan - better they be given control over the building projects that they 're doing rather than we tell them what to build .
and of course they wo n't do it as well if we would do it by western standards .
but the key is n't how well they do it , but that they will be made stakeholders in the process so that they see that they are rebuilding their nation , they are building their country , not that we are imposing some sort of diktat from outside .
i think that is actually the key piece of advice from the " 27 articles , " because it encapsulates what 's wrong with what we are doing .
what we are doing should be mainly psychological and political , and then only secondarily military .
in the arab revolt in 1917 , lawrence figured out that if the arabs were on his side he could n't lose and if they were n't on his side that he could n't win . and that 's what 's missing from obama 's plan .
there was precious little mention of local politics and working with localities .
the problem with the afghan constitution that we imposed on the country after installing karzai is that it 's centralized , that we 've made kabul the center of the political decision making when in afghanistan the tribe and localism has been the center of the afghan experience of a 1,000 years . lawrence would understand this in a heartbeat .
and that 's why in a sense what 's happening in afghanistan is so tragic and why i was really desperately impelled to write this book .
it comes out of a practical experience of working in washington on iraq and afghanistan and then i read this guy and i immediately said that 's it , that 's what 's missing . bildunterschrift : isaf commander stanley mcchrystal is trying to work closer with the afghan people lawrence of arabia , as the name and the popular movie about him suggest , was famous for his knowledge of and closeness to the arabs that contributed to his success .
do the current military and civilian leaders in charge of the afghan mission know enough about the country and its people ?
no , i do n't think they do .
i give general mcchrystal real credit , because he is aware that this is an area where they are falling behind .
in iraq , one of the most important things that explained to me why we failed there was when i read at the time that of the 200 senior staffers that viceroy paul bremer brought in under george w. bush to look after iraq , only one had an advanced degree in anything relating to iraq or the middle east .
and lawrence would say you ca n't transform a society you do n't know anything about , that 's just common sense . i laud mcchrystal for realizing that something is missing , but intellectually these guys do n't know anything near what lawrence did .
lawrence had worked before the war in an archeological dig with the arabs in karkemish , he spoke their language , he knew their tribal structure , he knew their feuds , he knew who liked whom and why .
cultural knowledge is far more important than military knowledge if you are going to do anything successful on counterinsurgency and nation building .
of course lawrence of arabia is perhaps most well-known for his military achievements , i.e. the arab revolt , the battle of aqaba and the fall of damascus .
what military lessons can the isaf troops in afghanistan learn from lawrence ?
what they can learn is actually an old german saying and they could read their clausewitz again .
clausewitz got it right that military matters are only an extension of doing things politically . if we clear the taliban somehow through a miracle from afghanistan , which we of course ca n't do because they are locals and not some foreign outside force , but even if we could get rid of all the taliban by some miracle we still would n't have stability in afghanistan because there is n't anything political to build on .
that is the key .
despite his successes , lawrence of arabia 's grand vision of arab self-determination failed in the end when the british and the french decided to divide the middle east between them .
is n't that a stark reminder that in afghanistan , realpolitik ultimately might trump visionary politics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban have steadily gained ground in afghanistan yes it definitely could .
we need to go from bottom up rather than from top down .
the british and french went top down .
they said what matters most on the great power level .
the reason why it is better to start with the micro level and then go to the macro level is really old-fashioned burkean thinking .
if you get the stuff on the ground locally right you can then build something .
if we get the various tribal leaders to buy into our settlement , then you can go to the chinese , the russians , the indians and the pakistanis and say , we can promise you stability , but only if we all do n't intervene and meddle , including the united states .
going bottom up leads to that stability .
without that local component it wo n't work as was seen in the case of lawrence , that is absolutely right .

thousands took to the streets on saturday to urge leaders at un talks to agree on a deal to fight global warming . danish police say they have released nearly all of the 968 people detained during a climate rally which drew an estimated 40,000 people in the danish capital on saturday . law enforcement authorities said only 13 demonstrators were still in custody on sunday and of those , three are set to be arraigned on preliminary charges of fighting with the police . on saturday , the heart of the danish capital became a sea of blue as environmentalists and anti-capitalist demonstrators gathered in front of parliament at the start of a six-kilometer -lrb- four-mile -rrb- march that took them to the venue of the ongoing united nations climate summit . the protesters ' aim was to pressure united nations negotiators to take concrete action on climate change .
an estimated 40,000 people attended the march which was jointly organized by over 500 groups from 67 countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were scuffles in copenhagen as police detained hundreds for throwing bottles and smashing windows the procession wound its way from the folketing , the danish parliament , to the conference site , the massive bella center on the outskirts of the city center . demonstrators wore sky blue raincoats or carried blue umbrellas following a call by the environmental group , friends of the earth . activists slam rich nations nigerian nnimmo bassey , chairman of friends of the earth international , delivered a fiery speech to the crowd . " we can not allow carbon traders to damage the world .
there is no such thing as clean coal or clean crude .
leave the oil in the soil , leave the coal in the hole , " he said .
" to those who want to pollute at home and plant a tree somewhere we say no , " he added .
the demonstrations come as delegates to the un climate summit currently under way in copenhagen wrangle over a draft blueprint for a global pact .
at the un conference itself , developing nations on friday rejected as " insignificant " an eu pledge of 7.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- to help them tackle global warming .
the accord , which would see the money paid over three years , came a week before 110 heads of state and government convene in copenhagen for the finale of the 12-day conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel was criticized by greenpeace for not doing enough the head of greenpeace , kumi naidoo , strongly criticized german chancellor angela merkel for doing too little to help poorer nations cope with the effects of climate change .
" angela merkel can steer the rudder in copenhagen , " naidoo told the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday .
" but her behavior in the current debate is more than disappointing . " in an interview to be published in the sunday edition of the tabloid daily bild , merkel chided the developing countries for expecting richer ones to shoulder more of the burden . " we will not allow germany and the other european industrial states to lead the way on climate change , while others do nothing and then poach jobs from us , using the argument of lower costs for environmental protection , " merkel said . tight security the danish capital had resembled a military zone as authorities prepared for the arrival of activists from all over the world .
helicopters buzzed in the skies while armored police vans and canine squads patrolled the streets , amid fears that saturday 's march could be joined by violent far-left groups .
police also beefed up security at denmark 's land and sea borders to prevent troublemakers from entering the country .
shopkeepers and businesses were warned of a possible outbreak of violence .
those warnings unfortunately came to fruition to a small degree , as police arrested nearly a thousand people who had been throwing rocks and fireworks at police and smashing storefront windows .
on friday , authorities had rounded up 75 anti-capitalist demonstrators , 13 from germany , who were suspected of trying to set up an unauthorized blockade of companies they thought were emitting greenhouse gases .
protests worldwide protests and marches supporting a new climate covenant took place in more than 100 other countries as well , including greece , spain , and germany .
hours before the demonstration was due to kick off in copenhagen , protesters were out in force around asia , waving banners and chanting slogans urging action from the climate conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists march in sydney , australia as part of worldwide climate demonstrations in australia , organizers said around 50,000 people had taken to the streets nationwide , wearing sky-blue shoelaces in a call for a strong and binding agreement at the un talks .
" we want -lrb- world leaders -rrb- to bring home a treaty , we want them to stand by the pacific and our neighbors there .
and we want them to deliver and ensure a safe climate future for us all , " said james dannenberg , one of the organizers .
thousands of activists gathered in front of the parliament house in canberra , while 10,000-strong crowds marched through sydney , melbourne and other major cities .
protesters in hong kong – some dressed as pandas – and the philippines also took to the streets , while in indonesia , demonstrators rallied in front of the us embassy in the capital jakarta , calling for help for developing nations in reducing greenhouse gases. rb / svs / afp / reuters / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead of creating new concepts of nation building , leaders should read lawrence of arabia , argues a foreign policy expert . john hulsman is the author of the recently released " to begin the world over again : lawrence of arabia from damascus to baghdad . "
he is president of john hulsman enterprises , an international relations consulting firm , and a member of the council on foreign relations .
he is based in germany .
deutsche welle : in your new book you argue that instead of trying to develop new strategies for counterinsurgency and nation building in afghanistan , western leaders should read t. e. lawrence 's " 27 articles " written in 1917 during the so-called arab revolt as a guide for british officers .
what can we learn from lawrence of arabia that would help us today in afghanistan ?
john hulsman : the thing that was missing in barack obama 's speech was of course the most important piece from a lawrence point of view which is what are the locals going to do if you do these other things .
the problem with modern nation building is that it 's always about what 's going on in washington and other capitals , what the strategy should be for outsiders rather than what the strategy should be actually in these places that we are trying to nation build . lawrence realized that the key to success in the arab revolt was n't him , was n't the british , was n't the turks - it was the arabs .
could he make the arabs stakeholders in a settlement whereby he built a nation organically using the pieces there .
and so rather than create a nation where none had existed he worked with tribal leaders building something from the bottom up , seeing them as the key to the story , making them stakeholders in the assessment , realizing how their culture worked .
in other words it was entirely different than the failed efforts in bosnia , somalia , haiti , kosovo , afghanistan and iraq where we 've done this exactly the wrong way with the wrong philosophy .
if you are going to build a people you have to make sure you do n't liberate them from themselves .
probably the most famous advice given by t.e. lawrence in his " 27 articles " postulates " better the arabs do it tolerably than that you do it perfectly . "
has the international community heeded that advice so far in its mission in afghanistan ?
one of the things people say is " is n't it terrible that we 're working with these warlords . "
who do these people think has been running afghanistan for the last 1,000 years ?
not thomas jefferson and not james madison .
i wish that were the case , but it 's just not .
better that they be given control in terms of money - of course we should account for it because there is a lot of corruption in afghanistan - better they be given control over the building projects that they 're doing rather than we tell them what to build .
and of course they wo n't do it as well if we would do it by western standards .
but the key is n't how well they do it , but that they will be made stakeholders in the process so that they see that they are rebuilding their nation , they are building their country , not that we are imposing some sort of diktat from outside .
i think that is actually the key piece of advice from the " 27 articles , " because it encapsulates what 's wrong with what we are doing .
what we are doing should be mainly psychological and political , and then only secondarily military .
in the arab revolt in 1917 , lawrence figured out that if the arabs were on his side he could n't lose and if they were n't on his side that he could n't win . and that 's what 's missing from obama 's plan .
there was precious little mention of local politics and working with localities .
the problem with the afghan constitution that we imposed on the country after installing karzai is that it 's centralized , that we 've made kabul the center of the political decision making when in afghanistan the tribe and localism has been the center of the afghan experience of a 1,000 years . lawrence would understand this in a heartbeat .
and that 's why in a sense what 's happening in afghanistan is so tragic and why i was really desperately impelled to write this book .
it comes out of a practical experience of working in washington on iraq and afghanistan and then i read this guy and i immediately said that 's it , that 's what 's missing . bildunterschrift : isaf commander stanley mcchrystal is trying to work closer with the afghan people lawrence of arabia , as the name and the popular movie about him suggest , was famous for his knowledge of and closeness to the arabs that contributed to his success .
do the current military and civilian leaders in charge of the afghan mission know enough about the country and its people ?
no , i do n't think they do .
i give general mcchrystal real credit , because he is aware that this is an area where they are falling behind .
in iraq , one of the most important things that explained to me why we failed there was when i read at the time that of the 200 senior staffers that viceroy paul bremer brought in under george w. bush to look after iraq , only one had an advanced degree in anything relating to iraq or the middle east .
and lawrence would say you ca n't transform a society you do n't know anything about , that 's just common sense . i laud mcchrystal for realizing that something is missing , but intellectually these guys do n't know anything near what lawrence did .
lawrence had worked before the war in an archeological dig with the arabs in karkemish , he spoke their language , he knew their tribal structure , he knew their feuds , he knew who liked whom and why .
cultural knowledge is far more important than military knowledge if you are going to do anything successful on counterinsurgency and nation building .
of course lawrence of arabia is perhaps most well-known for his military achievements , i.e. the arab revolt , the battle of aqaba and the fall of damascus .
what military lessons can the isaf troops in afghanistan learn from lawrence ?
what they can learn is actually an old german saying and they could read their clausewitz again .
clausewitz got it right that military matters are only an extension of doing things politically . if we clear the taliban somehow through a miracle from afghanistan , which we of course ca n't do because they are locals and not some foreign outside force , but even if we could get rid of all the taliban by some miracle we still would n't have stability in afghanistan because there is n't anything political to build on .

" to those who want to pollute at home and plant a tree somewhere we say no , " he added .
the demonstrations come as delegates to the un climate summit currently under way in copenhagen wrangle over a draft blueprint for a global pact .
at the un conference itself , developing nations on friday rejected as " insignificant " an eu pledge of 7.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- to help them tackle global warming .
the accord , which would see the money paid over three years , came a week before 110 heads of state and government convene in copenhagen for the finale of the 12-day conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel was criticized by greenpeace for not doing enough the head of greenpeace , kumi naidoo , strongly criticized german chancellor angela merkel for doing too little to help poorer nations cope with the effects of climate change .
" angela merkel can steer the rudder in copenhagen , " naidoo told the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday .
" but her behavior in the current debate is more than disappointing . " in an interview to be published in the sunday edition of the tabloid daily bild , merkel chided the developing countries for expecting richer ones to shoulder more of the burden . " we will not allow germany and the other european industrial states to lead the way on climate change , while others do nothing and then poach jobs from us , using the argument of lower costs for environmental protection , " merkel said . tight security the danish capital had resembled a military zone as authorities prepared for the arrival of activists from all over the world .
helicopters buzzed in the skies while armored police vans and canine squads patrolled the streets , amid fears that saturday 's march could be joined by violent far-left groups .
police also beefed up security at denmark 's land and sea borders to prevent troublemakers from entering the country .
shopkeepers and businesses were warned of a possible outbreak of violence .
those warnings unfortunately came to fruition to a small degree , as police arrested nearly a thousand people who had been throwing rocks and fireworks at police and smashing storefront windows .
on friday , authorities had rounded up 75 anti-capitalist demonstrators , 13 from germany , who were suspected of trying to set up an unauthorized blockade of companies they thought were emitting greenhouse gases .
protests worldwide protests and marches supporting a new climate covenant took place in more than 100 other countries as well , including greece , spain , and germany .
hours before the demonstration was due to kick off in copenhagen , protesters were out in force around asia , waving banners and chanting slogans urging action from the climate conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists march in sydney , australia as part of worldwide climate demonstrations in australia , organizers said around 50,000 people had taken to the streets nationwide , wearing sky-blue shoelaces in a call for a strong and binding agreement at the un talks .
" we want -lrb- world leaders -rrb- to bring home a treaty , we want them to stand by the pacific and our neighbors there .
and we want them to deliver and ensure a safe climate future for us all , " said james dannenberg , one of the organizers .
thousands of activists gathered in front of the parliament house in canberra , while 10,000-strong crowds marched through sydney , melbourne and other major cities .
protesters in hong kong – some dressed as pandas – and the philippines also took to the streets , while in indonesia , demonstrators rallied in front of the us embassy in the capital jakarta , calling for help for developing nations in reducing greenhouse gases. rb / svs / afp / reuters / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

vogel had been due to attend an islamic rally in the swiss capital berne on saturday against a ban on the construction of new minarets . switzerland voted to ban the building of new minarets in a referendum two weeks ago .
the surprise result provoked condemnation across the world . reports said vogel objected to not being allowed into switzerland , but that he cooperated with border guards and signed the order banning his entry into the country .
he then returned to germany .
a report on the swiss broadcasting corporation 's web site said that vogel was not allowed in as the federal migration office said his presence could pose a threat to public law and order .
vogel , a former professional boxer who converted to islam in 2001 , told swiss newspapers that he wanted to encourage muslims in switzerland to come out of their social isolation and help lessen mistrust , the site said .
over 57 percent of voters and all but four of the country 's 26 cantons approved the proposal to ban new minarets .
the right-wing swiss people 's party was the driving force behind the november 29 referendum .
the government said it would respect the people 's decision and would no longer permit construction of minarets .

vogel had been due to attend an islamic rally in the swiss capital berne on saturday against a ban on the construction of new minarets . switzerland voted to ban the building of new minarets in a referendum two weeks ago .
the surprise result provoked condemnation across the world . reports said vogel objected to not being allowed into switzerland , but that he cooperated with border guards and signed the order banning his entry into the country .
he then returned to germany .
a report on the swiss broadcasting corporation 's web site said that vogel was not allowed in as the federal migration office said his presence could pose a threat to public law and order .
vogel , a former professional boxer who converted to islam in 2001 , told swiss newspapers that he wanted to encourage muslims in switzerland to come out of their social isolation and help lessen mistrust , the site said .

a russian-norwegian consortium won a bid to develop iraq 's biggest oil field . russia 's oil company lukoil and the norwegian statoilhydro won a joint bid on saturday to develop iraq 's largest undeveloped oil field .
on the second day of the largest iraqi postwar auction , the west qurna-2 reservoir , with 12.86 billion barrels of oil in reserves , went to the norwegian-russian consortium after the preceding day had seen auctions won by shell and china 's cnpc .
located in relatively calm and secure southern iraq , west qurna is expected to produce 1.8 billion barrels per day . lukoil and statoilhydro requested 1.15 dollars for each barrel extracted from the giant field .
lukoil will take 85 percent and statoilhydro 15 percent .
the deals reached so far in the two-day auction promise to increase iraq 's oil production by more than 4.2 million barrels per day .
underbidding the competition the prices to develop the largest fields bid by oil companies have been lower than many expected .
" they were astonishingly low figures .
but 2009 will be remembered as the year that iraq opened its door to the international oil companies and then shut it .
it 's 10 fields and that 's it , " a senior oil executive told reuters .
" so it 's strategic for the oil firms , either you are here or you are n't and this is the chance .
you have to think about it like that . "
oil fields were auctioned off to multiple firms , including a consortium led by the russian firm gazprom , france 's total and the malaysia 's petronas .
but some fields near baghdad and the northern city of mosul were still considered too risky for the international firms and received no bids during the auction .
security for the auction at the oil ministry in baghdad was extremely tight after a string of bombings targeted various government buildings around the city on tuesday .
iraq has the world 's third largest oil reserves at 115 billion barrels , behind saudi arabia and iran .

the official bulgarian reaction so far has been noncommittal . bulgaria is in talks with the united states to host some of the inmates from guantanamo bay , the country 's interior minister said on saturday .
tsvetan tsvetanov confirmed his country was considering a request from the obama administration for an arrangement to host former detainees .
the government in sofia had received a letter addressed to prime minister boyko borisov , tsvetanov said in a national radio interview " we have not taken a decision yet , " he said .
" in any case , bulgaria 's participation would be small and we would not accept people who might pose a threat to our national security . "
the issue was due to be discussed before parliament , he added .
gesture of soldarity bulgarian prime minister borisov said he thinks taking an inmate would be a strong gesture of cooperation between europe and the united states .
" there is european and nato solidarity .

the us continues to seek out potential hosts for former guantanamo inmates as part of president barack obama 's initiative to shut down the controversial detention camp .
obama had promised to shut down the facility within a year of taking office but , because of diplomatic and political obstacles , there are still more than 200 inmates who need to be relocated .
earlier this month , the french foreign ministry said two detainees at guantanamo were sent to france and to hungary .

a russian-norwegian consortium won a bid to develop iraq 's biggest oil field . russia 's oil company lukoil and the norwegian statoilhydro won a joint bid on saturday to develop iraq 's largest undeveloped oil field .
on the second day of the largest iraqi postwar auction , the west qurna-2 reservoir , with 12.86 billion barrels of oil in reserves , went to the norwegian-russian consortium after the preceding day had seen auctions won by shell and china 's cnpc .
located in relatively calm and secure southern iraq , west qurna is expected to produce 1.8 billion barrels per day . lukoil and statoilhydro requested 1.15 dollars for each barrel extracted from the giant field .
lukoil will take 85 percent and statoilhydro 15 percent .
the deals reached so far in the two-day auction promise to increase iraq 's oil production by more than 4.2 million barrels per day .
underbidding the competition the prices to develop the largest fields bid by oil companies have been lower than many expected .
" they were astonishingly low figures .
but 2009 will be remembered as the year that iraq opened its door to the international oil companies and then shut it .
it 's 10 fields and that 's it , " a senior oil executive told reuters .
" so it 's strategic for the oil firms , either you are here or you are n't and this is the chance .
you have to think about it like that . "
oil fields were auctioned off to multiple firms , including a consortium led by the russian firm gazprom , france 's total and the malaysia 's petronas .
but some fields near baghdad and the northern city of mosul were still considered too risky for the international firms and received no bids during the auction .

on the second day of the largest iraqi postwar auction , the west qurna-2 reservoir , with 12.86 billion barrels of oil in reserves , went to the norwegian-russian consortium after the preceding day had seen auctions won by shell and china 's cnpc .
located in relatively calm and secure southern iraq , west qurna is expected to produce 1.8 billion barrels per day . lukoil and statoilhydro requested 1.15 dollars for each barrel extracted from the giant field .
lukoil will take 85 percent and statoilhydro 15 percent .
the deals reached so far in the two-day auction promise to increase iraq 's oil production by more than 4.2 million barrels per day .
underbidding the competition the prices to develop the largest fields bid by oil companies have been lower than many expected .
" they were astonishingly low figures .
but 2009 will be remembered as the year that iraq opened its door to the international oil companies and then shut it .
it 's 10 fields and that 's it , " a senior oil executive told reuters .
" so it 's strategic for the oil firms , either you are here or you are n't and this is the chance .
you have to think about it like that . "
oil fields were auctioned off to multiple firms , including a consortium led by the russian firm gazprom , france 's total and the malaysia 's petronas .
but some fields near baghdad and the northern city of mosul were still considered too risky for the international firms and received no bids during the auction .
security for the auction at the oil ministry in baghdad was extremely tight after a string of bombings targeted various government buildings around the city on tuesday .
iraq has the world 's third largest oil reserves at 115 billion barrels , behind saudi arabia and iran .
oil sales make up 85 percent of iraq 's revenue. sjt / afp / reuters / ap editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i would still have thought it right to remove him .
obviously you would have had to use and deploy different arguments , about the nature of the threat , " blair told the broadcaster in comments released saturday .
the interview for the show " fern britton meets ... " airs on sunday .
blair said hussein and his government were " a threat to the region , " and that his decision was also influenced by hussein 's willingness to use chemical weapons on " his own people " and by the stalling tactics he used against weapons inspectors .
comments spark criticism but blair 's comments have attracted strong criticism . hans blix , the head of the un team that conducted weapons inspections in iraq before the war , said he thought blair used wmd as a " convenient justification " for war .
" saddam 's removal was a gain but it 's the only gain that i can see from the war , " blix said .
the former un weapons inspector said he believed blair 's statement had a " strong impression of a lack of sincerity . "

the " chilcot inquiry , " named after a longtime civil servant who is overseeing it , began in november , shortly after almost all of the country 's troops were withdrawn from iraq .
blair is expected to appear as a witness in january .
britain 's former un ambassador , jeremy greenstock , testified on nov .
27 that the us-led invasion in march 2003 was " legal but of questionable legitimacy , in that it did n't have the democratically observable backing of the great majority of member states . "
greenstock said the un security council had passed a resolution in late 2002 that gave iraq a " final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations , " but the council never passed a resolution authorizing the invasion .
sympathy , but no regrets the war has also been met with widespread opposition among the british public .
hundreds of thousands of people marched to protest in the run-up to the war in february 2003 .
" i sympathize with the people who were against it for perfectly good reasons and are against it now , but for me you know , in the end i had to take the decision , " blair said .

" i would still have thought it right to remove him .
obviously you would have had to use and deploy different arguments , about the nature of the threat , " blair told the broadcaster in comments released saturday .
the interview for the show " fern britton meets ... " airs on sunday .
blair said hussein and his government were " a threat to the region , " and that his decision was also influenced by hussein 's willingness to use chemical weapons on " his own people " and by the stalling tactics he used against weapons inspectors .
comments spark criticism but blair 's comments have attracted strong criticism . hans blix , the head of the un team that conducted weapons inspections in iraq before the war , said he thought blair used wmd as a " convenient justification " for war .
" saddam 's removal was a gain but it 's the only gain that i can see from the war , " blix said .
the former un weapons inspector said he believed blair 's statement had a " strong impression of a lack of sincerity . "
the peace activism group stop the war coalition called blair 's remarks " an admission of war crimes ...
it is an illegal act of aggression under international law to attack another country for the purposes of regime change . "
according to the uk 's defense ministry , 179 british soldiers have died in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair , left , was a major supporter of then-president george w. bush 's war plan " legal but questionable " blair 's statements come ahead of his expected testimony before a public inquiry about britain 's role in the iraq war between 2001 and 2009 .
the " chilcot inquiry , " named after a longtime civil servant who is overseeing it , began in november , shortly after almost all of the country 's troops were withdrawn from iraq .
blair is expected to appear as a witness in january .
britain 's former un ambassador , jeremy greenstock , testified on nov .
27 that the us-led invasion in march 2003 was " legal but of questionable legitimacy , in that it did n't have the democratically observable backing of the great majority of member states . "
greenstock said the un security council had passed a resolution in late 2002 that gave iraq a " final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations , " but the council never passed a resolution authorizing the invasion .
sympathy , but no regrets the war has also been met with widespread opposition among the british public .
hundreds of thousands of people marched to protest in the run-up to the war in february 2003 .
" i sympathize with the people who were against it for perfectly good reasons and are against it now , but for me you know , in the end i had to take the decision , " blair said .
" there is no point in going into a situation of conflict and not understanding there is going to be a price paid . " svs / afp / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think that we are looking at a very significant reorganization of the church in ireland , " said dublin archbishop diarmuid martin after the meeting .
the meeting was called by the pope to discuss the widespread sexual abuse of children by clergymen in ireland , which was reportedly covered up by the church in ireland for decades .
in a statement released by the vatican , the pope said he shares the " outrage , betrayal and shame felt by so many of the faithful in ireland -lrb- over -rrb- these heinous crimes . "
decades of abuse the investigation , known as the murphy report , revealed that not only was sexual abuse of children by priests in ireland prevalent from 1975-2004 , but that the archdiocese of dublin was aware of the situation and maintained a policy of " do n't ask , do n't tell . "
in the vatican 's statement , it said the pope felt " profound regret at the actions of some members of the clergy who have betrayed their solemn promises to god , as well as the trust placed in them by the victims and their families , and by society at large . "
the pope is reportedly planning to issue a letter to irish catholics .
it would be the first time the pope had delivered an official document on the issue of child abuse within the church .
previously , the pope has issued apologies to victims of sexual abuse from clergy members in the united states , canada , and australia. mz / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" being the champions of the first half means nothing to me , " said jupp heynckes , coach of first place bayer leverkusen , after his team 's 2-2 draw against last place hertha berlin .
the single point from the draw left the door open for other teams in the bundesliga to close in on leverkusen 's top spot with one game to go before the winter break .
if being in first place at the end of the first half is irrelevant for heynckes , then there are two other teams in the league who would gladly celebrate the holidays from the top of the standings in leverkusen 's stead .

kevin kuranyi put the first goal in the net for schalke just after the second half got underway , and jan moravek , coming off the bench , took a pass from kuranyi and sealed the victory for schalke with the final goal in the 72nd minute .
the loss ended bremen 's undefeated streak of 23 matches and left them in fourth place , four points off the top and two shy of third place bayern .
bayern continues to win fresh off their convincing 4-0 thrashing of juventus that advanced them to the knock-out stage of the champions league , munich won again in the bundesliga with another feast of goals .

bad luck for hanover it may have been a memorable day for louis van gaal , but saturday 's game between borussia moenchengladbach and hanover 96 is one that hanover defender karim haggui would probably rather forget after putting two goals into his own net .
the first came after hanover florian fromlowitz slipped while attempting to clear the ball and kicked it into haggui 's leg , which deflected the ball back into the net .
the second was a back pass that missed fromlowitz and landed in the goal in stoppage time .

hanover put three goals in the correct goal as well , including two from didier ya konan , for a final score of 5-3 for moenchengladbach .

" being the champions of the first half means nothing to me , " said jupp heynckes , coach of first place bayer leverkusen , after his team 's 2-2 draw against last place hertha berlin .
the single point from the draw left the door open for other teams in the bundesliga to close in on leverkusen 's top spot with one game to go before the winter break .
if being in first place at the end of the first half is irrelevant for heynckes , then there are two other teams in the league who would gladly celebrate the holidays from the top of the standings in leverkusen 's stead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes is unconcerned with being crowned the first half champs those teams would be schalke and bayern munich , who both won their matches in the bundesliga to narrow the gap to heynckes ' team .
leverkusen leads the league with 32 points , just one ahead of second place schalke and two in front of munich .
battle for second goes to schalke despite playing with the home-field advantage , werder bremen was forced to concede second place and any hopes of leading the league before the break after losing 2-0 in schalke .
heading into the match , the two were tied on points , with schalke trailing on goal differential .
kevin kuranyi put the first goal in the net for schalke just after the second half got underway , and jan moravek , coming off the bench , took a pass from kuranyi and sealed the victory for schalke with the final goal in the 72nd minute .
the loss ended bremen 's undefeated streak of 23 matches and left them in fourth place , four points off the top and two shy of third place bayern .
bayern continues to win fresh off their convincing 4-0 thrashing of juventus that advanced them to the knock-out stage of the champions league , munich won again in the bundesliga with another feast of goals .
the final tally for bayern , playing on the road against bochum , was 5-1 .

bochum 's mergim marvic put the fifth goal on the board for bayern , misdirecting a clearance attempt into his own goal .
christian fuchs prevented a bayern shutout with a free kick in the 76th minute .
" it 's been a great week , the best since i have been in munich , " said a pleased munich coach louis van gaal .
" we are only two points off the top spot and that is very satisfying . "
bad luck for hanover it may have been a memorable day for louis van gaal , but saturday 's game between borussia moenchengladbach and hanover 96 is one that hanover defender karim haggui would probably rather forget after putting two goals into his own net .
the first came after hanover florian fromlowitz slipped while attempting to clear the ball and kicked it into haggui 's leg , which deflected the ball back into the net .
the second was a back pass that missed fromlowitz and landed in the goal in stoppage time .
huggui could n't help but grin over his terrible luck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanover scored three own goals incredibly , haggui was n't the only one to score at the wrong end for hanover .

moenchengladbach did manage to score two goals of their own , with rob friend scoring in the 22nd minute and michael bradley sending a free kick to the back of the net in the 68th .
hanover put three goals in the correct goal as well , including two from didier ya konan , for a final score of 5-3 for moenchengladbach .

instead of creating new concepts of nation building , leaders should read lawrence of arabia , argues a foreign policy expert . john hulsman is the author of the recently released " to begin the world over again : lawrence of arabia from damascus to baghdad . "
he is president of john hulsman enterprises , an international relations consulting firm , and a member of the council on foreign relations .
he is based in germany .
deutsche welle : in your new book you argue that instead of trying to develop new strategies for counterinsurgency and nation building in afghanistan , western leaders should read t. e. lawrence 's " 27 articles " written in 1917 during the so-called arab revolt as a guide for british officers .
what can we learn from lawrence of arabia that would help us today in afghanistan ?
john hulsman : the thing that was missing in barack obama 's speech was of course the most important piece from a lawrence point of view which is what are the locals going to do if you do these other things .
the problem with modern nation building is that it 's always about what 's going on in washington and other capitals , what the strategy should be for outsiders rather than what the strategy should be actually in these places that we are trying to nation build . lawrence realized that the key to success in the arab revolt was n't him , was n't the british , was n't the turks - it was the arabs .
could he make the arabs stakeholders in a settlement whereby he built a nation organically using the pieces there .
and so rather than create a nation where none had existed he worked with tribal leaders building something from the bottom up , seeing them as the key to the story , making them stakeholders in the assessment , realizing how their culture worked .
in other words it was entirely different than the failed efforts in bosnia , somalia , haiti , kosovo , afghanistan and iraq where we 've done this exactly the wrong way with the wrong philosophy .
if you are going to build a people you have to make sure you do n't liberate them from themselves .
probably the most famous advice given by t.e. lawrence in his " 27 articles " postulates " better the arabs do it tolerably than that you do it perfectly . "
has the international community heeded that advice so far in its mission in afghanistan ?
one of the things people say is " is n't it terrible that we 're working with these warlords . "
who do these people think has been running afghanistan for the last 1,000 years ?
not thomas jefferson and not james madison .
i wish that were the case , but it 's just not .
better that they be given control in terms of money - of course we should account for it because there is a lot of corruption in afghanistan - better they be given control over the building projects that they 're doing rather than we tell them what to build .
and of course they wo n't do it as well if we would do it by western standards .
but the key is n't how well they do it , but that they will be made stakeholders in the process so that they see that they are rebuilding their nation , they are building their country , not that we are imposing some sort of diktat from outside .
i think that is actually the key piece of advice from the " 27 articles , " because it encapsulates what 's wrong with what we are doing .
what we are doing should be mainly psychological and political , and then only secondarily military .
in the arab revolt in 1917 , lawrence figured out that if the arabs were on his side he could n't lose and if they were n't on his side that he could n't win . and that 's what 's missing from obama 's plan .
there was precious little mention of local politics and working with localities .
the problem with the afghan constitution that we imposed on the country after installing karzai is that it 's centralized , that we 've made kabul the center of the political decision making when in afghanistan the tribe and localism has been the center of the afghan experience of a 1,000 years . lawrence would understand this in a heartbeat .
and that 's why in a sense what 's happening in afghanistan is so tragic and why i was really desperately impelled to write this book .
it comes out of a practical experience of working in washington on iraq and afghanistan and then i read this guy and i immediately said that 's it , that 's what 's missing . bildunterschrift : isaf commander stanley mcchrystal is trying to work closer with the afghan people lawrence of arabia , as the name and the popular movie about him suggest , was famous for his knowledge of and closeness to the arabs that contributed to his success .
do the current military and civilian leaders in charge of the afghan mission know enough about the country and its people ?
no , i do n't think they do .
i give general mcchrystal real credit , because he is aware that this is an area where they are falling behind .
in iraq , one of the most important things that explained to me why we failed there was when i read at the time that of the 200 senior staffers that viceroy paul bremer brought in under george w. bush to look after iraq , only one had an advanced degree in anything relating to iraq or the middle east .
and lawrence would say you ca n't transform a society you do n't know anything about , that 's just common sense . i laud mcchrystal for realizing that something is missing , but intellectually these guys do n't know anything near what lawrence did .
lawrence had worked before the war in an archeological dig with the arabs in karkemish , he spoke their language , he knew their tribal structure , he knew their feuds , he knew who liked whom and why .
cultural knowledge is far more important than military knowledge if you are going to do anything successful on counterinsurgency and nation building .
of course lawrence of arabia is perhaps most well-known for his military achievements , i.e. the arab revolt , the battle of aqaba and the fall of damascus .
what military lessons can the isaf troops in afghanistan learn from lawrence ?
what they can learn is actually an old german saying and they could read their clausewitz again .
clausewitz got it right that military matters are only an extension of doing things politically . if we clear the taliban somehow through a miracle from afghanistan , which we of course ca n't do because they are locals and not some foreign outside force , but even if we could get rid of all the taliban by some miracle we still would n't have stability in afghanistan because there is n't anything political to build on .
that is the key .
despite his successes , lawrence of arabia 's grand vision of arab self-determination failed in the end when the british and the french decided to divide the middle east between them .
is n't that a stark reminder that in afghanistan , realpolitik ultimately might trump visionary politics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban have steadily gained ground in afghanistan yes it definitely could .
we need to go from bottom up rather than from top down .
the british and french went top down .
they said what matters most on the great power level .
the reason why it is better to start with the micro level and then go to the macro level is really old-fashioned burkean thinking .
if you get the stuff on the ground locally right you can then build something .
if we get the various tribal leaders to buy into our settlement , then you can go to the chinese , the russians , the indians and the pakistanis and say , we can promise you stability , but only if we all do n't intervene and meddle , including the united states .
going bottom up leads to that stability .
without that local component it wo n't work as was seen in the case of lawrence , that is absolutely right .

deutsche welle : in your new book you argue that instead of trying to develop new strategies for counterinsurgency and nation building in afghanistan , western leaders should read t. e. lawrence 's " 27 articles " written in 1917 during the so-called arab revolt as a guide for british officers .
what can we learn from lawrence of arabia that would help us today in afghanistan ?
john hulsman : the thing that was missing in barack obama 's speech was of course the most important piece from a lawrence point of view which is what are the locals going to do if you do these other things .
the problem with modern nation building is that it 's always about what 's going on in washington and other capitals , what the strategy should be for outsiders rather than what the strategy should be actually in these places that we are trying to nation build . lawrence realized that the key to success in the arab revolt was n't him , was n't the british , was n't the turks - it was the arabs .
could he make the arabs stakeholders in a settlement whereby he built a nation organically using the pieces there .
and so rather than create a nation where none had existed he worked with tribal leaders building something from the bottom up , seeing them as the key to the story , making them stakeholders in the assessment , realizing how their culture worked .
in other words it was entirely different than the failed efforts in bosnia , somalia , haiti , kosovo , afghanistan and iraq where we 've done this exactly the wrong way with the wrong philosophy .
if you are going to build a people you have to make sure you do n't liberate them from themselves .
probably the most famous advice given by t.e. lawrence in his " 27 articles " postulates " better the arabs do it tolerably than that you do it perfectly . "
has the international community heeded that advice so far in its mission in afghanistan ?
one of the things people say is " is n't it terrible that we 're working with these warlords . "
who do these people think has been running afghanistan for the last 1,000 years ?
not thomas jefferson and not james madison .
i wish that were the case , but it 's just not .
better that they be given control in terms of money - of course we should account for it because there is a lot of corruption in afghanistan - better they be given control over the building projects that they 're doing rather than we tell them what to build .
and of course they wo n't do it as well if we would do it by western standards .
but the key is n't how well they do it , but that they will be made stakeholders in the process so that they see that they are rebuilding their nation , they are building their country , not that we are imposing some sort of diktat from outside .
i think that is actually the key piece of advice from the " 27 articles , " because it encapsulates what 's wrong with what we are doing .
what we are doing should be mainly psychological and political , and then only secondarily military .
in the arab revolt in 1917 , lawrence figured out that if the arabs were on his side he could n't lose and if they were n't on his side that he could n't win . and that 's what 's missing from obama 's plan .
there was precious little mention of local politics and working with localities .
the problem with the afghan constitution that we imposed on the country after installing karzai is that it 's centralized , that we 've made kabul the center of the political decision making when in afghanistan the tribe and localism has been the center of the afghan experience of a 1,000 years . lawrence would understand this in a heartbeat .
and that 's why in a sense what 's happening in afghanistan is so tragic and why i was really desperately impelled to write this book .
it comes out of a practical experience of working in washington on iraq and afghanistan and then i read this guy and i immediately said that 's it , that 's what 's missing . bildunterschrift : isaf commander stanley mcchrystal is trying to work closer with the afghan people lawrence of arabia , as the name and the popular movie about him suggest , was famous for his knowledge of and closeness to the arabs that contributed to his success .
do the current military and civilian leaders in charge of the afghan mission know enough about the country and its people ?
no , i do n't think they do .
i give general mcchrystal real credit , because he is aware that this is an area where they are falling behind .
in iraq , one of the most important things that explained to me why we failed there was when i read at the time that of the 200 senior staffers that viceroy paul bremer brought in under george w. bush to look after iraq , only one had an advanced degree in anything relating to iraq or the middle east .
and lawrence would say you ca n't transform a society you do n't know anything about , that 's just common sense . i laud mcchrystal for realizing that something is missing , but intellectually these guys do n't know anything near what lawrence did .
lawrence had worked before the war in an archeological dig with the arabs in karkemish , he spoke their language , he knew their tribal structure , he knew their feuds , he knew who liked whom and why .
cultural knowledge is far more important than military knowledge if you are going to do anything successful on counterinsurgency and nation building .
of course lawrence of arabia is perhaps most well-known for his military achievements , i.e. the arab revolt , the battle of aqaba and the fall of damascus .
what military lessons can the isaf troops in afghanistan learn from lawrence ?
what they can learn is actually an old german saying and they could read their clausewitz again .
clausewitz got it right that military matters are only an extension of doing things politically . if we clear the taliban somehow through a miracle from afghanistan , which we of course ca n't do because they are locals and not some foreign outside force , but even if we could get rid of all the taliban by some miracle we still would n't have stability in afghanistan because there is n't anything political to build on .
that is the key .
despite his successes , lawrence of arabia 's grand vision of arab self-determination failed in the end when the british and the french decided to divide the middle east between them .
is n't that a stark reminder that in afghanistan , realpolitik ultimately might trump visionary politics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban have steadily gained ground in afghanistan yes it definitely could .
we need to go from bottom up rather than from top down .
the british and french went top down .
they said what matters most on the great power level .
the reason why it is better to start with the micro level and then go to the macro level is really old-fashioned burkean thinking .
if you get the stuff on the ground locally right you can then build something .
if we get the various tribal leaders to buy into our settlement , then you can go to the chinese , the russians , the indians and the pakistanis and say , we can promise you stability , but only if we all do n't intervene and meddle , including the united states .
going bottom up leads to that stability .
without that local component it wo n't work as was seen in the case of lawrence , that is absolutely right .

instead of creating new concepts of nation building , leaders should read lawrence of arabia , argues a foreign policy expert . john hulsman is the author of the recently released " to begin the world over again : lawrence of arabia from damascus to baghdad . "
he is president of john hulsman enterprises , an international relations consulting firm , and a member of the council on foreign relations .
he is based in germany .
deutsche welle : in your new book you argue that instead of trying to develop new strategies for counterinsurgency and nation building in afghanistan , western leaders should read t. e. lawrence 's " 27 articles " written in 1917 during the so-called arab revolt as a guide for british officers .
what can we learn from lawrence of arabia that would help us today in afghanistan ?
john hulsman : the thing that was missing in barack obama 's speech was of course the most important piece from a lawrence point of view which is what are the locals going to do if you do these other things .
the problem with modern nation building is that it 's always about what 's going on in washington and other capitals , what the strategy should be for outsiders rather than what the strategy should be actually in these places that we are trying to nation build . lawrence realized that the key to success in the arab revolt was n't him , was n't the british , was n't the turks - it was the arabs .
could he make the arabs stakeholders in a settlement whereby he built a nation organically using the pieces there .
and so rather than create a nation where none had existed he worked with tribal leaders building something from the bottom up , seeing them as the key to the story , making them stakeholders in the assessment , realizing how their culture worked .
in other words it was entirely different than the failed efforts in bosnia , somalia , haiti , kosovo , afghanistan and iraq where we 've done this exactly the wrong way with the wrong philosophy .
if you are going to build a people you have to make sure you do n't liberate them from themselves .
probably the most famous advice given by t.e. lawrence in his " 27 articles " postulates " better the arabs do it tolerably than that you do it perfectly . "
has the international community heeded that advice so far in its mission in afghanistan ?
one of the things people say is " is n't it terrible that we 're working with these warlords . "
who do these people think has been running afghanistan for the last 1,000 years ?
not thomas jefferson and not james madison .
i wish that were the case , but it 's just not .
better that they be given control in terms of money - of course we should account for it because there is a lot of corruption in afghanistan - better they be given control over the building projects that they 're doing rather than we tell them what to build .
and of course they wo n't do it as well if we would do it by western standards .
but the key is n't how well they do it , but that they will be made stakeholders in the process so that they see that they are rebuilding their nation , they are building their country , not that we are imposing some sort of diktat from outside .
i think that is actually the key piece of advice from the " 27 articles , " because it encapsulates what 's wrong with what we are doing .
what we are doing should be mainly psychological and political , and then only secondarily military .
in the arab revolt in 1917 , lawrence figured out that if the arabs were on his side he could n't lose and if they were n't on his side that he could n't win . and that 's what 's missing from obama 's plan .
there was precious little mention of local politics and working with localities .
the problem with the afghan constitution that we imposed on the country after installing karzai is that it 's centralized , that we 've made kabul the center of the political decision making when in afghanistan the tribe and localism has been the center of the afghan experience of a 1,000 years . lawrence would understand this in a heartbeat .
and that 's why in a sense what 's happening in afghanistan is so tragic and why i was really desperately impelled to write this book .
it comes out of a practical experience of working in washington on iraq and afghanistan and then i read this guy and i immediately said that 's it , that 's what 's missing . bildunterschrift : isaf commander stanley mcchrystal is trying to work closer with the afghan people lawrence of arabia , as the name and the popular movie about him suggest , was famous for his knowledge of and closeness to the arabs that contributed to his success .
do the current military and civilian leaders in charge of the afghan mission know enough about the country and its people ?
no , i do n't think they do .
i give general mcchrystal real credit , because he is aware that this is an area where they are falling behind .
in iraq , one of the most important things that explained to me why we failed there was when i read at the time that of the 200 senior staffers that viceroy paul bremer brought in under george w. bush to look after iraq , only one had an advanced degree in anything relating to iraq or the middle east .
and lawrence would say you ca n't transform a society you do n't know anything about , that 's just common sense . i laud mcchrystal for realizing that something is missing , but intellectually these guys do n't know anything near what lawrence did .
lawrence had worked before the war in an archeological dig with the arabs in karkemish , he spoke their language , he knew their tribal structure , he knew their feuds , he knew who liked whom and why .
cultural knowledge is far more important than military knowledge if you are going to do anything successful on counterinsurgency and nation building .
of course lawrence of arabia is perhaps most well-known for his military achievements , i.e. the arab revolt , the battle of aqaba and the fall of damascus .
what military lessons can the isaf troops in afghanistan learn from lawrence ?
what they can learn is actually an old german saying and they could read their clausewitz again .
clausewitz got it right that military matters are only an extension of doing things politically . if we clear the taliban somehow through a miracle from afghanistan , which we of course ca n't do because they are locals and not some foreign outside force , but even if we could get rid of all the taliban by some miracle we still would n't have stability in afghanistan because there is n't anything political to build on .
that is the key .
despite his successes , lawrence of arabia 's grand vision of arab self-determination failed in the end when the british and the french decided to divide the middle east between them .
is n't that a stark reminder that in afghanistan , realpolitik ultimately might trump visionary politics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban have steadily gained ground in afghanistan yes it definitely could .
we need to go from bottom up rather than from top down .
the british and french went top down .
they said what matters most on the great power level .
the reason why it is better to start with the micro level and then go to the macro level is really old-fashioned burkean thinking .
if you get the stuff on the ground locally right you can then build something .
if we get the various tribal leaders to buy into our settlement , then you can go to the chinese , the russians , the indians and the pakistanis and say , we can promise you stability , but only if we all do n't intervene and meddle , including the united states .
going bottom up leads to that stability .
without that local component it wo n't work as was seen in the case of lawrence , that is absolutely right .

instead of creating new concepts of nation building , leaders should read lawrence of arabia , argues a foreign policy expert . john hulsman is the author of the recently released " to begin the world over again : lawrence of arabia from damascus to baghdad . "
he is president of john hulsman enterprises , an international relations consulting firm , and a member of the council on foreign relations .
he is based in germany .
deutsche welle : in your new book you argue that instead of trying to develop new strategies for counterinsurgency and nation building in afghanistan , western leaders should read t. e. lawrence 's " 27 articles " written in 1917 during the so-called arab revolt as a guide for british officers .
what can we learn from lawrence of arabia that would help us today in afghanistan ?
john hulsman : the thing that was missing in barack obama 's speech was of course the most important piece from a lawrence point of view which is what are the locals going to do if you do these other things .
the problem with modern nation building is that it 's always about what 's going on in washington and other capitals , what the strategy should be for outsiders rather than what the strategy should be actually in these places that we are trying to nation build . lawrence realized that the key to success in the arab revolt was n't him , was n't the british , was n't the turks - it was the arabs .
could he make the arabs stakeholders in a settlement whereby he built a nation organically using the pieces there .
and so rather than create a nation where none had existed he worked with tribal leaders building something from the bottom up , seeing them as the key to the story , making them stakeholders in the assessment , realizing how their culture worked .
in other words it was entirely different than the failed efforts in bosnia , somalia , haiti , kosovo , afghanistan and iraq where we 've done this exactly the wrong way with the wrong philosophy .
if you are going to build a people you have to make sure you do n't liberate them from themselves .
probably the most famous advice given by t.e. lawrence in his " 27 articles " postulates " better the arabs do it tolerably than that you do it perfectly . "
has the international community heeded that advice so far in its mission in afghanistan ?
one of the things people say is " is n't it terrible that we 're working with these warlords . "
who do these people think has been running afghanistan for the last 1,000 years ?
not thomas jefferson and not james madison .
i wish that were the case , but it 's just not .
better that they be given control in terms of money - of course we should account for it because there is a lot of corruption in afghanistan - better they be given control over the building projects that they 're doing rather than we tell them what to build .
and of course they wo n't do it as well if we would do it by western standards .
but the key is n't how well they do it , but that they will be made stakeholders in the process so that they see that they are rebuilding their nation , they are building their country , not that we are imposing some sort of diktat from outside .
i think that is actually the key piece of advice from the " 27 articles , " because it encapsulates what 's wrong with what we are doing .
what we are doing should be mainly psychological and political , and then only secondarily military .
in the arab revolt in 1917 , lawrence figured out that if the arabs were on his side he could n't lose and if they were n't on his side that he could n't win . and that 's what 's missing from obama 's plan .
there was precious little mention of local politics and working with localities .
the problem with the afghan constitution that we imposed on the country after installing karzai is that it 's centralized , that we 've made kabul the center of the political decision making when in afghanistan the tribe and localism has been the center of the afghan experience of a 1,000 years . lawrence would understand this in a heartbeat .
and that 's why in a sense what 's happening in afghanistan is so tragic and why i was really desperately impelled to write this book .
it comes out of a practical experience of working in washington on iraq and afghanistan and then i read this guy and i immediately said that 's it , that 's what 's missing . bildunterschrift : isaf commander stanley mcchrystal is trying to work closer with the afghan people lawrence of arabia , as the name and the popular movie about him suggest , was famous for his knowledge of and closeness to the arabs that contributed to his success .
do the current military and civilian leaders in charge of the afghan mission know enough about the country and its people ?
no , i do n't think they do .
i give general mcchrystal real credit , because he is aware that this is an area where they are falling behind .
in iraq , one of the most important things that explained to me why we failed there was when i read at the time that of the 200 senior staffers that viceroy paul bremer brought in under george w. bush to look after iraq , only one had an advanced degree in anything relating to iraq or the middle east .
and lawrence would say you ca n't transform a society you do n't know anything about , that 's just common sense . i laud mcchrystal for realizing that something is missing , but intellectually these guys do n't know anything near what lawrence did .
lawrence had worked before the war in an archeological dig with the arabs in karkemish , he spoke their language , he knew their tribal structure , he knew their feuds , he knew who liked whom and why .
cultural knowledge is far more important than military knowledge if you are going to do anything successful on counterinsurgency and nation building .
of course lawrence of arabia is perhaps most well-known for his military achievements , i.e. the arab revolt , the battle of aqaba and the fall of damascus .
what military lessons can the isaf troops in afghanistan learn from lawrence ?
what they can learn is actually an old german saying and they could read their clausewitz again .
clausewitz got it right that military matters are only an extension of doing things politically . if we clear the taliban somehow through a miracle from afghanistan , which we of course ca n't do because they are locals and not some foreign outside force , but even if we could get rid of all the taliban by some miracle we still would n't have stability in afghanistan because there is n't anything political to build on .
that is the key .
despite his successes , lawrence of arabia 's grand vision of arab self-determination failed in the end when the british and the french decided to divide the middle east between them .
is n't that a stark reminder that in afghanistan , realpolitik ultimately might trump visionary politics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban have steadily gained ground in afghanistan yes it definitely could .
we need to go from bottom up rather than from top down .
the british and french went top down .
they said what matters most on the great power level .
the reason why it is better to start with the micro level and then go to the macro level is really old-fashioned burkean thinking .
if you get the stuff on the ground locally right you can then build something .
if we get the various tribal leaders to buy into our settlement , then you can go to the chinese , the russians , the indians and the pakistanis and say , we can promise you stability , but only if we all do n't intervene and meddle , including the united states .
going bottom up leads to that stability .
without that local component it wo n't work as was seen in the case of lawrence , that is absolutely right .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 12.12.2009 bulgaria considers taking guantanamo inmates großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has admitted he will not be able to close the prison as early as he had wished as part of the ongoing effort to close the guantanamo detention facility , the us has approached bulgaria to host some inmates .
the official bulgarian reaction so far has been noncommittal . bulgaria is in talks with the united states to host some of the inmates from guantanamo bay , the country 's interior minister said on saturday .
tsvetan tsvetanov confirmed his country was considering a request from the obama administration for an arrangement to host former detainees .
the government in sofia had received a letter addressed to prime minister boyko borisov , tsvetanov said in a national radio interview " we have not taken a decision yet , " he said .
" in any case , bulgaria 's participation would be small and we would not accept people who might pose a threat to our national security . "
the issue was due to be discussed before parliament , he added .
gesture of soldarity bulgarian prime minister borisov said he thinks taking an inmate would be a strong gesture of cooperation between europe and the united states .
" there is european and nato solidarity .
just like we seek support for everything from our euro-atlantic partners , president obama is now seeking this from all of us , " borisov told reporters .
" my personal opinion is that we should accept one person . "
his center-right administration , which replaced its socialist predecessor in july , is conscious of the balkan country 's image that was marred by the previous government 's failure to tame corruption and crime .
ongoing effort to close prison the united states embassy in sofia confirmed to afp late friday that : " us special envoy for guantanamo closure , daniel fried , visited bulgaria from december 2-3 and met with bulgarian officials . "
" while we do not comment on our bilateral discussions with foreign governments , we are encouraged by the continued willingness of many of our close friends and allies to consider resettling detainees and help our effort to close the guantanamo bay detention facility , " it added in a statement .
the us continues to seek out potential hosts for former guantanamo inmates as part of president barack obama 's initiative to shut down the controversial detention camp .
obama had promised to shut down the facility within a year of taking office but , because of diplomatic and political obstacles , there are still more than 200 inmates who need to be relocated .
earlier this month , the french foreign ministry said two detainees at guantanamo were sent to france and to hungary .

" i would still have thought it right to remove him .
obviously you would have had to use and deploy different arguments , about the nature of the threat , " blair told the broadcaster in comments released saturday .
the interview for the show " fern britton meets ... " airs on sunday .
blair said hussein and his government were " a threat to the region , " and that his decision was also influenced by hussein 's willingness to use chemical weapons on " his own people " and by the stalling tactics he used against weapons inspectors .
comments spark criticism but blair 's comments have attracted strong criticism . hans blix , the head of the un team that conducted weapons inspections in iraq before the war , said he thought blair used wmd as a " convenient justification " for war .
" saddam 's removal was a gain but it 's the only gain that i can see from the war , " blix said .
the former un weapons inspector said he believed blair 's statement had a " strong impression of a lack of sincerity . "
the peace activism group stop the war coalition called blair 's remarks " an admission of war crimes ...
it is an illegal act of aggression under international law to attack another country for the purposes of regime change . "
according to the uk 's defense ministry , 179 british soldiers have died in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair , left , was a major supporter of then-president george w. bush 's war plan " legal but questionable " blair 's statements come ahead of his expected testimony before a public inquiry about britain 's role in the iraq war between 2001 and 2009 .
the " chilcot inquiry , " named after a longtime civil servant who is overseeing it , began in november , shortly after almost all of the country 's troops were withdrawn from iraq .
blair is expected to appear as a witness in january .
britain 's former un ambassador , jeremy greenstock , testified on nov .
27 that the us-led invasion in march 2003 was " legal but of questionable legitimacy , in that it did n't have the democratically observable backing of the great majority of member states . "
greenstock said the un security council had passed a resolution in late 2002 that gave iraq a " final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations , " but the council never passed a resolution authorizing the invasion .
sympathy , but no regrets the war has also been met with widespread opposition among the british public .
hundreds of thousands of people marched to protest in the run-up to the war in february 2003 .
" i sympathize with the people who were against it for perfectly good reasons and are against it now , but for me you know , in the end i had to take the decision , " blair said .
" there is no point in going into a situation of conflict and not understanding there is going to be a price paid . " svs / afp / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" being the champions of the first half means nothing to me , " said jupp heynckes , coach of first place bayer leverkusen , after his team 's 2-2 draw against last place hertha berlin .
the single point from the draw left the door open for other teams in the bundesliga to close in on leverkusen 's top spot with one game to go before the winter break .
if being in first place at the end of the first half is irrelevant for heynckes , then there are two other teams in the league who would gladly celebrate the holidays from the top of the standings in leverkusen 's stead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes is unconcerned with being crowned the first half champs those teams would be schalke and bayern munich , who both won their matches in the bundesliga to narrow the gap to heynckes ' team .
leverkusen leads the league with 32 points , just one ahead of second place schalke and two in front of munich .
battle for second goes to schalke despite playing with the home-field advantage , werder bremen was forced to concede second place and any hopes of leading the league before the break after losing 2-0 in schalke .
heading into the match , the two were tied on points , with schalke trailing on goal differential .
kevin kuranyi put the first goal in the net for schalke just after the second half got underway , and jan moravek , coming off the bench , took a pass from kuranyi and sealed the victory for schalke with the final goal in the 72nd minute .
the loss ended bremen 's undefeated streak of 23 matches and left them in fourth place , four points off the top and two shy of third place bayern .
bayern continues to win fresh off their convincing 4-0 thrashing of juventus that advanced them to the knock-out stage of the champions league , munich won again in the bundesliga with another feast of goals .
the final tally for bayern , playing on the road against bochum , was 5-1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's ivica olic scored three goals agains bochum mario gomez got things started for the bavarians , scoring his fourth goal in four matches in the 23rd minute .
ivica olic added a pair of goals on either side of the break , and danijel prandic scored munich 's final goal ten minutes after half-time .
bochum 's mergim marvic put the fifth goal on the board for bayern , misdirecting a clearance attempt into his own goal .
christian fuchs prevented a bayern shutout with a free kick in the 76th minute .
" it 's been a great week , the best since i have been in munich , " said a pleased munich coach louis van gaal .
" we are only two points off the top spot and that is very satisfying . "
bad luck for hanover it may have been a memorable day for louis van gaal , but saturday 's game between borussia moenchengladbach and hanover 96 is one that hanover defender karim haggui would probably rather forget after putting two goals into his own net .
the first came after hanover florian fromlowitz slipped while attempting to clear the ball and kicked it into haggui 's leg , which deflected the ball back into the net .
the second was a back pass that missed fromlowitz and landed in the goal in stoppage time .
huggui could n't help but grin over his terrible luck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanover scored three own goals incredibly , haggui was n't the only one to score at the wrong end for hanover .
in the 58th minute , constant djakpa gave moenchengladbach their third early christmas present of the match .
moenchengladbach did manage to score two goals of their own , with rob friend scoring in the 22nd minute and michael bradley sending a free kick to the back of the net in the 68th .
hanover put three goals in the correct goal as well , including two from didier ya konan , for a final score of 5-3 for moenchengladbach .
" we saw a crazy , curious match , " said hanover coach andreas bergmann .
" it 's unbelievable we scored six goals and lost the match .
i do n't think we 'll forget this match any time soon . "
hamburg still contenders while schalke and bayern are closing in on leverkusen as the first half of the season comes to a close , hamburg has kept itself in a good position for when play resumes in january with a 4-0 road win over nuremburg .
eljero elia scored twice for the visiting side , and marcel jansen and tunay torun added 1 goal each .

the official bulgarian reaction so far has been noncommittal . bulgaria is in talks with the united states to host some of the inmates from guantanamo bay , the country 's interior minister said on saturday .
tsvetan tsvetanov confirmed his country was considering a request from the obama administration for an arrangement to host former detainees .
the government in sofia had received a letter addressed to prime minister boyko borisov , tsvetanov said in a national radio interview " we have not taken a decision yet , " he said .
" in any case , bulgaria 's participation would be small and we would not accept people who might pose a threat to our national security . "
the issue was due to be discussed before parliament , he added .
gesture of soldarity bulgarian prime minister borisov said he thinks taking an inmate would be a strong gesture of cooperation between europe and the united states .
" there is european and nato solidarity .
just like we seek support for everything from our euro-atlantic partners , president obama is now seeking this from all of us , " borisov told reporters .
" my personal opinion is that we should accept one person . "
his center-right administration , which replaced its socialist predecessor in july , is conscious of the balkan country 's image that was marred by the previous government 's failure to tame corruption and crime .
ongoing effort to close prison the united states embassy in sofia confirmed to afp late friday that : " us special envoy for guantanamo closure , daniel fried , visited bulgaria from december 2-3 and met with bulgarian officials . "
" while we do not comment on our bilateral discussions with foreign governments , we are encouraged by the continued willingness of many of our close friends and allies to consider resettling detainees and help our effort to close the guantanamo bay detention facility , " it added in a statement .
the us continues to seek out potential hosts for former guantanamo inmates as part of president barack obama 's initiative to shut down the controversial detention camp .
obama had promised to shut down the facility within a year of taking office but , because of diplomatic and political obstacles , there are still more than 200 inmates who need to be relocated .
earlier this month , the french foreign ministry said two detainees at guantanamo were sent to france and to hungary .
overall , however , the international response to us requests for inmate hosting has been muted. sjt / dpa / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead of creating new concepts of nation building , leaders should read lawrence of arabia , argues a foreign policy expert . john hulsman is the author of the recently released " to begin the world over again : lawrence of arabia from damascus to baghdad . "
he is president of john hulsman enterprises , an international relations consulting firm , and a member of the council on foreign relations .
he is based in germany .
deutsche welle : in your new book you argue that instead of trying to develop new strategies for counterinsurgency and nation building in afghanistan , western leaders should read t. e. lawrence 's " 27 articles " written in 1917 during the so-called arab revolt as a guide for british officers .
what can we learn from lawrence of arabia that would help us today in afghanistan ?
john hulsman : the thing that was missing in barack obama 's speech was of course the most important piece from a lawrence point of view which is what are the locals going to do if you do these other things .
the problem with modern nation building is that it 's always about what 's going on in washington and other capitals , what the strategy should be for outsiders rather than what the strategy should be actually in these places that we are trying to nation build . lawrence realized that the key to success in the arab revolt was n't him , was n't the british , was n't the turks - it was the arabs .
could he make the arabs stakeholders in a settlement whereby he built a nation organically using the pieces there .
and so rather than create a nation where none had existed he worked with tribal leaders building something from the bottom up , seeing them as the key to the story , making them stakeholders in the assessment , realizing how their culture worked .
in other words it was entirely different than the failed efforts in bosnia , somalia , haiti , kosovo , afghanistan and iraq where we 've done this exactly the wrong way with the wrong philosophy .
if you are going to build a people you have to make sure you do n't liberate them from themselves .
probably the most famous advice given by t.e. lawrence in his " 27 articles " postulates " better the arabs do it tolerably than that you do it perfectly . "
has the international community heeded that advice so far in its mission in afghanistan ?
one of the things people say is " is n't it terrible that we 're working with these warlords . "
who do these people think has been running afghanistan for the last 1,000 years ?
not thomas jefferson and not james madison .
i wish that were the case , but it 's just not .
better that they be given control in terms of money - of course we should account for it because there is a lot of corruption in afghanistan - better they be given control over the building projects that they 're doing rather than we tell them what to build .
and of course they wo n't do it as well if we would do it by western standards .
but the key is n't how well they do it , but that they will be made stakeholders in the process so that they see that they are rebuilding their nation , they are building their country , not that we are imposing some sort of diktat from outside .
i think that is actually the key piece of advice from the " 27 articles , " because it encapsulates what 's wrong with what we are doing .
what we are doing should be mainly psychological and political , and then only secondarily military .
in the arab revolt in 1917 , lawrence figured out that if the arabs were on his side he could n't lose and if they were n't on his side that he could n't win . and that 's what 's missing from obama 's plan .
there was precious little mention of local politics and working with localities .
the problem with the afghan constitution that we imposed on the country after installing karzai is that it 's centralized , that we 've made kabul the center of the political decision making when in afghanistan the tribe and localism has been the center of the afghan experience of a 1,000 years . lawrence would understand this in a heartbeat .
and that 's why in a sense what 's happening in afghanistan is so tragic and why i was really desperately impelled to write this book .
it comes out of a practical experience of working in washington on iraq and afghanistan and then i read this guy and i immediately said that 's it , that 's what 's missing . bildunterschrift : isaf commander stanley mcchrystal is trying to work closer with the afghan people lawrence of arabia , as the name and the popular movie about him suggest , was famous for his knowledge of and closeness to the arabs that contributed to his success .
do the current military and civilian leaders in charge of the afghan mission know enough about the country and its people ?
no , i do n't think they do .
i give general mcchrystal real credit , because he is aware that this is an area where they are falling behind .
in iraq , one of the most important things that explained to me why we failed there was when i read at the time that of the 200 senior staffers that viceroy paul bremer brought in under george w. bush to look after iraq , only one had an advanced degree in anything relating to iraq or the middle east .
and lawrence would say you ca n't transform a society you do n't know anything about , that 's just common sense . i laud mcchrystal for realizing that something is missing , but intellectually these guys do n't know anything near what lawrence did .
lawrence had worked before the war in an archeological dig with the arabs in karkemish , he spoke their language , he knew their tribal structure , he knew their feuds , he knew who liked whom and why .
cultural knowledge is far more important than military knowledge if you are going to do anything successful on counterinsurgency and nation building .
of course lawrence of arabia is perhaps most well-known for his military achievements , i.e. the arab revolt , the battle of aqaba and the fall of damascus .
what military lessons can the isaf troops in afghanistan learn from lawrence ?
what they can learn is actually an old german saying and they could read their clausewitz again .
clausewitz got it right that military matters are only an extension of doing things politically . if we clear the taliban somehow through a miracle from afghanistan , which we of course ca n't do because they are locals and not some foreign outside force , but even if we could get rid of all the taliban by some miracle we still would n't have stability in afghanistan because there is n't anything political to build on .
that is the key .
despite his successes , lawrence of arabia 's grand vision of arab self-determination failed in the end when the british and the french decided to divide the middle east between them .
is n't that a stark reminder that in afghanistan , realpolitik ultimately might trump visionary politics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban have steadily gained ground in afghanistan yes it definitely could .
we need to go from bottom up rather than from top down .
the british and french went top down .
they said what matters most on the great power level .
the reason why it is better to start with the micro level and then go to the macro level is really old-fashioned burkean thinking .
if you get the stuff on the ground locally right you can then build something .
if we get the various tribal leaders to buy into our settlement , then you can go to the chinese , the russians , the indians and the pakistanis and say , we can promise you stability , but only if we all do n't intervene and meddle , including the united states .
going bottom up leads to that stability .
without that local component it wo n't work as was seen in the case of lawrence , that is absolutely right .

not thomas jefferson and not james madison .
i wish that were the case , but it 's just not .
better that they be given control in terms of money - of course we should account for it because there is a lot of corruption in afghanistan - better they be given control over the building projects that they 're doing rather than we tell them what to build .
and of course they wo n't do it as well if we would do it by western standards .
but the key is n't how well they do it , but that they will be made stakeholders in the process so that they see that they are rebuilding their nation , they are building their country , not that we are imposing some sort of diktat from outside .
i think that is actually the key piece of advice from the " 27 articles , " because it encapsulates what 's wrong with what we are doing .
what we are doing should be mainly psychological and political , and then only secondarily military .
in the arab revolt in 1917 , lawrence figured out that if the arabs were on his side he could n't lose and if they were n't on his side that he could n't win . and that 's what 's missing from obama 's plan .
there was precious little mention of local politics and working with localities .
the problem with the afghan constitution that we imposed on the country after installing karzai is that it 's centralized , that we 've made kabul the center of the political decision making when in afghanistan the tribe and localism has been the center of the afghan experience of a 1,000 years . lawrence would understand this in a heartbeat .
and that 's why in a sense what 's happening in afghanistan is so tragic and why i was really desperately impelled to write this book .
it comes out of a practical experience of working in washington on iraq and afghanistan and then i read this guy and i immediately said that 's it , that 's what 's missing . bildunterschrift : isaf commander stanley mcchrystal is trying to work closer with the afghan people lawrence of arabia , as the name and the popular movie about him suggest , was famous for his knowledge of and closeness to the arabs that contributed to his success .
do the current military and civilian leaders in charge of the afghan mission know enough about the country and its people ?
no , i do n't think they do .
i give general mcchrystal real credit , because he is aware that this is an area where they are falling behind .
in iraq , one of the most important things that explained to me why we failed there was when i read at the time that of the 200 senior staffers that viceroy paul bremer brought in under george w. bush to look after iraq , only one had an advanced degree in anything relating to iraq or the middle east .
and lawrence would say you ca n't transform a society you do n't know anything about , that 's just common sense . i laud mcchrystal for realizing that something is missing , but intellectually these guys do n't know anything near what lawrence did .
lawrence had worked before the war in an archeological dig with the arabs in karkemish , he spoke their language , he knew their tribal structure , he knew their feuds , he knew who liked whom and why .
cultural knowledge is far more important than military knowledge if you are going to do anything successful on counterinsurgency and nation building .
of course lawrence of arabia is perhaps most well-known for his military achievements , i.e. the arab revolt , the battle of aqaba and the fall of damascus .
what military lessons can the isaf troops in afghanistan learn from lawrence ?
what they can learn is actually an old german saying and they could read their clausewitz again .
clausewitz got it right that military matters are only an extension of doing things politically . if we clear the taliban somehow through a miracle from afghanistan , which we of course ca n't do because they are locals and not some foreign outside force , but even if we could get rid of all the taliban by some miracle we still would n't have stability in afghanistan because there is n't anything political to build on .
that is the key .
despite his successes , lawrence of arabia 's grand vision of arab self-determination failed in the end when the british and the french decided to divide the middle east between them .
is n't that a stark reminder that in afghanistan , realpolitik ultimately might trump visionary politics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban have steadily gained ground in afghanistan yes it definitely could .
we need to go from bottom up rather than from top down .
the british and french went top down .
they said what matters most on the great power level .
the reason why it is better to start with the micro level and then go to the macro level is really old-fashioned burkean thinking .
if you get the stuff on the ground locally right you can then build something .
if we get the various tribal leaders to buy into our settlement , then you can go to the chinese , the russians , the indians and the pakistanis and say , we can promise you stability , but only if we all do n't intervene and meddle , including the united states .
going bottom up leads to that stability .
without that local component it wo n't work as was seen in the case of lawrence , that is absolutely right .

" i think that we are looking at a very significant reorganization of the church in ireland , " said dublin archbishop diarmuid martin after the meeting .
the meeting was called by the pope to discuss the widespread sexual abuse of children by clergymen in ireland , which was reportedly covered up by the church in ireland for decades .
in a statement released by the vatican , the pope said he shares the " outrage , betrayal and shame felt by so many of the faithful in ireland -lrb- over -rrb- these heinous crimes . "
decades of abuse the investigation , known as the murphy report , revealed that not only was sexual abuse of children by priests in ireland prevalent from 1975-2004 , but that the archdiocese of dublin was aware of the situation and maintained a policy of " do n't ask , do n't tell . "
in the vatican 's statement , it said the pope felt " profound regret at the actions of some members of the clergy who have betrayed their solemn promises to god , as well as the trust placed in them by the victims and their families , and by society at large . "
the pope is reportedly planning to issue a letter to irish catholics .
it would be the first time the pope had delivered an official document on the issue of child abuse within the church .
previously , the pope has issued apologies to victims of sexual abuse from clergy members in the united states , canada , and australia. mz / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

thousands took to the streets on saturday to urge leaders at un talks to agree on a deal to fight global warming . danish police say they have released nearly all of the 968 people detained during a climate rally which drew an estimated 40,000 people in the danish capital on saturday . law enforcement authorities said only 13 demonstrators were still in custody on sunday and of those , three are set to be arraigned on preliminary charges of fighting with the police . on saturday , the heart of the danish capital became a sea of blue as environmentalists and anti-capitalist demonstrators gathered in front of parliament at the start of a six-kilometer -lrb- four-mile -rrb- march that took them to the venue of the ongoing united nations climate summit . the protesters ' aim was to pressure united nations negotiators to take concrete action on climate change .
an estimated 40,000 people attended the march which was jointly organized by over 500 groups from 67 countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were scuffles in copenhagen as police detained hundreds for throwing bottles and smashing windows the procession wound its way from the folketing , the danish parliament , to the conference site , the massive bella center on the outskirts of the city center . demonstrators wore sky blue raincoats or carried blue umbrellas following a call by the environmental group , friends of the earth . activists slam rich nations nigerian nnimmo bassey , chairman of friends of the earth international , delivered a fiery speech to the crowd . " we can not allow carbon traders to damage the world .
there is no such thing as clean coal or clean crude .
leave the oil in the soil , leave the coal in the hole , " he said .
" to those who want to pollute at home and plant a tree somewhere we say no , " he added .
the demonstrations come as delegates to the un climate summit currently under way in copenhagen wrangle over a draft blueprint for a global pact .
at the un conference itself , developing nations on friday rejected as " insignificant " an eu pledge of 7.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- to help them tackle global warming .
the accord , which would see the money paid over three years , came a week before 110 heads of state and government convene in copenhagen for the finale of the 12-day conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel was criticized by greenpeace for not doing enough the head of greenpeace , kumi naidoo , strongly criticized german chancellor angela merkel for doing too little to help poorer nations cope with the effects of climate change .
" angela merkel can steer the rudder in copenhagen , " naidoo told the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday .
" but her behavior in the current debate is more than disappointing . " in an interview to be published in the sunday edition of the tabloid daily bild , merkel chided the developing countries for expecting richer ones to shoulder more of the burden . " we will not allow germany and the other european industrial states to lead the way on climate change , while others do nothing and then poach jobs from us , using the argument of lower costs for environmental protection , " merkel said . tight security the danish capital had resembled a military zone as authorities prepared for the arrival of activists from all over the world .
helicopters buzzed in the skies while armored police vans and canine squads patrolled the streets , amid fears that saturday 's march could be joined by violent far-left groups .
police also beefed up security at denmark 's land and sea borders to prevent troublemakers from entering the country .
shopkeepers and businesses were warned of a possible outbreak of violence .
those warnings unfortunately came to fruition to a small degree , as police arrested nearly a thousand people who had been throwing rocks and fireworks at police and smashing storefront windows .
on friday , authorities had rounded up 75 anti-capitalist demonstrators , 13 from germany , who were suspected of trying to set up an unauthorized blockade of companies they thought were emitting greenhouse gases .
protests worldwide protests and marches supporting a new climate covenant took place in more than 100 other countries as well , including greece , spain , and germany .
hours before the demonstration was due to kick off in copenhagen , protesters were out in force around asia , waving banners and chanting slogans urging action from the climate conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists march in sydney , australia as part of worldwide climate demonstrations in australia , organizers said around 50,000 people had taken to the streets nationwide , wearing sky-blue shoelaces in a call for a strong and binding agreement at the un talks .
" we want -lrb- world leaders -rrb- to bring home a treaty , we want them to stand by the pacific and our neighbors there .
and we want them to deliver and ensure a safe climate future for us all , " said james dannenberg , one of the organizers .
thousands of activists gathered in front of the parliament house in canberra , while 10,000-strong crowds marched through sydney , melbourne and other major cities .
protesters in hong kong – some dressed as pandas – and the philippines also took to the streets , while in indonesia , demonstrators rallied in front of the us embassy in the capital jakarta , calling for help for developing nations in reducing greenhouse gases. rb / svs / afp / reuters / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

vogel had been due to attend an islamic rally in the swiss capital berne on saturday against a ban on the construction of new minarets . switzerland voted to ban the building of new minarets in a referendum two weeks ago .
the surprise result provoked condemnation across the world . reports said vogel objected to not being allowed into switzerland , but that he cooperated with border guards and signed the order banning his entry into the country .
he then returned to germany .
a report on the swiss broadcasting corporation 's web site said that vogel was not allowed in as the federal migration office said his presence could pose a threat to public law and order .
vogel , a former professional boxer who converted to islam in 2001 , told swiss newspapers that he wanted to encourage muslims in switzerland to come out of their social isolation and help lessen mistrust , the site said .
over 57 percent of voters and all but four of the country 's 26 cantons approved the proposal to ban new minarets .
the right-wing swiss people 's party was the driving force behind the november 29 referendum .
the government said it would respect the people 's decision and would no longer permit construction of minarets .
however , it tried to assure the country 's 400,000-strong muslim community that the ban did not amount to “ a rejection of the muslim community , religion or culture . ” rb / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the official bulgarian reaction so far has been noncommittal . bulgaria is in talks with the united states to host some of the inmates from guantanamo bay , the country 's interior minister said on saturday .
tsvetan tsvetanov confirmed his country was considering a request from the obama administration for an arrangement to host former detainees .
the government in sofia had received a letter addressed to prime minister boyko borisov , tsvetanov said in a national radio interview " we have not taken a decision yet , " he said .
" in any case , bulgaria 's participation would be small and we would not accept people who might pose a threat to our national security . "
the issue was due to be discussed before parliament , he added .
gesture of soldarity bulgarian prime minister borisov said he thinks taking an inmate would be a strong gesture of cooperation between europe and the united states .
" there is european and nato solidarity .
just like we seek support for everything from our euro-atlantic partners , president obama is now seeking this from all of us , " borisov told reporters .
" my personal opinion is that we should accept one person . "
his center-right administration , which replaced its socialist predecessor in july , is conscious of the balkan country 's image that was marred by the previous government 's failure to tame corruption and crime .
ongoing effort to close prison the united states embassy in sofia confirmed to afp late friday that : " us special envoy for guantanamo closure , daniel fried , visited bulgaria from december 2-3 and met with bulgarian officials . "
" while we do not comment on our bilateral discussions with foreign governments , we are encouraged by the continued willingness of many of our close friends and allies to consider resettling detainees and help our effort to close the guantanamo bay detention facility , " it added in a statement .
the us continues to seek out potential hosts for former guantanamo inmates as part of president barack obama 's initiative to shut down the controversial detention camp .
obama had promised to shut down the facility within a year of taking office but , because of diplomatic and political obstacles , there are still more than 200 inmates who need to be relocated .
earlier this month , the french foreign ministry said two detainees at guantanamo were sent to france and to hungary .
overall , however , the international response to us requests for inmate hosting has been muted. sjt / dpa / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a report on the swiss broadcasting corporation 's web site said that vogel was not allowed in as the federal migration office said his presence could pose a threat to public law and order .

the turkish population of the island , which was divided in a 1974 turkish invasion after a greek-inspired coup , had voted in favor of the proposals .
service to go ahead papadopoulos 's family said it would go ahead with a planned commemoration service on saturday .
" this sacrilege , apart from the sadness and anger it has caused , can not in any way bury the politics and the legacy which tassos papadopoulos left behind , " read a family statement .
" wherever he is now , his voice will continue to be heard . "
papadopoulos was president from 2003 until 2008 , when he lost his bid at re-election to christofias , a former coalition partner in his center-left government .

the shipment was worth 16 million euros and reportedly part of a larger order dispatched by a swedish subsidiary of siemens to an iranian company .
in the other case , the magazine reported that the british navy stopped a chinese ship containing computers near dubai .
the shipment was intended for an iranian company .
the computers , which are used to control nuclear reactors , were thought to have been sent to china by siemens .
siemens would not give specific details about the shipments .
but the company told der spiegel that it did not break any german foreign trade laws .
“ our business activities in iran serve purely civil purposes and are in accord with international legal regulations , ” a siemens spokesperson told the magazine .
not the first controversy with iran the latest allegations come months after criticism that siemens , along with its finnish partner nokia , sold technology to iran that was thought to be capable of monitoring phone calls and e-mails .
this was in the wake of iran 's widespread post-election protests , where the iranian government was accused of censoring public dissent .

he added that the technology provided by nsn allows millions of iranians to communicate every day. mk / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i would still have thought it right to remove him .
obviously you would have had to use and deploy different arguments , about the nature of the threat , " blair told the broadcaster in comments released saturday .
the interview for the show " fern britton meets ... " airs on sunday .
blair said hussein and his government were " a threat to the region , " and that his decision was also influenced by hussein 's willingness to use chemical weapons on " his own people " and by the stalling tactics he used against weapons inspectors .
comments spark criticism but blair 's comments have attracted strong criticism . hans blix , the head of the un team that conducted weapons inspections in iraq before the war , said he thought blair used wmd as a " convenient justification " for war .
" saddam 's removal was a gain but it 's the only gain that i can see from the war , " blix said .
the former un weapons inspector said he believed blair 's statement had a " strong impression of a lack of sincerity . "

the official bulgarian reaction so far has been noncommittal . bulgaria is in talks with the united states to host some of the inmates from guantanamo bay , the country 's interior minister said on saturday .
tsvetan tsvetanov confirmed his country was considering a request from the obama administration for an arrangement to host former detainees .
the government in sofia had received a letter addressed to prime minister boyko borisov , tsvetanov said in a national radio interview " we have not taken a decision yet , " he said .
" in any case , bulgaria 's participation would be small and we would not accept people who might pose a threat to our national security . "
the issue was due to be discussed before parliament , he added .
gesture of soldarity bulgarian prime minister borisov said he thinks taking an inmate would be a strong gesture of cooperation between europe and the united states .
" there is european and nato solidarity .
just like we seek support for everything from our euro-atlantic partners , president obama is now seeking this from all of us , " borisov told reporters .
" my personal opinion is that we should accept one person . "
his center-right administration , which replaced its socialist predecessor in july , is conscious of the balkan country 's image that was marred by the previous government 's failure to tame corruption and crime .
ongoing effort to close prison the united states embassy in sofia confirmed to afp late friday that : " us special envoy for guantanamo closure , daniel fried , visited bulgaria from december 2-3 and met with bulgarian officials . "
" while we do not comment on our bilateral discussions with foreign governments , we are encouraged by the continued willingness of many of our close friends and allies to consider resettling detainees and help our effort to close the guantanamo bay detention facility , " it added in a statement .
the us continues to seek out potential hosts for former guantanamo inmates as part of president barack obama 's initiative to shut down the controversial detention camp .
obama had promised to shut down the facility within a year of taking office but , because of diplomatic and political obstacles , there are still more than 200 inmates who need to be relocated .
earlier this month , the french foreign ministry said two detainees at guantanamo were sent to france and to hungary .

the government in sofia had received a letter addressed to prime minister boyko borisov , tsvetanov said in a national radio interview " we have not taken a decision yet , " he said .
" in any case , bulgaria 's participation would be small and we would not accept people who might pose a threat to our national security . "
the issue was due to be discussed before parliament , he added .
gesture of soldarity bulgarian prime minister borisov said he thinks taking an inmate would be a strong gesture of cooperation between europe and the united states .
" there is european and nato solidarity .
just like we seek support for everything from our euro-atlantic partners , president obama is now seeking this from all of us , " borisov told reporters .
" my personal opinion is that we should accept one person . "
his center-right administration , which replaced its socialist predecessor in july , is conscious of the balkan country 's image that was marred by the previous government 's failure to tame corruption and crime .
ongoing effort to close prison the united states embassy in sofia confirmed to afp late friday that : " us special envoy for guantanamo closure , daniel fried , visited bulgaria from december 2-3 and met with bulgarian officials . "
" while we do not comment on our bilateral discussions with foreign governments , we are encouraged by the continued willingness of many of our close friends and allies to consider resettling detainees and help our effort to close the guantanamo bay detention facility , " it added in a statement .
the us continues to seek out potential hosts for former guantanamo inmates as part of president barack obama 's initiative to shut down the controversial detention camp .
obama had promised to shut down the facility within a year of taking office but , because of diplomatic and political obstacles , there are still more than 200 inmates who need to be relocated .
earlier this month , the french foreign ministry said two detainees at guantanamo were sent to france and to hungary .

vogel had been due to attend an islamic rally in the swiss capital berne on saturday against a ban on the construction of new minarets . switzerland voted to ban the building of new minarets in a referendum two weeks ago .
the surprise result provoked condemnation across the world . reports said vogel objected to not being allowed into switzerland , but that he cooperated with border guards and signed the order banning his entry into the country .
he then returned to germany .
a report on the swiss broadcasting corporation 's web site said that vogel was not allowed in as the federal migration office said his presence could pose a threat to public law and order .
vogel , a former professional boxer who converted to islam in 2001 , told swiss newspapers that he wanted to encourage muslims in switzerland to come out of their social isolation and help lessen mistrust , the site said .
over 57 percent of voters and all but four of the country 's 26 cantons approved the proposal to ban new minarets .
the right-wing swiss people 's party was the driving force behind the november 29 referendum .
the government said it would respect the people 's decision and would no longer permit construction of minarets .

" i would still have thought it right to remove him .
obviously you would have had to use and deploy different arguments , about the nature of the threat , " blair told the broadcaster in comments released saturday .
the interview for the show " fern britton meets ... " airs on sunday .
blair said hussein and his government were " a threat to the region , " and that his decision was also influenced by hussein 's willingness to use chemical weapons on " his own people " and by the stalling tactics he used against weapons inspectors .
comments spark criticism but blair 's comments have attracted strong criticism . hans blix , the head of the un team that conducted weapons inspections in iraq before the war , said he thought blair used wmd as a " convenient justification " for war .
" saddam 's removal was a gain but it 's the only gain that i can see from the war , " blix said .
the former un weapons inspector said he believed blair 's statement had a " strong impression of a lack of sincerity . "
the peace activism group stop the war coalition called blair 's remarks " an admission of war crimes ...
it is an illegal act of aggression under international law to attack another country for the purposes of regime change . "

the " chilcot inquiry , " named after a longtime civil servant who is overseeing it , began in november , shortly after almost all of the country 's troops were withdrawn from iraq .
blair is expected to appear as a witness in january .
britain 's former un ambassador , jeremy greenstock , testified on nov .

greenstock said the un security council had passed a resolution in late 2002 that gave iraq a " final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations , " but the council never passed a resolution authorizing the invasion .
sympathy , but no regrets the war has also been met with widespread opposition among the british public .
hundreds of thousands of people marched to protest in the run-up to the war in february 2003 .
" i sympathize with the people who were against it for perfectly good reasons and are against it now , but for me you know , in the end i had to take the decision , " blair said .

" i would still have thought it right to remove him .
obviously you would have had to use and deploy different arguments , about the nature of the threat , " blair told the broadcaster in comments released saturday .
the interview for the show " fern britton meets ... " airs on sunday .
blair said hussein and his government were " a threat to the region , " and that his decision was also influenced by hussein 's willingness to use chemical weapons on " his own people " and by the stalling tactics he used against weapons inspectors .
comments spark criticism but blair 's comments have attracted strong criticism . hans blix , the head of the un team that conducted weapons inspections in iraq before the war , said he thought blair used wmd as a " convenient justification " for war .
" saddam 's removal was a gain but it 's the only gain that i can see from the war , " blix said .
the former un weapons inspector said he believed blair 's statement had a " strong impression of a lack of sincerity . "
the peace activism group stop the war coalition called blair 's remarks " an admission of war crimes ...
it is an illegal act of aggression under international law to attack another country for the purposes of regime change . "
according to the uk 's defense ministry , 179 british soldiers have died in iraq .

in a statement released by the vatican , the pope said he shares the " outrage , betrayal and shame felt by so many of the faithful in ireland -lrb- over -rrb- these heinous crimes . "
decades of abuse the investigation , known as the murphy report , revealed that not only was sexual abuse of children by priests in ireland prevalent from 1975-2004 , but that the archdiocese of dublin was aware of the situation and maintained a policy of " do n't ask , do n't tell . "
in the vatican 's statement , it said the pope felt " profound regret at the actions of some members of the clergy who have betrayed their solemn promises to god , as well as the trust placed in them by the victims and their families , and by society at large . "
the pope is reportedly planning to issue a letter to irish catholics .
it would be the first time the pope had delivered an official document on the issue of child abuse within the church .
previously , the pope has issued apologies to victims of sexual abuse from clergy members in the united states , canada , and australia. mz / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the shipment was worth 16 million euros and reportedly part of a larger order dispatched by a swedish subsidiary of siemens to an iranian company .
in the other case , the magazine reported that the british navy stopped a chinese ship containing computers near dubai .
the shipment was intended for an iranian company .
the computers , which are used to control nuclear reactors , were thought to have been sent to china by siemens .
siemens would not give specific details about the shipments .
but the company told der spiegel that it did not break any german foreign trade laws .
“ our business activities in iran serve purely civil purposes and are in accord with international legal regulations , ” a siemens spokesperson told the magazine .
not the first controversy with iran the latest allegations come months after criticism that siemens , along with its finnish partner nokia , sold technology to iran that was thought to be capable of monitoring phone calls and e-mails .
this was in the wake of iran 's widespread post-election protests , where the iranian government was accused of censoring public dissent .

the single point from the draw left the door open for other teams in the bundesliga to close in on leverkusen 's top spot with one game to go before the winter break .
if being in first place at the end of the first half is irrelevant for heynckes , then there are two other teams in the league who would gladly celebrate the holidays from the top of the standings in leverkusen 's stead .

the official bulgarian reaction so far has been noncommittal . bulgaria is in talks with the united states to host some of the inmates from guantanamo bay , the country 's interior minister said on saturday .
tsvetan tsvetanov confirmed his country was considering a request from the obama administration for an arrangement to host former detainees .
the government in sofia had received a letter addressed to prime minister boyko borisov , tsvetanov said in a national radio interview " we have not taken a decision yet , " he said .
" in any case , bulgaria 's participation would be small and we would not accept people who might pose a threat to our national security . "
the issue was due to be discussed before parliament , he added .
gesture of soldarity bulgarian prime minister borisov said he thinks taking an inmate would be a strong gesture of cooperation between europe and the united states .
" there is european and nato solidarity .
just like we seek support for everything from our euro-atlantic partners , president obama is now seeking this from all of us , " borisov told reporters .
" my personal opinion is that we should accept one person . "
his center-right administration , which replaced its socialist predecessor in july , is conscious of the balkan country 's image that was marred by the previous government 's failure to tame corruption and crime .

the official bulgarian reaction so far has been noncommittal . bulgaria is in talks with the united states to host some of the inmates from guantanamo bay , the country 's interior minister said on saturday .
tsvetan tsvetanov confirmed his country was considering a request from the obama administration for an arrangement to host former detainees .
the government in sofia had received a letter addressed to prime minister boyko borisov , tsvetanov said in a national radio interview " we have not taken a decision yet , " he said .
" in any case , bulgaria 's participation would be small and we would not accept people who might pose a threat to our national security . "
the issue was due to be discussed before parliament , he added .
gesture of soldarity bulgarian prime minister borisov said he thinks taking an inmate would be a strong gesture of cooperation between europe and the united states .
" there is european and nato solidarity .
just like we seek support for everything from our euro-atlantic partners , president obama is now seeking this from all of us , " borisov told reporters .
" my personal opinion is that we should accept one person . "

vogel had been due to attend an islamic rally in the swiss capital berne on saturday against a ban on the construction of new minarets . switzerland voted to ban the building of new minarets in a referendum two weeks ago .
the surprise result provoked condemnation across the world . reports said vogel objected to not being allowed into switzerland , but that he cooperated with border guards and signed the order banning his entry into the country .
he then returned to germany .
a report on the swiss broadcasting corporation 's web site said that vogel was not allowed in as the federal migration office said his presence could pose a threat to public law and order .
vogel , a former professional boxer who converted to islam in 2001 , told swiss newspapers that he wanted to encourage muslims in switzerland to come out of their social isolation and help lessen mistrust , the site said .
over 57 percent of voters and all but four of the country 's 26 cantons approved the proposal to ban new minarets .
the right-wing swiss people 's party was the driving force behind the november 29 referendum .
the government said it would respect the people 's decision and would no longer permit construction of minarets .
however , it tried to assure the country 's 400,000-strong muslim community that the ban did not amount to “ a rejection of the muslim community , religion or culture . ” rb / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

thousands took to the streets on saturday to urge leaders at un talks to agree on a deal to fight global warming . danish police say they have released nearly all of the 968 people detained during a climate rally which drew an estimated 40,000 people in the danish capital on saturday . law enforcement authorities said only 13 demonstrators were still in custody on sunday and of those , three are set to be arraigned on preliminary charges of fighting with the police . on saturday , the heart of the danish capital became a sea of blue as environmentalists and anti-capitalist demonstrators gathered in front of parliament at the start of a six-kilometer -lrb- four-mile -rrb- march that took them to the venue of the ongoing united nations climate summit . the protesters ' aim was to pressure united nations negotiators to take concrete action on climate change .
an estimated 40,000 people attended the march which was jointly organized by over 500 groups from 67 countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were scuffles in copenhagen as police detained hundreds for throwing bottles and smashing windows the procession wound its way from the folketing , the danish parliament , to the conference site , the massive bella center on the outskirts of the city center . demonstrators wore sky blue raincoats or carried blue umbrellas following a call by the environmental group , friends of the earth . activists slam rich nations nigerian nnimmo bassey , chairman of friends of the earth international , delivered a fiery speech to the crowd . " we can not allow carbon traders to damage the world .
there is no such thing as clean coal or clean crude .
leave the oil in the soil , leave the coal in the hole , " he said .
" to those who want to pollute at home and plant a tree somewhere we say no , " he added .
the demonstrations come as delegates to the un climate summit currently under way in copenhagen wrangle over a draft blueprint for a global pact .
at the un conference itself , developing nations on friday rejected as " insignificant " an eu pledge of 7.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- to help them tackle global warming .
the accord , which would see the money paid over three years , came a week before 110 heads of state and government convene in copenhagen for the finale of the 12-day conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel was criticized by greenpeace for not doing enough the head of greenpeace , kumi naidoo , strongly criticized german chancellor angela merkel for doing too little to help poorer nations cope with the effects of climate change .
" angela merkel can steer the rudder in copenhagen , " naidoo told the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday .
" but her behavior in the current debate is more than disappointing . " in an interview to be published in the sunday edition of the tabloid daily bild , merkel chided the developing countries for expecting richer ones to shoulder more of the burden . " we will not allow germany and the other european industrial states to lead the way on climate change , while others do nothing and then poach jobs from us , using the argument of lower costs for environmental protection , " merkel said . tight security the danish capital had resembled a military zone as authorities prepared for the arrival of activists from all over the world .
helicopters buzzed in the skies while armored police vans and canine squads patrolled the streets , amid fears that saturday 's march could be joined by violent far-left groups .
police also beefed up security at denmark 's land and sea borders to prevent troublemakers from entering the country .
shopkeepers and businesses were warned of a possible outbreak of violence .
those warnings unfortunately came to fruition to a small degree , as police arrested nearly a thousand people who had been throwing rocks and fireworks at police and smashing storefront windows .
on friday , authorities had rounded up 75 anti-capitalist demonstrators , 13 from germany , who were suspected of trying to set up an unauthorized blockade of companies they thought were emitting greenhouse gases .
protests worldwide protests and marches supporting a new climate covenant took place in more than 100 other countries as well , including greece , spain , and germany .
hours before the demonstration was due to kick off in copenhagen , protesters were out in force around asia , waving banners and chanting slogans urging action from the climate conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists march in sydney , australia as part of worldwide climate demonstrations in australia , organizers said around 50,000 people had taken to the streets nationwide , wearing sky-blue shoelaces in a call for a strong and binding agreement at the un talks .
" we want -lrb- world leaders -rrb- to bring home a treaty , we want them to stand by the pacific and our neighbors there .
and we want them to deliver and ensure a safe climate future for us all , " said james dannenberg , one of the organizers .
thousands of activists gathered in front of the parliament house in canberra , while 10,000-strong crowds marched through sydney , melbourne and other major cities .
protesters in hong kong – some dressed as pandas – and the philippines also took to the streets , while in indonesia , demonstrators rallied in front of the us embassy in the capital jakarta , calling for help for developing nations in reducing greenhouse gases. rb / svs / afp / reuters / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an estimated 40,000 people attended the march which was jointly organized by over 500 groups from 67 countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were scuffles in copenhagen as police detained hundreds for throwing bottles and smashing windows the procession wound its way from the folketing , the danish parliament , to the conference site , the massive bella center on the outskirts of the city center . demonstrators wore sky blue raincoats or carried blue umbrellas following a call by the environmental group , friends of the earth . activists slam rich nations nigerian nnimmo bassey , chairman of friends of the earth international , delivered a fiery speech to the crowd . " we can not allow carbon traders to damage the world .
there is no such thing as clean coal or clean crude .
leave the oil in the soil , leave the coal in the hole , " he said .
" to those who want to pollute at home and plant a tree somewhere we say no , " he added .
the demonstrations come as delegates to the un climate summit currently under way in copenhagen wrangle over a draft blueprint for a global pact .
at the un conference itself , developing nations on friday rejected as " insignificant " an eu pledge of 7.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- to help them tackle global warming .
the accord , which would see the money paid over three years , came a week before 110 heads of state and government convene in copenhagen for the finale of the 12-day conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel was criticized by greenpeace for not doing enough the head of greenpeace , kumi naidoo , strongly criticized german chancellor angela merkel for doing too little to help poorer nations cope with the effects of climate change .
" angela merkel can steer the rudder in copenhagen , " naidoo told the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday .
" but her behavior in the current debate is more than disappointing . " in an interview to be published in the sunday edition of the tabloid daily bild , merkel chided the developing countries for expecting richer ones to shoulder more of the burden . " we will not allow germany and the other european industrial states to lead the way on climate change , while others do nothing and then poach jobs from us , using the argument of lower costs for environmental protection , " merkel said . tight security the danish capital had resembled a military zone as authorities prepared for the arrival of activists from all over the world .
helicopters buzzed in the skies while armored police vans and canine squads patrolled the streets , amid fears that saturday 's march could be joined by violent far-left groups .
police also beefed up security at denmark 's land and sea borders to prevent troublemakers from entering the country .
shopkeepers and businesses were warned of a possible outbreak of violence .
those warnings unfortunately came to fruition to a small degree , as police arrested nearly a thousand people who had been throwing rocks and fireworks at police and smashing storefront windows .
on friday , authorities had rounded up 75 anti-capitalist demonstrators , 13 from germany , who were suspected of trying to set up an unauthorized blockade of companies they thought were emitting greenhouse gases .
protests worldwide protests and marches supporting a new climate covenant took place in more than 100 other countries as well , including greece , spain , and germany .
hours before the demonstration was due to kick off in copenhagen , protesters were out in force around asia , waving banners and chanting slogans urging action from the climate conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists march in sydney , australia as part of worldwide climate demonstrations in australia , organizers said around 50,000 people had taken to the streets nationwide , wearing sky-blue shoelaces in a call for a strong and binding agreement at the un talks .
" we want -lrb- world leaders -rrb- to bring home a treaty , we want them to stand by the pacific and our neighbors there .
and we want them to deliver and ensure a safe climate future for us all , " said james dannenberg , one of the organizers .
thousands of activists gathered in front of the parliament house in canberra , while 10,000-strong crowds marched through sydney , melbourne and other major cities .
protesters in hong kong – some dressed as pandas – and the philippines also took to the streets , while in indonesia , demonstrators rallied in front of the us embassy in the capital jakarta , calling for help for developing nations in reducing greenhouse gases. rb / svs / afp / reuters / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a russian-norwegian consortium won a bid to develop iraq 's biggest oil field . russia 's oil company lukoil and the norwegian statoilhydro won a joint bid on saturday to develop iraq 's largest undeveloped oil field .

located in relatively calm and secure southern iraq , west qurna is expected to produce 1.8 billion barrels per day . lukoil and statoilhydro requested 1.15 dollars for each barrel extracted from the giant field .
lukoil will take 85 percent and statoilhydro 15 percent .

a russian-norwegian consortium won a bid to develop iraq 's biggest oil field . russia 's oil company lukoil and the norwegian statoilhydro won a joint bid on saturday to develop iraq 's largest undeveloped oil field .
on the second day of the largest iraqi postwar auction , the west qurna-2 reservoir , with 12.86 billion barrels of oil in reserves , went to the norwegian-russian consortium after the preceding day had seen auctions won by shell and china 's cnpc .
located in relatively calm and secure southern iraq , west qurna is expected to produce 1.8 billion barrels per day . lukoil and statoilhydro requested 1.15 dollars for each barrel extracted from the giant field .
lukoil will take 85 percent and statoilhydro 15 percent .
the deals reached so far in the two-day auction promise to increase iraq 's oil production by more than 4.2 million barrels per day .
underbidding the competition the prices to develop the largest fields bid by oil companies have been lower than many expected .
" they were astonishingly low figures .
but 2009 will be remembered as the year that iraq opened its door to the international oil companies and then shut it .
it 's 10 fields and that 's it , " a senior oil executive told reuters .
" so it 's strategic for the oil firms , either you are here or you are n't and this is the chance .
you have to think about it like that . "
oil fields were auctioned off to multiple firms , including a consortium led by the russian firm gazprom , france 's total and the malaysia 's petronas .
but some fields near baghdad and the northern city of mosul were still considered too risky for the international firms and received no bids during the auction .
security for the auction at the oil ministry in baghdad was extremely tight after a string of bombings targeted various government buildings around the city on tuesday .
iraq has the world 's third largest oil reserves at 115 billion barrels , behind saudi arabia and iran .

police have interviewed three , but are still short of clues . the body of former greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos was dug up by vandals on late thursday or early friday , say police .
three people helped with inquiries into the macabre theft , but no arrests were made , said a police spokesman .
there has been no claim of responsibility , no sign of the corpse and the vandals ' motives for stealing it remain unclear .
whoever took the body , just before the first anniversary of papadopoulos ' death on saturday , appears to have worked overnight through torrential rain .
a former bodyguard found earth beside the grave , along with an empty casket , when he visited the cemetery on the outskirts of nicosia to light a candle on friday morning .
act was ' sacrilege ' cypriot president demetris christofias appealed for calm from brussels , where he was attending the eu summit , but also voiced his outrage . " i am appealing to the public to remain calm in the light of this provocation .
i can not describe this act any other way , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tassos papadopoulos after being elected president " this is a sacrilege .
it is an immoral and condemnable act which is a blight to our culture and respect for our dead . "
papadopoulos died a year ago on saturday , aged 74 , and was celebrated by many greek cypriots for rejecting a united nations reunification plan for the island in 2004 .
the turkish population of the island , which was divided in a 1974 turkish invasion after a greek-inspired coup , had voted in favor of the proposals .
service to go ahead papadopoulos 's family said it would go ahead with a planned commemoration service on saturday .
" this sacrilege , apart from the sadness and anger it has caused , can not in any way bury the politics and the legacy which tassos papadopoulos left behind , " read a family statement .
" wherever he is now , his voice will continue to be heard . "
papadopoulos was president from 2003 until 2008 , when he lost his bid at re-election to christofias , a former coalition partner in his center-left government .
his rival has now relaunched reunification talks. rc / reuters / ap editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead of creating new concepts of nation building , leaders should read lawrence of arabia , argues a foreign policy expert . john hulsman is the author of the recently released " to begin the world over again : lawrence of arabia from damascus to baghdad . "
he is president of john hulsman enterprises , an international relations consulting firm , and a member of the council on foreign relations .
he is based in germany .
deutsche welle : in your new book you argue that instead of trying to develop new strategies for counterinsurgency and nation building in afghanistan , western leaders should read t. e. lawrence 's " 27 articles " written in 1917 during the so-called arab revolt as a guide for british officers .
what can we learn from lawrence of arabia that would help us today in afghanistan ?
john hulsman : the thing that was missing in barack obama 's speech was of course the most important piece from a lawrence point of view which is what are the locals going to do if you do these other things .
the problem with modern nation building is that it 's always about what 's going on in washington and other capitals , what the strategy should be for outsiders rather than what the strategy should be actually in these places that we are trying to nation build . lawrence realized that the key to success in the arab revolt was n't him , was n't the british , was n't the turks - it was the arabs .
could he make the arabs stakeholders in a settlement whereby he built a nation organically using the pieces there .
and so rather than create a nation where none had existed he worked with tribal leaders building something from the bottom up , seeing them as the key to the story , making them stakeholders in the assessment , realizing how their culture worked .
in other words it was entirely different than the failed efforts in bosnia , somalia , haiti , kosovo , afghanistan and iraq where we 've done this exactly the wrong way with the wrong philosophy .
if you are going to build a people you have to make sure you do n't liberate them from themselves .
probably the most famous advice given by t.e. lawrence in his " 27 articles " postulates " better the arabs do it tolerably than that you do it perfectly . "
has the international community heeded that advice so far in its mission in afghanistan ?
one of the things people say is " is n't it terrible that we 're working with these warlords . "
who do these people think has been running afghanistan for the last 1,000 years ?
not thomas jefferson and not james madison .
i wish that were the case , but it 's just not .
better that they be given control in terms of money - of course we should account for it because there is a lot of corruption in afghanistan - better they be given control over the building projects that they 're doing rather than we tell them what to build .
and of course they wo n't do it as well if we would do it by western standards .
but the key is n't how well they do it , but that they will be made stakeholders in the process so that they see that they are rebuilding their nation , they are building their country , not that we are imposing some sort of diktat from outside .
i think that is actually the key piece of advice from the " 27 articles , " because it encapsulates what 's wrong with what we are doing .
what we are doing should be mainly psychological and political , and then only secondarily military .
in the arab revolt in 1917 , lawrence figured out that if the arabs were on his side he could n't lose and if they were n't on his side that he could n't win . and that 's what 's missing from obama 's plan .
there was precious little mention of local politics and working with localities .
the problem with the afghan constitution that we imposed on the country after installing karzai is that it 's centralized , that we 've made kabul the center of the political decision making when in afghanistan the tribe and localism has been the center of the afghan experience of a 1,000 years . lawrence would understand this in a heartbeat .
and that 's why in a sense what 's happening in afghanistan is so tragic and why i was really desperately impelled to write this book .
it comes out of a practical experience of working in washington on iraq and afghanistan and then i read this guy and i immediately said that 's it , that 's what 's missing . bildunterschrift : isaf commander stanley mcchrystal is trying to work closer with the afghan people lawrence of arabia , as the name and the popular movie about him suggest , was famous for his knowledge of and closeness to the arabs that contributed to his success .
do the current military and civilian leaders in charge of the afghan mission know enough about the country and its people ?
no , i do n't think they do .
i give general mcchrystal real credit , because he is aware that this is an area where they are falling behind .
in iraq , one of the most important things that explained to me why we failed there was when i read at the time that of the 200 senior staffers that viceroy paul bremer brought in under george w. bush to look after iraq , only one had an advanced degree in anything relating to iraq or the middle east .
and lawrence would say you ca n't transform a society you do n't know anything about , that 's just common sense . i laud mcchrystal for realizing that something is missing , but intellectually these guys do n't know anything near what lawrence did .
lawrence had worked before the war in an archeological dig with the arabs in karkemish , he spoke their language , he knew their tribal structure , he knew their feuds , he knew who liked whom and why .
cultural knowledge is far more important than military knowledge if you are going to do anything successful on counterinsurgency and nation building .
of course lawrence of arabia is perhaps most well-known for his military achievements , i.e. the arab revolt , the battle of aqaba and the fall of damascus .
what military lessons can the isaf troops in afghanistan learn from lawrence ?
what they can learn is actually an old german saying and they could read their clausewitz again .
clausewitz got it right that military matters are only an extension of doing things politically . if we clear the taliban somehow through a miracle from afghanistan , which we of course ca n't do because they are locals and not some foreign outside force , but even if we could get rid of all the taliban by some miracle we still would n't have stability in afghanistan because there is n't anything political to build on .
that is the key .
despite his successes , lawrence of arabia 's grand vision of arab self-determination failed in the end when the british and the french decided to divide the middle east between them .
is n't that a stark reminder that in afghanistan , realpolitik ultimately might trump visionary politics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban have steadily gained ground in afghanistan yes it definitely could .
we need to go from bottom up rather than from top down .
the british and french went top down .
they said what matters most on the great power level .
the reason why it is better to start with the micro level and then go to the macro level is really old-fashioned burkean thinking .
if you get the stuff on the ground locally right you can then build something .
if we get the various tribal leaders to buy into our settlement , then you can go to the chinese , the russians , the indians and the pakistanis and say , we can promise you stability , but only if we all do n't intervene and meddle , including the united states .
going bottom up leads to that stability .
without that local component it wo n't work as was seen in the case of lawrence , that is absolutely right .

instead of creating new concepts of nation building , leaders should read lawrence of arabia , argues a foreign policy expert . john hulsman is the author of the recently released " to begin the world over again : lawrence of arabia from damascus to baghdad . "
he is president of john hulsman enterprises , an international relations consulting firm , and a member of the council on foreign relations .
he is based in germany .
deutsche welle : in your new book you argue that instead of trying to develop new strategies for counterinsurgency and nation building in afghanistan , western leaders should read t. e. lawrence 's " 27 articles " written in 1917 during the so-called arab revolt as a guide for british officers .
what can we learn from lawrence of arabia that would help us today in afghanistan ?
john hulsman : the thing that was missing in barack obama 's speech was of course the most important piece from a lawrence point of view which is what are the locals going to do if you do these other things .
the problem with modern nation building is that it 's always about what 's going on in washington and other capitals , what the strategy should be for outsiders rather than what the strategy should be actually in these places that we are trying to nation build . lawrence realized that the key to success in the arab revolt was n't him , was n't the british , was n't the turks - it was the arabs .
could he make the arabs stakeholders in a settlement whereby he built a nation organically using the pieces there .
and so rather than create a nation where none had existed he worked with tribal leaders building something from the bottom up , seeing them as the key to the story , making them stakeholders in the assessment , realizing how their culture worked .
in other words it was entirely different than the failed efforts in bosnia , somalia , haiti , kosovo , afghanistan and iraq where we 've done this exactly the wrong way with the wrong philosophy .
if you are going to build a people you have to make sure you do n't liberate them from themselves .
probably the most famous advice given by t.e. lawrence in his " 27 articles " postulates " better the arabs do it tolerably than that you do it perfectly . "
has the international community heeded that advice so far in its mission in afghanistan ?
one of the things people say is " is n't it terrible that we 're working with these warlords . "
who do these people think has been running afghanistan for the last 1,000 years ?
not thomas jefferson and not james madison .
i wish that were the case , but it 's just not .
better that they be given control in terms of money - of course we should account for it because there is a lot of corruption in afghanistan - better they be given control over the building projects that they 're doing rather than we tell them what to build .
and of course they wo n't do it as well if we would do it by western standards .
but the key is n't how well they do it , but that they will be made stakeholders in the process so that they see that they are rebuilding their nation , they are building their country , not that we are imposing some sort of diktat from outside .
i think that is actually the key piece of advice from the " 27 articles , " because it encapsulates what 's wrong with what we are doing .
what we are doing should be mainly psychological and political , and then only secondarily military .
in the arab revolt in 1917 , lawrence figured out that if the arabs were on his side he could n't lose and if they were n't on his side that he could n't win . and that 's what 's missing from obama 's plan .
there was precious little mention of local politics and working with localities .
the problem with the afghan constitution that we imposed on the country after installing karzai is that it 's centralized , that we 've made kabul the center of the political decision making when in afghanistan the tribe and localism has been the center of the afghan experience of a 1,000 years . lawrence would understand this in a heartbeat .
and that 's why in a sense what 's happening in afghanistan is so tragic and why i was really desperately impelled to write this book .
it comes out of a practical experience of working in washington on iraq and afghanistan and then i read this guy and i immediately said that 's it , that 's what 's missing . bildunterschrift : isaf commander stanley mcchrystal is trying to work closer with the afghan people lawrence of arabia , as the name and the popular movie about him suggest , was famous for his knowledge of and closeness to the arabs that contributed to his success .
do the current military and civilian leaders in charge of the afghan mission know enough about the country and its people ?
no , i do n't think they do .
i give general mcchrystal real credit , because he is aware that this is an area where they are falling behind .
in iraq , one of the most important things that explained to me why we failed there was when i read at the time that of the 200 senior staffers that viceroy paul bremer brought in under george w. bush to look after iraq , only one had an advanced degree in anything relating to iraq or the middle east .
and lawrence would say you ca n't transform a society you do n't know anything about , that 's just common sense . i laud mcchrystal for realizing that something is missing , but intellectually these guys do n't know anything near what lawrence did .
lawrence had worked before the war in an archeological dig with the arabs in karkemish , he spoke their language , he knew their tribal structure , he knew their feuds , he knew who liked whom and why .
cultural knowledge is far more important than military knowledge if you are going to do anything successful on counterinsurgency and nation building .
of course lawrence of arabia is perhaps most well-known for his military achievements , i.e. the arab revolt , the battle of aqaba and the fall of damascus .
what military lessons can the isaf troops in afghanistan learn from lawrence ?
what they can learn is actually an old german saying and they could read their clausewitz again .
clausewitz got it right that military matters are only an extension of doing things politically . if we clear the taliban somehow through a miracle from afghanistan , which we of course ca n't do because they are locals and not some foreign outside force , but even if we could get rid of all the taliban by some miracle we still would n't have stability in afghanistan because there is n't anything political to build on .
that is the key .
despite his successes , lawrence of arabia 's grand vision of arab self-determination failed in the end when the british and the french decided to divide the middle east between them .
is n't that a stark reminder that in afghanistan , realpolitik ultimately might trump visionary politics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban have steadily gained ground in afghanistan yes it definitely could .
we need to go from bottom up rather than from top down .
the british and french went top down .
they said what matters most on the great power level .
the reason why it is better to start with the micro level and then go to the macro level is really old-fashioned burkean thinking .
if you get the stuff on the ground locally right you can then build something .
if we get the various tribal leaders to buy into our settlement , then you can go to the chinese , the russians , the indians and the pakistanis and say , we can promise you stability , but only if we all do n't intervene and meddle , including the united states .
going bottom up leads to that stability .
without that local component it wo n't work as was seen in the case of lawrence , that is absolutely right .

instead of creating new concepts of nation building , leaders should read lawrence of arabia , argues a foreign policy expert . john hulsman is the author of the recently released " to begin the world over again : lawrence of arabia from damascus to baghdad . "
he is president of john hulsman enterprises , an international relations consulting firm , and a member of the council on foreign relations .
he is based in germany .
deutsche welle : in your new book you argue that instead of trying to develop new strategies for counterinsurgency and nation building in afghanistan , western leaders should read t. e. lawrence 's " 27 articles " written in 1917 during the so-called arab revolt as a guide for british officers .
what can we learn from lawrence of arabia that would help us today in afghanistan ?
john hulsman : the thing that was missing in barack obama 's speech was of course the most important piece from a lawrence point of view which is what are the locals going to do if you do these other things .
the problem with modern nation building is that it 's always about what 's going on in washington and other capitals , what the strategy should be for outsiders rather than what the strategy should be actually in these places that we are trying to nation build . lawrence realized that the key to success in the arab revolt was n't him , was n't the british , was n't the turks - it was the arabs .
could he make the arabs stakeholders in a settlement whereby he built a nation organically using the pieces there .
and so rather than create a nation where none had existed he worked with tribal leaders building something from the bottom up , seeing them as the key to the story , making them stakeholders in the assessment , realizing how their culture worked .
in other words it was entirely different than the failed efforts in bosnia , somalia , haiti , kosovo , afghanistan and iraq where we 've done this exactly the wrong way with the wrong philosophy .
if you are going to build a people you have to make sure you do n't liberate them from themselves .
probably the most famous advice given by t.e. lawrence in his " 27 articles " postulates " better the arabs do it tolerably than that you do it perfectly . "
has the international community heeded that advice so far in its mission in afghanistan ?
one of the things people say is " is n't it terrible that we 're working with these warlords . "
who do these people think has been running afghanistan for the last 1,000 years ?
not thomas jefferson and not james madison .
i wish that were the case , but it 's just not .
better that they be given control in terms of money - of course we should account for it because there is a lot of corruption in afghanistan - better they be given control over the building projects that they 're doing rather than we tell them what to build .
and of course they wo n't do it as well if we would do it by western standards .
but the key is n't how well they do it , but that they will be made stakeholders in the process so that they see that they are rebuilding their nation , they are building their country , not that we are imposing some sort of diktat from outside .
i think that is actually the key piece of advice from the " 27 articles , " because it encapsulates what 's wrong with what we are doing .
what we are doing should be mainly psychological and political , and then only secondarily military .
in the arab revolt in 1917 , lawrence figured out that if the arabs were on his side he could n't lose and if they were n't on his side that he could n't win . and that 's what 's missing from obama 's plan .
there was precious little mention of local politics and working with localities .
the problem with the afghan constitution that we imposed on the country after installing karzai is that it 's centralized , that we 've made kabul the center of the political decision making when in afghanistan the tribe and localism has been the center of the afghan experience of a 1,000 years . lawrence would understand this in a heartbeat .
and that 's why in a sense what 's happening in afghanistan is so tragic and why i was really desperately impelled to write this book .
it comes out of a practical experience of working in washington on iraq and afghanistan and then i read this guy and i immediately said that 's it , that 's what 's missing . bildunterschrift : isaf commander stanley mcchrystal is trying to work closer with the afghan people lawrence of arabia , as the name and the popular movie about him suggest , was famous for his knowledge of and closeness to the arabs that contributed to his success .
do the current military and civilian leaders in charge of the afghan mission know enough about the country and its people ?
no , i do n't think they do .
i give general mcchrystal real credit , because he is aware that this is an area where they are falling behind .
in iraq , one of the most important things that explained to me why we failed there was when i read at the time that of the 200 senior staffers that viceroy paul bremer brought in under george w. bush to look after iraq , only one had an advanced degree in anything relating to iraq or the middle east .
and lawrence would say you ca n't transform a society you do n't know anything about , that 's just common sense . i laud mcchrystal for realizing that something is missing , but intellectually these guys do n't know anything near what lawrence did .
lawrence had worked before the war in an archeological dig with the arabs in karkemish , he spoke their language , he knew their tribal structure , he knew their feuds , he knew who liked whom and why .
cultural knowledge is far more important than military knowledge if you are going to do anything successful on counterinsurgency and nation building .
of course lawrence of arabia is perhaps most well-known for his military achievements , i.e. the arab revolt , the battle of aqaba and the fall of damascus .
what military lessons can the isaf troops in afghanistan learn from lawrence ?
what they can learn is actually an old german saying and they could read their clausewitz again .
clausewitz got it right that military matters are only an extension of doing things politically . if we clear the taliban somehow through a miracle from afghanistan , which we of course ca n't do because they are locals and not some foreign outside force , but even if we could get rid of all the taliban by some miracle we still would n't have stability in afghanistan because there is n't anything political to build on .
that is the key .
despite his successes , lawrence of arabia 's grand vision of arab self-determination failed in the end when the british and the french decided to divide the middle east between them .
is n't that a stark reminder that in afghanistan , realpolitik ultimately might trump visionary politics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban have steadily gained ground in afghanistan yes it definitely could .
we need to go from bottom up rather than from top down .
the british and french went top down .
they said what matters most on the great power level .
the reason why it is better to start with the micro level and then go to the macro level is really old-fashioned burkean thinking .
if you get the stuff on the ground locally right you can then build something .
if we get the various tribal leaders to buy into our settlement , then you can go to the chinese , the russians , the indians and the pakistanis and say , we can promise you stability , but only if we all do n't intervene and meddle , including the united states .
going bottom up leads to that stability .
without that local component it wo n't work as was seen in the case of lawrence , that is absolutely right .
