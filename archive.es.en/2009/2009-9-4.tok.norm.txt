they also warned that the global crisis is n't over yet . finance ministers from the world 's 20 leading economies have set their sights on multi-million euro bonuses paid to some bankers .
the explosive issue of bank bonuses is being pushed by europe 's largest economies .
" our citizens are deeply shocked at the revival of reprehensible practices , despite taxpayers ' money having been mobilized to support the financial sector , " chancellor angela merkel , british prime minister gordon brown and french president nicolas sarkozy said in a letter released before the start of the meeting .
sarkozy has called for bankers ' bonuses to be capped , an idea which found broad support among european finance ministers earlier this week .
britain has been reluctant to support a cap , for fear it could cause bankers to move their business out of london .
but there is british support for tying bonuses to long-term performance .
the bonus practices are seen as helping create banking culture which critics say is too focused on risky , short-term gains .
one issue which germany is expected to push is for rules limiting the size of banks .
" no bank should be allowed to become so big that it can blackmail governments , " merkel said earlier this week .

" the biggest single risk to recovery is that people think the job is done .
there is a real risk that either governments or people generally think ' we have done that , we are on the path to recovery , ' " he said .
that feeling was echoed by merkel , brown and sarkozy , who warned that we have not yet seen the end of the global economic crisis .
they urged colleagues to continue exercising " prudence and caution " saying that a bumpy road lies ahead .
besides bankers ' bonuses , finance ministers will also discuss how to go forward with huge stimulus packages introduced at the beginning of the crisis .
while g-20 countries need to show their commitment to implementing stimulus plans , they also need to begin coordinating exit strategies once the crisis has ended , the three leaders said .
germany is concerned about inflation and has talked about the need to ease up on stimulus spending .
britain , which is still in a recession , has been more cautious .
" we must be careful to avoid laying the foundations of new global imbalances , " the leaders wrote .

a berlin musicologist says he knows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was she the one ?
everyone knows the melody to ludwig van beethoven 's piano piece " fuer elise , " but elise 's true identity has remained a mystery .
now a german musicologist says he 's discovered who she really was . from hard rock and jazz to cabaret and ring tones , " fuer elise " is the quintessential example of the popularization of classical music .
if beethoven got royalties , he 'd be a wealthy man . while everyone knows the melody to the short piano piece in a minor , few stop to wonder what was behind the intimate dedication . berlin musicologist klaus martin kopitz believes he has uncovered elise 's true identity - while he was n't even looking for it . " for years , i 've been working on a publication called ' beethoven in the eyes of his contemporaries , ' which includes all the reports from people who knew beethoven personally : journals , letters , poems , memoires , " said kopitz .
" certain women are mentioned , and one of them was elisabeth roeckel . " a close friendship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roeckel was an accomplished pianist elisabeth roeckel , born in 1793 , was the younger sister of singer joseph roeckel , who sang the role of florestan in beethoven 's opera " fidelio , " and became a good friend of the composer 's .
elise was also musically inclined - she played the piano and later became a singer . in her circle of friends , she was affectionately referred to as " elise . "
in the spring of 1810 , she went to bamberg to work in theater , with the hope of impressing none other than eta hoffman , who was the theater manager there at the time . according to kopitz , beethoven dedicated the a-minor piano piece " in the memory of " elise because they were separated when she relocated to bamberg .
since elisabeth roeckel was referred to in the dedication as " elise " and not the more formal " fraeulein roeckel , " she must have known beethoven well , said kopitz . indeed , their relationship was documented , as elise herself had written about it . beethoven the flirt " according to what she wrote , -lrb- their relationship -rrb- must have been close , " said kopitz .
in a letter , elise wrote about an evening with the composer , the famous guitarist mauro giuliani , and composer johann nepomuk hummel , who would later become her husband . " she wrote that beethoven , true to his frisky rhenish disposition , would n't stop teasing her and she did n't know what to do , " said the musicologist .
" he had pinched her arm out of sheer affection , " added kopitz . that elise chose hummel instead apparently did not mean the end of their friendship with beethoven .
several days before the composer 's death in march 1827 , elise visited him .
to remember her former admirer , she cut off a lock of his hair and accepted one of his quills as a present . how , then , could elisabeth roeckel have remained a mystery to musicologists over all the years ?
and why has the piece so often been attributed to therese malfatti , who beethoven proposed to in 1810 ? bildunterschrift : the beethoven archive and the composer 's birth house are located in bonn original manuscript has disappeared the beethoven scholar ludwig nohl -lrb- 1831-1885 -rrb- may be to blame .
when he discovered a draft of the work , he published it in 1865 with a dedication to therese .
nohl claimed to have seen the original manuscript , saying it had been discovered in therese 's estate , but it has never been found since . all that exists is an incomplete draft of the work , sketched on a sheet of paper beethoven had apparently used for brainstorming other works .
this has been dated to 1810 , around the time of beethoven 's engagement to therese malfatti . if , however , the a-minor melody was indeed composed for elise and not therese , it is not immediately apparent how and why the original manuscript could have made it into therese 's hands . kopitz admitted that his theory on this point is not particularly scientific : " therese malfatti comes to beethoven 's house and sees the " fuer elise " manuscript lying on top of his piano , so she asks ' who is this elise ?
do you still want to marry me ? '
at that point he was embarrassed that he had written the piece for elise when he really wanted to marry therese . " what does it matter ? the musicologist 's theory is currently in the process of being published and has not yet garnered widespread acceptance in the field . the director of the beethoven archive at the beethoven house in bonn , bernhard appel , said he was skeptical of kopitz ' hypothesis , though he emphasized that he could not make a conclusion until the report was available for detailed review . " elise was a very common name in vienna at the time , " said appel , so the dedication could have referred to any number of women .
he added that , to prove who elise really was , it would be essential to clarify what path the manuscript took before it disappeared . " would the music change if we knew who it was dedicated to ? " questioned appel .
for those who use it as their mobile phone ring tone , probably not . author : anastassia boutsko -lrb- cn -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the isaf troops then engaged the militants in a fire fight .
no civilians or german soldiers were injured in the battle .
the german statement said that nato planes then launched the attack in response to a call for air support . german military confirm air attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato troops and afghan policemen are still investigating the incident while the german military did not say whether the airstrike was responsible for the tanker blast , a german army spokesman in berlin admitted that the tankers exploded during the battle .
kunduz provincial governor mohammad omar later said that local residents claimed a military jet fired at the tanker , setting off the explosion . captain jon stock , press officer for isaf , later told the reuters news agency : " i can confirm that there was an airstrike last night or early this morning .
isaf 's target in the air raid was insurgents . "
however , he said he was unable to comment on the reports of the blast . in the wake of the attack , reports of casualties at the scene varied , with the german army saying that 56 militants were killed in the blast while the local authorities put the number of civilian dead at 45 .
a security officer who asked to remain anonymous told reporters that 200 people were killed and wounded in the explosion while residents put the number of casualties at 300 . european leaders begin to speak out following the attack , british prime minster gordon brown confirmed that he would not be backing down or changing the government 's afghanistan policy in any way . speaking at the international institute for strategic studies -lrb- iiss -rrb- in london , brown said that the stability of the volatile region , spanning the afghan-pakistan border , had a profound impact on the security of britain and the rest of the international community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister brown refuses to back down " we can not just walk away , " said brown , adding that the objectives in the conflict were " clear , justified , realistic and achievable . " brown announced that his government would provide an extra 20 million pounds -lrb- 23 million euros / $ 32 million -rrb- to help stabilization and security efforts in helmand province , where british troops are based .
british foreign secretary david miliband called for an " urgent investigation " into the nato airstrike . nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen responded by saying that there would be a thorough investigation into the incident . " the afghan people should know that we are clearly committed to protecting them and that we will fully and immediately investigate this incident , " rasmussen told reporters . increased instability in previously safe north bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local afghan people have begun burying their villagers killed in the nato airstrike the incident is likely to cause more outrage among an afghan population which has been increasingly angered and frustrated by the rising civilian death toll and the apparent failure of the western forces to stabilize the country . the airstrike also serves as another example of the disintegrating state of security in the previously safe northern provinces of the country and the overall doggedness and endurance of the taliban across the whole of afghanistan .
despite us military surges and diverted troop deployments from iraq , many areas of the country remain in a state of war . the presidential vote on august 20 , which was meant to be an indication of how far the country had come since the end of taliban rule eight years ago , was marred by violence and intimidation as counter-insurgents targeted polling stations as well as afghan soldiers and isaf troops . mrm / nda / dpa / ap / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we the government have done the homework , the contracts have been drawn up , and now the ball is in general motors ' court , " said economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg on german television on friday , sept .
4 .
but since berlin provided opel with a 1.5-billion-euro bridging loan to help the car group through its current upheaval , it has a decisive say in the outcome - and would like to see opel sold to magna international .
the german government has endorsed a bid from the austrian-canadian auto supplier to acquire a majority holding in opel by offering state-backed guarantees worth about 4.5 billion euros .
magna is leading a joint bid with state-owned russian bank sberbank and russia 's second-largest auto maker , gaz .
chancellor angela merkel told the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung on friday that magna 's concept was " the most viable and the most sustainable . "
but she also stressed that gm had to make its own mind up .
" we hope -lrb- its decision -rrb- will be in the interests of the company and its employees , " she said .
decision time the head of general motors in europe said magna was indeed well positioned to win the drawn-out battle to take over the us car maker 's opel division .
german daily die welt this week quoted carl-peter forster as saying that magna would " most likely " win the takeover bid since all the contracts and financing were in place for it to do so .
but he did not rule out the possibility that gm could keep control of opel and gm 's british-based vauxhall division instead .
speculation has been rife that gm is considering retaining control instead of hiving off a majority stake in the group , which includes the opel and british vauxhall brands .
quoting what it said was a gm official involved in the negotiations , the wall street journal reported that the auto group was prepared to pour more than 1 billion euros of its own money into restructuring opel .
according to german press agency dpa , gm has been considering the investment plan in the event that it fails to sell off the majority stake in opel to the groups bidding for control .
" should the negotiations with the bidders not reach a satisfactory result then alternatives must be examined , " said a source close to the negotiations .

rhj international earlier this week raised its offer for a 50.1-percent stake in what has been described as the new opel by 25 million to 300 million euros in cash .
the talks over opel come at a crucial time for german chancellor angela merkel , with parliamentary elections just weeks away .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical music -pipe- 04.09.2009 who was beethoven 's elise ?
a berlin musicologist says he knows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was she the one ?
everyone knows the melody to ludwig van beethoven 's piano piece " fuer elise , " but elise 's true identity has remained a mystery .
now a german musicologist says he 's discovered who she really was . from hard rock and jazz to cabaret and ring tones , " fuer elise " is the quintessential example of the popularization of classical music .
if beethoven got royalties , he 'd be a wealthy man . while everyone knows the melody to the short piano piece in a minor , few stop to wonder what was behind the intimate dedication . berlin musicologist klaus martin kopitz believes he has uncovered elise 's true identity - while he was n't even looking for it . " for years , i 've been working on a publication called ' beethoven in the eyes of his contemporaries , ' which includes all the reports from people who knew beethoven personally : journals , letters , poems , memoires , " said kopitz .
" certain women are mentioned , and one of them was elisabeth roeckel . " a close friendship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roeckel was an accomplished pianist elisabeth roeckel , born in 1793 , was the younger sister of singer joseph roeckel , who sang the role of florestan in beethoven 's opera " fidelio , " and became a good friend of the composer 's .
elise was also musically inclined - she played the piano and later became a singer . in her circle of friends , she was affectionately referred to as " elise . "
in the spring of 1810 , she went to bamberg to work in theater , with the hope of impressing none other than eta hoffman , who was the theater manager there at the time . according to kopitz , beethoven dedicated the a-minor piano piece " in the memory of " elise because they were separated when she relocated to bamberg .
since elisabeth roeckel was referred to in the dedication as " elise " and not the more formal " fraeulein roeckel , " she must have known beethoven well , said kopitz . indeed , their relationship was documented , as elise herself had written about it . beethoven the flirt " according to what she wrote , -lrb- their relationship -rrb- must have been close , " said kopitz .
in a letter , elise wrote about an evening with the composer , the famous guitarist mauro giuliani , and composer johann nepomuk hummel , who would later become her husband . " she wrote that beethoven , true to his frisky rhenish disposition , would n't stop teasing her and she did n't know what to do , " said the musicologist .
" he had pinched her arm out of sheer affection , " added kopitz . that elise chose hummel instead apparently did not mean the end of their friendship with beethoven .
several days before the composer 's death in march 1827 , elise visited him .
to remember her former admirer , she cut off a lock of his hair and accepted one of his quills as a present . how , then , could elisabeth roeckel have remained a mystery to musicologists over all the years ?
and why has the piece so often been attributed to therese malfatti , who beethoven proposed to in 1810 ? bildunterschrift : the beethoven archive and the composer 's birth house are located in bonn original manuscript has disappeared the beethoven scholar ludwig nohl -lrb- 1831-1885 -rrb- may be to blame .
when he discovered a draft of the work , he published it in 1865 with a dedication to therese .
nohl claimed to have seen the original manuscript , saying it had been discovered in therese 's estate , but it has never been found since . all that exists is an incomplete draft of the work , sketched on a sheet of paper beethoven had apparently used for brainstorming other works .
this has been dated to 1810 , around the time of beethoven 's engagement to therese malfatti . if , however , the a-minor melody was indeed composed for elise and not therese , it is not immediately apparent how and why the original manuscript could have made it into therese 's hands . kopitz admitted that his theory on this point is not particularly scientific : " therese malfatti comes to beethoven 's house and sees the " fuer elise " manuscript lying on top of his piano , so she asks ' who is this elise ?
do you still want to marry me ? '
at that point he was embarrassed that he had written the piece for elise when he really wanted to marry therese . " what does it matter ? the musicologist 's theory is currently in the process of being published and has not yet garnered widespread acceptance in the field . the director of the beethoven archive at the beethoven house in bonn , bernhard appel , said he was skeptical of kopitz ' hypothesis , though he emphasized that he could not make a conclusion until the report was available for detailed review . " elise was a very common name in vienna at the time , " said appel , so the dedication could have referred to any number of women .
he added that , to prove who elise really was , it would be essential to clarify what path the manuscript took before it disappeared . " would the music change if we knew who it was dedicated to ? " questioned appel .
for those who use it as their mobile phone ring tone , probably not . author : anastassia boutsko -lrb- cn -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor angela merkel told the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung on friday that magna 's concept was " the most viable and the most sustainable . "
but she also stressed that gm had to make its own mind up .
" we hope -lrb- its decision -rrb- will be in the interests of the company and its employees , " she said .
decision time the head of general motors in europe said magna was indeed well positioned to win the drawn-out battle to take over the us car maker 's opel division .
german daily die welt this week quoted carl-peter forster as saying that magna would " most likely " win the takeover bid since all the contracts and financing were in place for it to do so .
but he did not rule out the possibility that gm could keep control of opel and gm 's british-based vauxhall division instead .
speculation has been rife that gm is considering retaining control instead of hiving off a majority stake in the group , which includes the opel and british vauxhall brands .
quoting what it said was a gm official involved in the negotiations , the wall street journal reported that the auto group was prepared to pour more than 1 billion euros of its own money into restructuring opel .
according to german press agency dpa , gm has been considering the investment plan in the event that it fails to sell off the majority stake in opel to the groups bidding for control .
" should the negotiations with the bidders not reach a satisfactory result then alternatives must be examined , " said a source close to the negotiations .

rhj international earlier this week raised its offer for a 50.1-percent stake in what has been described as the new opel by 25 million to 300 million euros in cash .
the talks over opel come at a crucial time for german chancellor angela merkel , with parliamentary elections just weeks away .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 04.09.2009 polls show irish support sliding as lisbon treaty referendum approaches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish said " no " once , will they reject the treaty again ?
those hoping that a second irish referendum on the eu 's lisbon treaty will remove one of the largest stumbling blocks to the eu reform document ’ s ratification will be disappointed by news that has come out of dublin . polls and government ministers revealed a slump in support for the treaty among the populace of the recession-hit country ahead of the plebiscite next month .
public opinion was gauged by a face-to-face poll with 1,000 voters earlier this week conducted by the tns mrbi market research company .
the survey , published in the friday edition of the irish times , showed opposition to the treaty stood at 29 percent , increasing one point since the last poll in may , with support dropping eight points to 46 percent in the same time span .
the number of voters who remained undecided stood at 25 percent , an increase of seven points .
in an article which accompanied the results , the irish times ' political editor , stephen collins , wrote that " a striking feature of the latest poll is that most of those who have left the ' yes ' camp have moved into the ' do n't know ' category rather than shifting into the ' no ' camp . "
if the poll results were not gloomy enough , irish foreign minister michael martin admitted that the government was pessimistic about the october 2 referendum but that he believed that , while it would be difficult to secure ratification , he expected a slim vote in favor .
" i was never under any illusion but that it would be difficult to secure this but i do think we can do it , " he told national radio broadcaster rte .
" there is a very significant challenge ahead , it 's going to be a very tight campaign and it will demand all of the resources , conviction , politics and passion of all of those on the yes side . "
brussels concessions led to second referendum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : support is slipping for the lisbio treaty as the vote nears ireland is the only member of the 27-nation eu which is constitutionally bound to hold a referendum on the treaty , which is designed to overhaul of the eu 's foreign policy-making and internal decision-making in a greatly expanded bloc .
irish voters threw the ratification process into chaos last year when they rejected the treaty in the first referendum .
irish voters rejected the pact in a referendum held in june , partly out of concerns that their country would lose the right to nominate a commissioner to the eu 's executive and concerns that the treaty would contravene the country 's constitution on issues relating to the right to life , education and family policy .
the decision to launch a second referendum came after opinion polls showed voters would back it this time after dublin won concessions from brussels on key policy areas .
these included the guarantee that ireland 's traditional policy of neutrality would be maintained and that the lisbon treaty would not impinge on ireland 's right to set tax levels .
the eu also agreed that ireland would retain the right to an eu commissioner .
backlash could lead to potential " no " vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brian cowen 's government is also losing support despite the fact that the previous three opinion polls conducted this year showed solid support for the treaty , it is believed that the growing dissatisfaction with the irish government 's handling of the financial crisis has turned an anti-government backlash into a vote against ratification .
prime minister brian cowen 's government has itself been faced with some uncomfortable reading in recent polls .
the latest showed that 75 percent of voters would like to see him ousted , while support for the prime minister 's fianna fail party dropped to a record low of 17 percent .
for the lisbon treaty to come into force , it has to be ratified by all 27 eu states .
poland and the czech republic , currently led by euro-skeptic presidents , have said that they will wait for ireland 's vote before signing it into law .
if ireland were to vote “ no ” for a second time , observers say it could derail the treaty for good. nda / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

public opinion was gauged by a face-to-face poll with 1,000 voters earlier this week conducted by the tns mrbi market research company .
the survey , published in the friday edition of the irish times , showed opposition to the treaty stood at 29 percent , increasing one point since the last poll in may , with support dropping eight points to 46 percent in the same time span .
the number of voters who remained undecided stood at 25 percent , an increase of seven points .
in an article which accompanied the results , the irish times ' political editor , stephen collins , wrote that " a striking feature of the latest poll is that most of those who have left the ' yes ' camp have moved into the ' do n't know ' category rather than shifting into the ' no ' camp . "
if the poll results were not gloomy enough , irish foreign minister michael martin admitted that the government was pessimistic about the october 2 referendum but that he believed that , while it would be difficult to secure ratification , he expected a slim vote in favor .
" i was never under any illusion but that it would be difficult to secure this but i do think we can do it , " he told national radio broadcaster rte .
" there is a very significant challenge ahead , it 's going to be a very tight campaign and it will demand all of the resources , conviction , politics and passion of all of those on the yes side . "
brussels concessions led to second referendum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : support is slipping for the lisbio treaty as the vote nears ireland is the only member of the 27-nation eu which is constitutionally bound to hold a referendum on the treaty , which is designed to overhaul of the eu 's foreign policy-making and internal decision-making in a greatly expanded bloc .
irish voters threw the ratification process into chaos last year when they rejected the treaty in the first referendum .
irish voters rejected the pact in a referendum held in june , partly out of concerns that their country would lose the right to nominate a commissioner to the eu 's executive and concerns that the treaty would contravene the country 's constitution on issues relating to the right to life , education and family policy .
the decision to launch a second referendum came after opinion polls showed voters would back it this time after dublin won concessions from brussels on key policy areas .
these included the guarantee that ireland 's traditional policy of neutrality would be maintained and that the lisbon treaty would not impinge on ireland 's right to set tax levels .
the eu also agreed that ireland would retain the right to an eu commissioner .
backlash could lead to potential " no " vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brian cowen 's government is also losing support despite the fact that the previous three opinion polls conducted this year showed solid support for the treaty , it is believed that the growing dissatisfaction with the irish government 's handling of the financial crisis has turned an anti-government backlash into a vote against ratification .
prime minister brian cowen 's government has itself been faced with some uncomfortable reading in recent polls .
the latest showed that 75 percent of voters would like to see him ousted , while support for the prime minister 's fianna fail party dropped to a record low of 17 percent .
for the lisbon treaty to come into force , it has to be ratified by all 27 eu states .
poland and the czech republic , currently led by euro-skeptic presidents , have said that they will wait for ireland 's vote before signing it into law .
if ireland were to vote “ no ” for a second time , observers say it could derail the treaty for good. nda / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the isaf troops then engaged the militants in a fire fight .
no civilians or german soldiers were injured in the battle .
the german statement said that nato planes then launched the attack in response to a call for air support . german military confirm air attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato troops and afghan policemen are still investigating the incident while the german military did not say whether the airstrike was responsible for the tanker blast , a german army spokesman in berlin admitted that the tankers exploded during the battle .
kunduz provincial governor mohammad omar later said that local residents claimed a military jet fired at the tanker , setting off the explosion . captain jon stock , press officer for isaf , later told the reuters news agency : " i can confirm that there was an airstrike last night or early this morning .
isaf 's target in the air raid was insurgents . "
however , he said he was unable to comment on the reports of the blast . in the wake of the attack , reports of casualties at the scene varied , with the german army saying that 56 militants were killed in the blast while the local authorities put the number of civilian dead at 45 .
a security officer who asked to remain anonymous told reporters that 200 people were killed and wounded in the explosion while residents put the number of casualties at 300 . european leaders begin to speak out following the attack , british prime minster gordon brown confirmed that he would not be backing down or changing the government 's afghanistan policy in any way . speaking at the international institute for strategic studies -lrb- iiss -rrb- in london , brown said that the stability of the volatile region , spanning the afghan-pakistan border , had a profound impact on the security of britain and the rest of the international community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister brown refuses to back down " we can not just walk away , " said brown , adding that the objectives in the conflict were " clear , justified , realistic and achievable . " brown announced that his government would provide an extra 20 million pounds -lrb- 23 million euros / $ 32 million -rrb- to help stabilization and security efforts in helmand province , where british troops are based .
british foreign secretary david miliband called for an " urgent investigation " into the nato airstrike . nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen responded by saying that there would be a thorough investigation into the incident . " the afghan people should know that we are clearly committed to protecting them and that we will fully and immediately investigate this incident , " rasmussen told reporters . increased instability in previously safe north bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local afghan people have begun burying their villagers killed in the nato airstrike the incident is likely to cause more outrage among an afghan population which has been increasingly angered and frustrated by the rising civilian death toll and the apparent failure of the western forces to stabilize the country . the airstrike also serves as another example of the disintegrating state of security in the previously safe northern provinces of the country and the overall doggedness and endurance of the taliban across the whole of afghanistan .
despite us military surges and diverted troop deployments from iraq , many areas of the country remain in a state of war . the presidential vote on august 20 , which was meant to be an indication of how far the country had come since the end of taliban rule eight years ago , was marred by violence and intimidation as counter-insurgents targeted polling stations as well as afghan soldiers and isaf troops . mrm / nda / dpa / ap / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

everyone knows the melody to ludwig van beethoven 's piano piece " fuer elise , " but elise 's true identity has remained a mystery .
now a german musicologist says he 's discovered who she really was . from hard rock and jazz to cabaret and ring tones , " fuer elise " is the quintessential example of the popularization of classical music .
if beethoven got royalties , he 'd be a wealthy man . while everyone knows the melody to the short piano piece in a minor , few stop to wonder what was behind the intimate dedication . berlin musicologist klaus martin kopitz believes he has uncovered elise 's true identity - while he was n't even looking for it . " for years , i 've been working on a publication called ' beethoven in the eyes of his contemporaries , ' which includes all the reports from people who knew beethoven personally : journals , letters , poems , memoires , " said kopitz .
" certain women are mentioned , and one of them was elisabeth roeckel . " a close friendship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roeckel was an accomplished pianist elisabeth roeckel , born in 1793 , was the younger sister of singer joseph roeckel , who sang the role of florestan in beethoven 's opera " fidelio , " and became a good friend of the composer 's .
elise was also musically inclined - she played the piano and later became a singer . in her circle of friends , she was affectionately referred to as " elise . "
in the spring of 1810 , she went to bamberg to work in theater , with the hope of impressing none other than eta hoffman , who was the theater manager there at the time . according to kopitz , beethoven dedicated the a-minor piano piece " in the memory of " elise because they were separated when she relocated to bamberg .
since elisabeth roeckel was referred to in the dedication as " elise " and not the more formal " fraeulein roeckel , " she must have known beethoven well , said kopitz . indeed , their relationship was documented , as elise herself had written about it . beethoven the flirt " according to what she wrote , -lrb- their relationship -rrb- must have been close , " said kopitz .
in a letter , elise wrote about an evening with the composer , the famous guitarist mauro giuliani , and composer johann nepomuk hummel , who would later become her husband . " she wrote that beethoven , true to his frisky rhenish disposition , would n't stop teasing her and she did n't know what to do , " said the musicologist .
" he had pinched her arm out of sheer affection , " added kopitz . that elise chose hummel instead apparently did not mean the end of their friendship with beethoven .
several days before the composer 's death in march 1827 , elise visited him .
to remember her former admirer , she cut off a lock of his hair and accepted one of his quills as a present . how , then , could elisabeth roeckel have remained a mystery to musicologists over all the years ?

nohl claimed to have seen the original manuscript , saying it had been discovered in therese 's estate , but it has never been found since . all that exists is an incomplete draft of the work , sketched on a sheet of paper beethoven had apparently used for brainstorming other works .
this has been dated to 1810 , around the time of beethoven 's engagement to therese malfatti . if , however , the a-minor melody was indeed composed for elise and not therese , it is not immediately apparent how and why the original manuscript could have made it into therese 's hands . kopitz admitted that his theory on this point is not particularly scientific : " therese malfatti comes to beethoven 's house and sees the " fuer elise " manuscript lying on top of his piano , so she asks ' who is this elise ?

at that point he was embarrassed that he had written the piece for elise when he really wanted to marry therese .

a berlin musicologist says he knows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was she the one ?
everyone knows the melody to ludwig van beethoven 's piano piece " fuer elise , " but elise 's true identity has remained a mystery .
now a german musicologist says he 's discovered who she really was . from hard rock and jazz to cabaret and ring tones , " fuer elise " is the quintessential example of the popularization of classical music .
if beethoven got royalties , he 'd be a wealthy man . while everyone knows the melody to the short piano piece in a minor , few stop to wonder what was behind the intimate dedication . berlin musicologist klaus martin kopitz believes he has uncovered elise 's true identity - while he was n't even looking for it . " for years , i 've been working on a publication called ' beethoven in the eyes of his contemporaries , ' which includes all the reports from people who knew beethoven personally : journals , letters , poems , memoires , " said kopitz .
" certain women are mentioned , and one of them was elisabeth roeckel . " a close friendship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roeckel was an accomplished pianist elisabeth roeckel , born in 1793 , was the younger sister of singer joseph roeckel , who sang the role of florestan in beethoven 's opera " fidelio , " and became a good friend of the composer 's .
elise was also musically inclined - she played the piano and later became a singer . in her circle of friends , she was affectionately referred to as " elise . "
in the spring of 1810 , she went to bamberg to work in theater , with the hope of impressing none other than eta hoffman , who was the theater manager there at the time . according to kopitz , beethoven dedicated the a-minor piano piece " in the memory of " elise because they were separated when she relocated to bamberg .
since elisabeth roeckel was referred to in the dedication as " elise " and not the more formal " fraeulein roeckel , " she must have known beethoven well , said kopitz . indeed , their relationship was documented , as elise herself had written about it . beethoven the flirt " according to what she wrote , -lrb- their relationship -rrb- must have been close , " said kopitz .
in a letter , elise wrote about an evening with the composer , the famous guitarist mauro giuliani , and composer johann nepomuk hummel , who would later become her husband . " she wrote that beethoven , true to his frisky rhenish disposition , would n't stop teasing her and she did n't know what to do , " said the musicologist .
" he had pinched her arm out of sheer affection , " added kopitz . that elise chose hummel instead apparently did not mean the end of their friendship with beethoven .
several days before the composer 's death in march 1827 , elise visited him .
to remember her former admirer , she cut off a lock of his hair and accepted one of his quills as a present . how , then , could elisabeth roeckel have remained a mystery to musicologists over all the years ?
and why has the piece so often been attributed to therese malfatti , who beethoven proposed to in 1810 ? bildunterschrift : the beethoven archive and the composer 's birth house are located in bonn original manuscript has disappeared the beethoven scholar ludwig nohl -lrb- 1831-1885 -rrb- may be to blame .
when he discovered a draft of the work , he published it in 1865 with a dedication to therese .
nohl claimed to have seen the original manuscript , saying it had been discovered in therese 's estate , but it has never been found since . all that exists is an incomplete draft of the work , sketched on a sheet of paper beethoven had apparently used for brainstorming other works .
this has been dated to 1810 , around the time of beethoven 's engagement to therese malfatti . if , however , the a-minor melody was indeed composed for elise and not therese , it is not immediately apparent how and why the original manuscript could have made it into therese 's hands . kopitz admitted that his theory on this point is not particularly scientific : " therese malfatti comes to beethoven 's house and sees the " fuer elise " manuscript lying on top of his piano , so she asks ' who is this elise ?

they also warned that the global crisis is n't over yet . finance ministers from the world 's 20 leading economies have set their sights on multi-million euro bonuses paid to some bankers .
the explosive issue of bank bonuses is being pushed by europe 's largest economies .
" our citizens are deeply shocked at the revival of reprehensible practices , despite taxpayers ' money having been mobilized to support the financial sector , " chancellor angela merkel , british prime minister gordon brown and french president nicolas sarkozy said in a letter released before the start of the meeting .
sarkozy has called for bankers ' bonuses to be capped , an idea which found broad support among european finance ministers earlier this week .
britain has been reluctant to support a cap , for fear it could cause bankers to move their business out of london .
but there is british support for tying bonuses to long-term performance .
the bonus practices are seen as helping create banking culture which critics say is too focused on risky , short-term gains .

germany 's healthcare system has experienced all manner of nips and tucks since it was introduced over 125 years ago but it 's nonetheless showing its age .
the election might decide whether it gets a new lease of life . health insurance in germany has come a long way since sickness cover was introduced in 1883 under kaiser wilhelm i and his chancellor , otto von bismarck .
at the time , the average german worked a 60-hour week for a pittance , and sickness or accidents meant a very real threat of starvation .
public dissatisfaction was widespread , and it was against this backdrop that germany started on the long road towards the welfare state it still more or less is .
but these days , less is the operative word .
the social solidarity that has traditionally underpinned the german healthcare system is looking increasingly frail .
the basic problem is that german society is ageing , while its birth rate is sinking .
this means that healthcare costs are rising while fewer people are paying into the system .
many believe that what the only way to rejuvenate the system is to expose it to market forces .
rising costs but this would mark a dramatic break with bismarck 's original program .
made up of health insurance ; accident insurance ; disability insurance and an old-age retirement pension , it was based from the outset on the principle of solidarity : anyone who was employed was obliged to pay into the system and anyone who fell ill would receive medical care and a living allowance .
the cost was divided between employers and the employed - the employers contributing one third , the workers two thirds .
the ratio has changed since then - and so have many other aspects of the german health care service .
the last 20 years alone have seen 14 health care reforms .
while the initial health care restructuring was designed to provide more efficient and cost-effective healthcare services , the most recent reforms focus more on the structure of health insurance funds .
one way or another , most of them have been bad news for the public .
personal contributions to dental care and medicine costs have gone up , and patients now have to pay a mandatory 10 euros -lrb- $ 14 -rrb- per quarter whenever they go to the doctor .
dissatisfaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private patients are more lucrative so although the german healthcare services are still more or less all-inclusive , the cracks are showing .
and it 's not just patients who are noticing .
medical and healthcare professionals also say that conditions are worsening .
" everything has gone downhill , " says one nurse who works in a hospital in bonn .
" we all have less time , there are so many cuts , patients are dissatisfied , especially the elderly ones . "
doctors are also fed up , and say the system is flawed .
dorothee keltz is a gp with a practice in bonn .
she believes it 's important to take the time to talk to patients , and resents the fact that insurers prefer to see doctors using technical equipment .
" if one of my assistants does a cardiogram and we tell the patient what our findings are , we make three times as much money as we would if we spent 10 minutes talking to the patient , " she complains .
another problem is that doctors have had to start relying on private patients to stay afloat .
in germany , only 10 percent of the population has private , for-profit insurance - mostly civil servants and the self-employed .
increasingly , doctors are realizing that patients with state health cover are just not profitable enough .
patients as pawns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german health care is the fourth most expensive in the world still , the stakes are high .
the german health care system averages an annual turnover of over 250 billion euros , making it one of the nation 's most important economic sectors .
it 's also a sector in which powerful interest groups from trade associations to pharmaceuticals companies are constantly jockeying for position .
german health minister ulla schmidt is well aware of the tensions .
" no other sector has the financial clout of the health service , " she says .
" the amount of money spent on it exceeds the entire federal budget .
the sector 's players are dealing with huge funds with which they can buy opinion , influence opinion and promote their products .
in this respect it is patients themselves who are in the weakest position , even though they should be the strongest , because 70 million people in germany have state health cover . "
but the public is often little more than a pawn in a game , and has little insight into what is being spent and how .
the new cornerstone for funding german health care spending is the controversial and highly complex ' gesundheitsfond ' , the health care fund .
supposedly , it aims to simplify health benefits , provide more choices , increase transparency and create competition among providers .
but its detractors believe that it fails to address the increasingly urgent issue of funding the enormous german system .
it makes no mention of reducing cost , they say , but simply spreads the cost risk differently .
in the wake of the financial crisis , saving costs has become more important then ever .
after numerous attempts at resuscitation , the solidarity principle introduced by bismarck could well be on its last legs , and germany 's two leading parties can not agree whether it should be kept on life-support .
social democrat ulla schmidt , for one , would like to give it another chance and abolish private health insurance altogether .
but ultimately , today 's social and economic forces are nudging germany more in the direction of a healthcare system built on individual responsibility .
the issue will certainly be on voters ' minds when they go to the polls this month .

and its coming to a screen near you on saturday . up until just two short decades ago , berlin was split down the middle by a great , dirty wall .
it is not a long chapter in history , yet the city has undergone such monumental change since reunification that the producers felt not only berliners should be party to the party .
hence the project .
the brainchild of producer thomas kufus and director volker heise , the documentary will run for 24 hours straight starting at 6am cet on saturday . that is exactly one year to the day since it was shot . early on the morning of sept .
5 , 2008 , 80 camera teams hit the streets of berlin and spent the subsequent 24 hours collecting footage to depict the myriad lives and fates played out day by day in the german capital .
the end result brings together the destinies of 20 main protagonists and 50 secondary characters and takes viewers into the realms - public and private - of a refuse worker , french journalist , poet , drag queen and drug addict .
there are also sequences with more high profile berlin figures , including the mayor of the city klaus wowereit , conductor daniel barenboim and the editor of the mass-circulation bild newspaper kai diekmann .
exploration of diversity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's left of the berlin wall volker heise said the film was a way to find out how people live in a city of such diversity .
" how do people educate their children ?
what television programs do they watch ?
what do they eat ? " he asked in material outlining the project .
work first began on the 2.8-million-euro -lrb- $ 4-million -rrb- film some three years ago .
besides the protagonists selected to feature in the tele-visual extravaganza , berliners were invited to send in their own contributions .
some of these have made it into the final product .
so , too , has the city itself .
there are multiple shots of the television tower at alexanderplatz , the river spree and other landmarks .
but viewers will also catch glimpses of the smaller spots that make berlin the unique city it is .
in essence , the makers have tried to leave no stone unturned in their portrayal of this 21st-century metropolis .
from the bedroom to the sausage stand , the courtroom to the chancellery , they have set out to capture life as it happens .
and as the introduction is at pains to point out , it is just a normal day : " nothing special is expected to happen .
people will get up and go to work , they will love and hate one another , they will be born and they will die . "
the show begins at 6am central european time and can be seen on arte and berlin public broadcaster , rbb .
viewers outside germany can pick up the live stream at www.24berlin.tv.

a berlin musicologist says he knows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was she the one ?
everyone knows the melody to ludwig van beethoven 's piano piece " fuer elise , " but elise 's true identity has remained a mystery .
now a german musicologist says he 's discovered who she really was . from hard rock and jazz to cabaret and ring tones , " fuer elise " is the quintessential example of the popularization of classical music .
if beethoven got royalties , he 'd be a wealthy man . while everyone knows the melody to the short piano piece in a minor , few stop to wonder what was behind the intimate dedication . berlin musicologist klaus martin kopitz believes he has uncovered elise 's true identity - while he was n't even looking for it . " for years , i 've been working on a publication called ' beethoven in the eyes of his contemporaries , ' which includes all the reports from people who knew beethoven personally : journals , letters , poems , memoires , " said kopitz .
" certain women are mentioned , and one of them was elisabeth roeckel . " a close friendship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roeckel was an accomplished pianist elisabeth roeckel , born in 1793 , was the younger sister of singer joseph roeckel , who sang the role of florestan in beethoven 's opera " fidelio , " and became a good friend of the composer 's .
elise was also musically inclined - she played the piano and later became a singer . in her circle of friends , she was affectionately referred to as " elise . "
in the spring of 1810 , she went to bamberg to work in theater , with the hope of impressing none other than eta hoffman , who was the theater manager there at the time . according to kopitz , beethoven dedicated the a-minor piano piece " in the memory of " elise because they were separated when she relocated to bamberg .
since elisabeth roeckel was referred to in the dedication as " elise " and not the more formal " fraeulein roeckel , " she must have known beethoven well , said kopitz . indeed , their relationship was documented , as elise herself had written about it . beethoven the flirt " according to what she wrote , -lrb- their relationship -rrb- must have been close , " said kopitz .
in a letter , elise wrote about an evening with the composer , the famous guitarist mauro giuliani , and composer johann nepomuk hummel , who would later become her husband . " she wrote that beethoven , true to his frisky rhenish disposition , would n't stop teasing her and she did n't know what to do , " said the musicologist .
" he had pinched her arm out of sheer affection , " added kopitz . that elise chose hummel instead apparently did not mean the end of their friendship with beethoven .
several days before the composer 's death in march 1827 , elise visited him .
to remember her former admirer , she cut off a lock of his hair and accepted one of his quills as a present . how , then , could elisabeth roeckel have remained a mystery to musicologists over all the years ?
and why has the piece so often been attributed to therese malfatti , who beethoven proposed to in 1810 ? bildunterschrift : the beethoven archive and the composer 's birth house are located in bonn original manuscript has disappeared the beethoven scholar ludwig nohl -lrb- 1831-1885 -rrb- may be to blame .
when he discovered a draft of the work , he published it in 1865 with a dedication to therese .
nohl claimed to have seen the original manuscript , saying it had been discovered in therese 's estate , but it has never been found since . all that exists is an incomplete draft of the work , sketched on a sheet of paper beethoven had apparently used for brainstorming other works .
this has been dated to 1810 , around the time of beethoven 's engagement to therese malfatti . if , however , the a-minor melody was indeed composed for elise and not therese , it is not immediately apparent how and why the original manuscript could have made it into therese 's hands . kopitz admitted that his theory on this point is not particularly scientific : " therese malfatti comes to beethoven 's house and sees the " fuer elise " manuscript lying on top of his piano , so she asks ' who is this elise ?
do you still want to marry me ? '
at that point he was embarrassed that he had written the piece for elise when he really wanted to marry therese . " what does it matter ? the musicologist 's theory is currently in the process of being published and has not yet garnered widespread acceptance in the field . the director of the beethoven archive at the beethoven house in bonn , bernhard appel , said he was skeptical of kopitz ' hypothesis , though he emphasized that he could not make a conclusion until the report was available for detailed review . " elise was a very common name in vienna at the time , " said appel , so the dedication could have referred to any number of women .
he added that , to prove who elise really was , it would be essential to clarify what path the manuscript took before it disappeared . " would the music change if we knew who it was dedicated to ? " questioned appel .
for those who use it as their mobile phone ring tone , probably not . author : anastassia boutsko -lrb- cn -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and its coming to a screen near you on saturday . up until just two short decades ago , berlin was split down the middle by a great , dirty wall .
it is not a long chapter in history , yet the city has undergone such monumental change since reunification that the producers felt not only berliners should be party to the party .
hence the project .
the brainchild of producer thomas kufus and director volker heise , the documentary will run for 24 hours straight starting at 6am cet on saturday . that is exactly one year to the day since it was shot . early on the morning of sept .
5 , 2008 , 80 camera teams hit the streets of berlin and spent the subsequent 24 hours collecting footage to depict the myriad lives and fates played out day by day in the german capital .
the end result brings together the destinies of 20 main protagonists and 50 secondary characters and takes viewers into the realms - public and private - of a refuse worker , french journalist , poet , drag queen and drug addict .
there are also sequences with more high profile berlin figures , including the mayor of the city klaus wowereit , conductor daniel barenboim and the editor of the mass-circulation bild newspaper kai diekmann .
exploration of diversity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's left of the berlin wall volker heise said the film was a way to find out how people live in a city of such diversity .
" how do people educate their children ?
what television programs do they watch ?
what do they eat ? " he asked in material outlining the project .
work first began on the 2.8-million-euro -lrb- $ 4-million -rrb- film some three years ago .
besides the protagonists selected to feature in the tele-visual extravaganza , berliners were invited to send in their own contributions .
some of these have made it into the final product .
so , too , has the city itself .
there are multiple shots of the television tower at alexanderplatz , the river spree and other landmarks .
but viewers will also catch glimpses of the smaller spots that make berlin the unique city it is .
in essence , the makers have tried to leave no stone unturned in their portrayal of this 21st-century metropolis .
from the bedroom to the sausage stand , the courtroom to the chancellery , they have set out to capture life as it happens .
and as the introduction is at pains to point out , it is just a normal day : " nothing special is expected to happen .
people will get up and go to work , they will love and hate one another , they will be born and they will die . "
the show begins at 6am central european time and can be seen on arte and berlin public broadcaster , rbb .
viewers outside germany can pick up the live stream at www.24berlin.tv.

a berlin musicologist says he knows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was she the one ?
everyone knows the melody to ludwig van beethoven 's piano piece " fuer elise , " but elise 's true identity has remained a mystery .
now a german musicologist says he 's discovered who she really was . from hard rock and jazz to cabaret and ring tones , " fuer elise " is the quintessential example of the popularization of classical music .
if beethoven got royalties , he 'd be a wealthy man . while everyone knows the melody to the short piano piece in a minor , few stop to wonder what was behind the intimate dedication . berlin musicologist klaus martin kopitz believes he has uncovered elise 's true identity - while he was n't even looking for it . " for years , i 've been working on a publication called ' beethoven in the eyes of his contemporaries , ' which includes all the reports from people who knew beethoven personally : journals , letters , poems , memoires , " said kopitz .
" certain women are mentioned , and one of them was elisabeth roeckel . " a close friendship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roeckel was an accomplished pianist elisabeth roeckel , born in 1793 , was the younger sister of singer joseph roeckel , who sang the role of florestan in beethoven 's opera " fidelio , " and became a good friend of the composer 's .
elise was also musically inclined - she played the piano and later became a singer . in her circle of friends , she was affectionately referred to as " elise . "
in the spring of 1810 , she went to bamberg to work in theater , with the hope of impressing none other than eta hoffman , who was the theater manager there at the time . according to kopitz , beethoven dedicated the a-minor piano piece " in the memory of " elise because they were separated when she relocated to bamberg .
since elisabeth roeckel was referred to in the dedication as " elise " and not the more formal " fraeulein roeckel , " she must have known beethoven well , said kopitz . indeed , their relationship was documented , as elise herself had written about it . beethoven the flirt " according to what she wrote , -lrb- their relationship -rrb- must have been close , " said kopitz .
in a letter , elise wrote about an evening with the composer , the famous guitarist mauro giuliani , and composer johann nepomuk hummel , who would later become her husband . " she wrote that beethoven , true to his frisky rhenish disposition , would n't stop teasing her and she did n't know what to do , " said the musicologist .
" he had pinched her arm out of sheer affection , " added kopitz . that elise chose hummel instead apparently did not mean the end of their friendship with beethoven .
several days before the composer 's death in march 1827 , elise visited him .
to remember her former admirer , she cut off a lock of his hair and accepted one of his quills as a present . how , then , could elisabeth roeckel have remained a mystery to musicologists over all the years ?
and why has the piece so often been attributed to therese malfatti , who beethoven proposed to in 1810 ? bildunterschrift : the beethoven archive and the composer 's birth house are located in bonn original manuscript has disappeared the beethoven scholar ludwig nohl -lrb- 1831-1885 -rrb- may be to blame .
when he discovered a draft of the work , he published it in 1865 with a dedication to therese .
nohl claimed to have seen the original manuscript , saying it had been discovered in therese 's estate , but it has never been found since . all that exists is an incomplete draft of the work , sketched on a sheet of paper beethoven had apparently used for brainstorming other works .
this has been dated to 1810 , around the time of beethoven 's engagement to therese malfatti . if , however , the a-minor melody was indeed composed for elise and not therese , it is not immediately apparent how and why the original manuscript could have made it into therese 's hands . kopitz admitted that his theory on this point is not particularly scientific : " therese malfatti comes to beethoven 's house and sees the " fuer elise " manuscript lying on top of his piano , so she asks ' who is this elise ?
do you still want to marry me ? '
at that point he was embarrassed that he had written the piece for elise when he really wanted to marry therese . " what does it matter ? the musicologist 's theory is currently in the process of being published and has not yet garnered widespread acceptance in the field . the director of the beethoven archive at the beethoven house in bonn , bernhard appel , said he was skeptical of kopitz ' hypothesis , though he emphasized that he could not make a conclusion until the report was available for detailed review . " elise was a very common name in vienna at the time , " said appel , so the dedication could have referred to any number of women .
he added that , to prove who elise really was , it would be essential to clarify what path the manuscript took before it disappeared . " would the music change if we knew who it was dedicated to ? " questioned appel .
for those who use it as their mobile phone ring tone , probably not . author : anastassia boutsko -lrb- cn -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they also warned that the global crisis is n't over yet . finance ministers from the world 's 20 leading economies have set their sights on multi-million euro bonuses paid to some bankers .
the explosive issue of bank bonuses is being pushed by europe 's largest economies .
" our citizens are deeply shocked at the revival of reprehensible practices , despite taxpayers ' money having been mobilized to support the financial sector , " chancellor angela merkel , british prime minister gordon brown and french president nicolas sarkozy said in a letter released before the start of the meeting .
sarkozy has called for bankers ' bonuses to be capped , an idea which found broad support among european finance ministers earlier this week .
britain has been reluctant to support a cap , for fear it could cause bankers to move their business out of london .
but there is british support for tying bonuses to long-term performance .
the bonus practices are seen as helping create banking culture which critics say is too focused on risky , short-term gains .

there is a real risk that either governments or people generally think ' we have done that , we are on the path to recovery , ' " he said .
that feeling was echoed by merkel , brown and sarkozy , who warned that we have not yet seen the end of the global economic crisis .
they urged colleagues to continue exercising " prudence and caution " saying that a bumpy road lies ahead .
besides bankers ' bonuses , finance ministers will also discuss how to go forward with huge stimulus packages introduced at the beginning of the crisis .
while g-20 countries need to show their commitment to implementing stimulus plans , they also need to begin coordinating exit strategies once the crisis has ended , the three leaders said .
germany is concerned about inflation and has talked about the need to ease up on stimulus spending .

they also warned that the global crisis is n't over yet . finance ministers from the world 's 20 leading economies have set their sights on multi-million euro bonuses paid to some bankers .
the explosive issue of bank bonuses is being pushed by europe 's largest economies .
" our citizens are deeply shocked at the revival of reprehensible practices , despite taxpayers ' money having been mobilized to support the financial sector , " chancellor angela merkel , british prime minister gordon brown and french president nicolas sarkozy said in a letter released before the start of the meeting .
sarkozy has called for bankers ' bonuses to be capped , an idea which found broad support among european finance ministers earlier this week .
britain has been reluctant to support a cap , for fear it could cause bankers to move their business out of london .
but there is british support for tying bonuses to long-term performance .
the bonus practices are seen as helping create banking culture which critics say is too focused on risky , short-term gains .

that feeling was echoed by merkel , brown and sarkozy , who warned that we have not yet seen the end of the global economic crisis .
they urged colleagues to continue exercising " prudence and caution " saying that a bumpy road lies ahead .
besides bankers ' bonuses , finance ministers will also discuss how to go forward with huge stimulus packages introduced at the beginning of the crisis .
while g-20 countries need to show their commitment to implementing stimulus plans , they also need to begin coordinating exit strategies once the crisis has ended , the three leaders said .

the isaf troops then engaged the militants in a fire fight .
no civilians or german soldiers were injured in the battle .

a security officer who asked to remain anonymous told reporters that 200 people were killed and wounded in the explosion while residents put the number of casualties at 300 . european leaders begin to speak out following the attack , british prime minster gordon brown confirmed that he would not be backing down or changing the government 's afghanistan policy in any way . speaking at the international institute for strategic studies -lrb- iiss -rrb- in london , brown said that the stability of the volatile region , spanning the afghan-pakistan border , had a profound impact on the security of britain and the rest of the international community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister brown refuses to back down " we can not just walk away , " said brown , adding that the objectives in the conflict were " clear , justified , realistic and achievable .

despite us military surges and diverted troop deployments from iraq , many areas of the country remain in a state of war . the presidential vote on august 20 , which was meant to be an indication of how far the country had come since the end of taliban rule eight years ago , was marred by violence and intimidation as counter-insurgents targeted polling stations as well as afghan soldiers and isaf troops . mrm / nda / dpa / ap / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a berlin musicologist says he knows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was she the one ?
everyone knows the melody to ludwig van beethoven 's piano piece " fuer elise , " but elise 's true identity has remained a mystery .
now a german musicologist says he 's discovered who she really was . from hard rock and jazz to cabaret and ring tones , " fuer elise " is the quintessential example of the popularization of classical music .
if beethoven got royalties , he 'd be a wealthy man . while everyone knows the melody to the short piano piece in a minor , few stop to wonder what was behind the intimate dedication . berlin musicologist klaus martin kopitz believes he has uncovered elise 's true identity - while he was n't even looking for it . " for years , i 've been working on a publication called ' beethoven in the eyes of his contemporaries , ' which includes all the reports from people who knew beethoven personally : journals , letters , poems , memoires , " said kopitz .
" certain women are mentioned , and one of them was elisabeth roeckel . " a close friendship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roeckel was an accomplished pianist elisabeth roeckel , born in 1793 , was the younger sister of singer joseph roeckel , who sang the role of florestan in beethoven 's opera " fidelio , " and became a good friend of the composer 's .
elise was also musically inclined - she played the piano and later became a singer . in her circle of friends , she was affectionately referred to as " elise . "
in the spring of 1810 , she went to bamberg to work in theater , with the hope of impressing none other than eta hoffman , who was the theater manager there at the time . according to kopitz , beethoven dedicated the a-minor piano piece " in the memory of " elise because they were separated when she relocated to bamberg .
since elisabeth roeckel was referred to in the dedication as " elise " and not the more formal " fraeulein roeckel , " she must have known beethoven well , said kopitz . indeed , their relationship was documented , as elise herself had written about it . beethoven the flirt " according to what she wrote , -lrb- their relationship -rrb- must have been close , " said kopitz .
in a letter , elise wrote about an evening with the composer , the famous guitarist mauro giuliani , and composer johann nepomuk hummel , who would later become her husband . " she wrote that beethoven , true to his frisky rhenish disposition , would n't stop teasing her and she did n't know what to do , " said the musicologist .
" he had pinched her arm out of sheer affection , " added kopitz . that elise chose hummel instead apparently did not mean the end of their friendship with beethoven .
several days before the composer 's death in march 1827 , elise visited him .
to remember her former admirer , she cut off a lock of his hair and accepted one of his quills as a present . how , then , could elisabeth roeckel have remained a mystery to musicologists over all the years ?
and why has the piece so often been attributed to therese malfatti , who beethoven proposed to in 1810 ? bildunterschrift : the beethoven archive and the composer 's birth house are located in bonn original manuscript has disappeared the beethoven scholar ludwig nohl -lrb- 1831-1885 -rrb- may be to blame .
when he discovered a draft of the work , he published it in 1865 with a dedication to therese .
nohl claimed to have seen the original manuscript , saying it had been discovered in therese 's estate , but it has never been found since . all that exists is an incomplete draft of the work , sketched on a sheet of paper beethoven had apparently used for brainstorming other works .
this has been dated to 1810 , around the time of beethoven 's engagement to therese malfatti . if , however , the a-minor melody was indeed composed for elise and not therese , it is not immediately apparent how and why the original manuscript could have made it into therese 's hands . kopitz admitted that his theory on this point is not particularly scientific : " therese malfatti comes to beethoven 's house and sees the " fuer elise " manuscript lying on top of his piano , so she asks ' who is this elise ?
do you still want to marry me ? '
at that point he was embarrassed that he had written the piece for elise when he really wanted to marry therese . " what does it matter ? the musicologist 's theory is currently in the process of being published and has not yet garnered widespread acceptance in the field . the director of the beethoven archive at the beethoven house in bonn , bernhard appel , said he was skeptical of kopitz ' hypothesis , though he emphasized that he could not make a conclusion until the report was available for detailed review . " elise was a very common name in vienna at the time , " said appel , so the dedication could have referred to any number of women .
he added that , to prove who elise really was , it would be essential to clarify what path the manuscript took before it disappeared . " would the music change if we knew who it was dedicated to ? " questioned appel .

a berlin musicologist says he knows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was she the one ?
everyone knows the melody to ludwig van beethoven 's piano piece " fuer elise , " but elise 's true identity has remained a mystery .
now a german musicologist says he 's discovered who she really was . from hard rock and jazz to cabaret and ring tones , " fuer elise " is the quintessential example of the popularization of classical music .
if beethoven got royalties , he 'd be a wealthy man . while everyone knows the melody to the short piano piece in a minor , few stop to wonder what was behind the intimate dedication . berlin musicologist klaus martin kopitz believes he has uncovered elise 's true identity - while he was n't even looking for it . " for years , i 've been working on a publication called ' beethoven in the eyes of his contemporaries , ' which includes all the reports from people who knew beethoven personally : journals , letters , poems , memoires , " said kopitz .
" certain women are mentioned , and one of them was elisabeth roeckel . " a close friendship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roeckel was an accomplished pianist elisabeth roeckel , born in 1793 , was the younger sister of singer joseph roeckel , who sang the role of florestan in beethoven 's opera " fidelio , " and became a good friend of the composer 's .
elise was also musically inclined - she played the piano and later became a singer . in her circle of friends , she was affectionately referred to as " elise . "
in the spring of 1810 , she went to bamberg to work in theater , with the hope of impressing none other than eta hoffman , who was the theater manager there at the time . according to kopitz , beethoven dedicated the a-minor piano piece " in the memory of " elise because they were separated when she relocated to bamberg .
since elisabeth roeckel was referred to in the dedication as " elise " and not the more formal " fraeulein roeckel , " she must have known beethoven well , said kopitz . indeed , their relationship was documented , as elise herself had written about it . beethoven the flirt " according to what she wrote , -lrb- their relationship -rrb- must have been close , " said kopitz .
in a letter , elise wrote about an evening with the composer , the famous guitarist mauro giuliani , and composer johann nepomuk hummel , who would later become her husband . " she wrote that beethoven , true to his frisky rhenish disposition , would n't stop teasing her and she did n't know what to do , " said the musicologist .
" he had pinched her arm out of sheer affection , " added kopitz . that elise chose hummel instead apparently did not mean the end of their friendship with beethoven .
several days before the composer 's death in march 1827 , elise visited him .
to remember her former admirer , she cut off a lock of his hair and accepted one of his quills as a present . how , then , could elisabeth roeckel have remained a mystery to musicologists over all the years ?
and why has the piece so often been attributed to therese malfatti , who beethoven proposed to in 1810 ? bildunterschrift : the beethoven archive and the composer 's birth house are located in bonn original manuscript has disappeared the beethoven scholar ludwig nohl -lrb- 1831-1885 -rrb- may be to blame .
when he discovered a draft of the work , he published it in 1865 with a dedication to therese .
nohl claimed to have seen the original manuscript , saying it had been discovered in therese 's estate , but it has never been found since . all that exists is an incomplete draft of the work , sketched on a sheet of paper beethoven had apparently used for brainstorming other works .
this has been dated to 1810 , around the time of beethoven 's engagement to therese malfatti . if , however , the a-minor melody was indeed composed for elise and not therese , it is not immediately apparent how and why the original manuscript could have made it into therese 's hands . kopitz admitted that his theory on this point is not particularly scientific : " therese malfatti comes to beethoven 's house and sees the " fuer elise " manuscript lying on top of his piano , so she asks ' who is this elise ?

a berlin musicologist says he knows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was she the one ?
everyone knows the melody to ludwig van beethoven 's piano piece " fuer elise , " but elise 's true identity has remained a mystery .
now a german musicologist says he 's discovered who she really was . from hard rock and jazz to cabaret and ring tones , " fuer elise " is the quintessential example of the popularization of classical music .
if beethoven got royalties , he 'd be a wealthy man . while everyone knows the melody to the short piano piece in a minor , few stop to wonder what was behind the intimate dedication . berlin musicologist klaus martin kopitz believes he has uncovered elise 's true identity - while he was n't even looking for it . " for years , i 've been working on a publication called ' beethoven in the eyes of his contemporaries , ' which includes all the reports from people who knew beethoven personally : journals , letters , poems , memoires , " said kopitz .
" certain women are mentioned , and one of them was elisabeth roeckel . " a close friendship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roeckel was an accomplished pianist elisabeth roeckel , born in 1793 , was the younger sister of singer joseph roeckel , who sang the role of florestan in beethoven 's opera " fidelio , " and became a good friend of the composer 's .
elise was also musically inclined - she played the piano and later became a singer . in her circle of friends , she was affectionately referred to as " elise . "
in the spring of 1810 , she went to bamberg to work in theater , with the hope of impressing none other than eta hoffman , who was the theater manager there at the time . according to kopitz , beethoven dedicated the a-minor piano piece " in the memory of " elise because they were separated when she relocated to bamberg .
since elisabeth roeckel was referred to in the dedication as " elise " and not the more formal " fraeulein roeckel , " she must have known beethoven well , said kopitz . indeed , their relationship was documented , as elise herself had written about it . beethoven the flirt " according to what she wrote , -lrb- their relationship -rrb- must have been close , " said kopitz .
in a letter , elise wrote about an evening with the composer , the famous guitarist mauro giuliani , and composer johann nepomuk hummel , who would later become her husband . " she wrote that beethoven , true to his frisky rhenish disposition , would n't stop teasing her and she did n't know what to do , " said the musicologist .
" he had pinched her arm out of sheer affection , " added kopitz . that elise chose hummel instead apparently did not mean the end of their friendship with beethoven .
several days before the composer 's death in march 1827 , elise visited him .
to remember her former admirer , she cut off a lock of his hair and accepted one of his quills as a present . how , then , could elisabeth roeckel have remained a mystery to musicologists over all the years ?
and why has the piece so often been attributed to therese malfatti , who beethoven proposed to in 1810 ? bildunterschrift : the beethoven archive and the composer 's birth house are located in bonn original manuscript has disappeared the beethoven scholar ludwig nohl -lrb- 1831-1885 -rrb- may be to blame .

" if they are ready to engage with us , we 're ready to cooperate with them , " said swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country holds the eu presidency , as he arrived at the talks in stockholm .
" but if they decide to go for confrontation , then confrontation will happen , " he told reporters .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , speaking at a separate press conference , said europe needed to remain united in its opposition to iran 's nuclear program .
" i think it 's very important for us to be gathered firmly in the eu 's reaction towards iran , not accepting nuclear ambitions , " he said .
germany 's deputy minister for foreign affairs , guenter gloser , however , said it was pointless to impose more sanctions on iran , pointing out that such actions in the past had yet to bring about any positive change .
" but something must be done to prevent a nuclear arms race in the middle east , " he added .
iran says nuclear endeavors are peaceful a defiant president mahmoud ahmadinejad said on thursday that iran is ready for more sanctions over its nuclear program and will not bow to pressure in meeting any deadline set by world powers .
however tehran has also said it was willing to begin fresh talks with the six major powers - britain , china , france , russia and the united states , plus germany - regarding its nuclear drive .
iran continues to insist its nuclear work is peaceful , while western countries suspect that iran is attempting to build atomic weapons .
the un security council has already slapped three rounds of sanctions on the islamic republic , but pressure is growing for more .
minister appointment further " provocation " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bildt has called iran 's policies " provocative " meanwhile , reinfeldt called president ahmadinejad 's appointment of international terror suspect ahmad vahidi as defense minister a sign of a desire to worsen relations between iran and the west .
" we feel this is a situation that simply returns to provocations .
the appointment of -lsb- vahdi -rsb- is another one of these examples , " reinfeldt told reporters .
vahidi is wanted by interpol in connection with a 1994 attack on a jewish charity that killed 85 people. glb / reuters / ap / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's healthcare system has experienced all manner of nips and tucks since it was introduced over 125 years ago but it 's nonetheless showing its age .
the election might decide whether it gets a new lease of life . health insurance in germany has come a long way since sickness cover was introduced in 1883 under kaiser wilhelm i and his chancellor , otto von bismarck .
at the time , the average german worked a 60-hour week for a pittance , and sickness or accidents meant a very real threat of starvation .
public dissatisfaction was widespread , and it was against this backdrop that germany started on the long road towards the welfare state it still more or less is .
but these days , less is the operative word .
the social solidarity that has traditionally underpinned the german healthcare system is looking increasingly frail .
the basic problem is that german society is ageing , while its birth rate is sinking .
this means that healthcare costs are rising while fewer people are paying into the system .
many believe that what the only way to rejuvenate the system is to expose it to market forces .
rising costs but this would mark a dramatic break with bismarck 's original program .
made up of health insurance ; accident insurance ; disability insurance and an old-age retirement pension , it was based from the outset on the principle of solidarity : anyone who was employed was obliged to pay into the system and anyone who fell ill would receive medical care and a living allowance .
the cost was divided between employers and the employed - the employers contributing one third , the workers two thirds .
the ratio has changed since then - and so have many other aspects of the german health care service .
the last 20 years alone have seen 14 health care reforms .
while the initial health care restructuring was designed to provide more efficient and cost-effective healthcare services , the most recent reforms focus more on the structure of health insurance funds .
one way or another , most of them have been bad news for the public .
personal contributions to dental care and medicine costs have gone up , and patients now have to pay a mandatory 10 euros -lrb- $ 14 -rrb- per quarter whenever they go to the doctor .

and it 's not just patients who are noticing .
medical and healthcare professionals also say that conditions are worsening .
" everything has gone downhill , " says one nurse who works in a hospital in bonn .
" we all have less time , there are so many cuts , patients are dissatisfied , especially the elderly ones . "
doctors are also fed up , and say the system is flawed .

" if one of my assistants does a cardiogram and we tell the patient what our findings are , we make three times as much money as we would if we spent 10 minutes talking to the patient , " she complains .
another problem is that doctors have had to start relying on private patients to stay afloat .
in germany , only 10 percent of the population has private , for-profit insurance - mostly civil servants and the self-employed .
increasingly , doctors are realizing that patients with state health cover are just not profitable enough .

the german health care system averages an annual turnover of over 250 billion euros , making it one of the nation 's most important economic sectors .
it 's also a sector in which powerful interest groups from trade associations to pharmaceuticals companies are constantly jockeying for position .
german health minister ulla schmidt is well aware of the tensions .
" no other sector has the financial clout of the health service , " she says .
" the amount of money spent on it exceeds the entire federal budget .
the sector 's players are dealing with huge funds with which they can buy opinion , influence opinion and promote their products .
in this respect it is patients themselves who are in the weakest position , even though they should be the strongest , because 70 million people in germany have state health cover . "
but the public is often little more than a pawn in a game , and has little insight into what is being spent and how .
the new cornerstone for funding german health care spending is the controversial and highly complex ' gesundheitsfond ' , the health care fund .
supposedly , it aims to simplify health benefits , provide more choices , increase transparency and create competition among providers .
but its detractors believe that it fails to address the increasingly urgent issue of funding the enormous german system .
it makes no mention of reducing cost , they say , but simply spreads the cost risk differently .
in the wake of the financial crisis , saving costs has become more important then ever .
after numerous attempts at resuscitation , the solidarity principle introduced by bismarck could well be on its last legs , and germany 's two leading parties can not agree whether it should be kept on life-support .
social democrat ulla schmidt , for one , would like to give it another chance and abolish private health insurance altogether .
but ultimately , today 's social and economic forces are nudging germany more in the direction of a healthcare system built on individual responsibility .
the issue will certainly be on voters ' minds when they go to the polls this month .

germany 's healthcare system has experienced all manner of nips and tucks since it was introduced over 125 years ago but it 's nonetheless showing its age .
the election might decide whether it gets a new lease of life . health insurance in germany has come a long way since sickness cover was introduced in 1883 under kaiser wilhelm i and his chancellor , otto von bismarck .
at the time , the average german worked a 60-hour week for a pittance , and sickness or accidents meant a very real threat of starvation .
public dissatisfaction was widespread , and it was against this backdrop that germany started on the long road towards the welfare state it still more or less is .
but these days , less is the operative word .
the social solidarity that has traditionally underpinned the german healthcare system is looking increasingly frail .
the basic problem is that german society is ageing , while its birth rate is sinking .
this means that healthcare costs are rising while fewer people are paying into the system .
many believe that what the only way to rejuvenate the system is to expose it to market forces .
rising costs but this would mark a dramatic break with bismarck 's original program .
made up of health insurance ; accident insurance ; disability insurance and an old-age retirement pension , it was based from the outset on the principle of solidarity : anyone who was employed was obliged to pay into the system and anyone who fell ill would receive medical care and a living allowance .
the cost was divided between employers and the employed - the employers contributing one third , the workers two thirds .
the ratio has changed since then - and so have many other aspects of the german health care service .
the last 20 years alone have seen 14 health care reforms .
while the initial health care restructuring was designed to provide more efficient and cost-effective healthcare services , the most recent reforms focus more on the structure of health insurance funds .
one way or another , most of them have been bad news for the public .
personal contributions to dental care and medicine costs have gone up , and patients now have to pay a mandatory 10 euros -lrb- $ 14 -rrb- per quarter whenever they go to the doctor .
dissatisfaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private patients are more lucrative so although the german healthcare services are still more or less all-inclusive , the cracks are showing .
and it 's not just patients who are noticing .
medical and healthcare professionals also say that conditions are worsening .
" everything has gone downhill , " says one nurse who works in a hospital in bonn .
" we all have less time , there are so many cuts , patients are dissatisfied , especially the elderly ones . "
doctors are also fed up , and say the system is flawed .
dorothee keltz is a gp with a practice in bonn .
she believes it 's important to take the time to talk to patients , and resents the fact that insurers prefer to see doctors using technical equipment .
" if one of my assistants does a cardiogram and we tell the patient what our findings are , we make three times as much money as we would if we spent 10 minutes talking to the patient , " she complains .
another problem is that doctors have had to start relying on private patients to stay afloat .
in germany , only 10 percent of the population has private , for-profit insurance - mostly civil servants and the self-employed .
increasingly , doctors are realizing that patients with state health cover are just not profitable enough .
patients as pawns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german health care is the fourth most expensive in the world still , the stakes are high .
the german health care system averages an annual turnover of over 250 billion euros , making it one of the nation 's most important economic sectors .
it 's also a sector in which powerful interest groups from trade associations to pharmaceuticals companies are constantly jockeying for position .
german health minister ulla schmidt is well aware of the tensions .
" no other sector has the financial clout of the health service , " she says .
" the amount of money spent on it exceeds the entire federal budget .
the sector 's players are dealing with huge funds with which they can buy opinion , influence opinion and promote their products .
in this respect it is patients themselves who are in the weakest position , even though they should be the strongest , because 70 million people in germany have state health cover . "
but the public is often little more than a pawn in a game , and has little insight into what is being spent and how .
the new cornerstone for funding german health care spending is the controversial and highly complex ' gesundheitsfond ' , the health care fund .
supposedly , it aims to simplify health benefits , provide more choices , increase transparency and create competition among providers .
but its detractors believe that it fails to address the increasingly urgent issue of funding the enormous german system .
it makes no mention of reducing cost , they say , but simply spreads the cost risk differently .
in the wake of the financial crisis , saving costs has become more important then ever .
after numerous attempts at resuscitation , the solidarity principle introduced by bismarck could well be on its last legs , and germany 's two leading parties can not agree whether it should be kept on life-support .
social democrat ulla schmidt , for one , would like to give it another chance and abolish private health insurance altogether .
but ultimately , today 's social and economic forces are nudging germany more in the direction of a healthcare system built on individual responsibility .
the issue will certainly be on voters ' minds when they go to the polls this month .

those hoping that a second irish referendum on the eu 's lisbon treaty will remove one of the largest stumbling blocks to the eu reform document ’ s ratification will be disappointed by news that has come out of dublin . polls and government ministers revealed a slump in support for the treaty among the populace of the recession-hit country ahead of the plebiscite next month .
public opinion was gauged by a face-to-face poll with 1,000 voters earlier this week conducted by the tns mrbi market research company .
the survey , published in the friday edition of the irish times , showed opposition to the treaty stood at 29 percent , increasing one point since the last poll in may , with support dropping eight points to 46 percent in the same time span .
the number of voters who remained undecided stood at 25 percent , an increase of seven points .
in an article which accompanied the results , the irish times ' political editor , stephen collins , wrote that " a striking feature of the latest poll is that most of those who have left the ' yes ' camp have moved into the ' do n't know ' category rather than shifting into the ' no ' camp . "
if the poll results were not gloomy enough , irish foreign minister michael martin admitted that the government was pessimistic about the october 2 referendum but that he believed that , while it would be difficult to secure ratification , he expected a slim vote in favor .
" i was never under any illusion but that it would be difficult to secure this but i do think we can do it , " he told national radio broadcaster rte .
" there is a very significant challenge ahead , it 's going to be a very tight campaign and it will demand all of the resources , conviction , politics and passion of all of those on the yes side . "
brussels concessions led to second referendum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : support is slipping for the lisbio treaty as the vote nears ireland is the only member of the 27-nation eu which is constitutionally bound to hold a referendum on the treaty , which is designed to overhaul of the eu 's foreign policy-making and internal decision-making in a greatly expanded bloc .
irish voters threw the ratification process into chaos last year when they rejected the treaty in the first referendum .
irish voters rejected the pact in a referendum held in june , partly out of concerns that their country would lose the right to nominate a commissioner to the eu 's executive and concerns that the treaty would contravene the country 's constitution on issues relating to the right to life , education and family policy .
the decision to launch a second referendum came after opinion polls showed voters would back it this time after dublin won concessions from brussels on key policy areas .
these included the guarantee that ireland 's traditional policy of neutrality would be maintained and that the lisbon treaty would not impinge on ireland 's right to set tax levels .
the eu also agreed that ireland would retain the right to an eu commissioner .
backlash could lead to potential " no " vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brian cowen 's government is also losing support despite the fact that the previous three opinion polls conducted this year showed solid support for the treaty , it is believed that the growing dissatisfaction with the irish government 's handling of the financial crisis has turned an anti-government backlash into a vote against ratification .
prime minister brian cowen 's government has itself been faced with some uncomfortable reading in recent polls .
the latest showed that 75 percent of voters would like to see him ousted , while support for the prime minister 's fianna fail party dropped to a record low of 17 percent .
for the lisbon treaty to come into force , it has to be ratified by all 27 eu states .
poland and the czech republic , currently led by euro-skeptic presidents , have said that they will wait for ireland 's vote before signing it into law .

those hoping that a second irish referendum on the eu 's lisbon treaty will remove one of the largest stumbling blocks to the eu reform document ’ s ratification will be disappointed by news that has come out of dublin . polls and government ministers revealed a slump in support for the treaty among the populace of the recession-hit country ahead of the plebiscite next month .
public opinion was gauged by a face-to-face poll with 1,000 voters earlier this week conducted by the tns mrbi market research company .
the survey , published in the friday edition of the irish times , showed opposition to the treaty stood at 29 percent , increasing one point since the last poll in may , with support dropping eight points to 46 percent in the same time span .
the number of voters who remained undecided stood at 25 percent , an increase of seven points .
in an article which accompanied the results , the irish times ' political editor , stephen collins , wrote that " a striking feature of the latest poll is that most of those who have left the ' yes ' camp have moved into the ' do n't know ' category rather than shifting into the ' no ' camp . "
if the poll results were not gloomy enough , irish foreign minister michael martin admitted that the government was pessimistic about the october 2 referendum but that he believed that , while it would be difficult to secure ratification , he expected a slim vote in favor .
" i was never under any illusion but that it would be difficult to secure this but i do think we can do it , " he told national radio broadcaster rte .
" there is a very significant challenge ahead , it 's going to be a very tight campaign and it will demand all of the resources , conviction , politics and passion of all of those on the yes side . "
brussels concessions led to second referendum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : support is slipping for the lisbio treaty as the vote nears ireland is the only member of the 27-nation eu which is constitutionally bound to hold a referendum on the treaty , which is designed to overhaul of the eu 's foreign policy-making and internal decision-making in a greatly expanded bloc .
irish voters threw the ratification process into chaos last year when they rejected the treaty in the first referendum .
irish voters rejected the pact in a referendum held in june , partly out of concerns that their country would lose the right to nominate a commissioner to the eu 's executive and concerns that the treaty would contravene the country 's constitution on issues relating to the right to life , education and family policy .
the decision to launch a second referendum came after opinion polls showed voters would back it this time after dublin won concessions from brussels on key policy areas .
these included the guarantee that ireland 's traditional policy of neutrality would be maintained and that the lisbon treaty would not impinge on ireland 's right to set tax levels .
the eu also agreed that ireland would retain the right to an eu commissioner .
backlash could lead to potential " no " vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brian cowen 's government is also losing support despite the fact that the previous three opinion polls conducted this year showed solid support for the treaty , it is believed that the growing dissatisfaction with the irish government 's handling of the financial crisis has turned an anti-government backlash into a vote against ratification .
prime minister brian cowen 's government has itself been faced with some uncomfortable reading in recent polls .
the latest showed that 75 percent of voters would like to see him ousted , while support for the prime minister 's fianna fail party dropped to a record low of 17 percent .
for the lisbon treaty to come into force , it has to be ratified by all 27 eu states .
poland and the czech republic , currently led by euro-skeptic presidents , have said that they will wait for ireland 's vote before signing it into law .
if ireland were to vote “ no ” for a second time , observers say it could derail the treaty for good. nda / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these included the guarantee that ireland 's traditional policy of neutrality would be maintained and that the lisbon treaty would not impinge on ireland 's right to set tax levels .
the eu also agreed that ireland would retain the right to an eu commissioner .
backlash could lead to potential " no " vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brian cowen 's government is also losing support despite the fact that the previous three opinion polls conducted this year showed solid support for the treaty , it is believed that the growing dissatisfaction with the irish government 's handling of the financial crisis has turned an anti-government backlash into a vote against ratification .
prime minister brian cowen 's government has itself been faced with some uncomfortable reading in recent polls .
the latest showed that 75 percent of voters would like to see him ousted , while support for the prime minister 's fianna fail party dropped to a record low of 17 percent .
for the lisbon treaty to come into force , it has to be ratified by all 27 eu states .
poland and the czech republic , currently led by euro-skeptic presidents , have said that they will wait for ireland 's vote before signing it into law .
if ireland were to vote “ no ” for a second time , observers say it could derail the treaty for good. nda / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's healthcare system has experienced all manner of nips and tucks since it was introduced over 125 years ago but it 's nonetheless showing its age .
the election might decide whether it gets a new lease of life . health insurance in germany has come a long way since sickness cover was introduced in 1883 under kaiser wilhelm i and his chancellor , otto von bismarck .
at the time , the average german worked a 60-hour week for a pittance , and sickness or accidents meant a very real threat of starvation .
public dissatisfaction was widespread , and it was against this backdrop that germany started on the long road towards the welfare state it still more or less is .
but these days , less is the operative word .
the social solidarity that has traditionally underpinned the german healthcare system is looking increasingly frail .
the basic problem is that german society is ageing , while its birth rate is sinking .
this means that healthcare costs are rising while fewer people are paying into the system .
many believe that what the only way to rejuvenate the system is to expose it to market forces .
rising costs but this would mark a dramatic break with bismarck 's original program .
made up of health insurance ; accident insurance ; disability insurance and an old-age retirement pension , it was based from the outset on the principle of solidarity : anyone who was employed was obliged to pay into the system and anyone who fell ill would receive medical care and a living allowance .
the cost was divided between employers and the employed - the employers contributing one third , the workers two thirds .
the ratio has changed since then - and so have many other aspects of the german health care service .
the last 20 years alone have seen 14 health care reforms .
while the initial health care restructuring was designed to provide more efficient and cost-effective healthcare services , the most recent reforms focus more on the structure of health insurance funds .
one way or another , most of them have been bad news for the public .
personal contributions to dental care and medicine costs have gone up , and patients now have to pay a mandatory 10 euros -lrb- $ 14 -rrb- per quarter whenever they go to the doctor .
dissatisfaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private patients are more lucrative so although the german healthcare services are still more or less all-inclusive , the cracks are showing .
and it 's not just patients who are noticing .
medical and healthcare professionals also say that conditions are worsening .
" everything has gone downhill , " says one nurse who works in a hospital in bonn .
" we all have less time , there are so many cuts , patients are dissatisfied , especially the elderly ones . "
doctors are also fed up , and say the system is flawed .
dorothee keltz is a gp with a practice in bonn .
she believes it 's important to take the time to talk to patients , and resents the fact that insurers prefer to see doctors using technical equipment .
" if one of my assistants does a cardiogram and we tell the patient what our findings are , we make three times as much money as we would if we spent 10 minutes talking to the patient , " she complains .
another problem is that doctors have had to start relying on private patients to stay afloat .
in germany , only 10 percent of the population has private , for-profit insurance - mostly civil servants and the self-employed .
increasingly , doctors are realizing that patients with state health cover are just not profitable enough .
patients as pawns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german health care is the fourth most expensive in the world still , the stakes are high .
the german health care system averages an annual turnover of over 250 billion euros , making it one of the nation 's most important economic sectors .
it 's also a sector in which powerful interest groups from trade associations to pharmaceuticals companies are constantly jockeying for position .
german health minister ulla schmidt is well aware of the tensions .
" no other sector has the financial clout of the health service , " she says .
" the amount of money spent on it exceeds the entire federal budget .
the sector 's players are dealing with huge funds with which they can buy opinion , influence opinion and promote their products .
in this respect it is patients themselves who are in the weakest position , even though they should be the strongest , because 70 million people in germany have state health cover . "
but the public is often little more than a pawn in a game , and has little insight into what is being spent and how .
the new cornerstone for funding german health care spending is the controversial and highly complex ' gesundheitsfond ' , the health care fund .
supposedly , it aims to simplify health benefits , provide more choices , increase transparency and create competition among providers .
but its detractors believe that it fails to address the increasingly urgent issue of funding the enormous german system .
it makes no mention of reducing cost , they say , but simply spreads the cost risk differently .
in the wake of the financial crisis , saving costs has become more important then ever .
after numerous attempts at resuscitation , the solidarity principle introduced by bismarck could well be on its last legs , and germany 's two leading parties can not agree whether it should be kept on life-support .
social democrat ulla schmidt , for one , would like to give it another chance and abolish private health insurance altogether .
but ultimately , today 's social and economic forces are nudging germany more in the direction of a healthcare system built on individual responsibility .
the issue will certainly be on voters ' minds when they go to the polls this month .

" if they are ready to engage with us , we 're ready to cooperate with them , " said swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country holds the eu presidency , as he arrived at the talks in stockholm .
" but if they decide to go for confrontation , then confrontation will happen , " he told reporters .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , speaking at a separate press conference , said europe needed to remain united in its opposition to iran 's nuclear program .
" i think it 's very important for us to be gathered firmly in the eu 's reaction towards iran , not accepting nuclear ambitions , " he said .
germany 's deputy minister for foreign affairs , guenter gloser , however , said it was pointless to impose more sanctions on iran , pointing out that such actions in the past had yet to bring about any positive change .
" but something must be done to prevent a nuclear arms race in the middle east , " he added .
iran says nuclear endeavors are peaceful a defiant president mahmoud ahmadinejad said on thursday that iran is ready for more sanctions over its nuclear program and will not bow to pressure in meeting any deadline set by world powers .
however tehran has also said it was willing to begin fresh talks with the six major powers - britain , china , france , russia and the united states , plus germany - regarding its nuclear drive .
iran continues to insist its nuclear work is peaceful , while western countries suspect that iran is attempting to build atomic weapons .
the un security council has already slapped three rounds of sanctions on the islamic republic , but pressure is growing for more .

" we feel this is a situation that simply returns to provocations .
the appointment of -lsb- vahdi -rsb- is another one of these examples , " reinfeldt told reporters .
vahidi is wanted by interpol in connection with a 1994 attack on a jewish charity that killed 85 people. glb / reuters / ap / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the wake of the financial crisis , saving costs has become more important then ever .
after numerous attempts at resuscitation , the solidarity principle introduced by bismarck could well be on its last legs , and germany 's two leading parties can not agree whether it should be kept on life-support .
social democrat ulla schmidt , for one , would like to give it another chance and abolish private health insurance altogether .
but ultimately , today 's social and economic forces are nudging germany more in the direction of a healthcare system built on individual responsibility .
the issue will certainly be on voters ' minds when they go to the polls this month .

" we the government have done the homework , the contracts have been drawn up , and now the ball is in general motors ' court , " said economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg on german television on friday , sept .
4 .
but since berlin provided opel with a 1.5-billion-euro bridging loan to help the car group through its current upheaval , it has a decisive say in the outcome - and would like to see opel sold to magna international .
the german government has endorsed a bid from the austrian-canadian auto supplier to acquire a majority holding in opel by offering state-backed guarantees worth about 4.5 billion euros .
magna is leading a joint bid with state-owned russian bank sberbank and russia 's second-largest auto maker , gaz .
chancellor angela merkel told the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung on friday that magna 's concept was " the most viable and the most sustainable . "
but she also stressed that gm had to make its own mind up .
" we hope -lrb- its decision -rrb- will be in the interests of the company and its employees , " she said .
decision time the head of general motors in europe said magna was indeed well positioned to win the drawn-out battle to take over the us car maker 's opel division .
german daily die welt this week quoted carl-peter forster as saying that magna would " most likely " win the takeover bid since all the contracts and financing were in place for it to do so .
but he did not rule out the possibility that gm could keep control of opel and gm 's british-based vauxhall division instead .
speculation has been rife that gm is considering retaining control instead of hiving off a majority stake in the group , which includes the opel and british vauxhall brands .
quoting what it said was a gm official involved in the negotiations , the wall street journal reported that the auto group was prepared to pour more than 1 billion euros of its own money into restructuring opel .
according to german press agency dpa , gm has been considering the investment plan in the event that it fails to sell off the majority stake in opel to the groups bidding for control .
" should the negotiations with the bidders not reach a satisfactory result then alternatives must be examined , " said a source close to the negotiations .

rhj international earlier this week raised its offer for a 50.1-percent stake in what has been described as the new opel by 25 million to 300 million euros in cash .
the talks over opel come at a crucial time for german chancellor angela merkel , with parliamentary elections just weeks away .

" we the government have done the homework , the contracts have been drawn up , and now the ball is in general motors ' court , " said economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg on german television on friday , sept .

but since berlin provided opel with a 1.5-billion-euro bridging loan to help the car group through its current upheaval , it has a decisive say in the outcome - and would like to see opel sold to magna international .
the german government has endorsed a bid from the austrian-canadian auto supplier to acquire a majority holding in opel by offering state-backed guarantees worth about 4.5 billion euros .
magna is leading a joint bid with state-owned russian bank sberbank and russia 's second-largest auto maker , gaz .
chancellor angela merkel told the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung on friday that magna 's concept was " the most viable and the most sustainable . "

decision time the head of general motors in europe said magna was indeed well positioned to win the drawn-out battle to take over the us car maker 's opel division .

quoting what it said was a gm official involved in the negotiations , the wall street journal reported that the auto group was prepared to pour more than 1 billion euros of its own money into restructuring opel .
according to german press agency dpa , gm has been considering the investment plan in the event that it fails to sell off the majority stake in opel to the groups bidding for control .

rhj international earlier this week raised its offer for a 50.1-percent stake in what has been described as the new opel by 25 million to 300 million euros in cash .
the talks over opel come at a crucial time for german chancellor angela merkel , with parliamentary elections just weeks away .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 04.09.2009 german healthcare issues back on agenda ahead of election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is german health care in need of surgery ?
germany 's healthcare system has experienced all manner of nips and tucks since it was introduced over 125 years ago but it 's nonetheless showing its age .
the election might decide whether it gets a new lease of life . health insurance in germany has come a long way since sickness cover was introduced in 1883 under kaiser wilhelm i and his chancellor , otto von bismarck .
at the time , the average german worked a 60-hour week for a pittance , and sickness or accidents meant a very real threat of starvation .
public dissatisfaction was widespread , and it was against this backdrop that germany started on the long road towards the welfare state it still more or less is .
but these days , less is the operative word .
the social solidarity that has traditionally underpinned the german healthcare system is looking increasingly frail .
the basic problem is that german society is ageing , while its birth rate is sinking .
this means that healthcare costs are rising while fewer people are paying into the system .
many believe that what the only way to rejuvenate the system is to expose it to market forces .
rising costs but this would mark a dramatic break with bismarck 's original program .
made up of health insurance ; accident insurance ; disability insurance and an old-age retirement pension , it was based from the outset on the principle of solidarity : anyone who was employed was obliged to pay into the system and anyone who fell ill would receive medical care and a living allowance .
the cost was divided between employers and the employed - the employers contributing one third , the workers two thirds .
the ratio has changed since then - and so have many other aspects of the german health care service .
the last 20 years alone have seen 14 health care reforms .
while the initial health care restructuring was designed to provide more efficient and cost-effective healthcare services , the most recent reforms focus more on the structure of health insurance funds .
one way or another , most of them have been bad news for the public .
personal contributions to dental care and medicine costs have gone up , and patients now have to pay a mandatory 10 euros -lrb- $ 14 -rrb- per quarter whenever they go to the doctor .
dissatisfaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private patients are more lucrative so although the german healthcare services are still more or less all-inclusive , the cracks are showing .
and it 's not just patients who are noticing .
medical and healthcare professionals also say that conditions are worsening .
" everything has gone downhill , " says one nurse who works in a hospital in bonn .
" we all have less time , there are so many cuts , patients are dissatisfied , especially the elderly ones . "
doctors are also fed up , and say the system is flawed .
dorothee keltz is a gp with a practice in bonn .
she believes it 's important to take the time to talk to patients , and resents the fact that insurers prefer to see doctors using technical equipment .
" if one of my assistants does a cardiogram and we tell the patient what our findings are , we make three times as much money as we would if we spent 10 minutes talking to the patient , " she complains .
another problem is that doctors have had to start relying on private patients to stay afloat .
in germany , only 10 percent of the population has private , for-profit insurance - mostly civil servants and the self-employed .
increasingly , doctors are realizing that patients with state health cover are just not profitable enough .
patients as pawns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german health care is the fourth most expensive in the world still , the stakes are high .
the german health care system averages an annual turnover of over 250 billion euros , making it one of the nation 's most important economic sectors .
it 's also a sector in which powerful interest groups from trade associations to pharmaceuticals companies are constantly jockeying for position .
german health minister ulla schmidt is well aware of the tensions .
" no other sector has the financial clout of the health service , " she says .
" the amount of money spent on it exceeds the entire federal budget .
the sector 's players are dealing with huge funds with which they can buy opinion , influence opinion and promote their products .
in this respect it is patients themselves who are in the weakest position , even though they should be the strongest , because 70 million people in germany have state health cover . "
but the public is often little more than a pawn in a game , and has little insight into what is being spent and how .
the new cornerstone for funding german health care spending is the controversial and highly complex ' gesundheitsfond ' , the health care fund .
supposedly , it aims to simplify health benefits , provide more choices , increase transparency and create competition among providers .
but its detractors believe that it fails to address the increasingly urgent issue of funding the enormous german system .
it makes no mention of reducing cost , they say , but simply spreads the cost risk differently .
in the wake of the financial crisis , saving costs has become more important then ever .
after numerous attempts at resuscitation , the solidarity principle introduced by bismarck could well be on its last legs , and germany 's two leading parties can not agree whether it should be kept on life-support .
social democrat ulla schmidt , for one , would like to give it another chance and abolish private health insurance altogether .
but ultimately , today 's social and economic forces are nudging germany more in the direction of a healthcare system built on individual responsibility .
the issue will certainly be on voters ' minds when they go to the polls this month .

the isaf troops then engaged the militants in a fire fight .
no civilians or german soldiers were injured in the battle .
the german statement said that nato planes then launched the attack in response to a call for air support . german military confirm air attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato troops and afghan policemen are still investigating the incident while the german military did not say whether the airstrike was responsible for the tanker blast , a german army spokesman in berlin admitted that the tankers exploded during the battle .
kunduz provincial governor mohammad omar later said that local residents claimed a military jet fired at the tanker , setting off the explosion . captain jon stock , press officer for isaf , later told the reuters news agency : " i can confirm that there was an airstrike last night or early this morning .
isaf 's target in the air raid was insurgents . "
however , he said he was unable to comment on the reports of the blast . in the wake of the attack , reports of casualties at the scene varied , with the german army saying that 56 militants were killed in the blast while the local authorities put the number of civilian dead at 45 .
a security officer who asked to remain anonymous told reporters that 200 people were killed and wounded in the explosion while residents put the number of casualties at 300 . european leaders begin to speak out following the attack , british prime minster gordon brown confirmed that he would not be backing down or changing the government 's afghanistan policy in any way . speaking at the international institute for strategic studies -lrb- iiss -rrb- in london , brown said that the stability of the volatile region , spanning the afghan-pakistan border , had a profound impact on the security of britain and the rest of the international community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister brown refuses to back down " we can not just walk away , " said brown , adding that the objectives in the conflict were " clear , justified , realistic and achievable . " brown announced that his government would provide an extra 20 million pounds -lrb- 23 million euros / $ 32 million -rrb- to help stabilization and security efforts in helmand province , where british troops are based .
british foreign secretary david miliband called for an " urgent investigation " into the nato airstrike . nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen responded by saying that there would be a thorough investigation into the incident . " the afghan people should know that we are clearly committed to protecting them and that we will fully and immediately investigate this incident , " rasmussen told reporters . increased instability in previously safe north bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local afghan people have begun burying their villagers killed in the nato airstrike the incident is likely to cause more outrage among an afghan population which has been increasingly angered and frustrated by the rising civilian death toll and the apparent failure of the western forces to stabilize the country . the airstrike also serves as another example of the disintegrating state of security in the previously safe northern provinces of the country and the overall doggedness and endurance of the taliban across the whole of afghanistan .
despite us military surges and diverted troop deployments from iraq , many areas of the country remain in a state of war . the presidential vote on august 20 , which was meant to be an indication of how far the country had come since the end of taliban rule eight years ago , was marred by violence and intimidation as counter-insurgents targeted polling stations as well as afghan soldiers and isaf troops . mrm / nda / dpa / ap / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a berlin musicologist says he knows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was she the one ?
everyone knows the melody to ludwig van beethoven 's piano piece " fuer elise , " but elise 's true identity has remained a mystery .
now a german musicologist says he 's discovered who she really was . from hard rock and jazz to cabaret and ring tones , " fuer elise " is the quintessential example of the popularization of classical music .
if beethoven got royalties , he 'd be a wealthy man . while everyone knows the melody to the short piano piece in a minor , few stop to wonder what was behind the intimate dedication . berlin musicologist klaus martin kopitz believes he has uncovered elise 's true identity - while he was n't even looking for it . " for years , i 've been working on a publication called ' beethoven in the eyes of his contemporaries , ' which includes all the reports from people who knew beethoven personally : journals , letters , poems , memoires , " said kopitz .
" certain women are mentioned , and one of them was elisabeth roeckel . " a close friendship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roeckel was an accomplished pianist elisabeth roeckel , born in 1793 , was the younger sister of singer joseph roeckel , who sang the role of florestan in beethoven 's opera " fidelio , " and became a good friend of the composer 's .
elise was also musically inclined - she played the piano and later became a singer . in her circle of friends , she was affectionately referred to as " elise . "
in the spring of 1810 , she went to bamberg to work in theater , with the hope of impressing none other than eta hoffman , who was the theater manager there at the time . according to kopitz , beethoven dedicated the a-minor piano piece " in the memory of " elise because they were separated when she relocated to bamberg .
since elisabeth roeckel was referred to in the dedication as " elise " and not the more formal " fraeulein roeckel , " she must have known beethoven well , said kopitz . indeed , their relationship was documented , as elise herself had written about it . beethoven the flirt " according to what she wrote , -lrb- their relationship -rrb- must have been close , " said kopitz .
in a letter , elise wrote about an evening with the composer , the famous guitarist mauro giuliani , and composer johann nepomuk hummel , who would later become her husband . " she wrote that beethoven , true to his frisky rhenish disposition , would n't stop teasing her and she did n't know what to do , " said the musicologist .
" he had pinched her arm out of sheer affection , " added kopitz . that elise chose hummel instead apparently did not mean the end of their friendship with beethoven .
several days before the composer 's death in march 1827 , elise visited him .
to remember her former admirer , she cut off a lock of his hair and accepted one of his quills as a present . how , then , could elisabeth roeckel have remained a mystery to musicologists over all the years ?
and why has the piece so often been attributed to therese malfatti , who beethoven proposed to in 1810 ? bildunterschrift : the beethoven archive and the composer 's birth house are located in bonn original manuscript has disappeared the beethoven scholar ludwig nohl -lrb- 1831-1885 -rrb- may be to blame .
when he discovered a draft of the work , he published it in 1865 with a dedication to therese .
nohl claimed to have seen the original manuscript , saying it had been discovered in therese 's estate , but it has never been found since . all that exists is an incomplete draft of the work , sketched on a sheet of paper beethoven had apparently used for brainstorming other works .
this has been dated to 1810 , around the time of beethoven 's engagement to therese malfatti . if , however , the a-minor melody was indeed composed for elise and not therese , it is not immediately apparent how and why the original manuscript could have made it into therese 's hands . kopitz admitted that his theory on this point is not particularly scientific : " therese malfatti comes to beethoven 's house and sees the " fuer elise " manuscript lying on top of his piano , so she asks ' who is this elise ?
do you still want to marry me ? '
at that point he was embarrassed that he had written the piece for elise when he really wanted to marry therese . " what does it matter ? the musicologist 's theory is currently in the process of being published and has not yet garnered widespread acceptance in the field . the director of the beethoven archive at the beethoven house in bonn , bernhard appel , said he was skeptical of kopitz ' hypothesis , though he emphasized that he could not make a conclusion until the report was available for detailed review . " elise was a very common name in vienna at the time , " said appel , so the dedication could have referred to any number of women .
he added that , to prove who elise really was , it would be essential to clarify what path the manuscript took before it disappeared . " would the music change if we knew who it was dedicated to ? " questioned appel .

a berlin musicologist says he knows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was she the one ?
everyone knows the melody to ludwig van beethoven 's piano piece " fuer elise , " but elise 's true identity has remained a mystery .
now a german musicologist says he 's discovered who she really was . from hard rock and jazz to cabaret and ring tones , " fuer elise " is the quintessential example of the popularization of classical music .
if beethoven got royalties , he 'd be a wealthy man . while everyone knows the melody to the short piano piece in a minor , few stop to wonder what was behind the intimate dedication . berlin musicologist klaus martin kopitz believes he has uncovered elise 's true identity - while he was n't even looking for it . " for years , i 've been working on a publication called ' beethoven in the eyes of his contemporaries , ' which includes all the reports from people who knew beethoven personally : journals , letters , poems , memoires , " said kopitz .
" certain women are mentioned , and one of them was elisabeth roeckel . " a close friendship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roeckel was an accomplished pianist elisabeth roeckel , born in 1793 , was the younger sister of singer joseph roeckel , who sang the role of florestan in beethoven 's opera " fidelio , " and became a good friend of the composer 's .
elise was also musically inclined - she played the piano and later became a singer . in her circle of friends , she was affectionately referred to as " elise . "
in the spring of 1810 , she went to bamberg to work in theater , with the hope of impressing none other than eta hoffman , who was the theater manager there at the time . according to kopitz , beethoven dedicated the a-minor piano piece " in the memory of " elise because they were separated when she relocated to bamberg .
since elisabeth roeckel was referred to in the dedication as " elise " and not the more formal " fraeulein roeckel , " she must have known beethoven well , said kopitz . indeed , their relationship was documented , as elise herself had written about it . beethoven the flirt " according to what she wrote , -lrb- their relationship -rrb- must have been close , " said kopitz .
in a letter , elise wrote about an evening with the composer , the famous guitarist mauro giuliani , and composer johann nepomuk hummel , who would later become her husband . " she wrote that beethoven , true to his frisky rhenish disposition , would n't stop teasing her and she did n't know what to do , " said the musicologist .
" he had pinched her arm out of sheer affection , " added kopitz . that elise chose hummel instead apparently did not mean the end of their friendship with beethoven .
several days before the composer 's death in march 1827 , elise visited him .
to remember her former admirer , she cut off a lock of his hair and accepted one of his quills as a present . how , then , could elisabeth roeckel have remained a mystery to musicologists over all the years ?
and why has the piece so often been attributed to therese malfatti , who beethoven proposed to in 1810 ? bildunterschrift : the beethoven archive and the composer 's birth house are located in bonn original manuscript has disappeared the beethoven scholar ludwig nohl -lrb- 1831-1885 -rrb- may be to blame .
when he discovered a draft of the work , he published it in 1865 with a dedication to therese .
nohl claimed to have seen the original manuscript , saying it had been discovered in therese 's estate , but it has never been found since . all that exists is an incomplete draft of the work , sketched on a sheet of paper beethoven had apparently used for brainstorming other works .
this has been dated to 1810 , around the time of beethoven 's engagement to therese malfatti . if , however , the a-minor melody was indeed composed for elise and not therese , it is not immediately apparent how and why the original manuscript could have made it into therese 's hands . kopitz admitted that his theory on this point is not particularly scientific : " therese malfatti comes to beethoven 's house and sees the " fuer elise " manuscript lying on top of his piano , so she asks ' who is this elise ?
do you still want to marry me ? '
at that point he was embarrassed that he had written the piece for elise when he really wanted to marry therese . " what does it matter ? the musicologist 's theory is currently in the process of being published and has not yet garnered widespread acceptance in the field . the director of the beethoven archive at the beethoven house in bonn , bernhard appel , said he was skeptical of kopitz ' hypothesis , though he emphasized that he could not make a conclusion until the report was available for detailed review . " elise was a very common name in vienna at the time , " said appel , so the dedication could have referred to any number of women .
he added that , to prove who elise really was , it would be essential to clarify what path the manuscript took before it disappeared . " would the music change if we knew who it was dedicated to ? " questioned appel .
for those who use it as their mobile phone ring tone , probably not . author : anastassia boutsko -lrb- cn -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

those hoping that a second irish referendum on the eu 's lisbon treaty will remove one of the largest stumbling blocks to the eu reform document ’ s ratification will be disappointed by news that has come out of dublin . polls and government ministers revealed a slump in support for the treaty among the populace of the recession-hit country ahead of the plebiscite next month .
public opinion was gauged by a face-to-face poll with 1,000 voters earlier this week conducted by the tns mrbi market research company .
the survey , published in the friday edition of the irish times , showed opposition to the treaty stood at 29 percent , increasing one point since the last poll in may , with support dropping eight points to 46 percent in the same time span .
the number of voters who remained undecided stood at 25 percent , an increase of seven points .
in an article which accompanied the results , the irish times ' political editor , stephen collins , wrote that " a striking feature of the latest poll is that most of those who have left the ' yes ' camp have moved into the ' do n't know ' category rather than shifting into the ' no ' camp . "
if the poll results were not gloomy enough , irish foreign minister michael martin admitted that the government was pessimistic about the october 2 referendum but that he believed that , while it would be difficult to secure ratification , he expected a slim vote in favor .
" i was never under any illusion but that it would be difficult to secure this but i do think we can do it , " he told national radio broadcaster rte .
" there is a very significant challenge ahead , it 's going to be a very tight campaign and it will demand all of the resources , conviction , politics and passion of all of those on the yes side . "
brussels concessions led to second referendum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : support is slipping for the lisbio treaty as the vote nears ireland is the only member of the 27-nation eu which is constitutionally bound to hold a referendum on the treaty , which is designed to overhaul of the eu 's foreign policy-making and internal decision-making in a greatly expanded bloc .
irish voters threw the ratification process into chaos last year when they rejected the treaty in the first referendum .
irish voters rejected the pact in a referendum held in june , partly out of concerns that their country would lose the right to nominate a commissioner to the eu 's executive and concerns that the treaty would contravene the country 's constitution on issues relating to the right to life , education and family policy .
the decision to launch a second referendum came after opinion polls showed voters would back it this time after dublin won concessions from brussels on key policy areas .
these included the guarantee that ireland 's traditional policy of neutrality would be maintained and that the lisbon treaty would not impinge on ireland 's right to set tax levels .
the eu also agreed that ireland would retain the right to an eu commissioner .
backlash could lead to potential " no " vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brian cowen 's government is also losing support despite the fact that the previous three opinion polls conducted this year showed solid support for the treaty , it is believed that the growing dissatisfaction with the irish government 's handling of the financial crisis has turned an anti-government backlash into a vote against ratification .
prime minister brian cowen 's government has itself been faced with some uncomfortable reading in recent polls .
the latest showed that 75 percent of voters would like to see him ousted , while support for the prime minister 's fianna fail party dropped to a record low of 17 percent .
for the lisbon treaty to come into force , it has to be ratified by all 27 eu states .
poland and the czech republic , currently led by euro-skeptic presidents , have said that they will wait for ireland 's vote before signing it into law .
if ireland were to vote “ no ” for a second time , observers say it could derail the treaty for good. nda / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the survey , published in the friday edition of the irish times , showed opposition to the treaty stood at 29 percent , increasing one point since the last poll in may , with support dropping eight points to 46 percent in the same time span .
the number of voters who remained undecided stood at 25 percent , an increase of seven points .
in an article which accompanied the results , the irish times ' political editor , stephen collins , wrote that " a striking feature of the latest poll is that most of those who have left the ' yes ' camp have moved into the ' do n't know ' category rather than shifting into the ' no ' camp . "
if the poll results were not gloomy enough , irish foreign minister michael martin admitted that the government was pessimistic about the october 2 referendum but that he believed that , while it would be difficult to secure ratification , he expected a slim vote in favor .
" i was never under any illusion but that it would be difficult to secure this but i do think we can do it , " he told national radio broadcaster rte .
" there is a very significant challenge ahead , it 's going to be a very tight campaign and it will demand all of the resources , conviction , politics and passion of all of those on the yes side . "
brussels concessions led to second referendum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : support is slipping for the lisbio treaty as the vote nears ireland is the only member of the 27-nation eu which is constitutionally bound to hold a referendum on the treaty , which is designed to overhaul of the eu 's foreign policy-making and internal decision-making in a greatly expanded bloc .
irish voters threw the ratification process into chaos last year when they rejected the treaty in the first referendum .
irish voters rejected the pact in a referendum held in june , partly out of concerns that their country would lose the right to nominate a commissioner to the eu 's executive and concerns that the treaty would contravene the country 's constitution on issues relating to the right to life , education and family policy .
the decision to launch a second referendum came after opinion polls showed voters would back it this time after dublin won concessions from brussels on key policy areas .
these included the guarantee that ireland 's traditional policy of neutrality would be maintained and that the lisbon treaty would not impinge on ireland 's right to set tax levels .
the eu also agreed that ireland would retain the right to an eu commissioner .
backlash could lead to potential " no " vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brian cowen 's government is also losing support despite the fact that the previous three opinion polls conducted this year showed solid support for the treaty , it is believed that the growing dissatisfaction with the irish government 's handling of the financial crisis has turned an anti-government backlash into a vote against ratification .
prime minister brian cowen 's government has itself been faced with some uncomfortable reading in recent polls .
the latest showed that 75 percent of voters would like to see him ousted , while support for the prime minister 's fianna fail party dropped to a record low of 17 percent .
for the lisbon treaty to come into force , it has to be ratified by all 27 eu states .
poland and the czech republic , currently led by euro-skeptic presidents , have said that they will wait for ireland 's vote before signing it into law .
if ireland were to vote “ no ” for a second time , observers say it could derail the treaty for good. nda / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but since berlin provided opel with a 1.5-billion-euro bridging loan to help the car group through its current upheaval , it has a decisive say in the outcome - and would like to see opel sold to magna international .
the german government has endorsed a bid from the austrian-canadian auto supplier to acquire a majority holding in opel by offering state-backed guarantees worth about 4.5 billion euros .
magna is leading a joint bid with state-owned russian bank sberbank and russia 's second-largest auto maker , gaz .

" if they are ready to engage with us , we 're ready to cooperate with them , " said swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country holds the eu presidency , as he arrived at the talks in stockholm .
" but if they decide to go for confrontation , then confrontation will happen , " he told reporters .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , speaking at a separate press conference , said europe needed to remain united in its opposition to iran 's nuclear program .
" i think it 's very important for us to be gathered firmly in the eu 's reaction towards iran , not accepting nuclear ambitions , " he said .
germany 's deputy minister for foreign affairs , guenter gloser , however , said it was pointless to impose more sanctions on iran , pointing out that such actions in the past had yet to bring about any positive change .
" but something must be done to prevent a nuclear arms race in the middle east , " he added .
iran says nuclear endeavors are peaceful a defiant president mahmoud ahmadinejad said on thursday that iran is ready for more sanctions over its nuclear program and will not bow to pressure in meeting any deadline set by world powers .
however tehran has also said it was willing to begin fresh talks with the six major powers - britain , china , france , russia and the united states , plus germany - regarding its nuclear drive .
iran continues to insist its nuclear work is peaceful , while western countries suspect that iran is attempting to build atomic weapons .
the un security council has already slapped three rounds of sanctions on the islamic republic , but pressure is growing for more .
minister appointment further " provocation " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bildt has called iran 's policies " provocative " meanwhile , reinfeldt called president ahmadinejad 's appointment of international terror suspect ahmad vahidi as defense minister a sign of a desire to worsen relations between iran and the west .
" we feel this is a situation that simply returns to provocations .
the appointment of -lsb- vahdi -rsb- is another one of these examples , " reinfeldt told reporters .
vahidi is wanted by interpol in connection with a 1994 attack on a jewish charity that killed 85 people. glb / reuters / ap / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they also warned that the global crisis is n't over yet . finance ministers from the world 's 20 leading economies have set their sights on multi-million euro bonuses paid to some bankers .
the explosive issue of bank bonuses is being pushed by europe 's largest economies .
" our citizens are deeply shocked at the revival of reprehensible practices , despite taxpayers ' money having been mobilized to support the financial sector , " chancellor angela merkel , british prime minister gordon brown and french president nicolas sarkozy said in a letter released before the start of the meeting .
sarkozy has called for bankers ' bonuses to be capped , an idea which found broad support among european finance ministers earlier this week .
britain has been reluctant to support a cap , for fear it could cause bankers to move their business out of london .
but there is british support for tying bonuses to long-term performance .
the bonus practices are seen as helping create banking culture which critics say is too focused on risky , short-term gains .
one issue which germany is expected to push is for rules limiting the size of banks .
" no bank should be allowed to become so big that it can blackmail governments , " merkel said earlier this week .
crisis not over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , sarkozy and brown warned that tough times are still to come british finance minister alistair darling , the host of the g-20 meeting , warned against complacency in an interview with the independent newspaper .
" the biggest single risk to recovery is that people think the job is done .
there is a real risk that either governments or people generally think ' we have done that , we are on the path to recovery , ' " he said .
that feeling was echoed by merkel , brown and sarkozy , who warned that we have not yet seen the end of the global economic crisis .
they urged colleagues to continue exercising " prudence and caution " saying that a bumpy road lies ahead .
besides bankers ' bonuses , finance ministers will also discuss how to go forward with huge stimulus packages introduced at the beginning of the crisis .
while g-20 countries need to show their commitment to implementing stimulus plans , they also need to begin coordinating exit strategies once the crisis has ended , the three leaders said .
germany is concerned about inflation and has talked about the need to ease up on stimulus spending .
britain , which is still in a recession , has been more cautious .
" we must be careful to avoid laying the foundations of new global imbalances , " the leaders wrote .
the talks , being held friday and saturday , will lay the groundwork for an upcoming meeting of g-20 leaders in pittsburgh , us. th / reuters / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we the government have done the homework , the contracts have been drawn up , and now the ball is in general motors ' court , " said economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg on german television on friday , sept .
4 .
but since berlin provided opel with a 1.5-billion-euro bridging loan to help the car group through its current upheaval , it has a decisive say in the outcome - and would like to see opel sold to magna international .
the german government has endorsed a bid from the austrian-canadian auto supplier to acquire a majority holding in opel by offering state-backed guarantees worth about 4.5 billion euros .
magna is leading a joint bid with state-owned russian bank sberbank and russia 's second-largest auto maker , gaz .
chancellor angela merkel told the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung on friday that magna 's concept was " the most viable and the most sustainable . "
but she also stressed that gm had to make its own mind up .
" we hope -lrb- its decision -rrb- will be in the interests of the company and its employees , " she said .
decision time the head of general motors in europe said magna was indeed well positioned to win the drawn-out battle to take over the us car maker 's opel division .
german daily die welt this week quoted carl-peter forster as saying that magna would " most likely " win the takeover bid since all the contracts and financing were in place for it to do so .
but he did not rule out the possibility that gm could keep control of opel and gm 's british-based vauxhall division instead .
speculation has been rife that gm is considering retaining control instead of hiving off a majority stake in the group , which includes the opel and british vauxhall brands .
quoting what it said was a gm official involved in the negotiations , the wall street journal reported that the auto group was prepared to pour more than 1 billion euros of its own money into restructuring opel .
according to german press agency dpa , gm has been considering the investment plan in the event that it fails to sell off the majority stake in opel to the groups bidding for control .
" should the negotiations with the bidders not reach a satisfactory result then alternatives must be examined , " said a source close to the negotiations .
weighing the options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg says it 's decision time the general motors board decided last month against making a decision on opel , with company officials indicating that gm would like berlin to consider an alternative offer for its european subsidiary , drawn up by the brussels-based private equity group rhj international .
rhj international earlier this week raised its offer for a 50.1-percent stake in what has been described as the new opel by 25 million to 300 million euros in cash .
the talks over opel come at a crucial time for german chancellor angela merkel , with parliamentary elections just weeks away .
the other european nations where opel has operations - spain , britain and poland - have been concerned that the financial support offered by berlin meant that they would bear the brunt of any cost cutting launched by the new owners of opel .

" we the government have done the homework , the contracts have been drawn up , and now the ball is in general motors ' court , " said economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg on german television on friday , sept .
4 .
but since berlin provided opel with a 1.5-billion-euro bridging loan to help the car group through its current upheaval , it has a decisive say in the outcome - and would like to see opel sold to magna international .
the german government has endorsed a bid from the austrian-canadian auto supplier to acquire a majority holding in opel by offering state-backed guarantees worth about 4.5 billion euros .
magna is leading a joint bid with state-owned russian bank sberbank and russia 's second-largest auto maker , gaz .
chancellor angela merkel told the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung on friday that magna 's concept was " the most viable and the most sustainable . "
but she also stressed that gm had to make its own mind up .
" we hope -lrb- its decision -rrb- will be in the interests of the company and its employees , " she said .
decision time the head of general motors in europe said magna was indeed well positioned to win the drawn-out battle to take over the us car maker 's opel division .
german daily die welt this week quoted carl-peter forster as saying that magna would " most likely " win the takeover bid since all the contracts and financing were in place for it to do so .
but he did not rule out the possibility that gm could keep control of opel and gm 's british-based vauxhall division instead .
speculation has been rife that gm is considering retaining control instead of hiving off a majority stake in the group , which includes the opel and british vauxhall brands .
quoting what it said was a gm official involved in the negotiations , the wall street journal reported that the auto group was prepared to pour more than 1 billion euros of its own money into restructuring opel .
according to german press agency dpa , gm has been considering the investment plan in the event that it fails to sell off the majority stake in opel to the groups bidding for control .
" should the negotiations with the bidders not reach a satisfactory result then alternatives must be examined , " said a source close to the negotiations .
weighing the options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg says it 's decision time the general motors board decided last month against making a decision on opel , with company officials indicating that gm would like berlin to consider an alternative offer for its european subsidiary , drawn up by the brussels-based private equity group rhj international .
rhj international earlier this week raised its offer for a 50.1-percent stake in what has been described as the new opel by 25 million to 300 million euros in cash .
the talks over opel come at a crucial time for german chancellor angela merkel , with parliamentary elections just weeks away .
the other european nations where opel has operations - spain , britain and poland - have been concerned that the financial support offered by berlin meant that they would bear the brunt of any cost cutting launched by the new owners of opel .

they also warned that the global crisis is n't over yet . finance ministers from the world 's 20 leading economies have set their sights on multi-million euro bonuses paid to some bankers .
the explosive issue of bank bonuses is being pushed by europe 's largest economies .
" our citizens are deeply shocked at the revival of reprehensible practices , despite taxpayers ' money having been mobilized to support the financial sector , " chancellor angela merkel , british prime minister gordon brown and french president nicolas sarkozy said in a letter released before the start of the meeting .
sarkozy has called for bankers ' bonuses to be capped , an idea which found broad support among european finance ministers earlier this week .
britain has been reluctant to support a cap , for fear it could cause bankers to move their business out of london .
but there is british support for tying bonuses to long-term performance .
the bonus practices are seen as helping create banking culture which critics say is too focused on risky , short-term gains .
one issue which germany is expected to push is for rules limiting the size of banks .
" no bank should be allowed to become so big that it can blackmail governments , " merkel said earlier this week .

" the biggest single risk to recovery is that people think the job is done .
there is a real risk that either governments or people generally think ' we have done that , we are on the path to recovery , ' " he said .
that feeling was echoed by merkel , brown and sarkozy , who warned that we have not yet seen the end of the global economic crisis .
they urged colleagues to continue exercising " prudence and caution " saying that a bumpy road lies ahead .
besides bankers ' bonuses , finance ministers will also discuss how to go forward with huge stimulus packages introduced at the beginning of the crisis .
while g-20 countries need to show their commitment to implementing stimulus plans , they also need to begin coordinating exit strategies once the crisis has ended , the three leaders said .
germany is concerned about inflation and has talked about the need to ease up on stimulus spending .
britain , which is still in a recession , has been more cautious .
" we must be careful to avoid laying the foundations of new global imbalances , " the leaders wrote .

they also warned that the global crisis is n't over yet . finance ministers from the world 's 20 leading economies have set their sights on multi-million euro bonuses paid to some bankers .
the explosive issue of bank bonuses is being pushed by europe 's largest economies .
" our citizens are deeply shocked at the revival of reprehensible practices , despite taxpayers ' money having been mobilized to support the financial sector , " chancellor angela merkel , british prime minister gordon brown and french president nicolas sarkozy said in a letter released before the start of the meeting .
sarkozy has called for bankers ' bonuses to be capped , an idea which found broad support among european finance ministers earlier this week .
britain has been reluctant to support a cap , for fear it could cause bankers to move their business out of london .
but there is british support for tying bonuses to long-term performance .
the bonus practices are seen as helping create banking culture which critics say is too focused on risky , short-term gains .
one issue which germany is expected to push is for rules limiting the size of banks .
" no bank should be allowed to become so big that it can blackmail governments , " merkel said earlier this week .
crisis not over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , sarkozy and brown warned that tough times are still to come british finance minister alistair darling , the host of the g-20 meeting , warned against complacency in an interview with the independent newspaper .
" the biggest single risk to recovery is that people think the job is done .
there is a real risk that either governments or people generally think ' we have done that , we are on the path to recovery , ' " he said .
that feeling was echoed by merkel , brown and sarkozy , who warned that we have not yet seen the end of the global economic crisis .
they urged colleagues to continue exercising " prudence and caution " saying that a bumpy road lies ahead .

the bonus practices are seen as helping create banking culture which critics say is too focused on risky , short-term gains .
one issue which germany is expected to push is for rules limiting the size of banks .
" no bank should be allowed to become so big that it can blackmail governments , " merkel said earlier this week .
crisis not over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , sarkozy and brown warned that tough times are still to come british finance minister alistair darling , the host of the g-20 meeting , warned against complacency in an interview with the independent newspaper .
" the biggest single risk to recovery is that people think the job is done .
there is a real risk that either governments or people generally think ' we have done that , we are on the path to recovery , ' " he said .
that feeling was echoed by merkel , brown and sarkozy , who warned that we have not yet seen the end of the global economic crisis .
they urged colleagues to continue exercising " prudence and caution " saying that a bumpy road lies ahead .
besides bankers ' bonuses , finance ministers will also discuss how to go forward with huge stimulus packages introduced at the beginning of the crisis .
while g-20 countries need to show their commitment to implementing stimulus plans , they also need to begin coordinating exit strategies once the crisis has ended , the three leaders said .
germany is concerned about inflation and has talked about the need to ease up on stimulus spending .
britain , which is still in a recession , has been more cautious .
" we must be careful to avoid laying the foundations of new global imbalances , " the leaders wrote .
the talks , being held friday and saturday , will lay the groundwork for an upcoming meeting of g-20 leaders in pittsburgh , us. th / reuters / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" but if they decide to go for confrontation , then confrontation will happen , " he told reporters .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , speaking at a separate press conference , said europe needed to remain united in its opposition to iran 's nuclear program .
" i think it 's very important for us to be gathered firmly in the eu 's reaction towards iran , not accepting nuclear ambitions , " he said .
germany 's deputy minister for foreign affairs , guenter gloser , however , said it was pointless to impose more sanctions on iran , pointing out that such actions in the past had yet to bring about any positive change .

germany 's healthcare system has experienced all manner of nips and tucks since it was introduced over 125 years ago but it 's nonetheless showing its age .
the election might decide whether it gets a new lease of life . health insurance in germany has come a long way since sickness cover was introduced in 1883 under kaiser wilhelm i and his chancellor , otto von bismarck .
at the time , the average german worked a 60-hour week for a pittance , and sickness or accidents meant a very real threat of starvation .
public dissatisfaction was widespread , and it was against this backdrop that germany started on the long road towards the welfare state it still more or less is .
but these days , less is the operative word .
the social solidarity that has traditionally underpinned the german healthcare system is looking increasingly frail .
the basic problem is that german society is ageing , while its birth rate is sinking .
this means that healthcare costs are rising while fewer people are paying into the system .
many believe that what the only way to rejuvenate the system is to expose it to market forces .
rising costs but this would mark a dramatic break with bismarck 's original program .
made up of health insurance ; accident insurance ; disability insurance and an old-age retirement pension , it was based from the outset on the principle of solidarity : anyone who was employed was obliged to pay into the system and anyone who fell ill would receive medical care and a living allowance .
the cost was divided between employers and the employed - the employers contributing one third , the workers two thirds .
the ratio has changed since then - and so have many other aspects of the german health care service .
the last 20 years alone have seen 14 health care reforms .
while the initial health care restructuring was designed to provide more efficient and cost-effective healthcare services , the most recent reforms focus more on the structure of health insurance funds .
one way or another , most of them have been bad news for the public .
personal contributions to dental care and medicine costs have gone up , and patients now have to pay a mandatory 10 euros -lrb- $ 14 -rrb- per quarter whenever they go to the doctor .
dissatisfaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private patients are more lucrative so although the german healthcare services are still more or less all-inclusive , the cracks are showing .
and it 's not just patients who are noticing .
medical and healthcare professionals also say that conditions are worsening .
" everything has gone downhill , " says one nurse who works in a hospital in bonn .
" we all have less time , there are so many cuts , patients are dissatisfied , especially the elderly ones . "
doctors are also fed up , and say the system is flawed .
dorothee keltz is a gp with a practice in bonn .
she believes it 's important to take the time to talk to patients , and resents the fact that insurers prefer to see doctors using technical equipment .
" if one of my assistants does a cardiogram and we tell the patient what our findings are , we make three times as much money as we would if we spent 10 minutes talking to the patient , " she complains .
another problem is that doctors have had to start relying on private patients to stay afloat .
in germany , only 10 percent of the population has private , for-profit insurance - mostly civil servants and the self-employed .
increasingly , doctors are realizing that patients with state health cover are just not profitable enough .
patients as pawns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german health care is the fourth most expensive in the world still , the stakes are high .
the german health care system averages an annual turnover of over 250 billion euros , making it one of the nation 's most important economic sectors .
it 's also a sector in which powerful interest groups from trade associations to pharmaceuticals companies are constantly jockeying for position .
german health minister ulla schmidt is well aware of the tensions .
" no other sector has the financial clout of the health service , " she says .
" the amount of money spent on it exceeds the entire federal budget .
the sector 's players are dealing with huge funds with which they can buy opinion , influence opinion and promote their products .
in this respect it is patients themselves who are in the weakest position , even though they should be the strongest , because 70 million people in germany have state health cover . "
but the public is often little more than a pawn in a game , and has little insight into what is being spent and how .
the new cornerstone for funding german health care spending is the controversial and highly complex ' gesundheitsfond ' , the health care fund .
supposedly , it aims to simplify health benefits , provide more choices , increase transparency and create competition among providers .
but its detractors believe that it fails to address the increasingly urgent issue of funding the enormous german system .
it makes no mention of reducing cost , they say , but simply spreads the cost risk differently .
in the wake of the financial crisis , saving costs has become more important then ever .
after numerous attempts at resuscitation , the solidarity principle introduced by bismarck could well be on its last legs , and germany 's two leading parties can not agree whether it should be kept on life-support .
social democrat ulla schmidt , for one , would like to give it another chance and abolish private health insurance altogether .
but ultimately , today 's social and economic forces are nudging germany more in the direction of a healthcare system built on individual responsibility .
the issue will certainly be on voters ' minds when they go to the polls this month .

germany 's healthcare system has experienced all manner of nips and tucks since it was introduced over 125 years ago but it 's nonetheless showing its age .
the election might decide whether it gets a new lease of life . health insurance in germany has come a long way since sickness cover was introduced in 1883 under kaiser wilhelm i and his chancellor , otto von bismarck .
at the time , the average german worked a 60-hour week for a pittance , and sickness or accidents meant a very real threat of starvation .
public dissatisfaction was widespread , and it was against this backdrop that germany started on the long road towards the welfare state it still more or less is .
but these days , less is the operative word .
the social solidarity that has traditionally underpinned the german healthcare system is looking increasingly frail .
the basic problem is that german society is ageing , while its birth rate is sinking .
this means that healthcare costs are rising while fewer people are paying into the system .
many believe that what the only way to rejuvenate the system is to expose it to market forces .
rising costs but this would mark a dramatic break with bismarck 's original program .
made up of health insurance ; accident insurance ; disability insurance and an old-age retirement pension , it was based from the outset on the principle of solidarity : anyone who was employed was obliged to pay into the system and anyone who fell ill would receive medical care and a living allowance .
the cost was divided between employers and the employed - the employers contributing one third , the workers two thirds .
the ratio has changed since then - and so have many other aspects of the german health care service .
the last 20 years alone have seen 14 health care reforms .
while the initial health care restructuring was designed to provide more efficient and cost-effective healthcare services , the most recent reforms focus more on the structure of health insurance funds .
one way or another , most of them have been bad news for the public .
personal contributions to dental care and medicine costs have gone up , and patients now have to pay a mandatory 10 euros -lrb- $ 14 -rrb- per quarter whenever they go to the doctor .
dissatisfaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private patients are more lucrative so although the german healthcare services are still more or less all-inclusive , the cracks are showing .
and it 's not just patients who are noticing .
medical and healthcare professionals also say that conditions are worsening .
" everything has gone downhill , " says one nurse who works in a hospital in bonn .
" we all have less time , there are so many cuts , patients are dissatisfied , especially the elderly ones . "
doctors are also fed up , and say the system is flawed .
dorothee keltz is a gp with a practice in bonn .
she believes it 's important to take the time to talk to patients , and resents the fact that insurers prefer to see doctors using technical equipment .
" if one of my assistants does a cardiogram and we tell the patient what our findings are , we make three times as much money as we would if we spent 10 minutes talking to the patient , " she complains .
another problem is that doctors have had to start relying on private patients to stay afloat .
in germany , only 10 percent of the population has private , for-profit insurance - mostly civil servants and the self-employed .
increasingly , doctors are realizing that patients with state health cover are just not profitable enough .
patients as pawns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german health care is the fourth most expensive in the world still , the stakes are high .
the german health care system averages an annual turnover of over 250 billion euros , making it one of the nation 's most important economic sectors .
it 's also a sector in which powerful interest groups from trade associations to pharmaceuticals companies are constantly jockeying for position .
german health minister ulla schmidt is well aware of the tensions .
" no other sector has the financial clout of the health service , " she says .
" the amount of money spent on it exceeds the entire federal budget .
the sector 's players are dealing with huge funds with which they can buy opinion , influence opinion and promote their products .
in this respect it is patients themselves who are in the weakest position , even though they should be the strongest , because 70 million people in germany have state health cover . "
but the public is often little more than a pawn in a game , and has little insight into what is being spent and how .
the new cornerstone for funding german health care spending is the controversial and highly complex ' gesundheitsfond ' , the health care fund .
supposedly , it aims to simplify health benefits , provide more choices , increase transparency and create competition among providers .
but its detractors believe that it fails to address the increasingly urgent issue of funding the enormous german system .
it makes no mention of reducing cost , they say , but simply spreads the cost risk differently .
in the wake of the financial crisis , saving costs has become more important then ever .
after numerous attempts at resuscitation , the solidarity principle introduced by bismarck could well be on its last legs , and germany 's two leading parties can not agree whether it should be kept on life-support .
social democrat ulla schmidt , for one , would like to give it another chance and abolish private health insurance altogether .
but ultimately , today 's social and economic forces are nudging germany more in the direction of a healthcare system built on individual responsibility .
the issue will certainly be on voters ' minds when they go to the polls this month .

dissatisfaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private patients are more lucrative so although the german healthcare services are still more or less all-inclusive , the cracks are showing .
and it 's not just patients who are noticing .
medical and healthcare professionals also say that conditions are worsening .
" everything has gone downhill , " says one nurse who works in a hospital in bonn .
" we all have less time , there are so many cuts , patients are dissatisfied , especially the elderly ones . "
doctors are also fed up , and say the system is flawed .
dorothee keltz is a gp with a practice in bonn .
she believes it 's important to take the time to talk to patients , and resents the fact that insurers prefer to see doctors using technical equipment .
" if one of my assistants does a cardiogram and we tell the patient what our findings are , we make three times as much money as we would if we spent 10 minutes talking to the patient , " she complains .
another problem is that doctors have had to start relying on private patients to stay afloat .
in germany , only 10 percent of the population has private , for-profit insurance - mostly civil servants and the self-employed .
increasingly , doctors are realizing that patients with state health cover are just not profitable enough .
patients as pawns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german health care is the fourth most expensive in the world still , the stakes are high .
the german health care system averages an annual turnover of over 250 billion euros , making it one of the nation 's most important economic sectors .
it 's also a sector in which powerful interest groups from trade associations to pharmaceuticals companies are constantly jockeying for position .
german health minister ulla schmidt is well aware of the tensions .
" no other sector has the financial clout of the health service , " she says .
" the amount of money spent on it exceeds the entire federal budget .
the sector 's players are dealing with huge funds with which they can buy opinion , influence opinion and promote their products .
in this respect it is patients themselves who are in the weakest position , even though they should be the strongest , because 70 million people in germany have state health cover . "
but the public is often little more than a pawn in a game , and has little insight into what is being spent and how .
the new cornerstone for funding german health care spending is the controversial and highly complex ' gesundheitsfond ' , the health care fund .
supposedly , it aims to simplify health benefits , provide more choices , increase transparency and create competition among providers .
but its detractors believe that it fails to address the increasingly urgent issue of funding the enormous german system .
it makes no mention of reducing cost , they say , but simply spreads the cost risk differently .
in the wake of the financial crisis , saving costs has become more important then ever .
after numerous attempts at resuscitation , the solidarity principle introduced by bismarck could well be on its last legs , and germany 's two leading parties can not agree whether it should be kept on life-support .
social democrat ulla schmidt , for one , would like to give it another chance and abolish private health insurance altogether .
but ultimately , today 's social and economic forces are nudging germany more in the direction of a healthcare system built on individual responsibility .
the issue will certainly be on voters ' minds when they go to the polls this month .

but the thai military is also looking to development programs in efforts to gain support – and vital intelligence - from the local muslim population to gain the upper hand in curbing the violence . across southern thailand ’ s four largely muslim populated provinces the thai army has deployed some 30,000 troops aimed at quelling the five year old islamic insurgency .
a further 30,000 civil volunteers , rangers and police have also been deployed .
across the provinces of pattani , yala , songkhla , and narathiwat there is a climate of fear and uncertainty .
over the years , the military has been accused by human rights groups of heavy-handed crackdowns and allegations of abuse .
these have led to deep animosity and distrust among the local largely muslim communities .
rights groups have called for the government to take action .
emergency powers in the south have given the army wide powers and immunity .
development projects since 2006 , the thai military has sought to steer a course towards winning hearts and minds within local muslim communities .
the government has spent over three billion dollars to boost the economy and security in the south .
lieutenant general pichet wisaijorn , the fourth army commander , is currently overseeing the program led by the internal security operations command -lrb- isoc -rrb- .
pichet says the aim is to work with local communities . “ it ’ s a question of trust , ” he says .
“ now today we have been able to create trust with the people .
we have constant conversations and dialogue with the people .
so in this respect we have substantially tackled the problem . ”
in pattani province the military has set up a training center , leading to hundreds of people gaining the skills to improve crop yields , oversee fish ponds , raise chickens and produce organic fertilizer aimed at reducing costs .
colonel attadet mattanom , an isoc spokesman in southern thailand , hopes the programs will improve local economies and ease sectarian violence .
“ in this area we try to look after the local -lrb- muslim -rrb- people here which are the majority of the population .
they have a sufficient way of living – we try to make it more complete .
if they have sufficient to live they live according to their religion ; then they think they are happy enough . ”
presence of thai military but others raise questions over the policy including the stationing of high levels of military in the region .
surachart bamrungsuk , is a professor in politics at chulalongkorn university .
he says for the thai military a counter insurgency strategy is a new approach .
“ when you ’ re talking about winning the hearts and minds it ’ s not easy because every unit will have its own way of thinking .
for me it would be better if we accept counter insurgency – a need to win at the people level – so the concept of winning hearts and minds would be applicable to the thai army . ”
he says the army is now involved in that process of readjustment . but angkhana neelapaichit , chairperson of rights organization , the working group on justice for peace , says local people need to have more influence over the projects being undertaken .
“ i suggest every project must be from the grass roots people , not only from the bottom-up but from the top down because we should have people participation .
we should ask the people what they want to do ; not what we want to do for them but what they want so we should ask the people . ”
the thai government is moving to place more civilian control over development in the south .
a new body will come under the control of the prime minister ’ s office .
a government spokesman says he was confident the military would support the new measures .

and its coming to a screen near you on saturday . up until just two short decades ago , berlin was split down the middle by a great , dirty wall .
it is not a long chapter in history , yet the city has undergone such monumental change since reunification that the producers felt not only berliners should be party to the party .
hence the project .
the brainchild of producer thomas kufus and director volker heise , the documentary will run for 24 hours straight starting at 6am cet on saturday . that is exactly one year to the day since it was shot . early on the morning of sept .
5 , 2008 , 80 camera teams hit the streets of berlin and spent the subsequent 24 hours collecting footage to depict the myriad lives and fates played out day by day in the german capital .
the end result brings together the destinies of 20 main protagonists and 50 secondary characters and takes viewers into the realms - public and private - of a refuse worker , french journalist , poet , drag queen and drug addict .
there are also sequences with more high profile berlin figures , including the mayor of the city klaus wowereit , conductor daniel barenboim and the editor of the mass-circulation bild newspaper kai diekmann .
exploration of diversity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's left of the berlin wall volker heise said the film was a way to find out how people live in a city of such diversity .
" how do people educate their children ?
what television programs do they watch ?
what do they eat ? " he asked in material outlining the project .
work first began on the 2.8-million-euro -lrb- $ 4-million -rrb- film some three years ago .
besides the protagonists selected to feature in the tele-visual extravaganza , berliners were invited to send in their own contributions .
some of these have made it into the final product .
so , too , has the city itself .
there are multiple shots of the television tower at alexanderplatz , the river spree and other landmarks .
but viewers will also catch glimpses of the smaller spots that make berlin the unique city it is .
in essence , the makers have tried to leave no stone unturned in their portrayal of this 21st-century metropolis .
from the bedroom to the sausage stand , the courtroom to the chancellery , they have set out to capture life as it happens .
and as the introduction is at pains to point out , it is just a normal day : " nothing special is expected to happen .
people will get up and go to work , they will love and hate one another , they will be born and they will die . "
the show begins at 6am central european time and can be seen on arte and berlin public broadcaster , rbb .

they also warned that the global crisis is n't over yet . finance ministers from the world 's 20 leading economies have set their sights on multi-million euro bonuses paid to some bankers .
the explosive issue of bank bonuses is being pushed by europe 's largest economies .
" our citizens are deeply shocked at the revival of reprehensible practices , despite taxpayers ' money having been mobilized to support the financial sector , " chancellor angela merkel , british prime minister gordon brown and french president nicolas sarkozy said in a letter released before the start of the meeting .
sarkozy has called for bankers ' bonuses to be capped , an idea which found broad support among european finance ministers earlier this week .
britain has been reluctant to support a cap , for fear it could cause bankers to move their business out of london .
but there is british support for tying bonuses to long-term performance .
the bonus practices are seen as helping create banking culture which critics say is too focused on risky , short-term gains .
one issue which germany is expected to push is for rules limiting the size of banks .
" no bank should be allowed to become so big that it can blackmail governments , " merkel said earlier this week .

" the biggest single risk to recovery is that people think the job is done .
there is a real risk that either governments or people generally think ' we have done that , we are on the path to recovery , ' " he said .
that feeling was echoed by merkel , brown and sarkozy , who warned that we have not yet seen the end of the global economic crisis .
they urged colleagues to continue exercising " prudence and caution " saying that a bumpy road lies ahead .
besides bankers ' bonuses , finance ministers will also discuss how to go forward with huge stimulus packages introduced at the beginning of the crisis .
while g-20 countries need to show their commitment to implementing stimulus plans , they also need to begin coordinating exit strategies once the crisis has ended , the three leaders said .
germany is concerned about inflation and has talked about the need to ease up on stimulus spending .
britain , which is still in a recession , has been more cautious .

the isaf troops then engaged the militants in a fire fight .
no civilians or german soldiers were injured in the battle .
the german statement said that nato planes then launched the attack in response to a call for air support . german military confirm air attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato troops and afghan policemen are still investigating the incident while the german military did not say whether the airstrike was responsible for the tanker blast , a german army spokesman in berlin admitted that the tankers exploded during the battle .
kunduz provincial governor mohammad omar later said that local residents claimed a military jet fired at the tanker , setting off the explosion . captain jon stock , press officer for isaf , later told the reuters news agency : " i can confirm that there was an airstrike last night or early this morning .
isaf 's target in the air raid was insurgents . "
however , he said he was unable to comment on the reports of the blast . in the wake of the attack , reports of casualties at the scene varied , with the german army saying that 56 militants were killed in the blast while the local authorities put the number of civilian dead at 45 .
a security officer who asked to remain anonymous told reporters that 200 people were killed and wounded in the explosion while residents put the number of casualties at 300 . european leaders begin to speak out following the attack , british prime minster gordon brown confirmed that he would not be backing down or changing the government 's afghanistan policy in any way . speaking at the international institute for strategic studies -lrb- iiss -rrb- in london , brown said that the stability of the volatile region , spanning the afghan-pakistan border , had a profound impact on the security of britain and the rest of the international community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister brown refuses to back down " we can not just walk away , " said brown , adding that the objectives in the conflict were " clear , justified , realistic and achievable . " brown announced that his government would provide an extra 20 million pounds -lrb- 23 million euros / $ 32 million -rrb- to help stabilization and security efforts in helmand province , where british troops are based .
british foreign secretary david miliband called for an " urgent investigation " into the nato airstrike . nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen responded by saying that there would be a thorough investigation into the incident . " the afghan people should know that we are clearly committed to protecting them and that we will fully and immediately investigate this incident , " rasmussen told reporters . increased instability in previously safe north bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local afghan people have begun burying their villagers killed in the nato airstrike the incident is likely to cause more outrage among an afghan population which has been increasingly angered and frustrated by the rising civilian death toll and the apparent failure of the western forces to stabilize the country . the airstrike also serves as another example of the disintegrating state of security in the previously safe northern provinces of the country and the overall doggedness and endurance of the taliban across the whole of afghanistan .
despite us military surges and diverted troop deployments from iraq , many areas of the country remain in a state of war . the presidential vote on august 20 , which was meant to be an indication of how far the country had come since the end of taliban rule eight years ago , was marred by violence and intimidation as counter-insurgents targeted polling stations as well as afghan soldiers and isaf troops . mrm / nda / dpa / ap / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a berlin musicologist says he knows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was she the one ?
everyone knows the melody to ludwig van beethoven 's piano piece " fuer elise , " but elise 's true identity has remained a mystery .
now a german musicologist says he 's discovered who she really was . from hard rock and jazz to cabaret and ring tones , " fuer elise " is the quintessential example of the popularization of classical music .
if beethoven got royalties , he 'd be a wealthy man . while everyone knows the melody to the short piano piece in a minor , few stop to wonder what was behind the intimate dedication . berlin musicologist klaus martin kopitz believes he has uncovered elise 's true identity - while he was n't even looking for it . " for years , i 've been working on a publication called ' beethoven in the eyes of his contemporaries , ' which includes all the reports from people who knew beethoven personally : journals , letters , poems , memoires , " said kopitz .
" certain women are mentioned , and one of them was elisabeth roeckel . " a close friendship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roeckel was an accomplished pianist elisabeth roeckel , born in 1793 , was the younger sister of singer joseph roeckel , who sang the role of florestan in beethoven 's opera " fidelio , " and became a good friend of the composer 's .
elise was also musically inclined - she played the piano and later became a singer . in her circle of friends , she was affectionately referred to as " elise . "
in the spring of 1810 , she went to bamberg to work in theater , with the hope of impressing none other than eta hoffman , who was the theater manager there at the time . according to kopitz , beethoven dedicated the a-minor piano piece " in the memory of " elise because they were separated when she relocated to bamberg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 04.09.2009 berlin pushes for a quick solution for opel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : options for future ownership of opel are still on the table the german government is stepping up the pressure on general motors ' executive board to reach a decision about opel . " we the government have done the homework , the contracts have been drawn up , and now the ball is in general motors ' court , " said economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg on german television on friday , sept .
4 .
but since berlin provided opel with a 1.5-billion-euro bridging loan to help the car group through its current upheaval , it has a decisive say in the outcome - and would like to see opel sold to magna international .
the german government has endorsed a bid from the austrian-canadian auto supplier to acquire a majority holding in opel by offering state-backed guarantees worth about 4.5 billion euros .
magna is leading a joint bid with state-owned russian bank sberbank and russia 's second-largest auto maker , gaz .
chancellor angela merkel told the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung on friday that magna 's concept was " the most viable and the most sustainable . "
but she also stressed that gm had to make its own mind up .
" we hope -lrb- its decision -rrb- will be in the interests of the company and its employees , " she said .
decision time the head of general motors in europe said magna was indeed well positioned to win the drawn-out battle to take over the us car maker 's opel division .
german daily die welt this week quoted carl-peter forster as saying that magna would " most likely " win the takeover bid since all the contracts and financing were in place for it to do so .
but he did not rule out the possibility that gm could keep control of opel and gm 's british-based vauxhall division instead .
speculation has been rife that gm is considering retaining control instead of hiving off a majority stake in the group , which includes the opel and british vauxhall brands .
quoting what it said was a gm official involved in the negotiations , the wall street journal reported that the auto group was prepared to pour more than 1 billion euros of its own money into restructuring opel .
according to german press agency dpa , gm has been considering the investment plan in the event that it fails to sell off the majority stake in opel to the groups bidding for control .
" should the negotiations with the bidders not reach a satisfactory result then alternatives must be examined , " said a source close to the negotiations .
weighing the options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg says it 's decision time the general motors board decided last month against making a decision on opel , with company officials indicating that gm would like berlin to consider an alternative offer for its european subsidiary , drawn up by the brussels-based private equity group rhj international .
rhj international earlier this week raised its offer for a 50.1-percent stake in what has been described as the new opel by 25 million to 300 million euros in cash .
the talks over opel come at a crucial time for german chancellor angela merkel , with parliamentary elections just weeks away .
the other european nations where opel has operations - spain , britain and poland - have been concerned that the financial support offered by berlin meant that they would bear the brunt of any cost cutting launched by the new owners of opel .

a berlin musicologist says he knows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was she the one ?
everyone knows the melody to ludwig van beethoven 's piano piece " fuer elise , " but elise 's true identity has remained a mystery .
now a german musicologist says he 's discovered who she really was . from hard rock and jazz to cabaret and ring tones , " fuer elise " is the quintessential example of the popularization of classical music .
if beethoven got royalties , he 'd be a wealthy man . while everyone knows the melody to the short piano piece in a minor , few stop to wonder what was behind the intimate dedication . berlin musicologist klaus martin kopitz believes he has uncovered elise 's true identity - while he was n't even looking for it . " for years , i 've been working on a publication called ' beethoven in the eyes of his contemporaries , ' which includes all the reports from people who knew beethoven personally : journals , letters , poems , memoires , " said kopitz .
" certain women are mentioned , and one of them was elisabeth roeckel . " a close friendship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roeckel was an accomplished pianist elisabeth roeckel , born in 1793 , was the younger sister of singer joseph roeckel , who sang the role of florestan in beethoven 's opera " fidelio , " and became a good friend of the composer 's .
elise was also musically inclined - she played the piano and later became a singer . in her circle of friends , she was affectionately referred to as " elise . "
in the spring of 1810 , she went to bamberg to work in theater , with the hope of impressing none other than eta hoffman , who was the theater manager there at the time . according to kopitz , beethoven dedicated the a-minor piano piece " in the memory of " elise because they were separated when she relocated to bamberg .
since elisabeth roeckel was referred to in the dedication as " elise " and not the more formal " fraeulein roeckel , " she must have known beethoven well , said kopitz . indeed , their relationship was documented , as elise herself had written about it . beethoven the flirt " according to what she wrote , -lrb- their relationship -rrb- must have been close , " said kopitz .
in a letter , elise wrote about an evening with the composer , the famous guitarist mauro giuliani , and composer johann nepomuk hummel , who would later become her husband . " she wrote that beethoven , true to his frisky rhenish disposition , would n't stop teasing her and she did n't know what to do , " said the musicologist .
" he had pinched her arm out of sheer affection , " added kopitz . that elise chose hummel instead apparently did not mean the end of their friendship with beethoven .
several days before the composer 's death in march 1827 , elise visited him .
to remember her former admirer , she cut off a lock of his hair and accepted one of his quills as a present . how , then , could elisabeth roeckel have remained a mystery to musicologists over all the years ?
and why has the piece so often been attributed to therese malfatti , who beethoven proposed to in 1810 ? bildunterschrift : the beethoven archive and the composer 's birth house are located in bonn original manuscript has disappeared the beethoven scholar ludwig nohl -lrb- 1831-1885 -rrb- may be to blame .

nohl claimed to have seen the original manuscript , saying it had been discovered in therese 's estate , but it has never been found since . all that exists is an incomplete draft of the work , sketched on a sheet of paper beethoven had apparently used for brainstorming other works .
this has been dated to 1810 , around the time of beethoven 's engagement to therese malfatti . if , however , the a-minor melody was indeed composed for elise and not therese , it is not immediately apparent how and why the original manuscript could have made it into therese 's hands . kopitz admitted that his theory on this point is not particularly scientific : " therese malfatti comes to beethoven 's house and sees the " fuer elise " manuscript lying on top of his piano , so she asks ' who is this elise ?

at that point he was embarrassed that he had written the piece for elise when he really wanted to marry therese .

" if they are ready to engage with us , we 're ready to cooperate with them , " said swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country holds the eu presidency , as he arrived at the talks in stockholm .
" but if they decide to go for confrontation , then confrontation will happen , " he told reporters .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , speaking at a separate press conference , said europe needed to remain united in its opposition to iran 's nuclear program .
" i think it 's very important for us to be gathered firmly in the eu 's reaction towards iran , not accepting nuclear ambitions , " he said .
germany 's deputy minister for foreign affairs , guenter gloser , however , said it was pointless to impose more sanctions on iran , pointing out that such actions in the past had yet to bring about any positive change .
" but something must be done to prevent a nuclear arms race in the middle east , " he added .
iran says nuclear endeavors are peaceful a defiant president mahmoud ahmadinejad said on thursday that iran is ready for more sanctions over its nuclear program and will not bow to pressure in meeting any deadline set by world powers .
however tehran has also said it was willing to begin fresh talks with the six major powers - britain , china , france , russia and the united states , plus germany - regarding its nuclear drive .
iran continues to insist its nuclear work is peaceful , while western countries suspect that iran is attempting to build atomic weapons .
the un security council has already slapped three rounds of sanctions on the islamic republic , but pressure is growing for more .
minister appointment further " provocation " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bildt has called iran 's policies " provocative " meanwhile , reinfeldt called president ahmadinejad 's appointment of international terror suspect ahmad vahidi as defense minister a sign of a desire to worsen relations between iran and the west .
" we feel this is a situation that simply returns to provocations .
the appointment of -lsb- vahdi -rsb- is another one of these examples , " reinfeldt told reporters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 04.09.2009 berlin pushes for a quick solution for opel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : options for future ownership of opel are still on the table the german government is stepping up the pressure on general motors ' executive board to reach a decision about opel . " we the government have done the homework , the contracts have been drawn up , and now the ball is in general motors ' court , " said economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg on german television on friday , sept .
4 .
but since berlin provided opel with a 1.5-billion-euro bridging loan to help the car group through its current upheaval , it has a decisive say in the outcome - and would like to see opel sold to magna international .
the german government has endorsed a bid from the austrian-canadian auto supplier to acquire a majority holding in opel by offering state-backed guarantees worth about 4.5 billion euros .
magna is leading a joint bid with state-owned russian bank sberbank and russia 's second-largest auto maker , gaz .
chancellor angela merkel told the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung on friday that magna 's concept was " the most viable and the most sustainable . "
but she also stressed that gm had to make its own mind up .
" we hope -lrb- its decision -rrb- will be in the interests of the company and its employees , " she said .
decision time the head of general motors in europe said magna was indeed well positioned to win the drawn-out battle to take over the us car maker 's opel division .
german daily die welt this week quoted carl-peter forster as saying that magna would " most likely " win the takeover bid since all the contracts and financing were in place for it to do so .
but he did not rule out the possibility that gm could keep control of opel and gm 's british-based vauxhall division instead .
speculation has been rife that gm is considering retaining control instead of hiving off a majority stake in the group , which includes the opel and british vauxhall brands .
quoting what it said was a gm official involved in the negotiations , the wall street journal reported that the auto group was prepared to pour more than 1 billion euros of its own money into restructuring opel .
according to german press agency dpa , gm has been considering the investment plan in the event that it fails to sell off the majority stake in opel to the groups bidding for control .
" should the negotiations with the bidders not reach a satisfactory result then alternatives must be examined , " said a source close to the negotiations .
weighing the options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg says it 's decision time the general motors board decided last month against making a decision on opel , with company officials indicating that gm would like berlin to consider an alternative offer for its european subsidiary , drawn up by the brussels-based private equity group rhj international .
rhj international earlier this week raised its offer for a 50.1-percent stake in what has been described as the new opel by 25 million to 300 million euros in cash .
the talks over opel come at a crucial time for german chancellor angela merkel , with parliamentary elections just weeks away .
the other european nations where opel has operations - spain , britain and poland - have been concerned that the financial support offered by berlin meant that they would bear the brunt of any cost cutting launched by the new owners of opel .
plunging car sales forced gm earlier this year to launch a major restructuring of its global operations , including selling off a majority stake in opel. jp / dpa / afp editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de germany regrets gm 's indecision regarding opel germany 's economics minister said on saturday he regretted that general motors ' board had failed to take a decision on a deal covering its european operations , including ailing german unit opel .

germany 's healthcare system has experienced all manner of nips and tucks since it was introduced over 125 years ago but it 's nonetheless showing its age .
the election might decide whether it gets a new lease of life . health insurance in germany has come a long way since sickness cover was introduced in 1883 under kaiser wilhelm i and his chancellor , otto von bismarck .
at the time , the average german worked a 60-hour week for a pittance , and sickness or accidents meant a very real threat of starvation .
public dissatisfaction was widespread , and it was against this backdrop that germany started on the long road towards the welfare state it still more or less is .
but these days , less is the operative word .
the social solidarity that has traditionally underpinned the german healthcare system is looking increasingly frail .
the basic problem is that german society is ageing , while its birth rate is sinking .
this means that healthcare costs are rising while fewer people are paying into the system .
many believe that what the only way to rejuvenate the system is to expose it to market forces .
rising costs but this would mark a dramatic break with bismarck 's original program .
made up of health insurance ; accident insurance ; disability insurance and an old-age retirement pension , it was based from the outset on the principle of solidarity : anyone who was employed was obliged to pay into the system and anyone who fell ill would receive medical care and a living allowance .
the cost was divided between employers and the employed - the employers contributing one third , the workers two thirds .
the ratio has changed since then - and so have many other aspects of the german health care service .
the last 20 years alone have seen 14 health care reforms .
while the initial health care restructuring was designed to provide more efficient and cost-effective healthcare services , the most recent reforms focus more on the structure of health insurance funds .
one way or another , most of them have been bad news for the public .
personal contributions to dental care and medicine costs have gone up , and patients now have to pay a mandatory 10 euros -lrb- $ 14 -rrb- per quarter whenever they go to the doctor .
dissatisfaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private patients are more lucrative so although the german healthcare services are still more or less all-inclusive , the cracks are showing .
and it 's not just patients who are noticing .
medical and healthcare professionals also say that conditions are worsening .
" everything has gone downhill , " says one nurse who works in a hospital in bonn .
" we all have less time , there are so many cuts , patients are dissatisfied , especially the elderly ones . "
doctors are also fed up , and say the system is flawed .
dorothee keltz is a gp with a practice in bonn .
she believes it 's important to take the time to talk to patients , and resents the fact that insurers prefer to see doctors using technical equipment .
" if one of my assistants does a cardiogram and we tell the patient what our findings are , we make three times as much money as we would if we spent 10 minutes talking to the patient , " she complains .
another problem is that doctors have had to start relying on private patients to stay afloat .
in germany , only 10 percent of the population has private , for-profit insurance - mostly civil servants and the self-employed .
increasingly , doctors are realizing that patients with state health cover are just not profitable enough .
patients as pawns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german health care is the fourth most expensive in the world still , the stakes are high .
the german health care system averages an annual turnover of over 250 billion euros , making it one of the nation 's most important economic sectors .
it 's also a sector in which powerful interest groups from trade associations to pharmaceuticals companies are constantly jockeying for position .
german health minister ulla schmidt is well aware of the tensions .
" no other sector has the financial clout of the health service , " she says .
" the amount of money spent on it exceeds the entire federal budget .
the sector 's players are dealing with huge funds with which they can buy opinion , influence opinion and promote their products .
in this respect it is patients themselves who are in the weakest position , even though they should be the strongest , because 70 million people in germany have state health cover . "
but the public is often little more than a pawn in a game , and has little insight into what is being spent and how .
the new cornerstone for funding german health care spending is the controversial and highly complex ' gesundheitsfond ' , the health care fund .
supposedly , it aims to simplify health benefits , provide more choices , increase transparency and create competition among providers .
but its detractors believe that it fails to address the increasingly urgent issue of funding the enormous german system .
it makes no mention of reducing cost , they say , but simply spreads the cost risk differently .
in the wake of the financial crisis , saving costs has become more important then ever .
after numerous attempts at resuscitation , the solidarity principle introduced by bismarck could well be on its last legs , and germany 's two leading parties can not agree whether it should be kept on life-support .
social democrat ulla schmidt , for one , would like to give it another chance and abolish private health insurance altogether .
but ultimately , today 's social and economic forces are nudging germany more in the direction of a healthcare system built on individual responsibility .
the issue will certainly be on voters ' minds when they go to the polls this month .

the last 20 years alone have seen 14 health care reforms .
while the initial health care restructuring was designed to provide more efficient and cost-effective healthcare services , the most recent reforms focus more on the structure of health insurance funds .
one way or another , most of them have been bad news for the public .
personal contributions to dental care and medicine costs have gone up , and patients now have to pay a mandatory 10 euros -lrb- $ 14 -rrb- per quarter whenever they go to the doctor .
dissatisfaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private patients are more lucrative so although the german healthcare services are still more or less all-inclusive , the cracks are showing .
and it 's not just patients who are noticing .
medical and healthcare professionals also say that conditions are worsening .
" everything has gone downhill , " says one nurse who works in a hospital in bonn .
" we all have less time , there are so many cuts , patients are dissatisfied , especially the elderly ones . "
doctors are also fed up , and say the system is flawed .
dorothee keltz is a gp with a practice in bonn .
she believes it 's important to take the time to talk to patients , and resents the fact that insurers prefer to see doctors using technical equipment .
" if one of my assistants does a cardiogram and we tell the patient what our findings are , we make three times as much money as we would if we spent 10 minutes talking to the patient , " she complains .
another problem is that doctors have had to start relying on private patients to stay afloat .
in germany , only 10 percent of the population has private , for-profit insurance - mostly civil servants and the self-employed .
increasingly , doctors are realizing that patients with state health cover are just not profitable enough .
patients as pawns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german health care is the fourth most expensive in the world still , the stakes are high .
the german health care system averages an annual turnover of over 250 billion euros , making it one of the nation 's most important economic sectors .
it 's also a sector in which powerful interest groups from trade associations to pharmaceuticals companies are constantly jockeying for position .
german health minister ulla schmidt is well aware of the tensions .
" no other sector has the financial clout of the health service , " she says .
" the amount of money spent on it exceeds the entire federal budget .
the sector 's players are dealing with huge funds with which they can buy opinion , influence opinion and promote their products .
in this respect it is patients themselves who are in the weakest position , even though they should be the strongest , because 70 million people in germany have state health cover . "
but the public is often little more than a pawn in a game , and has little insight into what is being spent and how .
the new cornerstone for funding german health care spending is the controversial and highly complex ' gesundheitsfond ' , the health care fund .
supposedly , it aims to simplify health benefits , provide more choices , increase transparency and create competition among providers .
but its detractors believe that it fails to address the increasingly urgent issue of funding the enormous german system .
it makes no mention of reducing cost , they say , but simply spreads the cost risk differently .
in the wake of the financial crisis , saving costs has become more important then ever .
after numerous attempts at resuscitation , the solidarity principle introduced by bismarck could well be on its last legs , and germany 's two leading parties can not agree whether it should be kept on life-support .
social democrat ulla schmidt , for one , would like to give it another chance and abolish private health insurance altogether .
but ultimately , today 's social and economic forces are nudging germany more in the direction of a healthcare system built on individual responsibility .
the issue will certainly be on voters ' minds when they go to the polls this month .

germany 's healthcare system has experienced all manner of nips and tucks since it was introduced over 125 years ago but it 's nonetheless showing its age .
the election might decide whether it gets a new lease of life . health insurance in germany has come a long way since sickness cover was introduced in 1883 under kaiser wilhelm i and his chancellor , otto von bismarck .
at the time , the average german worked a 60-hour week for a pittance , and sickness or accidents meant a very real threat of starvation .
public dissatisfaction was widespread , and it was against this backdrop that germany started on the long road towards the welfare state it still more or less is .
but these days , less is the operative word .
the social solidarity that has traditionally underpinned the german healthcare system is looking increasingly frail .
the basic problem is that german society is ageing , while its birth rate is sinking .
this means that healthcare costs are rising while fewer people are paying into the system .
many believe that what the only way to rejuvenate the system is to expose it to market forces .
rising costs but this would mark a dramatic break with bismarck 's original program .
made up of health insurance ; accident insurance ; disability insurance and an old-age retirement pension , it was based from the outset on the principle of solidarity : anyone who was employed was obliged to pay into the system and anyone who fell ill would receive medical care and a living allowance .
the cost was divided between employers and the employed - the employers contributing one third , the workers two thirds .
the ratio has changed since then - and so have many other aspects of the german health care service .
the last 20 years alone have seen 14 health care reforms .
while the initial health care restructuring was designed to provide more efficient and cost-effective healthcare services , the most recent reforms focus more on the structure of health insurance funds .
one way or another , most of them have been bad news for the public .
personal contributions to dental care and medicine costs have gone up , and patients now have to pay a mandatory 10 euros -lrb- $ 14 -rrb- per quarter whenever they go to the doctor .

and it 's not just patients who are noticing .

the isaf troops then engaged the militants in a fire fight .
no civilians or german soldiers were injured in the battle .
the german statement said that nato planes then launched the attack in response to a call for air support . german military confirm air attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato troops and afghan policemen are still investigating the incident while the german military did not say whether the airstrike was responsible for the tanker blast , a german army spokesman in berlin admitted that the tankers exploded during the battle .
kunduz provincial governor mohammad omar later said that local residents claimed a military jet fired at the tanker , setting off the explosion . captain jon stock , press officer for isaf , later told the reuters news agency : " i can confirm that there was an airstrike last night or early this morning .
isaf 's target in the air raid was insurgents . "
however , he said he was unable to comment on the reports of the blast . in the wake of the attack , reports of casualties at the scene varied , with the german army saying that 56 militants were killed in the blast while the local authorities put the number of civilian dead at 45 .
a security officer who asked to remain anonymous told reporters that 200 people were killed and wounded in the explosion while residents put the number of casualties at 300 . european leaders begin to speak out following the attack , british prime minster gordon brown confirmed that he would not be backing down or changing the government 's afghanistan policy in any way . speaking at the international institute for strategic studies -lrb- iiss -rrb- in london , brown said that the stability of the volatile region , spanning the afghan-pakistan border , had a profound impact on the security of britain and the rest of the international community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister brown refuses to back down " we can not just walk away , " said brown , adding that the objectives in the conflict were " clear , justified , realistic and achievable . " brown announced that his government would provide an extra 20 million pounds -lrb- 23 million euros / $ 32 million -rrb- to help stabilization and security efforts in helmand province , where british troops are based .
british foreign secretary david miliband called for an " urgent investigation " into the nato airstrike . nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen responded by saying that there would be a thorough investigation into the incident . " the afghan people should know that we are clearly committed to protecting them and that we will fully and immediately investigate this incident , " rasmussen told reporters . increased instability in previously safe north bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local afghan people have begun burying their villagers killed in the nato airstrike the incident is likely to cause more outrage among an afghan population which has been increasingly angered and frustrated by the rising civilian death toll and the apparent failure of the western forces to stabilize the country . the airstrike also serves as another example of the disintegrating state of security in the previously safe northern provinces of the country and the overall doggedness and endurance of the taliban across the whole of afghanistan .
despite us military surges and diverted troop deployments from iraq , many areas of the country remain in a state of war . the presidential vote on august 20 , which was meant to be an indication of how far the country had come since the end of taliban rule eight years ago , was marred by violence and intimidation as counter-insurgents targeted polling stations as well as afghan soldiers and isaf troops . mrm / nda / dpa / ap / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our sector is defying the crisis , " said rainer hecker , head of the gfu german consumer electronics trade association that runs the event .
the german ifo economic research institute has predicted german growth of up to one percent is possible next year in europe 's largest economy , with some analysts forecasting as much as three percent .
merkel , who has a phd in physics , officially opened the 49th ifa , at an official reception at the city fairgrounds in the german capital .
merkel said many products introduced at ifa quickly became big sellers soon after , but she chided german broadcasters for their long delay in introducing high-definition television .
merkel also called for a rapid expansion of broadband internet connections in rural areas .

those hoping that a second irish referendum on the eu 's lisbon treaty will remove one of the largest stumbling blocks to the eu reform document ’ s ratification will be disappointed by news that has come out of dublin . polls and government ministers revealed a slump in support for the treaty among the populace of the recession-hit country ahead of the plebiscite next month .
public opinion was gauged by a face-to-face poll with 1,000 voters earlier this week conducted by the tns mrbi market research company .
the survey , published in the friday edition of the irish times , showed opposition to the treaty stood at 29 percent , increasing one point since the last poll in may , with support dropping eight points to 46 percent in the same time span .
the number of voters who remained undecided stood at 25 percent , an increase of seven points .
in an article which accompanied the results , the irish times ' political editor , stephen collins , wrote that " a striking feature of the latest poll is that most of those who have left the ' yes ' camp have moved into the ' do n't know ' category rather than shifting into the ' no ' camp . "
if the poll results were not gloomy enough , irish foreign minister michael martin admitted that the government was pessimistic about the october 2 referendum but that he believed that , while it would be difficult to secure ratification , he expected a slim vote in favor .
" i was never under any illusion but that it would be difficult to secure this but i do think we can do it , " he told national radio broadcaster rte .
" there is a very significant challenge ahead , it 's going to be a very tight campaign and it will demand all of the resources , conviction , politics and passion of all of those on the yes side . "
brussels concessions led to second referendum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : support is slipping for the lisbio treaty as the vote nears ireland is the only member of the 27-nation eu which is constitutionally bound to hold a referendum on the treaty , which is designed to overhaul of the eu 's foreign policy-making and internal decision-making in a greatly expanded bloc .
irish voters threw the ratification process into chaos last year when they rejected the treaty in the first referendum .
irish voters rejected the pact in a referendum held in june , partly out of concerns that their country would lose the right to nominate a commissioner to the eu 's executive and concerns that the treaty would contravene the country 's constitution on issues relating to the right to life , education and family policy .
the decision to launch a second referendum came after opinion polls showed voters would back it this time after dublin won concessions from brussels on key policy areas .
these included the guarantee that ireland 's traditional policy of neutrality would be maintained and that the lisbon treaty would not impinge on ireland 's right to set tax levels .
the eu also agreed that ireland would retain the right to an eu commissioner .
backlash could lead to potential " no " vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brian cowen 's government is also losing support despite the fact that the previous three opinion polls conducted this year showed solid support for the treaty , it is believed that the growing dissatisfaction with the irish government 's handling of the financial crisis has turned an anti-government backlash into a vote against ratification .
prime minister brian cowen 's government has itself been faced with some uncomfortable reading in recent polls .
the latest showed that 75 percent of voters would like to see him ousted , while support for the prime minister 's fianna fail party dropped to a record low of 17 percent .
for the lisbon treaty to come into force , it has to be ratified by all 27 eu states .
poland and the czech republic , currently led by euro-skeptic presidents , have said that they will wait for ireland 's vote before signing it into law .

those hoping that a second irish referendum on the eu 's lisbon treaty will remove one of the largest stumbling blocks to the eu reform document ’ s ratification will be disappointed by news that has come out of dublin . polls and government ministers revealed a slump in support for the treaty among the populace of the recession-hit country ahead of the plebiscite next month .
public opinion was gauged by a face-to-face poll with 1,000 voters earlier this week conducted by the tns mrbi market research company .
the survey , published in the friday edition of the irish times , showed opposition to the treaty stood at 29 percent , increasing one point since the last poll in may , with support dropping eight points to 46 percent in the same time span .
the number of voters who remained undecided stood at 25 percent , an increase of seven points .
in an article which accompanied the results , the irish times ' political editor , stephen collins , wrote that " a striking feature of the latest poll is that most of those who have left the ' yes ' camp have moved into the ' do n't know ' category rather than shifting into the ' no ' camp . "
if the poll results were not gloomy enough , irish foreign minister michael martin admitted that the government was pessimistic about the october 2 referendum but that he believed that , while it would be difficult to secure ratification , he expected a slim vote in favor .
" i was never under any illusion but that it would be difficult to secure this but i do think we can do it , " he told national radio broadcaster rte .
" there is a very significant challenge ahead , it 's going to be a very tight campaign and it will demand all of the resources , conviction , politics and passion of all of those on the yes side . "
brussels concessions led to second referendum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : support is slipping for the lisbio treaty as the vote nears ireland is the only member of the 27-nation eu which is constitutionally bound to hold a referendum on the treaty , which is designed to overhaul of the eu 's foreign policy-making and internal decision-making in a greatly expanded bloc .
irish voters threw the ratification process into chaos last year when they rejected the treaty in the first referendum .
irish voters rejected the pact in a referendum held in june , partly out of concerns that their country would lose the right to nominate a commissioner to the eu 's executive and concerns that the treaty would contravene the country 's constitution on issues relating to the right to life , education and family policy .
the decision to launch a second referendum came after opinion polls showed voters would back it this time after dublin won concessions from brussels on key policy areas .
these included the guarantee that ireland 's traditional policy of neutrality would be maintained and that the lisbon treaty would not impinge on ireland 's right to set tax levels .
the eu also agreed that ireland would retain the right to an eu commissioner .
backlash could lead to potential " no " vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brian cowen 's government is also losing support despite the fact that the previous three opinion polls conducted this year showed solid support for the treaty , it is believed that the growing dissatisfaction with the irish government 's handling of the financial crisis has turned an anti-government backlash into a vote against ratification .
prime minister brian cowen 's government has itself been faced with some uncomfortable reading in recent polls .
the latest showed that 75 percent of voters would like to see him ousted , while support for the prime minister 's fianna fail party dropped to a record low of 17 percent .
for the lisbon treaty to come into force , it has to be ratified by all 27 eu states .
poland and the czech republic , currently led by euro-skeptic presidents , have said that they will wait for ireland 's vote before signing it into law .
if ireland were to vote “ no ” for a second time , observers say it could derail the treaty for good. nda / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 04.09.2009 polls show irish support sliding as lisbon treaty referendum approaches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish said " no " once , will they reject the treaty again ?
those hoping that a second irish referendum on the eu 's lisbon treaty will remove one of the largest stumbling blocks to the eu reform document ’ s ratification will be disappointed by news that has come out of dublin . polls and government ministers revealed a slump in support for the treaty among the populace of the recession-hit country ahead of the plebiscite next month .
public opinion was gauged by a face-to-face poll with 1,000 voters earlier this week conducted by the tns mrbi market research company .
the survey , published in the friday edition of the irish times , showed opposition to the treaty stood at 29 percent , increasing one point since the last poll in may , with support dropping eight points to 46 percent in the same time span .
the number of voters who remained undecided stood at 25 percent , an increase of seven points .
in an article which accompanied the results , the irish times ' political editor , stephen collins , wrote that " a striking feature of the latest poll is that most of those who have left the ' yes ' camp have moved into the ' do n't know ' category rather than shifting into the ' no ' camp . "
if the poll results were not gloomy enough , irish foreign minister michael martin admitted that the government was pessimistic about the october 2 referendum but that he believed that , while it would be difficult to secure ratification , he expected a slim vote in favor .
" i was never under any illusion but that it would be difficult to secure this but i do think we can do it , " he told national radio broadcaster rte .
" there is a very significant challenge ahead , it 's going to be a very tight campaign and it will demand all of the resources , conviction , politics and passion of all of those on the yes side . "
brussels concessions led to second referendum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : support is slipping for the lisbio treaty as the vote nears ireland is the only member of the 27-nation eu which is constitutionally bound to hold a referendum on the treaty , which is designed to overhaul of the eu 's foreign policy-making and internal decision-making in a greatly expanded bloc .
irish voters threw the ratification process into chaos last year when they rejected the treaty in the first referendum .
irish voters rejected the pact in a referendum held in june , partly out of concerns that their country would lose the right to nominate a commissioner to the eu 's executive and concerns that the treaty would contravene the country 's constitution on issues relating to the right to life , education and family policy .
the decision to launch a second referendum came after opinion polls showed voters would back it this time after dublin won concessions from brussels on key policy areas .
these included the guarantee that ireland 's traditional policy of neutrality would be maintained and that the lisbon treaty would not impinge on ireland 's right to set tax levels .
the eu also agreed that ireland would retain the right to an eu commissioner .
backlash could lead to potential " no " vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brian cowen 's government is also losing support despite the fact that the previous three opinion polls conducted this year showed solid support for the treaty , it is believed that the growing dissatisfaction with the irish government 's handling of the financial crisis has turned an anti-government backlash into a vote against ratification .
prime minister brian cowen 's government has itself been faced with some uncomfortable reading in recent polls .
the latest showed that 75 percent of voters would like to see him ousted , while support for the prime minister 's fianna fail party dropped to a record low of 17 percent .
for the lisbon treaty to come into force , it has to be ratified by all 27 eu states .
poland and the czech republic , currently led by euro-skeptic presidents , have said that they will wait for ireland 's vote before signing it into law .
if ireland were to vote “ no ” for a second time , observers say it could derail the treaty for good. nda / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we the government have done the homework , the contracts have been drawn up , and now the ball is in general motors ' court , " said economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg on german television on friday , sept .

but since berlin provided opel with a 1.5-billion-euro bridging loan to help the car group through its current upheaval , it has a decisive say in the outcome - and would like to see opel sold to magna international .
the german government has endorsed a bid from the austrian-canadian auto supplier to acquire a majority holding in opel by offering state-backed guarantees worth about 4.5 billion euros .
magna is leading a joint bid with state-owned russian bank sberbank and russia 's second-largest auto maker , gaz .
chancellor angela merkel told the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung on friday that magna 's concept was " the most viable and the most sustainable . "
but she also stressed that gm had to make its own mind up .
" we hope -lrb- its decision -rrb- will be in the interests of the company and its employees , " she said .
decision time the head of general motors in europe said magna was indeed well positioned to win the drawn-out battle to take over the us car maker 's opel division .
german daily die welt this week quoted carl-peter forster as saying that magna would " most likely " win the takeover bid since all the contracts and financing were in place for it to do so .
but he did not rule out the possibility that gm could keep control of opel and gm 's british-based vauxhall division instead .
speculation has been rife that gm is considering retaining control instead of hiving off a majority stake in the group , which includes the opel and british vauxhall brands .
quoting what it said was a gm official involved in the negotiations , the wall street journal reported that the auto group was prepared to pour more than 1 billion euros of its own money into restructuring opel .
according to german press agency dpa , gm has been considering the investment plan in the event that it fails to sell off the majority stake in opel to the groups bidding for control .
" should the negotiations with the bidders not reach a satisfactory result then alternatives must be examined , " said a source close to the negotiations .

rhj international earlier this week raised its offer for a 50.1-percent stake in what has been described as the new opel by 25 million to 300 million euros in cash .
the talks over opel come at a crucial time for german chancellor angela merkel , with parliamentary elections just weeks away .

magna is leading a joint bid with state-owned russian bank sberbank and russia 's second-largest auto maker , gaz .
chancellor angela merkel told the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung on friday that magna 's concept was " the most viable and the most sustainable . "
but she also stressed that gm had to make its own mind up .
" we hope -lrb- its decision -rrb- will be in the interests of the company and its employees , " she said .
decision time the head of general motors in europe said magna was indeed well positioned to win the drawn-out battle to take over the us car maker 's opel division .
german daily die welt this week quoted carl-peter forster as saying that magna would " most likely " win the takeover bid since all the contracts and financing were in place for it to do so .
but he did not rule out the possibility that gm could keep control of opel and gm 's british-based vauxhall division instead .
speculation has been rife that gm is considering retaining control instead of hiving off a majority stake in the group , which includes the opel and british vauxhall brands .
quoting what it said was a gm official involved in the negotiations , the wall street journal reported that the auto group was prepared to pour more than 1 billion euros of its own money into restructuring opel .
according to german press agency dpa , gm has been considering the investment plan in the event that it fails to sell off the majority stake in opel to the groups bidding for control .
" should the negotiations with the bidders not reach a satisfactory result then alternatives must be examined , " said a source close to the negotiations .
weighing the options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg says it 's decision time the general motors board decided last month against making a decision on opel , with company officials indicating that gm would like berlin to consider an alternative offer for its european subsidiary , drawn up by the brussels-based private equity group rhj international .
rhj international earlier this week raised its offer for a 50.1-percent stake in what has been described as the new opel by 25 million to 300 million euros in cash .
the talks over opel come at a crucial time for german chancellor angela merkel , with parliamentary elections just weeks away .
the other european nations where opel has operations - spain , britain and poland - have been concerned that the financial support offered by berlin meant that they would bear the brunt of any cost cutting launched by the new owners of opel .
plunging car sales forced gm earlier this year to launch a major restructuring of its global operations , including selling off a majority stake in opel. jp / dpa / afp editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the thai military is also looking to development programs in efforts to gain support – and vital intelligence - from the local muslim population to gain the upper hand in curbing the violence . across southern thailand ’ s four largely muslim populated provinces the thai army has deployed some 30,000 troops aimed at quelling the five year old islamic insurgency .
a further 30,000 civil volunteers , rangers and police have also been deployed .
across the provinces of pattani , yala , songkhla , and narathiwat there is a climate of fear and uncertainty .
over the years , the military has been accused by human rights groups of heavy-handed crackdowns and allegations of abuse .
these have led to deep animosity and distrust among the local largely muslim communities .
rights groups have called for the government to take action .
emergency powers in the south have given the army wide powers and immunity .
development projects since 2006 , the thai military has sought to steer a course towards winning hearts and minds within local muslim communities .
the government has spent over three billion dollars to boost the economy and security in the south .
lieutenant general pichet wisaijorn , the fourth army commander , is currently overseeing the program led by the internal security operations command -lrb- isoc -rrb- .
pichet says the aim is to work with local communities . “ it ’ s a question of trust , ” he says .
“ now today we have been able to create trust with the people .
we have constant conversations and dialogue with the people .
so in this respect we have substantially tackled the problem . ”
in pattani province the military has set up a training center , leading to hundreds of people gaining the skills to improve crop yields , oversee fish ponds , raise chickens and produce organic fertilizer aimed at reducing costs .
colonel attadet mattanom , an isoc spokesman in southern thailand , hopes the programs will improve local economies and ease sectarian violence .
“ in this area we try to look after the local -lrb- muslim -rrb- people here which are the majority of the population .
they have a sufficient way of living – we try to make it more complete .
if they have sufficient to live they live according to their religion ; then they think they are happy enough . ”
presence of thai military but others raise questions over the policy including the stationing of high levels of military in the region .
surachart bamrungsuk , is a professor in politics at chulalongkorn university .
he says for the thai military a counter insurgency strategy is a new approach .
“ when you ’ re talking about winning the hearts and minds it ’ s not easy because every unit will have its own way of thinking .
for me it would be better if we accept counter insurgency – a need to win at the people level – so the concept of winning hearts and minds would be applicable to the thai army . ”
he says the army is now involved in that process of readjustment . but angkhana neelapaichit , chairperson of rights organization , the working group on justice for peace , says local people need to have more influence over the projects being undertaken .
“ i suggest every project must be from the grass roots people , not only from the bottom-up but from the top down because we should have people participation .
we should ask the people what they want to do ; not what we want to do for them but what they want so we should ask the people . ”
the thai government is moving to place more civilian control over development in the south .
a new body will come under the control of the prime minister ’ s office .
a government spokesman says he was confident the military would support the new measures .

the isaf troops then engaged the militants in a fire fight .
no civilians or german soldiers were injured in the battle .
the german statement said that nato planes then launched the attack in response to a call for air support . german military confirm air attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato troops and afghan policemen are still investigating the incident while the german military did not say whether the airstrike was responsible for the tanker blast , a german army spokesman in berlin admitted that the tankers exploded during the battle .
kunduz provincial governor mohammad omar later said that local residents claimed a military jet fired at the tanker , setting off the explosion . captain jon stock , press officer for isaf , later told the reuters news agency : " i can confirm that there was an airstrike last night or early this morning .
isaf 's target in the air raid was insurgents . "
however , he said he was unable to comment on the reports of the blast . in the wake of the attack , reports of casualties at the scene varied , with the german army saying that 56 militants were killed in the blast while the local authorities put the number of civilian dead at 45 .
a security officer who asked to remain anonymous told reporters that 200 people were killed and wounded in the explosion while residents put the number of casualties at 300 . european leaders begin to speak out following the attack , british prime minster gordon brown confirmed that he would not be backing down or changing the government 's afghanistan policy in any way . speaking at the international institute for strategic studies -lrb- iiss -rrb- in london , brown said that the stability of the volatile region , spanning the afghan-pakistan border , had a profound impact on the security of britain and the rest of the international community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister brown refuses to back down " we can not just walk away , " said brown , adding that the objectives in the conflict were " clear , justified , realistic and achievable .

and its coming to a screen near you on saturday . up until just two short decades ago , berlin was split down the middle by a great , dirty wall .
it is not a long chapter in history , yet the city has undergone such monumental change since reunification that the producers felt not only berliners should be party to the party .
hence the project .
the brainchild of producer thomas kufus and director volker heise , the documentary will run for 24 hours straight starting at 6am cet on saturday . that is exactly one year to the day since it was shot . early on the morning of sept .
5 , 2008 , 80 camera teams hit the streets of berlin and spent the subsequent 24 hours collecting footage to depict the myriad lives and fates played out day by day in the german capital .
the end result brings together the destinies of 20 main protagonists and 50 secondary characters and takes viewers into the realms - public and private - of a refuse worker , french journalist , poet , drag queen and drug addict .
there are also sequences with more high profile berlin figures , including the mayor of the city klaus wowereit , conductor daniel barenboim and the editor of the mass-circulation bild newspaper kai diekmann .
exploration of diversity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's left of the berlin wall volker heise said the film was a way to find out how people live in a city of such diversity .
" how do people educate their children ?
what television programs do they watch ?
what do they eat ? " he asked in material outlining the project .
work first began on the 2.8-million-euro -lrb- $ 4-million -rrb- film some three years ago .
besides the protagonists selected to feature in the tele-visual extravaganza , berliners were invited to send in their own contributions .
some of these have made it into the final product .
so , too , has the city itself .
there are multiple shots of the television tower at alexanderplatz , the river spree and other landmarks .
but viewers will also catch glimpses of the smaller spots that make berlin the unique city it is .
in essence , the makers have tried to leave no stone unturned in their portrayal of this 21st-century metropolis .
from the bedroom to the sausage stand , the courtroom to the chancellery , they have set out to capture life as it happens .
and as the introduction is at pains to point out , it is just a normal day : " nothing special is expected to happen .
people will get up and go to work , they will love and hate one another , they will be born and they will die . "
the show begins at 6am central european time and can be seen on arte and berlin public broadcaster , rbb .
viewers outside germany can pick up the live stream at www.24berlin.tv.

germany 's healthcare system has experienced all manner of nips and tucks since it was introduced over 125 years ago but it 's nonetheless showing its age .
the election might decide whether it gets a new lease of life . health insurance in germany has come a long way since sickness cover was introduced in 1883 under kaiser wilhelm i and his chancellor , otto von bismarck .
at the time , the average german worked a 60-hour week for a pittance , and sickness or accidents meant a very real threat of starvation .
public dissatisfaction was widespread , and it was against this backdrop that germany started on the long road towards the welfare state it still more or less is .
but these days , less is the operative word .
the social solidarity that has traditionally underpinned the german healthcare system is looking increasingly frail .
the basic problem is that german society is ageing , while its birth rate is sinking .
this means that healthcare costs are rising while fewer people are paying into the system .
many believe that what the only way to rejuvenate the system is to expose it to market forces .
rising costs but this would mark a dramatic break with bismarck 's original program .
made up of health insurance ; accident insurance ; disability insurance and an old-age retirement pension , it was based from the outset on the principle of solidarity : anyone who was employed was obliged to pay into the system and anyone who fell ill would receive medical care and a living allowance .
the cost was divided between employers and the employed - the employers contributing one third , the workers two thirds .
the ratio has changed since then - and so have many other aspects of the german health care service .
the last 20 years alone have seen 14 health care reforms .
while the initial health care restructuring was designed to provide more efficient and cost-effective healthcare services , the most recent reforms focus more on the structure of health insurance funds .
one way or another , most of them have been bad news for the public .
personal contributions to dental care and medicine costs have gone up , and patients now have to pay a mandatory 10 euros -lrb- $ 14 -rrb- per quarter whenever they go to the doctor .
dissatisfaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private patients are more lucrative so although the german healthcare services are still more or less all-inclusive , the cracks are showing .
and it 's not just patients who are noticing .
medical and healthcare professionals also say that conditions are worsening .
" everything has gone downhill , " says one nurse who works in a hospital in bonn .
" we all have less time , there are so many cuts , patients are dissatisfied , especially the elderly ones . "
doctors are also fed up , and say the system is flawed .
dorothee keltz is a gp with a practice in bonn .
she believes it 's important to take the time to talk to patients , and resents the fact that insurers prefer to see doctors using technical equipment .
" if one of my assistants does a cardiogram and we tell the patient what our findings are , we make three times as much money as we would if we spent 10 minutes talking to the patient , " she complains .
another problem is that doctors have had to start relying on private patients to stay afloat .
in germany , only 10 percent of the population has private , for-profit insurance - mostly civil servants and the self-employed .
increasingly , doctors are realizing that patients with state health cover are just not profitable enough .
patients as pawns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german health care is the fourth most expensive in the world still , the stakes are high .
the german health care system averages an annual turnover of over 250 billion euros , making it one of the nation 's most important economic sectors .
it 's also a sector in which powerful interest groups from trade associations to pharmaceuticals companies are constantly jockeying for position .
german health minister ulla schmidt is well aware of the tensions .
" no other sector has the financial clout of the health service , " she says .
" the amount of money spent on it exceeds the entire federal budget .
the sector 's players are dealing with huge funds with which they can buy opinion , influence opinion and promote their products .
in this respect it is patients themselves who are in the weakest position , even though they should be the strongest , because 70 million people in germany have state health cover . "
but the public is often little more than a pawn in a game , and has little insight into what is being spent and how .
the new cornerstone for funding german health care spending is the controversial and highly complex ' gesundheitsfond ' , the health care fund .
supposedly , it aims to simplify health benefits , provide more choices , increase transparency and create competition among providers .
but its detractors believe that it fails to address the increasingly urgent issue of funding the enormous german system .
it makes no mention of reducing cost , they say , but simply spreads the cost risk differently .
in the wake of the financial crisis , saving costs has become more important then ever .
after numerous attempts at resuscitation , the solidarity principle introduced by bismarck could well be on its last legs , and germany 's two leading parties can not agree whether it should be kept on life-support .
social democrat ulla schmidt , for one , would like to give it another chance and abolish private health insurance altogether .
but ultimately , today 's social and economic forces are nudging germany more in the direction of a healthcare system built on individual responsibility .
the issue will certainly be on voters ' minds when they go to the polls this month .

german health minister ulla schmidt is well aware of the tensions .
" no other sector has the financial clout of the health service , " she says .
" the amount of money spent on it exceeds the entire federal budget .
the sector 's players are dealing with huge funds with which they can buy opinion , influence opinion and promote their products .
in this respect it is patients themselves who are in the weakest position , even though they should be the strongest , because 70 million people in germany have state health cover . "
but the public is often little more than a pawn in a game , and has little insight into what is being spent and how .
the new cornerstone for funding german health care spending is the controversial and highly complex ' gesundheitsfond ' , the health care fund .
supposedly , it aims to simplify health benefits , provide more choices , increase transparency and create competition among providers .
but its detractors believe that it fails to address the increasingly urgent issue of funding the enormous german system .
it makes no mention of reducing cost , they say , but simply spreads the cost risk differently .
in the wake of the financial crisis , saving costs has become more important then ever .
after numerous attempts at resuscitation , the solidarity principle introduced by bismarck could well be on its last legs , and germany 's two leading parties can not agree whether it should be kept on life-support .
social democrat ulla schmidt , for one , would like to give it another chance and abolish private health insurance altogether .
but ultimately , today 's social and economic forces are nudging germany more in the direction of a healthcare system built on individual responsibility .
the issue will certainly be on voters ' minds when they go to the polls this month .

germany 's healthcare system has experienced all manner of nips and tucks since it was introduced over 125 years ago but it 's nonetheless showing its age .
the election might decide whether it gets a new lease of life . health insurance in germany has come a long way since sickness cover was introduced in 1883 under kaiser wilhelm i and his chancellor , otto von bismarck .
at the time , the average german worked a 60-hour week for a pittance , and sickness or accidents meant a very real threat of starvation .
public dissatisfaction was widespread , and it was against this backdrop that germany started on the long road towards the welfare state it still more or less is .
but these days , less is the operative word .
the social solidarity that has traditionally underpinned the german healthcare system is looking increasingly frail .
the basic problem is that german society is ageing , while its birth rate is sinking .
this means that healthcare costs are rising while fewer people are paying into the system .
many believe that what the only way to rejuvenate the system is to expose it to market forces .
rising costs but this would mark a dramatic break with bismarck 's original program .
made up of health insurance ; accident insurance ; disability insurance and an old-age retirement pension , it was based from the outset on the principle of solidarity : anyone who was employed was obliged to pay into the system and anyone who fell ill would receive medical care and a living allowance .
the cost was divided between employers and the employed - the employers contributing one third , the workers two thirds .
the ratio has changed since then - and so have many other aspects of the german health care service .
the last 20 years alone have seen 14 health care reforms .
while the initial health care restructuring was designed to provide more efficient and cost-effective healthcare services , the most recent reforms focus more on the structure of health insurance funds .
one way or another , most of them have been bad news for the public .
personal contributions to dental care and medicine costs have gone up , and patients now have to pay a mandatory 10 euros -lrb- $ 14 -rrb- per quarter whenever they go to the doctor .
dissatisfaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private patients are more lucrative so although the german healthcare services are still more or less all-inclusive , the cracks are showing .
and it 's not just patients who are noticing .
medical and healthcare professionals also say that conditions are worsening .
" everything has gone downhill , " says one nurse who works in a hospital in bonn .
" we all have less time , there are so many cuts , patients are dissatisfied , especially the elderly ones . "
doctors are also fed up , and say the system is flawed .
dorothee keltz is a gp with a practice in bonn .
she believes it 's important to take the time to talk to patients , and resents the fact that insurers prefer to see doctors using technical equipment .
" if one of my assistants does a cardiogram and we tell the patient what our findings are , we make three times as much money as we would if we spent 10 minutes talking to the patient , " she complains .
another problem is that doctors have had to start relying on private patients to stay afloat .
in germany , only 10 percent of the population has private , for-profit insurance - mostly civil servants and the self-employed .
increasingly , doctors are realizing that patients with state health cover are just not profitable enough .
patients as pawns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german health care is the fourth most expensive in the world still , the stakes are high .
the german health care system averages an annual turnover of over 250 billion euros , making it one of the nation 's most important economic sectors .
it 's also a sector in which powerful interest groups from trade associations to pharmaceuticals companies are constantly jockeying for position .
german health minister ulla schmidt is well aware of the tensions .
" no other sector has the financial clout of the health service , " she says .
" the amount of money spent on it exceeds the entire federal budget .

the german women are to face either sweden or norway in the semifinals . although some observers thought italy was the better team in friday 's match played in the finnish city of lahti , germany came out on top .
grings with two goals striker inka grings , who plays her club soccer for the uefa cup champions , fcr duisburg , scored germany 's first goal , after taking a pass from melanie behringer and making a quick turn to open up space for a shot from inside the penalty area .
despite a knee injury that she suffered against iceland , grings , together with fellow striker birgit prinz , was solid throughout friday 's match after germany took the 1-0 lead , the six-time european champion italy controlled the ball for most of the first half , but was unable to get through the german defense .
grings increased germany 's lead to 2-0 shortly after the break , with a tap-in following a cross by simone laudehr .
germany looked set to cruise through the second half , until patrizia panico put italy on the scoresheet in the 63rd minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inka grings celebrates after her first goal on friday germany 's goalkeeper , nadine angerer , was solid between the sticks in injury time , making a number of saves to preserve the victory for the german women , their 24th straight in european championship play .

they also warned that the global crisis is n't over yet . finance ministers from the world 's 20 leading economies have set their sights on multi-million euro bonuses paid to some bankers .
the explosive issue of bank bonuses is being pushed by europe 's largest economies .
" our citizens are deeply shocked at the revival of reprehensible practices , despite taxpayers ' money having been mobilized to support the financial sector , " chancellor angela merkel , british prime minister gordon brown and french president nicolas sarkozy said in a letter released before the start of the meeting .
sarkozy has called for bankers ' bonuses to be capped , an idea which found broad support among european finance ministers earlier this week .
britain has been reluctant to support a cap , for fear it could cause bankers to move their business out of london .
but there is british support for tying bonuses to long-term performance .
the bonus practices are seen as helping create banking culture which critics say is too focused on risky , short-term gains .
one issue which germany is expected to push is for rules limiting the size of banks .
" no bank should be allowed to become so big that it can blackmail governments , " merkel said earlier this week .

there is a real risk that either governments or people generally think ' we have done that , we are on the path to recovery , ' " he said .
that feeling was echoed by merkel , brown and sarkozy , who warned that we have not yet seen the end of the global economic crisis .
they urged colleagues to continue exercising " prudence and caution " saying that a bumpy road lies ahead .
besides bankers ' bonuses , finance ministers will also discuss how to go forward with huge stimulus packages introduced at the beginning of the crisis .
while g-20 countries need to show their commitment to implementing stimulus plans , they also need to begin coordinating exit strategies once the crisis has ended , the three leaders said .
germany is concerned about inflation and has talked about the need to ease up on stimulus spending .
britain , which is still in a recession , has been more cautious .

the isaf troops then engaged the militants in a fire fight .
no civilians or german soldiers were injured in the battle .
the german statement said that nato planes then launched the attack in response to a call for air support . german military confirm air attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato troops and afghan policemen are still investigating the incident while the german military did not say whether the airstrike was responsible for the tanker blast , a german army spokesman in berlin admitted that the tankers exploded during the battle .
kunduz provincial governor mohammad omar later said that local residents claimed a military jet fired at the tanker , setting off the explosion . captain jon stock , press officer for isaf , later told the reuters news agency : " i can confirm that there was an airstrike last night or early this morning .
isaf 's target in the air raid was insurgents . "
however , he said he was unable to comment on the reports of the blast . in the wake of the attack , reports of casualties at the scene varied , with the german army saying that 56 militants were killed in the blast while the local authorities put the number of civilian dead at 45 .
a security officer who asked to remain anonymous told reporters that 200 people were killed and wounded in the explosion while residents put the number of casualties at 300 . european leaders begin to speak out following the attack , british prime minster gordon brown confirmed that he would not be backing down or changing the government 's afghanistan policy in any way . speaking at the international institute for strategic studies -lrb- iiss -rrb- in london , brown said that the stability of the volatile region , spanning the afghan-pakistan border , had a profound impact on the security of britain and the rest of the international community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister brown refuses to back down " we can not just walk away , " said brown , adding that the objectives in the conflict were " clear , justified , realistic and achievable . " brown announced that his government would provide an extra 20 million pounds -lrb- 23 million euros / $ 32 million -rrb- to help stabilization and security efforts in helmand province , where british troops are based .
british foreign secretary david miliband called for an " urgent investigation " into the nato airstrike . nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen responded by saying that there would be a thorough investigation into the incident . " the afghan people should know that we are clearly committed to protecting them and that we will fully and immediately investigate this incident , " rasmussen told reporters . increased instability in previously safe north bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local afghan people have begun burying their villagers killed in the nato airstrike the incident is likely to cause more outrage among an afghan population which has been increasingly angered and frustrated by the rising civilian death toll and the apparent failure of the western forces to stabilize the country . the airstrike also serves as another example of the disintegrating state of security in the previously safe northern provinces of the country and the overall doggedness and endurance of the taliban across the whole of afghanistan .
despite us military surges and diverted troop deployments from iraq , many areas of the country remain in a state of war . the presidential vote on august 20 , which was meant to be an indication of how far the country had come since the end of taliban rule eight years ago , was marred by violence and intimidation as counter-insurgents targeted polling stations as well as afghan soldiers and isaf troops . mrm / nda / dpa / ap / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

everyone knows the melody to ludwig van beethoven 's piano piece " fuer elise , " but elise 's true identity has remained a mystery .
now a german musicologist says he 's discovered who she really was . from hard rock and jazz to cabaret and ring tones , " fuer elise " is the quintessential example of the popularization of classical music .
if beethoven got royalties , he 'd be a wealthy man . while everyone knows the melody to the short piano piece in a minor , few stop to wonder what was behind the intimate dedication . berlin musicologist klaus martin kopitz believes he has uncovered elise 's true identity - while he was n't even looking for it . " for years , i 've been working on a publication called ' beethoven in the eyes of his contemporaries , ' which includes all the reports from people who knew beethoven personally : journals , letters , poems , memoires , " said kopitz .
" certain women are mentioned , and one of them was elisabeth roeckel . " a close friendship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roeckel was an accomplished pianist elisabeth roeckel , born in 1793 , was the younger sister of singer joseph roeckel , who sang the role of florestan in beethoven 's opera " fidelio , " and became a good friend of the composer 's .
elise was also musically inclined - she played the piano and later became a singer . in her circle of friends , she was affectionately referred to as " elise . "
in the spring of 1810 , she went to bamberg to work in theater , with the hope of impressing none other than eta hoffman , who was the theater manager there at the time . according to kopitz , beethoven dedicated the a-minor piano piece " in the memory of " elise because they were separated when she relocated to bamberg .
since elisabeth roeckel was referred to in the dedication as " elise " and not the more formal " fraeulein roeckel , " she must have known beethoven well , said kopitz . indeed , their relationship was documented , as elise herself had written about it . beethoven the flirt " according to what she wrote , -lrb- their relationship -rrb- must have been close , " said kopitz .
in a letter , elise wrote about an evening with the composer , the famous guitarist mauro giuliani , and composer johann nepomuk hummel , who would later become her husband . " she wrote that beethoven , true to his frisky rhenish disposition , would n't stop teasing her and she did n't know what to do , " said the musicologist .
" he had pinched her arm out of sheer affection , " added kopitz . that elise chose hummel instead apparently did not mean the end of their friendship with beethoven .
several days before the composer 's death in march 1827 , elise visited him .
to remember her former admirer , she cut off a lock of his hair and accepted one of his quills as a present . how , then , could elisabeth roeckel have remained a mystery to musicologists over all the years ?

nohl claimed to have seen the original manuscript , saying it had been discovered in therese 's estate , but it has never been found since . all that exists is an incomplete draft of the work , sketched on a sheet of paper beethoven had apparently used for brainstorming other works .
this has been dated to 1810 , around the time of beethoven 's engagement to therese malfatti . if , however , the a-minor melody was indeed composed for elise and not therese , it is not immediately apparent how and why the original manuscript could have made it into therese 's hands . kopitz admitted that his theory on this point is not particularly scientific : " therese malfatti comes to beethoven 's house and sees the " fuer elise " manuscript lying on top of his piano , so she asks ' who is this elise ?

a berlin musicologist says he knows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was she the one ?
everyone knows the melody to ludwig van beethoven 's piano piece " fuer elise , " but elise 's true identity has remained a mystery .
now a german musicologist says he 's discovered who she really was . from hard rock and jazz to cabaret and ring tones , " fuer elise " is the quintessential example of the popularization of classical music .
if beethoven got royalties , he 'd be a wealthy man . while everyone knows the melody to the short piano piece in a minor , few stop to wonder what was behind the intimate dedication . berlin musicologist klaus martin kopitz believes he has uncovered elise 's true identity - while he was n't even looking for it . " for years , i 've been working on a publication called ' beethoven in the eyes of his contemporaries , ' which includes all the reports from people who knew beethoven personally : journals , letters , poems , memoires , " said kopitz .
" certain women are mentioned , and one of them was elisabeth roeckel . " a close friendship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roeckel was an accomplished pianist elisabeth roeckel , born in 1793 , was the younger sister of singer joseph roeckel , who sang the role of florestan in beethoven 's opera " fidelio , " and became a good friend of the composer 's .
elise was also musically inclined - she played the piano and later became a singer . in her circle of friends , she was affectionately referred to as " elise . "
in the spring of 1810 , she went to bamberg to work in theater , with the hope of impressing none other than eta hoffman , who was the theater manager there at the time . according to kopitz , beethoven dedicated the a-minor piano piece " in the memory of " elise because they were separated when she relocated to bamberg .
since elisabeth roeckel was referred to in the dedication as " elise " and not the more formal " fraeulein roeckel , " she must have known beethoven well , said kopitz . indeed , their relationship was documented , as elise herself had written about it . beethoven the flirt " according to what she wrote , -lrb- their relationship -rrb- must have been close , " said kopitz .
in a letter , elise wrote about an evening with the composer , the famous guitarist mauro giuliani , and composer johann nepomuk hummel , who would later become her husband . " she wrote that beethoven , true to his frisky rhenish disposition , would n't stop teasing her and she did n't know what to do , " said the musicologist .
" he had pinched her arm out of sheer affection , " added kopitz . that elise chose hummel instead apparently did not mean the end of their friendship with beethoven .
several days before the composer 's death in march 1827 , elise visited him .
to remember her former admirer , she cut off a lock of his hair and accepted one of his quills as a present . how , then , could elisabeth roeckel have remained a mystery to musicologists over all the years ?
and why has the piece so often been attributed to therese malfatti , who beethoven proposed to in 1810 ? bildunterschrift : the beethoven archive and the composer 's birth house are located in bonn original manuscript has disappeared the beethoven scholar ludwig nohl -lrb- 1831-1885 -rrb- may be to blame .
when he discovered a draft of the work , he published it in 1865 with a dedication to therese .
nohl claimed to have seen the original manuscript , saying it had been discovered in therese 's estate , but it has never been found since . all that exists is an incomplete draft of the work , sketched on a sheet of paper beethoven had apparently used for brainstorming other works .
this has been dated to 1810 , around the time of beethoven 's engagement to therese malfatti . if , however , the a-minor melody was indeed composed for elise and not therese , it is not immediately apparent how and why the original manuscript could have made it into therese 's hands . kopitz admitted that his theory on this point is not particularly scientific : " therese malfatti comes to beethoven 's house and sees the " fuer elise " manuscript lying on top of his piano , so she asks ' who is this elise ?
do you still want to marry me ? '
at that point he was embarrassed that he had written the piece for elise when he really wanted to marry therese . " what does it matter ? the musicologist 's theory is currently in the process of being published and has not yet garnered widespread acceptance in the field . the director of the beethoven archive at the beethoven house in bonn , bernhard appel , said he was skeptical of kopitz ' hypothesis , though he emphasized that he could not make a conclusion until the report was available for detailed review . " elise was a very common name in vienna at the time , " said appel , so the dedication could have referred to any number of women .
he added that , to prove who elise really was , it would be essential to clarify what path the manuscript took before it disappeared . " would the music change if we knew who it was dedicated to ? " questioned appel .

those hoping that a second irish referendum on the eu 's lisbon treaty will remove one of the largest stumbling blocks to the eu reform document ’ s ratification will be disappointed by news that has come out of dublin . polls and government ministers revealed a slump in support for the treaty among the populace of the recession-hit country ahead of the plebiscite next month .
public opinion was gauged by a face-to-face poll with 1,000 voters earlier this week conducted by the tns mrbi market research company .
the survey , published in the friday edition of the irish times , showed opposition to the treaty stood at 29 percent , increasing one point since the last poll in may , with support dropping eight points to 46 percent in the same time span .
the number of voters who remained undecided stood at 25 percent , an increase of seven points .
in an article which accompanied the results , the irish times ' political editor , stephen collins , wrote that " a striking feature of the latest poll is that most of those who have left the ' yes ' camp have moved into the ' do n't know ' category rather than shifting into the ' no ' camp . "
if the poll results were not gloomy enough , irish foreign minister michael martin admitted that the government was pessimistic about the october 2 referendum but that he believed that , while it would be difficult to secure ratification , he expected a slim vote in favor .
" i was never under any illusion but that it would be difficult to secure this but i do think we can do it , " he told national radio broadcaster rte .
" there is a very significant challenge ahead , it 's going to be a very tight campaign and it will demand all of the resources , conviction , politics and passion of all of those on the yes side . "
brussels concessions led to second referendum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : support is slipping for the lisbio treaty as the vote nears ireland is the only member of the 27-nation eu which is constitutionally bound to hold a referendum on the treaty , which is designed to overhaul of the eu 's foreign policy-making and internal decision-making in a greatly expanded bloc .
irish voters threw the ratification process into chaos last year when they rejected the treaty in the first referendum .
irish voters rejected the pact in a referendum held in june , partly out of concerns that their country would lose the right to nominate a commissioner to the eu 's executive and concerns that the treaty would contravene the country 's constitution on issues relating to the right to life , education and family policy .
the decision to launch a second referendum came after opinion polls showed voters would back it this time after dublin won concessions from brussels on key policy areas .
these included the guarantee that ireland 's traditional policy of neutrality would be maintained and that the lisbon treaty would not impinge on ireland 's right to set tax levels .
the eu also agreed that ireland would retain the right to an eu commissioner .
backlash could lead to potential " no " vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brian cowen 's government is also losing support despite the fact that the previous three opinion polls conducted this year showed solid support for the treaty , it is believed that the growing dissatisfaction with the irish government 's handling of the financial crisis has turned an anti-government backlash into a vote against ratification .
prime minister brian cowen 's government has itself been faced with some uncomfortable reading in recent polls .
the latest showed that 75 percent of voters would like to see him ousted , while support for the prime minister 's fianna fail party dropped to a record low of 17 percent .
for the lisbon treaty to come into force , it has to be ratified by all 27 eu states .
poland and the czech republic , currently led by euro-skeptic presidents , have said that they will wait for ireland 's vote before signing it into law .

those hoping that a second irish referendum on the eu 's lisbon treaty will remove one of the largest stumbling blocks to the eu reform document ’ s ratification will be disappointed by news that has come out of dublin . polls and government ministers revealed a slump in support for the treaty among the populace of the recession-hit country ahead of the plebiscite next month .
public opinion was gauged by a face-to-face poll with 1,000 voters earlier this week conducted by the tns mrbi market research company .
the survey , published in the friday edition of the irish times , showed opposition to the treaty stood at 29 percent , increasing one point since the last poll in may , with support dropping eight points to 46 percent in the same time span .
the number of voters who remained undecided stood at 25 percent , an increase of seven points .
in an article which accompanied the results , the irish times ' political editor , stephen collins , wrote that " a striking feature of the latest poll is that most of those who have left the ' yes ' camp have moved into the ' do n't know ' category rather than shifting into the ' no ' camp . "
if the poll results were not gloomy enough , irish foreign minister michael martin admitted that the government was pessimistic about the october 2 referendum but that he believed that , while it would be difficult to secure ratification , he expected a slim vote in favor .
" i was never under any illusion but that it would be difficult to secure this but i do think we can do it , " he told national radio broadcaster rte .
" there is a very significant challenge ahead , it 's going to be a very tight campaign and it will demand all of the resources , conviction , politics and passion of all of those on the yes side . "
brussels concessions led to second referendum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : support is slipping for the lisbio treaty as the vote nears ireland is the only member of the 27-nation eu which is constitutionally bound to hold a referendum on the treaty , which is designed to overhaul of the eu 's foreign policy-making and internal decision-making in a greatly expanded bloc .
irish voters threw the ratification process into chaos last year when they rejected the treaty in the first referendum .
irish voters rejected the pact in a referendum held in june , partly out of concerns that their country would lose the right to nominate a commissioner to the eu 's executive and concerns that the treaty would contravene the country 's constitution on issues relating to the right to life , education and family policy .
the decision to launch a second referendum came after opinion polls showed voters would back it this time after dublin won concessions from brussels on key policy areas .
these included the guarantee that ireland 's traditional policy of neutrality would be maintained and that the lisbon treaty would not impinge on ireland 's right to set tax levels .
the eu also agreed that ireland would retain the right to an eu commissioner .
backlash could lead to potential " no " vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brian cowen 's government is also losing support despite the fact that the previous three opinion polls conducted this year showed solid support for the treaty , it is believed that the growing dissatisfaction with the irish government 's handling of the financial crisis has turned an anti-government backlash into a vote against ratification .
prime minister brian cowen 's government has itself been faced with some uncomfortable reading in recent polls .
the latest showed that 75 percent of voters would like to see him ousted , while support for the prime minister 's fianna fail party dropped to a record low of 17 percent .
for the lisbon treaty to come into force , it has to be ratified by all 27 eu states .
poland and the czech republic , currently led by euro-skeptic presidents , have said that they will wait for ireland 's vote before signing it into law .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 04.09.2009 berlin pushes for a quick solution for opel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : options for future ownership of opel are still on the table the german government is stepping up the pressure on general motors ' executive board to reach a decision about opel . " we the government have done the homework , the contracts have been drawn up , and now the ball is in general motors ' court , " said economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg on german television on friday , sept .
4 .
but since berlin provided opel with a 1.5-billion-euro bridging loan to help the car group through its current upheaval , it has a decisive say in the outcome - and would like to see opel sold to magna international .
the german government has endorsed a bid from the austrian-canadian auto supplier to acquire a majority holding in opel by offering state-backed guarantees worth about 4.5 billion euros .
magna is leading a joint bid with state-owned russian bank sberbank and russia 's second-largest auto maker , gaz .
chancellor angela merkel told the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung on friday that magna 's concept was " the most viable and the most sustainable . "
but she also stressed that gm had to make its own mind up .
" we hope -lrb- its decision -rrb- will be in the interests of the company and its employees , " she said .
decision time the head of general motors in europe said magna was indeed well positioned to win the drawn-out battle to take over the us car maker 's opel division .
german daily die welt this week quoted carl-peter forster as saying that magna would " most likely " win the takeover bid since all the contracts and financing were in place for it to do so .
but he did not rule out the possibility that gm could keep control of opel and gm 's british-based vauxhall division instead .
speculation has been rife that gm is considering retaining control instead of hiving off a majority stake in the group , which includes the opel and british vauxhall brands .
quoting what it said was a gm official involved in the negotiations , the wall street journal reported that the auto group was prepared to pour more than 1 billion euros of its own money into restructuring opel .

" if they are ready to engage with us , we 're ready to cooperate with them , " said swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country holds the eu presidency , as he arrived at the talks in stockholm .
" but if they decide to go for confrontation , then confrontation will happen , " he told reporters .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , speaking at a separate press conference , said europe needed to remain united in its opposition to iran 's nuclear program .
" i think it 's very important for us to be gathered firmly in the eu 's reaction towards iran , not accepting nuclear ambitions , " he said .
germany 's deputy minister for foreign affairs , guenter gloser , however , said it was pointless to impose more sanctions on iran , pointing out that such actions in the past had yet to bring about any positive change .
" but something must be done to prevent a nuclear arms race in the middle east , " he added .
iran says nuclear endeavors are peaceful a defiant president mahmoud ahmadinejad said on thursday that iran is ready for more sanctions over its nuclear program and will not bow to pressure in meeting any deadline set by world powers .
however tehran has also said it was willing to begin fresh talks with the six major powers - britain , china , france , russia and the united states , plus germany - regarding its nuclear drive .
iran continues to insist its nuclear work is peaceful , while western countries suspect that iran is attempting to build atomic weapons .
the un security council has already slapped three rounds of sanctions on the islamic republic , but pressure is growing for more .
minister appointment further " provocation " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bildt has called iran 's policies " provocative " meanwhile , reinfeldt called president ahmadinejad 's appointment of international terror suspect ahmad vahidi as defense minister a sign of a desire to worsen relations between iran and the west .
" we feel this is a situation that simply returns to provocations .
the appointment of -lsb- vahdi -rsb- is another one of these examples , " reinfeldt told reporters .
vahidi is wanted by interpol in connection with a 1994 attack on a jewish charity that killed 85 people. glb / reuters / ap / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the thai military is also looking to development programs in efforts to gain support – and vital intelligence - from the local muslim population to gain the upper hand in curbing the violence . across southern thailand ’ s four largely muslim populated provinces the thai army has deployed some 30,000 troops aimed at quelling the five year old islamic insurgency .
a further 30,000 civil volunteers , rangers and police have also been deployed .
across the provinces of pattani , yala , songkhla , and narathiwat there is a climate of fear and uncertainty .
over the years , the military has been accused by human rights groups of heavy-handed crackdowns and allegations of abuse .
these have led to deep animosity and distrust among the local largely muslim communities .
rights groups have called for the government to take action .
emergency powers in the south have given the army wide powers and immunity .
development projects since 2006 , the thai military has sought to steer a course towards winning hearts and minds within local muslim communities .
the government has spent over three billion dollars to boost the economy and security in the south .
lieutenant general pichet wisaijorn , the fourth army commander , is currently overseeing the program led by the internal security operations command -lrb- isoc -rrb- .

if they have sufficient to live they live according to their religion ; then they think they are happy enough . ”
presence of thai military but others raise questions over the policy including the stationing of high levels of military in the region .
surachart bamrungsuk , is a professor in politics at chulalongkorn university .
he says for the thai military a counter insurgency strategy is a new approach .
“ when you ’ re talking about winning the hearts and minds it ’ s not easy because every unit will have its own way of thinking .
for me it would be better if we accept counter insurgency – a need to win at the people level – so the concept of winning hearts and minds would be applicable to the thai army . ”
he says the army is now involved in that process of readjustment . but angkhana neelapaichit , chairperson of rights organization , the working group on justice for peace , says local people need to have more influence over the projects being undertaken .
“ i suggest every project must be from the grass roots people , not only from the bottom-up but from the top down because we should have people participation .
we should ask the people what they want to do ; not what we want to do for them but what they want so we should ask the people . ”
the thai government is moving to place more civilian control over development in the south .
a new body will come under the control of the prime minister ’ s office .
a government spokesman says he was confident the military would support the new measures .

the isaf troops then engaged the militants in a fire fight .
no civilians or german soldiers were injured in the battle .
the german statement said that nato planes then launched the attack in response to a call for air support . german military confirm air attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato troops and afghan policemen are still investigating the incident while the german military did not say whether the airstrike was responsible for the tanker blast , a german army spokesman in berlin admitted that the tankers exploded during the battle .
kunduz provincial governor mohammad omar later said that local residents claimed a military jet fired at the tanker , setting off the explosion . captain jon stock , press officer for isaf , later told the reuters news agency : " i can confirm that there was an airstrike last night or early this morning .
isaf 's target in the air raid was insurgents . "
however , he said he was unable to comment on the reports of the blast . in the wake of the attack , reports of casualties at the scene varied , with the german army saying that 56 militants were killed in the blast while the local authorities put the number of civilian dead at 45 .
a security officer who asked to remain anonymous told reporters that 200 people were killed and wounded in the explosion while residents put the number of casualties at 300 . european leaders begin to speak out following the attack , british prime minster gordon brown confirmed that he would not be backing down or changing the government 's afghanistan policy in any way . speaking at the international institute for strategic studies -lrb- iiss -rrb- in london , brown said that the stability of the volatile region , spanning the afghan-pakistan border , had a profound impact on the security of britain and the rest of the international community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister brown refuses to back down " we can not just walk away , " said brown , adding that the objectives in the conflict were " clear , justified , realistic and achievable . " brown announced that his government would provide an extra 20 million pounds -lrb- 23 million euros / $ 32 million -rrb- to help stabilization and security efforts in helmand province , where british troops are based .
british foreign secretary david miliband called for an " urgent investigation " into the nato airstrike . nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen responded by saying that there would be a thorough investigation into the incident . " the afghan people should know that we are clearly committed to protecting them and that we will fully and immediately investigate this incident , " rasmussen told reporters . increased instability in previously safe north bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local afghan people have begun burying their villagers killed in the nato airstrike the incident is likely to cause more outrage among an afghan population which has been increasingly angered and frustrated by the rising civilian death toll and the apparent failure of the western forces to stabilize the country . the airstrike also serves as another example of the disintegrating state of security in the previously safe northern provinces of the country and the overall doggedness and endurance of the taliban across the whole of afghanistan .
despite us military surges and diverted troop deployments from iraq , many areas of the country remain in a state of war . the presidential vote on august 20 , which was meant to be an indication of how far the country had come since the end of taliban rule eight years ago , was marred by violence and intimidation as counter-insurgents targeted polling stations as well as afghan soldiers and isaf troops . mrm / nda / dpa / ap / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and its coming to a screen near you on saturday . up until just two short decades ago , berlin was split down the middle by a great , dirty wall .
it is not a long chapter in history , yet the city has undergone such monumental change since reunification that the producers felt not only berliners should be party to the party .
hence the project .
the brainchild of producer thomas kufus and director volker heise , the documentary will run for 24 hours straight starting at 6am cet on saturday . that is exactly one year to the day since it was shot . early on the morning of sept .
5 , 2008 , 80 camera teams hit the streets of berlin and spent the subsequent 24 hours collecting footage to depict the myriad lives and fates played out day by day in the german capital .
the end result brings together the destinies of 20 main protagonists and 50 secondary characters and takes viewers into the realms - public and private - of a refuse worker , french journalist , poet , drag queen and drug addict .
there are also sequences with more high profile berlin figures , including the mayor of the city klaus wowereit , conductor daniel barenboim and the editor of the mass-circulation bild newspaper kai diekmann .
exploration of diversity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's left of the berlin wall volker heise said the film was a way to find out how people live in a city of such diversity .
" how do people educate their children ?
what television programs do they watch ?
what do they eat ? " he asked in material outlining the project .
work first began on the 2.8-million-euro -lrb- $ 4-million -rrb- film some three years ago .
besides the protagonists selected to feature in the tele-visual extravaganza , berliners were invited to send in their own contributions .
some of these have made it into the final product .
so , too , has the city itself .
there are multiple shots of the television tower at alexanderplatz , the river spree and other landmarks .
but viewers will also catch glimpses of the smaller spots that make berlin the unique city it is .
in essence , the makers have tried to leave no stone unturned in their portrayal of this 21st-century metropolis .

" we the government have done the homework , the contracts have been drawn up , and now the ball is in general motors ' court , " said economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg on german television on friday , sept .
4 .
but since berlin provided opel with a 1.5-billion-euro bridging loan to help the car group through its current upheaval , it has a decisive say in the outcome - and would like to see opel sold to magna international .
the german government has endorsed a bid from the austrian-canadian auto supplier to acquire a majority holding in opel by offering state-backed guarantees worth about 4.5 billion euros .
magna is leading a joint bid with state-owned russian bank sberbank and russia 's second-largest auto maker , gaz .
chancellor angela merkel told the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung on friday that magna 's concept was " the most viable and the most sustainable . "
but she also stressed that gm had to make its own mind up .
" we hope -lrb- its decision -rrb- will be in the interests of the company and its employees , " she said .
decision time the head of general motors in europe said magna was indeed well positioned to win the drawn-out battle to take over the us car maker 's opel division .
german daily die welt this week quoted carl-peter forster as saying that magna would " most likely " win the takeover bid since all the contracts and financing were in place for it to do so .
but he did not rule out the possibility that gm could keep control of opel and gm 's british-based vauxhall division instead .
speculation has been rife that gm is considering retaining control instead of hiving off a majority stake in the group , which includes the opel and british vauxhall brands .
quoting what it said was a gm official involved in the negotiations , the wall street journal reported that the auto group was prepared to pour more than 1 billion euros of its own money into restructuring opel .
according to german press agency dpa , gm has been considering the investment plan in the event that it fails to sell off the majority stake in opel to the groups bidding for control .
" should the negotiations with the bidders not reach a satisfactory result then alternatives must be examined , " said a source close to the negotiations .
weighing the options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg says it 's decision time the general motors board decided last month against making a decision on opel , with company officials indicating that gm would like berlin to consider an alternative offer for its european subsidiary , drawn up by the brussels-based private equity group rhj international .
rhj international earlier this week raised its offer for a 50.1-percent stake in what has been described as the new opel by 25 million to 300 million euros in cash .
the talks over opel come at a crucial time for german chancellor angela merkel , with parliamentary elections just weeks away .
the other european nations where opel has operations - spain , britain and poland - have been concerned that the financial support offered by berlin meant that they would bear the brunt of any cost cutting launched by the new owners of opel .

and its coming to a screen near you on saturday . up until just two short decades ago , berlin was split down the middle by a great , dirty wall .
it is not a long chapter in history , yet the city has undergone such monumental change since reunification that the producers felt not only berliners should be party to the party .
hence the project .
the brainchild of producer thomas kufus and director volker heise , the documentary will run for 24 hours straight starting at 6am cet on saturday . that is exactly one year to the day since it was shot . early on the morning of sept .
5 , 2008 , 80 camera teams hit the streets of berlin and spent the subsequent 24 hours collecting footage to depict the myriad lives and fates played out day by day in the german capital .
the end result brings together the destinies of 20 main protagonists and 50 secondary characters and takes viewers into the realms - public and private - of a refuse worker , french journalist , poet , drag queen and drug addict .
there are also sequences with more high profile berlin figures , including the mayor of the city klaus wowereit , conductor daniel barenboim and the editor of the mass-circulation bild newspaper kai diekmann .
exploration of diversity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's left of the berlin wall volker heise said the film was a way to find out how people live in a city of such diversity .
" how do people educate their children ?
what television programs do they watch ?
what do they eat ? " he asked in material outlining the project .
work first began on the 2.8-million-euro -lrb- $ 4-million -rrb- film some three years ago .
besides the protagonists selected to feature in the tele-visual extravaganza , berliners were invited to send in their own contributions .
some of these have made it into the final product .
so , too , has the city itself .
there are multiple shots of the television tower at alexanderplatz , the river spree and other landmarks .
but viewers will also catch glimpses of the smaller spots that make berlin the unique city it is .
in essence , the makers have tried to leave no stone unturned in their portrayal of this 21st-century metropolis .
from the bedroom to the sausage stand , the courtroom to the chancellery , they have set out to capture life as it happens .
and as the introduction is at pains to point out , it is just a normal day : " nothing special is expected to happen .
people will get up and go to work , they will love and hate one another , they will be born and they will die . "
the show begins at 6am central european time and can be seen on arte and berlin public broadcaster , rbb .
viewers outside germany can pick up the live stream at www.24berlin.tv.

germany 's healthcare system has experienced all manner of nips and tucks since it was introduced over 125 years ago but it 's nonetheless showing its age .
the election might decide whether it gets a new lease of life . health insurance in germany has come a long way since sickness cover was introduced in 1883 under kaiser wilhelm i and his chancellor , otto von bismarck .
at the time , the average german worked a 60-hour week for a pittance , and sickness or accidents meant a very real threat of starvation .
public dissatisfaction was widespread , and it was against this backdrop that germany started on the long road towards the welfare state it still more or less is .
but these days , less is the operative word .
the social solidarity that has traditionally underpinned the german healthcare system is looking increasingly frail .
the basic problem is that german society is ageing , while its birth rate is sinking .
this means that healthcare costs are rising while fewer people are paying into the system .
many believe that what the only way to rejuvenate the system is to expose it to market forces .
rising costs but this would mark a dramatic break with bismarck 's original program .
made up of health insurance ; accident insurance ; disability insurance and an old-age retirement pension , it was based from the outset on the principle of solidarity : anyone who was employed was obliged to pay into the system and anyone who fell ill would receive medical care and a living allowance .
the cost was divided between employers and the employed - the employers contributing one third , the workers two thirds .
the ratio has changed since then - and so have many other aspects of the german health care service .
the last 20 years alone have seen 14 health care reforms .
while the initial health care restructuring was designed to provide more efficient and cost-effective healthcare services , the most recent reforms focus more on the structure of health insurance funds .
one way or another , most of them have been bad news for the public .
personal contributions to dental care and medicine costs have gone up , and patients now have to pay a mandatory 10 euros -lrb- $ 14 -rrb- per quarter whenever they go to the doctor .

and it 's not just patients who are noticing .
medical and healthcare professionals also say that conditions are worsening .
" everything has gone downhill , " says one nurse who works in a hospital in bonn .
" we all have less time , there are so many cuts , patients are dissatisfied , especially the elderly ones . "
doctors are also fed up , and say the system is flawed .
dorothee keltz is a gp with a practice in bonn .
she believes it 's important to take the time to talk to patients , and resents the fact that insurers prefer to see doctors using technical equipment .
" if one of my assistants does a cardiogram and we tell the patient what our findings are , we make three times as much money as we would if we spent 10 minutes talking to the patient , " she complains .
another problem is that doctors have had to start relying on private patients to stay afloat .
in germany , only 10 percent of the population has private , for-profit insurance - mostly civil servants and the self-employed .
increasingly , doctors are realizing that patients with state health cover are just not profitable enough .
patients as pawns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german health care is the fourth most expensive in the world still , the stakes are high .
the german health care system averages an annual turnover of over 250 billion euros , making it one of the nation 's most important economic sectors .
it 's also a sector in which powerful interest groups from trade associations to pharmaceuticals companies are constantly jockeying for position .
german health minister ulla schmidt is well aware of the tensions .
" no other sector has the financial clout of the health service , " she says .
" the amount of money spent on it exceeds the entire federal budget .
the sector 's players are dealing with huge funds with which they can buy opinion , influence opinion and promote their products .
in this respect it is patients themselves who are in the weakest position , even though they should be the strongest , because 70 million people in germany have state health cover . "
but the public is often little more than a pawn in a game , and has little insight into what is being spent and how .
the new cornerstone for funding german health care spending is the controversial and highly complex ' gesundheitsfond ' , the health care fund .
supposedly , it aims to simplify health benefits , provide more choices , increase transparency and create competition among providers .
but its detractors believe that it fails to address the increasingly urgent issue of funding the enormous german system .

social democrat ulla schmidt , for one , would like to give it another chance and abolish private health insurance altogether .
but ultimately , today 's social and economic forces are nudging germany more in the direction of a healthcare system built on individual responsibility .

" we the government have done the homework , the contracts have been drawn up , and now the ball is in general motors ' court , " said economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg on german television on friday , sept .
4 .
but since berlin provided opel with a 1.5-billion-euro bridging loan to help the car group through its current upheaval , it has a decisive say in the outcome - and would like to see opel sold to magna international .
the german government has endorsed a bid from the austrian-canadian auto supplier to acquire a majority holding in opel by offering state-backed guarantees worth about 4.5 billion euros .
magna is leading a joint bid with state-owned russian bank sberbank and russia 's second-largest auto maker , gaz .
chancellor angela merkel told the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung on friday that magna 's concept was " the most viable and the most sustainable . "
but she also stressed that gm had to make its own mind up .
" we hope -lrb- its decision -rrb- will be in the interests of the company and its employees , " she said .
decision time the head of general motors in europe said magna was indeed well positioned to win the drawn-out battle to take over the us car maker 's opel division .
german daily die welt this week quoted carl-peter forster as saying that magna would " most likely " win the takeover bid since all the contracts and financing were in place for it to do so .
but he did not rule out the possibility that gm could keep control of opel and gm 's british-based vauxhall division instead .
speculation has been rife that gm is considering retaining control instead of hiving off a majority stake in the group , which includes the opel and british vauxhall brands .
quoting what it said was a gm official involved in the negotiations , the wall street journal reported that the auto group was prepared to pour more than 1 billion euros of its own money into restructuring opel .
according to german press agency dpa , gm has been considering the investment plan in the event that it fails to sell off the majority stake in opel to the groups bidding for control .
" should the negotiations with the bidders not reach a satisfactory result then alternatives must be examined , " said a source close to the negotiations .
weighing the options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg says it 's decision time the general motors board decided last month against making a decision on opel , with company officials indicating that gm would like berlin to consider an alternative offer for its european subsidiary , drawn up by the brussels-based private equity group rhj international .
rhj international earlier this week raised its offer for a 50.1-percent stake in what has been described as the new opel by 25 million to 300 million euros in cash .
the talks over opel come at a crucial time for german chancellor angela merkel , with parliamentary elections just weeks away .
the other european nations where opel has operations - spain , britain and poland - have been concerned that the financial support offered by berlin meant that they would bear the brunt of any cost cutting launched by the new owners of opel .
plunging car sales forced gm earlier this year to launch a major restructuring of its global operations , including selling off a majority stake in opel. jp / dpa / afp editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de germany regrets gm 's indecision regarding opel germany 's economics minister said on saturday he regretted that general motors ' board had failed to take a decision on a deal covering its european operations , including ailing german unit opel .
-lrb- 22.08.2009 -rrb- germany wants more money for struggling german car maker opel general motors has requested final offers for opel to be submitted by monday amid german government demands for more cash from bidders magna , rhj and china 's beijing automative industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- .

" we the government have done the homework , the contracts have been drawn up , and now the ball is in general motors ' court , " said economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg on german television on friday , sept .
4 .
but since berlin provided opel with a 1.5-billion-euro bridging loan to help the car group through its current upheaval , it has a decisive say in the outcome - and would like to see opel sold to magna international .
the german government has endorsed a bid from the austrian-canadian auto supplier to acquire a majority holding in opel by offering state-backed guarantees worth about 4.5 billion euros .
magna is leading a joint bid with state-owned russian bank sberbank and russia 's second-largest auto maker , gaz .
chancellor angela merkel told the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung on friday that magna 's concept was " the most viable and the most sustainable . "
but she also stressed that gm had to make its own mind up .
" we hope -lrb- its decision -rrb- will be in the interests of the company and its employees , " she said .
decision time the head of general motors in europe said magna was indeed well positioned to win the drawn-out battle to take over the us car maker 's opel division .
german daily die welt this week quoted carl-peter forster as saying that magna would " most likely " win the takeover bid since all the contracts and financing were in place for it to do so .
but he did not rule out the possibility that gm could keep control of opel and gm 's british-based vauxhall division instead .
speculation has been rife that gm is considering retaining control instead of hiving off a majority stake in the group , which includes the opel and british vauxhall brands .
quoting what it said was a gm official involved in the negotiations , the wall street journal reported that the auto group was prepared to pour more than 1 billion euros of its own money into restructuring opel .
according to german press agency dpa , gm has been considering the investment plan in the event that it fails to sell off the majority stake in opel to the groups bidding for control .
" should the negotiations with the bidders not reach a satisfactory result then alternatives must be examined , " said a source close to the negotiations .
weighing the options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg says it 's decision time the general motors board decided last month against making a decision on opel , with company officials indicating that gm would like berlin to consider an alternative offer for its european subsidiary , drawn up by the brussels-based private equity group rhj international .
rhj international earlier this week raised its offer for a 50.1-percent stake in what has been described as the new opel by 25 million to 300 million euros in cash .
the talks over opel come at a crucial time for german chancellor angela merkel , with parliamentary elections just weeks away .
the other european nations where opel has operations - spain , britain and poland - have been concerned that the financial support offered by berlin meant that they would bear the brunt of any cost cutting launched by the new owners of opel .

and its coming to a screen near you on saturday . up until just two short decades ago , berlin was split down the middle by a great , dirty wall .
it is not a long chapter in history , yet the city has undergone such monumental change since reunification that the producers felt not only berliners should be party to the party .
hence the project .
the brainchild of producer thomas kufus and director volker heise , the documentary will run for 24 hours straight starting at 6am cet on saturday . that is exactly one year to the day since it was shot . early on the morning of sept .
5 , 2008 , 80 camera teams hit the streets of berlin and spent the subsequent 24 hours collecting footage to depict the myriad lives and fates played out day by day in the german capital .
the end result brings together the destinies of 20 main protagonists and 50 secondary characters and takes viewers into the realms - public and private - of a refuse worker , french journalist , poet , drag queen and drug addict .
there are also sequences with more high profile berlin figures , including the mayor of the city klaus wowereit , conductor daniel barenboim and the editor of the mass-circulation bild newspaper kai diekmann .
exploration of diversity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's left of the berlin wall volker heise said the film was a way to find out how people live in a city of such diversity .
" how do people educate their children ?
what television programs do they watch ?
what do they eat ? " he asked in material outlining the project .
work first began on the 2.8-million-euro -lrb- $ 4-million -rrb- film some three years ago .
besides the protagonists selected to feature in the tele-visual extravaganza , berliners were invited to send in their own contributions .
some of these have made it into the final product .
so , too , has the city itself .
there are multiple shots of the television tower at alexanderplatz , the river spree and other landmarks .
but viewers will also catch glimpses of the smaller spots that make berlin the unique city it is .
in essence , the makers have tried to leave no stone unturned in their portrayal of this 21st-century metropolis .
from the bedroom to the sausage stand , the courtroom to the chancellery , they have set out to capture life as it happens .
and as the introduction is at pains to point out , it is just a normal day : " nothing special is expected to happen .
people will get up and go to work , they will love and hate one another , they will be born and they will die . "
the show begins at 6am central european time and can be seen on arte and berlin public broadcaster , rbb .
viewers outside germany can pick up the live stream at www.24berlin.tv.

work first began on the 2.8-million-euro -lrb- $ 4-million -rrb- film some three years ago .
besides the protagonists selected to feature in the tele-visual extravaganza , berliners were invited to send in their own contributions .
some of these have made it into the final product .
so , too , has the city itself .
there are multiple shots of the television tower at alexanderplatz , the river spree and other landmarks .
but viewers will also catch glimpses of the smaller spots that make berlin the unique city it is .
in essence , the makers have tried to leave no stone unturned in their portrayal of this 21st-century metropolis .
from the bedroom to the sausage stand , the courtroom to the chancellery , they have set out to capture life as it happens .
and as the introduction is at pains to point out , it is just a normal day : " nothing special is expected to happen .
people will get up and go to work , they will love and hate one another , they will be born and they will die . "
the show begins at 6am central european time and can be seen on arte and berlin public broadcaster , rbb .
viewers outside germany can pick up the live stream at www.24berlin.tv.

they also warned that the global crisis is n't over yet . finance ministers from the world 's 20 leading economies have set their sights on multi-million euro bonuses paid to some bankers .
the explosive issue of bank bonuses is being pushed by europe 's largest economies .
" our citizens are deeply shocked at the revival of reprehensible practices , despite taxpayers ' money having been mobilized to support the financial sector , " chancellor angela merkel , british prime minister gordon brown and french president nicolas sarkozy said in a letter released before the start of the meeting .
sarkozy has called for bankers ' bonuses to be capped , an idea which found broad support among european finance ministers earlier this week .
britain has been reluctant to support a cap , for fear it could cause bankers to move their business out of london .
but there is british support for tying bonuses to long-term performance .
the bonus practices are seen as helping create banking culture which critics say is too focused on risky , short-term gains .

" no bank should be allowed to become so big that it can blackmail governments , " merkel said earlier this week .

that feeling was echoed by merkel , brown and sarkozy , who warned that we have not yet seen the end of the global economic crisis .
they urged colleagues to continue exercising " prudence and caution " saying that a bumpy road lies ahead .
besides bankers ' bonuses , finance ministers will also discuss how to go forward with huge stimulus packages introduced at the beginning of the crisis .
while g-20 countries need to show their commitment to implementing stimulus plans , they also need to begin coordinating exit strategies once the crisis has ended , the three leaders said .
germany is concerned about inflation and has talked about the need to ease up on stimulus spending .

they also warned that the global crisis is n't over yet . finance ministers from the world 's 20 leading economies have set their sights on multi-million euro bonuses paid to some bankers .
the explosive issue of bank bonuses is being pushed by europe 's largest economies .
" our citizens are deeply shocked at the revival of reprehensible practices , despite taxpayers ' money having been mobilized to support the financial sector , " chancellor angela merkel , british prime minister gordon brown and french president nicolas sarkozy said in a letter released before the start of the meeting .
sarkozy has called for bankers ' bonuses to be capped , an idea which found broad support among european finance ministers earlier this week .
britain has been reluctant to support a cap , for fear it could cause bankers to move their business out of london .
but there is british support for tying bonuses to long-term performance .
the bonus practices are seen as helping create banking culture which critics say is too focused on risky , short-term gains .
one issue which germany is expected to push is for rules limiting the size of banks .
" no bank should be allowed to become so big that it can blackmail governments , " merkel said earlier this week .
crisis not over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , sarkozy and brown warned that tough times are still to come british finance minister alistair darling , the host of the g-20 meeting , warned against complacency in an interview with the independent newspaper .
" the biggest single risk to recovery is that people think the job is done .
there is a real risk that either governments or people generally think ' we have done that , we are on the path to recovery , ' " he said .
that feeling was echoed by merkel , brown and sarkozy , who warned that we have not yet seen the end of the global economic crisis .
they urged colleagues to continue exercising " prudence and caution " saying that a bumpy road lies ahead .

those hoping that a second irish referendum on the eu 's lisbon treaty will remove one of the largest stumbling blocks to the eu reform document ’ s ratification will be disappointed by news that has come out of dublin . polls and government ministers revealed a slump in support for the treaty among the populace of the recession-hit country ahead of the plebiscite next month .
public opinion was gauged by a face-to-face poll with 1,000 voters earlier this week conducted by the tns mrbi market research company .
the survey , published in the friday edition of the irish times , showed opposition to the treaty stood at 29 percent , increasing one point since the last poll in may , with support dropping eight points to 46 percent in the same time span .
the number of voters who remained undecided stood at 25 percent , an increase of seven points .
in an article which accompanied the results , the irish times ' political editor , stephen collins , wrote that " a striking feature of the latest poll is that most of those who have left the ' yes ' camp have moved into the ' do n't know ' category rather than shifting into the ' no ' camp . "
if the poll results were not gloomy enough , irish foreign minister michael martin admitted that the government was pessimistic about the october 2 referendum but that he believed that , while it would be difficult to secure ratification , he expected a slim vote in favor .
" i was never under any illusion but that it would be difficult to secure this but i do think we can do it , " he told national radio broadcaster rte .
" there is a very significant challenge ahead , it 's going to be a very tight campaign and it will demand all of the resources , conviction , politics and passion of all of those on the yes side . "
brussels concessions led to second referendum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : support is slipping for the lisbio treaty as the vote nears ireland is the only member of the 27-nation eu which is constitutionally bound to hold a referendum on the treaty , which is designed to overhaul of the eu 's foreign policy-making and internal decision-making in a greatly expanded bloc .
irish voters threw the ratification process into chaos last year when they rejected the treaty in the first referendum .
irish voters rejected the pact in a referendum held in june , partly out of concerns that their country would lose the right to nominate a commissioner to the eu 's executive and concerns that the treaty would contravene the country 's constitution on issues relating to the right to life , education and family policy .
the decision to launch a second referendum came after opinion polls showed voters would back it this time after dublin won concessions from brussels on key policy areas .
these included the guarantee that ireland 's traditional policy of neutrality would be maintained and that the lisbon treaty would not impinge on ireland 's right to set tax levels .
the eu also agreed that ireland would retain the right to an eu commissioner .
backlash could lead to potential " no " vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brian cowen 's government is also losing support despite the fact that the previous three opinion polls conducted this year showed solid support for the treaty , it is believed that the growing dissatisfaction with the irish government 's handling of the financial crisis has turned an anti-government backlash into a vote against ratification .
prime minister brian cowen 's government has itself been faced with some uncomfortable reading in recent polls .
the latest showed that 75 percent of voters would like to see him ousted , while support for the prime minister 's fianna fail party dropped to a record low of 17 percent .
for the lisbon treaty to come into force , it has to be ratified by all 27 eu states .
poland and the czech republic , currently led by euro-skeptic presidents , have said that they will wait for ireland 's vote before signing it into law .

these included the guarantee that ireland 's traditional policy of neutrality would be maintained and that the lisbon treaty would not impinge on ireland 's right to set tax levels .
the eu also agreed that ireland would retain the right to an eu commissioner .
backlash could lead to potential " no " vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brian cowen 's government is also losing support despite the fact that the previous three opinion polls conducted this year showed solid support for the treaty , it is believed that the growing dissatisfaction with the irish government 's handling of the financial crisis has turned an anti-government backlash into a vote against ratification .
prime minister brian cowen 's government has itself been faced with some uncomfortable reading in recent polls .
the latest showed that 75 percent of voters would like to see him ousted , while support for the prime minister 's fianna fail party dropped to a record low of 17 percent .
for the lisbon treaty to come into force , it has to be ratified by all 27 eu states .
poland and the czech republic , currently led by euro-skeptic presidents , have said that they will wait for ireland 's vote before signing it into law .
if ireland were to vote “ no ” for a second time , observers say it could derail the treaty for good. nda / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's healthcare system has experienced all manner of nips and tucks since it was introduced over 125 years ago but it 's nonetheless showing its age .
the election might decide whether it gets a new lease of life . health insurance in germany has come a long way since sickness cover was introduced in 1883 under kaiser wilhelm i and his chancellor , otto von bismarck .
at the time , the average german worked a 60-hour week for a pittance , and sickness or accidents meant a very real threat of starvation .
public dissatisfaction was widespread , and it was against this backdrop that germany started on the long road towards the welfare state it still more or less is .
but these days , less is the operative word .
the social solidarity that has traditionally underpinned the german healthcare system is looking increasingly frail .
the basic problem is that german society is ageing , while its birth rate is sinking .
this means that healthcare costs are rising while fewer people are paying into the system .
many believe that what the only way to rejuvenate the system is to expose it to market forces .
rising costs but this would mark a dramatic break with bismarck 's original program .
made up of health insurance ; accident insurance ; disability insurance and an old-age retirement pension , it was based from the outset on the principle of solidarity : anyone who was employed was obliged to pay into the system and anyone who fell ill would receive medical care and a living allowance .
the cost was divided between employers and the employed - the employers contributing one third , the workers two thirds .
the ratio has changed since then - and so have many other aspects of the german health care service .
the last 20 years alone have seen 14 health care reforms .
while the initial health care restructuring was designed to provide more efficient and cost-effective healthcare services , the most recent reforms focus more on the structure of health insurance funds .
one way or another , most of them have been bad news for the public .
personal contributions to dental care and medicine costs have gone up , and patients now have to pay a mandatory 10 euros -lrb- $ 14 -rrb- per quarter whenever they go to the doctor .
dissatisfaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private patients are more lucrative so although the german healthcare services are still more or less all-inclusive , the cracks are showing .
and it 's not just patients who are noticing .
medical and healthcare professionals also say that conditions are worsening .
" everything has gone downhill , " says one nurse who works in a hospital in bonn .
" we all have less time , there are so many cuts , patients are dissatisfied , especially the elderly ones . "
doctors are also fed up , and say the system is flawed .
dorothee keltz is a gp with a practice in bonn .
she believes it 's important to take the time to talk to patients , and resents the fact that insurers prefer to see doctors using technical equipment .
" if one of my assistants does a cardiogram and we tell the patient what our findings are , we make three times as much money as we would if we spent 10 minutes talking to the patient , " she complains .
another problem is that doctors have had to start relying on private patients to stay afloat .
in germany , only 10 percent of the population has private , for-profit insurance - mostly civil servants and the self-employed .
increasingly , doctors are realizing that patients with state health cover are just not profitable enough .
patients as pawns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german health care is the fourth most expensive in the world still , the stakes are high .
the german health care system averages an annual turnover of over 250 billion euros , making it one of the nation 's most important economic sectors .
it 's also a sector in which powerful interest groups from trade associations to pharmaceuticals companies are constantly jockeying for position .
german health minister ulla schmidt is well aware of the tensions .
" no other sector has the financial clout of the health service , " she says .
" the amount of money spent on it exceeds the entire federal budget .
the sector 's players are dealing with huge funds with which they can buy opinion , influence opinion and promote their products .
in this respect it is patients themselves who are in the weakest position , even though they should be the strongest , because 70 million people in germany have state health cover . "
but the public is often little more than a pawn in a game , and has little insight into what is being spent and how .
the new cornerstone for funding german health care spending is the controversial and highly complex ' gesundheitsfond ' , the health care fund .
supposedly , it aims to simplify health benefits , provide more choices , increase transparency and create competition among providers .
but its detractors believe that it fails to address the increasingly urgent issue of funding the enormous german system .
it makes no mention of reducing cost , they say , but simply spreads the cost risk differently .
in the wake of the financial crisis , saving costs has become more important then ever .
after numerous attempts at resuscitation , the solidarity principle introduced by bismarck could well be on its last legs , and germany 's two leading parties can not agree whether it should be kept on life-support .
social democrat ulla schmidt , for one , would like to give it another chance and abolish private health insurance altogether .
but ultimately , today 's social and economic forces are nudging germany more in the direction of a healthcare system built on individual responsibility .
the issue will certainly be on voters ' minds when they go to the polls this month .

" if they are ready to engage with us , we 're ready to cooperate with them , " said swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country holds the eu presidency , as he arrived at the talks in stockholm .
" but if they decide to go for confrontation , then confrontation will happen , " he told reporters .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , speaking at a separate press conference , said europe needed to remain united in its opposition to iran 's nuclear program .
" i think it 's very important for us to be gathered firmly in the eu 's reaction towards iran , not accepting nuclear ambitions , " he said .
germany 's deputy minister for foreign affairs , guenter gloser , however , said it was pointless to impose more sanctions on iran , pointing out that such actions in the past had yet to bring about any positive change .
" but something must be done to prevent a nuclear arms race in the middle east , " he added .
iran says nuclear endeavors are peaceful a defiant president mahmoud ahmadinejad said on thursday that iran is ready for more sanctions over its nuclear program and will not bow to pressure in meeting any deadline set by world powers .
however tehran has also said it was willing to begin fresh talks with the six major powers - britain , china , france , russia and the united states , plus germany - regarding its nuclear drive .
iran continues to insist its nuclear work is peaceful , while western countries suspect that iran is attempting to build atomic weapons .
the un security council has already slapped three rounds of sanctions on the islamic republic , but pressure is growing for more .
minister appointment further " provocation " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bildt has called iran 's policies " provocative " meanwhile , reinfeldt called president ahmadinejad 's appointment of international terror suspect ahmad vahidi as defense minister a sign of a desire to worsen relations between iran and the west .
" we feel this is a situation that simply returns to provocations .
the appointment of -lsb- vahdi -rsb- is another one of these examples , " reinfeldt told reporters .

those hoping that a second irish referendum on the eu 's lisbon treaty will remove one of the largest stumbling blocks to the eu reform document ’ s ratification will be disappointed by news that has come out of dublin . polls and government ministers revealed a slump in support for the treaty among the populace of the recession-hit country ahead of the plebiscite next month .
public opinion was gauged by a face-to-face poll with 1,000 voters earlier this week conducted by the tns mrbi market research company .
the survey , published in the friday edition of the irish times , showed opposition to the treaty stood at 29 percent , increasing one point since the last poll in may , with support dropping eight points to 46 percent in the same time span .
the number of voters who remained undecided stood at 25 percent , an increase of seven points .
in an article which accompanied the results , the irish times ' political editor , stephen collins , wrote that " a striking feature of the latest poll is that most of those who have left the ' yes ' camp have moved into the ' do n't know ' category rather than shifting into the ' no ' camp . "
if the poll results were not gloomy enough , irish foreign minister michael martin admitted that the government was pessimistic about the october 2 referendum but that he believed that , while it would be difficult to secure ratification , he expected a slim vote in favor .
" i was never under any illusion but that it would be difficult to secure this but i do think we can do it , " he told national radio broadcaster rte .
" there is a very significant challenge ahead , it 's going to be a very tight campaign and it will demand all of the resources , conviction , politics and passion of all of those on the yes side . "
brussels concessions led to second referendum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : support is slipping for the lisbio treaty as the vote nears ireland is the only member of the 27-nation eu which is constitutionally bound to hold a referendum on the treaty , which is designed to overhaul of the eu 's foreign policy-making and internal decision-making in a greatly expanded bloc .
irish voters threw the ratification process into chaos last year when they rejected the treaty in the first referendum .
irish voters rejected the pact in a referendum held in june , partly out of concerns that their country would lose the right to nominate a commissioner to the eu 's executive and concerns that the treaty would contravene the country 's constitution on issues relating to the right to life , education and family policy .
the decision to launch a second referendum came after opinion polls showed voters would back it this time after dublin won concessions from brussels on key policy areas .
these included the guarantee that ireland 's traditional policy of neutrality would be maintained and that the lisbon treaty would not impinge on ireland 's right to set tax levels .
the eu also agreed that ireland would retain the right to an eu commissioner .

prime minister brian cowen 's government has itself been faced with some uncomfortable reading in recent polls .
the latest showed that 75 percent of voters would like to see him ousted , while support for the prime minister 's fianna fail party dropped to a record low of 17 percent .
for the lisbon treaty to come into force , it has to be ratified by all 27 eu states .
poland and the czech republic , currently led by euro-skeptic presidents , have said that they will wait for ireland 's vote before signing it into law .

those hoping that a second irish referendum on the eu 's lisbon treaty will remove one of the largest stumbling blocks to the eu reform document ’ s ratification will be disappointed by news that has come out of dublin . polls and government ministers revealed a slump in support for the treaty among the populace of the recession-hit country ahead of the plebiscite next month .
public opinion was gauged by a face-to-face poll with 1,000 voters earlier this week conducted by the tns mrbi market research company .
the survey , published in the friday edition of the irish times , showed opposition to the treaty stood at 29 percent , increasing one point since the last poll in may , with support dropping eight points to 46 percent in the same time span .
the number of voters who remained undecided stood at 25 percent , an increase of seven points .
in an article which accompanied the results , the irish times ' political editor , stephen collins , wrote that " a striking feature of the latest poll is that most of those who have left the ' yes ' camp have moved into the ' do n't know ' category rather than shifting into the ' no ' camp . "
if the poll results were not gloomy enough , irish foreign minister michael martin admitted that the government was pessimistic about the october 2 referendum but that he believed that , while it would be difficult to secure ratification , he expected a slim vote in favor .
" i was never under any illusion but that it would be difficult to secure this but i do think we can do it , " he told national radio broadcaster rte .
" there is a very significant challenge ahead , it 's going to be a very tight campaign and it will demand all of the resources , conviction , politics and passion of all of those on the yes side . "
brussels concessions led to second referendum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : support is slipping for the lisbio treaty as the vote nears ireland is the only member of the 27-nation eu which is constitutionally bound to hold a referendum on the treaty , which is designed to overhaul of the eu 's foreign policy-making and internal decision-making in a greatly expanded bloc .
irish voters threw the ratification process into chaos last year when they rejected the treaty in the first referendum .
irish voters rejected the pact in a referendum held in june , partly out of concerns that their country would lose the right to nominate a commissioner to the eu 's executive and concerns that the treaty would contravene the country 's constitution on issues relating to the right to life , education and family policy .
the decision to launch a second referendum came after opinion polls showed voters would back it this time after dublin won concessions from brussels on key policy areas .
these included the guarantee that ireland 's traditional policy of neutrality would be maintained and that the lisbon treaty would not impinge on ireland 's right to set tax levels .
the eu also agreed that ireland would retain the right to an eu commissioner .
backlash could lead to potential " no " vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brian cowen 's government is also losing support despite the fact that the previous three opinion polls conducted this year showed solid support for the treaty , it is believed that the growing dissatisfaction with the irish government 's handling of the financial crisis has turned an anti-government backlash into a vote against ratification .

the isaf troops then engaged the militants in a fire fight .
no civilians or german soldiers were injured in the battle .

isaf 's target in the air raid was insurgents . "
however , he said he was unable to comment on the reports of the blast . in the wake of the attack , reports of casualties at the scene varied , with the german army saying that 56 militants were killed in the blast while the local authorities put the number of civilian dead at 45 .
a security officer who asked to remain anonymous told reporters that 200 people were killed and wounded in the explosion while residents put the number of casualties at 300 . european leaders begin to speak out following the attack , british prime minster gordon brown confirmed that he would not be backing down or changing the government 's afghanistan policy in any way . speaking at the international institute for strategic studies -lrb- iiss -rrb- in london , brown said that the stability of the volatile region , spanning the afghan-pakistan border , had a profound impact on the security of britain and the rest of the international community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister brown refuses to back down " we can not just walk away , " said brown , adding that the objectives in the conflict were " clear , justified , realistic and achievable .

the isaf troops then engaged the militants in a fire fight .
no civilians or german soldiers were injured in the battle .
the german statement said that nato planes then launched the attack in response to a call for air support . german military confirm air attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato troops and afghan policemen are still investigating the incident while the german military did not say whether the airstrike was responsible for the tanker blast , a german army spokesman in berlin admitted that the tankers exploded during the battle .
kunduz provincial governor mohammad omar later said that local residents claimed a military jet fired at the tanker , setting off the explosion . captain jon stock , press officer for isaf , later told the reuters news agency : " i can confirm that there was an airstrike last night or early this morning .
isaf 's target in the air raid was insurgents . "
however , he said he was unable to comment on the reports of the blast . in the wake of the attack , reports of casualties at the scene varied , with the german army saying that 56 militants were killed in the blast while the local authorities put the number of civilian dead at 45 .
a security officer who asked to remain anonymous told reporters that 200 people were killed and wounded in the explosion while residents put the number of casualties at 300 . european leaders begin to speak out following the attack , british prime minster gordon brown confirmed that he would not be backing down or changing the government 's afghanistan policy in any way . speaking at the international institute for strategic studies -lrb- iiss -rrb- in london , brown said that the stability of the volatile region , spanning the afghan-pakistan border , had a profound impact on the security of britain and the rest of the international community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister brown refuses to back down " we can not just walk away , " said brown , adding that the objectives in the conflict were " clear , justified , realistic and achievable . " brown announced that his government would provide an extra 20 million pounds -lrb- 23 million euros / $ 32 million -rrb- to help stabilization and security efforts in helmand province , where british troops are based .
british foreign secretary david miliband called for an " urgent investigation " into the nato airstrike . nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen responded by saying that there would be a thorough investigation into the incident . " the afghan people should know that we are clearly committed to protecting them and that we will fully and immediately investigate this incident , " rasmussen told reporters . increased instability in previously safe north bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local afghan people have begun burying their villagers killed in the nato airstrike the incident is likely to cause more outrage among an afghan population which has been increasingly angered and frustrated by the rising civilian death toll and the apparent failure of the western forces to stabilize the country . the airstrike also serves as another example of the disintegrating state of security in the previously safe northern provinces of the country and the overall doggedness and endurance of the taliban across the whole of afghanistan .
despite us military surges and diverted troop deployments from iraq , many areas of the country remain in a state of war . the presidential vote on august 20 , which was meant to be an indication of how far the country had come since the end of taliban rule eight years ago , was marred by violence and intimidation as counter-insurgents targeted polling stations as well as afghan soldiers and isaf troops . mrm / nda / dpa / ap / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and its coming to a screen near you on saturday . up until just two short decades ago , berlin was split down the middle by a great , dirty wall .
it is not a long chapter in history , yet the city has undergone such monumental change since reunification that the producers felt not only berliners should be party to the party .
hence the project .
the brainchild of producer thomas kufus and director volker heise , the documentary will run for 24 hours straight starting at 6am cet on saturday . that is exactly one year to the day since it was shot . early on the morning of sept .
5 , 2008 , 80 camera teams hit the streets of berlin and spent the subsequent 24 hours collecting footage to depict the myriad lives and fates played out day by day in the german capital .
the end result brings together the destinies of 20 main protagonists and 50 secondary characters and takes viewers into the realms - public and private - of a refuse worker , french journalist , poet , drag queen and drug addict .
there are also sequences with more high profile berlin figures , including the mayor of the city klaus wowereit , conductor daniel barenboim and the editor of the mass-circulation bild newspaper kai diekmann .
exploration of diversity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's left of the berlin wall volker heise said the film was a way to find out how people live in a city of such diversity .
" how do people educate their children ?
what television programs do they watch ?
what do they eat ? " he asked in material outlining the project .
work first began on the 2.8-million-euro -lrb- $ 4-million -rrb- film some three years ago .
besides the protagonists selected to feature in the tele-visual extravaganza , berliners were invited to send in their own contributions .
some of these have made it into the final product .
so , too , has the city itself .
there are multiple shots of the television tower at alexanderplatz , the river spree and other landmarks .
but viewers will also catch glimpses of the smaller spots that make berlin the unique city it is .
in essence , the makers have tried to leave no stone unturned in their portrayal of this 21st-century metropolis .
from the bedroom to the sausage stand , the courtroom to the chancellery , they have set out to capture life as it happens .
and as the introduction is at pains to point out , it is just a normal day : " nothing special is expected to happen .
people will get up and go to work , they will love and hate one another , they will be born and they will die . "
the show begins at 6am central european time and can be seen on arte and berlin public broadcaster , rbb .
viewers outside germany can pick up the live stream at www.24berlin.tv.

a berlin musicologist says he knows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was she the one ?
everyone knows the melody to ludwig van beethoven 's piano piece " fuer elise , " but elise 's true identity has remained a mystery .
now a german musicologist says he 's discovered who she really was . from hard rock and jazz to cabaret and ring tones , " fuer elise " is the quintessential example of the popularization of classical music .
if beethoven got royalties , he 'd be a wealthy man . while everyone knows the melody to the short piano piece in a minor , few stop to wonder what was behind the intimate dedication . berlin musicologist klaus martin kopitz believes he has uncovered elise 's true identity - while he was n't even looking for it . " for years , i 've been working on a publication called ' beethoven in the eyes of his contemporaries , ' which includes all the reports from people who knew beethoven personally : journals , letters , poems , memoires , " said kopitz .
" certain women are mentioned , and one of them was elisabeth roeckel . " a close friendship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roeckel was an accomplished pianist elisabeth roeckel , born in 1793 , was the younger sister of singer joseph roeckel , who sang the role of florestan in beethoven 's opera " fidelio , " and became a good friend of the composer 's .
elise was also musically inclined - she played the piano and later became a singer . in her circle of friends , she was affectionately referred to as " elise . "
in the spring of 1810 , she went to bamberg to work in theater , with the hope of impressing none other than eta hoffman , who was the theater manager there at the time . according to kopitz , beethoven dedicated the a-minor piano piece " in the memory of " elise because they were separated when she relocated to bamberg .
since elisabeth roeckel was referred to in the dedication as " elise " and not the more formal " fraeulein roeckel , " she must have known beethoven well , said kopitz . indeed , their relationship was documented , as elise herself had written about it . beethoven the flirt " according to what she wrote , -lrb- their relationship -rrb- must have been close , " said kopitz .
in a letter , elise wrote about an evening with the composer , the famous guitarist mauro giuliani , and composer johann nepomuk hummel , who would later become her husband . " she wrote that beethoven , true to his frisky rhenish disposition , would n't stop teasing her and she did n't know what to do , " said the musicologist .
" he had pinched her arm out of sheer affection , " added kopitz . that elise chose hummel instead apparently did not mean the end of their friendship with beethoven .
several days before the composer 's death in march 1827 , elise visited him .
to remember her former admirer , she cut off a lock of his hair and accepted one of his quills as a present . how , then , could elisabeth roeckel have remained a mystery to musicologists over all the years ?

nohl claimed to have seen the original manuscript , saying it had been discovered in therese 's estate , but it has never been found since . all that exists is an incomplete draft of the work , sketched on a sheet of paper beethoven had apparently used for brainstorming other works .
this has been dated to 1810 , around the time of beethoven 's engagement to therese malfatti . if , however , the a-minor melody was indeed composed for elise and not therese , it is not immediately apparent how and why the original manuscript could have made it into therese 's hands . kopitz admitted that his theory on this point is not particularly scientific : " therese malfatti comes to beethoven 's house and sees the " fuer elise " manuscript lying on top of his piano , so she asks ' who is this elise ?
do you still want to marry me ? '
at that point he was embarrassed that he had written the piece for elise when he really wanted to marry therese . " what does it matter ? the musicologist 's theory is currently in the process of being published and has not yet garnered widespread acceptance in the field . the director of the beethoven archive at the beethoven house in bonn , bernhard appel , said he was skeptical of kopitz ' hypothesis , though he emphasized that he could not make a conclusion until the report was available for detailed review . " elise was a very common name in vienna at the time , " said appel , so the dedication could have referred to any number of women .

" if they are ready to engage with us , we 're ready to cooperate with them , " said swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country holds the eu presidency , as he arrived at the talks in stockholm .
" but if they decide to go for confrontation , then confrontation will happen , " he told reporters .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , speaking at a separate press conference , said europe needed to remain united in its opposition to iran 's nuclear program .
" i think it 's very important for us to be gathered firmly in the eu 's reaction towards iran , not accepting nuclear ambitions , " he said .
germany 's deputy minister for foreign affairs , guenter gloser , however , said it was pointless to impose more sanctions on iran , pointing out that such actions in the past had yet to bring about any positive change .
" but something must be done to prevent a nuclear arms race in the middle east , " he added .
iran says nuclear endeavors are peaceful a defiant president mahmoud ahmadinejad said on thursday that iran is ready for more sanctions over its nuclear program and will not bow to pressure in meeting any deadline set by world powers .
however tehran has also said it was willing to begin fresh talks with the six major powers - britain , china , france , russia and the united states , plus germany - regarding its nuclear drive .
iran continues to insist its nuclear work is peaceful , while western countries suspect that iran is attempting to build atomic weapons .
the un security council has already slapped three rounds of sanctions on the islamic republic , but pressure is growing for more .
minister appointment further " provocation " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bildt has called iran 's policies " provocative " meanwhile , reinfeldt called president ahmadinejad 's appointment of international terror suspect ahmad vahidi as defense minister a sign of a desire to worsen relations between iran and the west .
" we feel this is a situation that simply returns to provocations .
the appointment of -lsb- vahdi -rsb- is another one of these examples , " reinfeldt told reporters .

germany 's healthcare system has experienced all manner of nips and tucks since it was introduced over 125 years ago but it 's nonetheless showing its age .
the election might decide whether it gets a new lease of life . health insurance in germany has come a long way since sickness cover was introduced in 1883 under kaiser wilhelm i and his chancellor , otto von bismarck .
at the time , the average german worked a 60-hour week for a pittance , and sickness or accidents meant a very real threat of starvation .
public dissatisfaction was widespread , and it was against this backdrop that germany started on the long road towards the welfare state it still more or less is .
but these days , less is the operative word .
the social solidarity that has traditionally underpinned the german healthcare system is looking increasingly frail .
the basic problem is that german society is ageing , while its birth rate is sinking .
this means that healthcare costs are rising while fewer people are paying into the system .
many believe that what the only way to rejuvenate the system is to expose it to market forces .
rising costs but this would mark a dramatic break with bismarck 's original program .
made up of health insurance ; accident insurance ; disability insurance and an old-age retirement pension , it was based from the outset on the principle of solidarity : anyone who was employed was obliged to pay into the system and anyone who fell ill would receive medical care and a living allowance .
the cost was divided between employers and the employed - the employers contributing one third , the workers two thirds .
the ratio has changed since then - and so have many other aspects of the german health care service .
the last 20 years alone have seen 14 health care reforms .
while the initial health care restructuring was designed to provide more efficient and cost-effective healthcare services , the most recent reforms focus more on the structure of health insurance funds .
one way or another , most of them have been bad news for the public .
personal contributions to dental care and medicine costs have gone up , and patients now have to pay a mandatory 10 euros -lrb- $ 14 -rrb- per quarter whenever they go to the doctor .
dissatisfaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private patients are more lucrative so although the german healthcare services are still more or less all-inclusive , the cracks are showing .
and it 's not just patients who are noticing .
medical and healthcare professionals also say that conditions are worsening .
" everything has gone downhill , " says one nurse who works in a hospital in bonn .
" we all have less time , there are so many cuts , patients are dissatisfied , especially the elderly ones . "
doctors are also fed up , and say the system is flawed .
dorothee keltz is a gp with a practice in bonn .
she believes it 's important to take the time to talk to patients , and resents the fact that insurers prefer to see doctors using technical equipment .
" if one of my assistants does a cardiogram and we tell the patient what our findings are , we make three times as much money as we would if we spent 10 minutes talking to the patient , " she complains .
another problem is that doctors have had to start relying on private patients to stay afloat .
in germany , only 10 percent of the population has private , for-profit insurance - mostly civil servants and the self-employed .
increasingly , doctors are realizing that patients with state health cover are just not profitable enough .
patients as pawns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german health care is the fourth most expensive in the world still , the stakes are high .
the german health care system averages an annual turnover of over 250 billion euros , making it one of the nation 's most important economic sectors .
it 's also a sector in which powerful interest groups from trade associations to pharmaceuticals companies are constantly jockeying for position .
german health minister ulla schmidt is well aware of the tensions .
" no other sector has the financial clout of the health service , " she says .
" the amount of money spent on it exceeds the entire federal budget .
the sector 's players are dealing with huge funds with which they can buy opinion , influence opinion and promote their products .
in this respect it is patients themselves who are in the weakest position , even though they should be the strongest , because 70 million people in germany have state health cover . "
but the public is often little more than a pawn in a game , and has little insight into what is being spent and how .
the new cornerstone for funding german health care spending is the controversial and highly complex ' gesundheitsfond ' , the health care fund .
supposedly , it aims to simplify health benefits , provide more choices , increase transparency and create competition among providers .
but its detractors believe that it fails to address the increasingly urgent issue of funding the enormous german system .
it makes no mention of reducing cost , they say , but simply spreads the cost risk differently .
in the wake of the financial crisis , saving costs has become more important then ever .
after numerous attempts at resuscitation , the solidarity principle introduced by bismarck could well be on its last legs , and germany 's two leading parties can not agree whether it should be kept on life-support .
social democrat ulla schmidt , for one , would like to give it another chance and abolish private health insurance altogether .
but ultimately , today 's social and economic forces are nudging germany more in the direction of a healthcare system built on individual responsibility .
the issue will certainly be on voters ' minds when they go to the polls this month .

the social solidarity that has traditionally underpinned the german healthcare system is looking increasingly frail .
the basic problem is that german society is ageing , while its birth rate is sinking .
this means that healthcare costs are rising while fewer people are paying into the system .
many believe that what the only way to rejuvenate the system is to expose it to market forces .
rising costs but this would mark a dramatic break with bismarck 's original program .
made up of health insurance ; accident insurance ; disability insurance and an old-age retirement pension , it was based from the outset on the principle of solidarity : anyone who was employed was obliged to pay into the system and anyone who fell ill would receive medical care and a living allowance .
the cost was divided between employers and the employed - the employers contributing one third , the workers two thirds .
the ratio has changed since then - and so have many other aspects of the german health care service .
the last 20 years alone have seen 14 health care reforms .
while the initial health care restructuring was designed to provide more efficient and cost-effective healthcare services , the most recent reforms focus more on the structure of health insurance funds .
one way or another , most of them have been bad news for the public .
personal contributions to dental care and medicine costs have gone up , and patients now have to pay a mandatory 10 euros -lrb- $ 14 -rrb- per quarter whenever they go to the doctor .
dissatisfaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private patients are more lucrative so although the german healthcare services are still more or less all-inclusive , the cracks are showing .
and it 's not just patients who are noticing .
medical and healthcare professionals also say that conditions are worsening .
" everything has gone downhill , " says one nurse who works in a hospital in bonn .
" we all have less time , there are so many cuts , patients are dissatisfied , especially the elderly ones . "
doctors are also fed up , and say the system is flawed .
dorothee keltz is a gp with a practice in bonn .
she believes it 's important to take the time to talk to patients , and resents the fact that insurers prefer to see doctors using technical equipment .
" if one of my assistants does a cardiogram and we tell the patient what our findings are , we make three times as much money as we would if we spent 10 minutes talking to the patient , " she complains .
another problem is that doctors have had to start relying on private patients to stay afloat .
in germany , only 10 percent of the population has private , for-profit insurance - mostly civil servants and the self-employed .
increasingly , doctors are realizing that patients with state health cover are just not profitable enough .
patients as pawns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german health care is the fourth most expensive in the world still , the stakes are high .
the german health care system averages an annual turnover of over 250 billion euros , making it one of the nation 's most important economic sectors .
it 's also a sector in which powerful interest groups from trade associations to pharmaceuticals companies are constantly jockeying for position .
german health minister ulla schmidt is well aware of the tensions .
" no other sector has the financial clout of the health service , " she says .
" the amount of money spent on it exceeds the entire federal budget .
the sector 's players are dealing with huge funds with which they can buy opinion , influence opinion and promote their products .
in this respect it is patients themselves who are in the weakest position , even though they should be the strongest , because 70 million people in germany have state health cover . "
but the public is often little more than a pawn in a game , and has little insight into what is being spent and how .
the new cornerstone for funding german health care spending is the controversial and highly complex ' gesundheitsfond ' , the health care fund .
supposedly , it aims to simplify health benefits , provide more choices , increase transparency and create competition among providers .
but its detractors believe that it fails to address the increasingly urgent issue of funding the enormous german system .
it makes no mention of reducing cost , they say , but simply spreads the cost risk differently .
in the wake of the financial crisis , saving costs has become more important then ever .
after numerous attempts at resuscitation , the solidarity principle introduced by bismarck could well be on its last legs , and germany 's two leading parties can not agree whether it should be kept on life-support .
social democrat ulla schmidt , for one , would like to give it another chance and abolish private health insurance altogether .
but ultimately , today 's social and economic forces are nudging germany more in the direction of a healthcare system built on individual responsibility .
the issue will certainly be on voters ' minds when they go to the polls this month .

" if they are ready to engage with us , we 're ready to cooperate with them , " said swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country holds the eu presidency , as he arrived at the talks in stockholm .
" but if they decide to go for confrontation , then confrontation will happen , " he told reporters .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , speaking at a separate press conference , said europe needed to remain united in its opposition to iran 's nuclear program .
" i think it 's very important for us to be gathered firmly in the eu 's reaction towards iran , not accepting nuclear ambitions , " he said .
germany 's deputy minister for foreign affairs , guenter gloser , however , said it was pointless to impose more sanctions on iran , pointing out that such actions in the past had yet to bring about any positive change .
" but something must be done to prevent a nuclear arms race in the middle east , " he added .
iran says nuclear endeavors are peaceful a defiant president mahmoud ahmadinejad said on thursday that iran is ready for more sanctions over its nuclear program and will not bow to pressure in meeting any deadline set by world powers .
however tehran has also said it was willing to begin fresh talks with the six major powers - britain , china , france , russia and the united states , plus germany - regarding its nuclear drive .
iran continues to insist its nuclear work is peaceful , while western countries suspect that iran is attempting to build atomic weapons .
the un security council has already slapped three rounds of sanctions on the islamic republic , but pressure is growing for more .
minister appointment further " provocation " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bildt has called iran 's policies " provocative " meanwhile , reinfeldt called president ahmadinejad 's appointment of international terror suspect ahmad vahidi as defense minister a sign of a desire to worsen relations between iran and the west .
" we feel this is a situation that simply returns to provocations .
the appointment of -lsb- vahdi -rsb- is another one of these examples , " reinfeldt told reporters .
vahidi is wanted by interpol in connection with a 1994 attack on a jewish charity that killed 85 people. glb / reuters / ap / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the isaf troops then engaged the militants in a fire fight .
no civilians or german soldiers were injured in the battle .
the german statement said that nato planes then launched the attack in response to a call for air support . german military confirm air attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato troops and afghan policemen are still investigating the incident while the german military did not say whether the airstrike was responsible for the tanker blast , a german army spokesman in berlin admitted that the tankers exploded during the battle .
kunduz provincial governor mohammad omar later said that local residents claimed a military jet fired at the tanker , setting off the explosion . captain jon stock , press officer for isaf , later told the reuters news agency : " i can confirm that there was an airstrike last night or early this morning .
isaf 's target in the air raid was insurgents . "
however , he said he was unable to comment on the reports of the blast . in the wake of the attack , reports of casualties at the scene varied , with the german army saying that 56 militants were killed in the blast while the local authorities put the number of civilian dead at 45 .
a security officer who asked to remain anonymous told reporters that 200 people were killed and wounded in the explosion while residents put the number of casualties at 300 . european leaders begin to speak out following the attack , british prime minster gordon brown confirmed that he would not be backing down or changing the government 's afghanistan policy in any way . speaking at the international institute for strategic studies -lrb- iiss -rrb- in london , brown said that the stability of the volatile region , spanning the afghan-pakistan border , had a profound impact on the security of britain and the rest of the international community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister brown refuses to back down " we can not just walk away , " said brown , adding that the objectives in the conflict were " clear , justified , realistic and achievable . " brown announced that his government would provide an extra 20 million pounds -lrb- 23 million euros / $ 32 million -rrb- to help stabilization and security efforts in helmand province , where british troops are based .
british foreign secretary david miliband called for an " urgent investigation " into the nato airstrike . nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen responded by saying that there would be a thorough investigation into the incident . " the afghan people should know that we are clearly committed to protecting them and that we will fully and immediately investigate this incident , " rasmussen told reporters . increased instability in previously safe north bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local afghan people have begun burying their villagers killed in the nato airstrike the incident is likely to cause more outrage among an afghan population which has been increasingly angered and frustrated by the rising civilian death toll and the apparent failure of the western forces to stabilize the country . the airstrike also serves as another example of the disintegrating state of security in the previously safe northern provinces of the country and the overall doggedness and endurance of the taliban across the whole of afghanistan .
despite us military surges and diverted troop deployments from iraq , many areas of the country remain in a state of war . the presidential vote on august 20 , which was meant to be an indication of how far the country had come since the end of taliban rule eight years ago , was marred by violence and intimidation as counter-insurgents targeted polling stations as well as afghan soldiers and isaf troops . mrm / nda / dpa / ap / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the portuguese has the backing of eu leaders but persuading the new european parliament could be trickier . barroso is the sole candidate for the top eu post of commission president , who is appointed not elected , but support from many new faces in the parliament is by no means guaranteed .
the current parliament , which is the eu 's legislative arm , was elected in june and could hold barroso to task over criticism that his commission reacted slowly to the financial crisis last year .
opposition could also come from the greens and the socialists , who have been at the forefront of efforts to have the conservative barroso replaced , and have demanded concessions in return for their support .
at a press conference thursday , barroso outlined his policy goals in an effort to appease the power players in the european parliament .
" the next commission needs to maintain the momentum towards a low emission economy , and in particular towards decarbonizing our electricity supply and the transport sector - all transport , " he said .
euro economy pledges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lisbon treaty still faces opposition in several quarters of the eu barroso promised parliamentarians he would oversee measures to tackle unemployment in the 27-nation bloc , as well as a strategy for exiting the financial crisis .
" the priority now is to continue to sustain demand and stem the rise in unemployment , " he said , also commenting on the importance of " keeping interest rates low , and using our state aid rules to support governments in their efforts to revitalize the economy without adverse effects on other -lrb- eu -rrb- member states .
" it is too early to withdraw these stimulus and support measures to the economy and the financial sector , but an exit strategy must be prepared , " he added .
barroso said " enhanced coordination " would be central to any such exit strategy , and that this could come through the lisbon treaty , which could come into force as early as next year if ratified by the last four eu states yet to do so - germany , ireland , poland and the czech republic .
the commission chief said the treaty , which is meant to reform eu foreign and internal decision-making , would " strengthen the convergence of objectives and the coherence of the effects of economic policy , particularly in the euro area . "
parliament has from sept .
14-17 to vote on barroso 's second five-year tenure .
he is due to outline his program proposal for another term to parliamentary groups on sept .

and its coming to a screen near you on saturday . up until just two short decades ago , berlin was split down the middle by a great , dirty wall .
it is not a long chapter in history , yet the city has undergone such monumental change since reunification that the producers felt not only berliners should be party to the party .
hence the project .
the brainchild of producer thomas kufus and director volker heise , the documentary will run for 24 hours straight starting at 6am cet on saturday . that is exactly one year to the day since it was shot . early on the morning of sept .
5 , 2008 , 80 camera teams hit the streets of berlin and spent the subsequent 24 hours collecting footage to depict the myriad lives and fates played out day by day in the german capital .
the end result brings together the destinies of 20 main protagonists and 50 secondary characters and takes viewers into the realms - public and private - of a refuse worker , french journalist , poet , drag queen and drug addict .
there are also sequences with more high profile berlin figures , including the mayor of the city klaus wowereit , conductor daniel barenboim and the editor of the mass-circulation bild newspaper kai diekmann .
exploration of diversity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's left of the berlin wall volker heise said the film was a way to find out how people live in a city of such diversity .
" how do people educate their children ?
what television programs do they watch ?
what do they eat ? " he asked in material outlining the project .
work first began on the 2.8-million-euro -lrb- $ 4-million -rrb- film some three years ago .
besides the protagonists selected to feature in the tele-visual extravaganza , berliners were invited to send in their own contributions .
some of these have made it into the final product .
so , too , has the city itself .
there are multiple shots of the television tower at alexanderplatz , the river spree and other landmarks .
but viewers will also catch glimpses of the smaller spots that make berlin the unique city it is .
in essence , the makers have tried to leave no stone unturned in their portrayal of this 21st-century metropolis .
from the bedroom to the sausage stand , the courtroom to the chancellery , they have set out to capture life as it happens .
and as the introduction is at pains to point out , it is just a normal day : " nothing special is expected to happen .
people will get up and go to work , they will love and hate one another , they will be born and they will die . "
the show begins at 6am central european time and can be seen on arte and berlin public broadcaster , rbb .
viewers outside germany can pick up the live stream at www.24berlin.tv.

they also warned that the global crisis is n't over yet . finance ministers from the world 's 20 leading economies have set their sights on multi-million euro bonuses paid to some bankers .
the explosive issue of bank bonuses is being pushed by europe 's largest economies .
" our citizens are deeply shocked at the revival of reprehensible practices , despite taxpayers ' money having been mobilized to support the financial sector , " chancellor angela merkel , british prime minister gordon brown and french president nicolas sarkozy said in a letter released before the start of the meeting .
sarkozy has called for bankers ' bonuses to be capped , an idea which found broad support among european finance ministers earlier this week .
britain has been reluctant to support a cap , for fear it could cause bankers to move their business out of london .
but there is british support for tying bonuses to long-term performance .
the bonus practices are seen as helping create banking culture which critics say is too focused on risky , short-term gains .
one issue which germany is expected to push is for rules limiting the size of banks .
" no bank should be allowed to become so big that it can blackmail governments , " merkel said earlier this week .
crisis not over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , sarkozy and brown warned that tough times are still to come british finance minister alistair darling , the host of the g-20 meeting , warned against complacency in an interview with the independent newspaper .
" the biggest single risk to recovery is that people think the job is done .
there is a real risk that either governments or people generally think ' we have done that , we are on the path to recovery , ' " he said .
that feeling was echoed by merkel , brown and sarkozy , who warned that we have not yet seen the end of the global economic crisis .
they urged colleagues to continue exercising " prudence and caution " saying that a bumpy road lies ahead .
besides bankers ' bonuses , finance ministers will also discuss how to go forward with huge stimulus packages introduced at the beginning of the crisis .
while g-20 countries need to show their commitment to implementing stimulus plans , they also need to begin coordinating exit strategies once the crisis has ended , the three leaders said .
germany is concerned about inflation and has talked about the need to ease up on stimulus spending .
britain , which is still in a recession , has been more cautious .
" we must be careful to avoid laying the foundations of new global imbalances , " the leaders wrote .
the talks , being held friday and saturday , will lay the groundwork for an upcoming meeting of g-20 leaders in pittsburgh , us. th / reuters / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de dw-world : eu finance ministers support effort to curb bank bonuses most of europe 's finance ministers say they 'll support international legislation to cap bank bonuses .

britain declared war on germany on 3 september 1939 .
the very next day the first citizens advice bureau opened its doors .
the network of 200 offices was planned before the war as an emergency service .
the theory was that , in times of conflict , people would need clear , calm advice about all sorts of practical problems .
during the blitz , the first cab advisers were kept busy dealing with the damage caused by air raids .
help was also given evacuating children and tracing missing relatives .
in late 1939 , almost 28,000 people a month were going to cabs .
by 1944 there had been a tenfold increase to 280,000 visits a month .
the war ended , but the need for free , independent help kept growing - particularly as the welfare state began a period of rapid expansion .
people wanted to know how to use the nhs and how to apply for things like legal aid and housing benefit .
changing demands as the years passed , the nature of the advice given out by cabs evolved .
divorce became much more of an issue .
crowded cities meant that in the 1950s housing problems dominated the work of the bureaux .
the consumer boom of the 1970s was followed by rising unemployment in the 1980s and an increasingly complex benefit system .
all these developments kept up the workload of advisers .
so how relevant are cabs in 2009 ?
these days we are bombarded with advice from every angle - in books , on the internet , tv and radio .
but it seems that many people who get into difficulty still want to sit down with someone face-to-face rather than talk to distant call centres or trawl websites .
citizens advice itself also now has a strong online presence .
had i not gone to the cab that day , i would be without my house and i would have had creditors chasing me to the grave chris kilburn the organisation , which is run as a network of local charities , now deals with six million problems a year .
the recession has led to a dramatic increase in issues like debt and unemployment .
chief executive david harker said : " our new figures show that what started out as an emergency service in wartime is needed now more than ever as the recession continues to take its toll on people 's lives . "
he said inquiries about debt have increased 27 % this year .
the number of questions about jobseeker 's allowance has doubled .
inquiries on redundancy are up 74 % .
chris kilburn , who lives in derbyshire , is one of those who have benefited from the advice on offer .
he was made redundant three times in seven months and his finances went into freefall .
the local cab recommended voluntary bankruptcy and now he has got a new job as a bus driver and a fresh start .
" had i not gone to the cab that day , i would be without my house and i would have had creditors chasing me to the grave , " he says .
have your say long may they be there for us all roy turner , nottingham send us your comments today the citizens advice service is one of the largest charitable organisations in the uk .
over 20,000 volunteers swell its ranks .
even if the uk economy returns to growth this year , the social impact of the recession will be felt for a long time to come .
that will mean even greater demands on the 3,200 cabs across the country .

the network of 200 offices was planned before the war as an emergency service .
the theory was that , in times of conflict , people would need clear , calm advice about all sorts of practical problems .
during the blitz , the first cab advisers were kept busy dealing with the damage caused by air raids .
help was also given evacuating children and tracing missing relatives .
in late 1939 , almost 28,000 people a month were going to cabs .
by 1944 there had been a tenfold increase to 280,000 visits a month .
the war ended , but the need for free , independent help kept growing - particularly as the welfare state began a period of rapid expansion .
people wanted to know how to use the nhs and how to apply for things like legal aid and housing benefit .
changing demands as the years passed , the nature of the advice given out by cabs evolved .
divorce became much more of an issue .
crowded cities meant that in the 1950s housing problems dominated the work of the bureaux .
the consumer boom of the 1970s was followed by rising unemployment in the 1980s and an increasingly complex benefit system .
all these developments kept up the workload of advisers .
so how relevant are cabs in 2009 ?
these days we are bombarded with advice from every angle - in books , on the internet , tv and radio .
but it seems that many people who get into difficulty still want to sit down with someone face-to-face rather than talk to distant call centres or trawl websites .
citizens advice itself also now has a strong online presence .
had i not gone to the cab that day , i would be without my house and i would have had creditors chasing me to the grave chris kilburn the organisation , which is run as a network of local charities , now deals with six million problems a year .
the recession has led to a dramatic increase in issues like debt and unemployment .
chief executive david harker said : " our new figures show that what started out as an emergency service in wartime is needed now more than ever as the recession continues to take its toll on people 's lives . "
he said inquiries about debt have increased 27 % this year .
the number of questions about jobseeker 's allowance has doubled .
inquiries on redundancy are up 74 % .
chris kilburn , who lives in derbyshire , is one of those who have benefited from the advice on offer .
he was made redundant three times in seven months and his finances went into freefall .
the local cab recommended voluntary bankruptcy and now he has got a new job as a bus driver and a fresh start .
" had i not gone to the cab that day , i would be without my house and i would have had creditors chasing me to the grave , " he says .
have your say long may they be there for us all roy turner , nottingham send us your comments today the citizens advice service is one of the largest charitable organisations in the uk .
over 20,000 volunteers swell its ranks .
even if the uk economy returns to growth this year , the social impact of the recession will be felt for a long time to come .
that will mean even greater demands on the 3,200 cabs across the country .
