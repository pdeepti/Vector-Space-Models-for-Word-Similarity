" the document has been finally signed , " medvedev said at a news conference in brussels .
" if everything goes without problem , most likely in the nearest future we will start pumping the first quantities of gas , " he said .
european union energy ministers had convened an emergency meeting in the morning for russia to resume gas supplies to europe , since all of the conditions set by moscow had been fulfilled .
the talks were designed to shape " concrete measures " needed by the bloc to deal with the gas shortages , provoked by russia blocking all supplies destined for europe via ukrainian pipelines .
strengthening solidarity among eu energy ministers improving the efficiency of the bloc 's energy market was also on the agenda , as well as ways of strengthening solidarity between member states in the face of future crises , the czech presidency said .

the czech eu presidency will also be called upon to mediate in a brewing row between slovakia and its neighbor , austria .
austrian furor over re-launch of slovakian nuclear reactor bratislava has infuriated vienna by deciding to make up for its shortages by re-opening its soviet-era bohunice nuclear power plant complex , which it had to shut down for security reasons as part of the conditions set for it to join the bloc in 2004 .
" shutting off the plant was one of the fundamental conditions fo -lrb- slovakia 's entry into the eu -rrb- , and it can not simply be cancelled now , " austrian environment minister nikolaus berlakovich said over the weekend .
the eu 's top energy official , andris piebalgs , said the european commission is willing to discuss the matter .
european households without heating the weeks-long gas dispute between russia and ukraine has already left hundreds of thousands of people in central and southern europe without heating in one of the coldest winters in decades .
the eu had worked hard to try and break the stalemate by sending a monitoring mission to kiev tasked with ensuring that no gas bound to europe is siphoned off by ukraine , as alleged by moscow .
eu ministers were also expected to focus on the need for the bloc to develop alternative energy supplies , both by building pipelines to bypass ukraine and russia and by turning to other technologies , such as solar , wind and wave power .
" all european member states must do their bit so that more sources -lrb- of energy -rrb- are opened up and delivery routes created , " peter hintze , a top official from the german economics ministry , said in brussels . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ceo zetsche expects recovery for second half of 2009 . german car manufacturer daimler introduced reduced working hours monday for employees at factories across germany .
shifts are being cut to three or four days a week for 30,000 workers at core manufacturing sites in the company 's home town of stuttgart and its main plant in the suburb of sindelfingen alone .
until sunday , many daimler plants had been closed since mid-december for an extended winter break .
the measures , set to last until the end of march , will also affect operations in berlin and the towns of rastatt and ludwigsfelde .
workers are to receive reduced pay and government welfare benefits for the days when they are idle .
most german carmakers , like their counterparts elsewhere , are reeling under the effects of the economic crisis and have been forced to slash production to offset a fall in consumer demand .
speaking sunday at the detroit motor show , the chief executive of daimler , dieter zetsche , said the consequences of the financial crisis had been underestimated in the car industry .
however he was cautiously optimistic for the remainder of 2009 , saying it was conceivable that global demand would recover in the second half of the year .
in 2008 daimler saw sales of its flagship brand mercedes-benz drop 5.4 percent .
new car sales in germany fell by almost two per cent in 2008 , to 3.09 million new registrations .
these are the lowest figures since german reunification in 1990 . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

normally , neural crest cells stop dividing .
but neuroblastoma lose this capacity , and they go on to spawn deadly neuroblastoma cells . now for the first time , researchers at wuerzburg university in germany have isolated the so-called aurka gene which scientists know nurtures another gene called mycn , which is a key culprit in the spread of neuroblastoma tumours . " we speculated that genes that are expressed in a mycn dependent manner might be required specifically for the growth of mycn-amplified neuroblastomas and that mycn-amplified neuroblastomas might depend not only on n-myc itself , but also on upstream regulatory factors or downstream target genes , " explained senior study author , dr. martin eilers , from the university of wuerzburg . hope for new treatments dr. eilers and colleagues performed a genetic screen of nearly 200 genes that are dependent on amplified mycn in human neuroblastoma or are direct targets of myc . " our results show that stabilization of n-myc is a critical oncogenic function of aurora a in childhood neuroblastoma ; the challenge will now be to find ways to interfere with this function in order to find new approaches for the therapy of these tumours , " said dr. eilers .
" the findings also suggest that the current views about why aurora a is oncogenic may need to be re-evaluated . " neuroblastoma accounts for 15 percent of childhood cancer deaths , with just a 40 percent survival rate even though it only causes about 7 percent of all pediatric cancers . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ceo zetsche expects recovery for second half of 2009 . german car manufacturer daimler introduced reduced working hours monday for employees at factories across germany .
shifts are being cut to three or four days a week for 30,000 workers at core manufacturing sites in the company 's home town of stuttgart and its main plant in the suburb of sindelfingen alone .
until sunday , many daimler plants had been closed since mid-december for an extended winter break .
the measures , set to last until the end of march , will also affect operations in berlin and the towns of rastatt and ludwigsfelde .
workers are to receive reduced pay and government welfare benefits for the days when they are idle .
most german carmakers , like their counterparts elsewhere , are reeling under the effects of the economic crisis and have been forced to slash production to offset a fall in consumer demand .
speaking sunday at the detroit motor show , the chief executive of daimler , dieter zetsche , said the consequences of the financial crisis had been underestimated in the car industry .
however he was cautiously optimistic for the remainder of 2009 , saying it was conceivable that global demand would recover in the second half of the year .
in 2008 daimler saw sales of its flagship brand mercedes-benz drop 5.4 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 12.01.2009 german leaders hammer out details of stimulus package großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with key issues still to hash out , the talks are set to last late into the night senior members of german chancellor angela merkel 's coalition are meeting monday to work out the last details of a second stimulus plan worth up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- .
but can they put partisanship aside ? merkel 's coalition of her conservative cdu and the left of center spd have agreed on the broad make-up of germany 's second economic rescue package , but the devil may prove to be in the details , particularly when it comes to the issue of tax cuts .
before monday 's talks , coalition sources said the partners were ready to agree on issues including investing in infrastructure projects and schools .
but some experts have warned that the planned tax cuts could push germany 's deficit back above eu limits .
the two sides seem likely to agree on an increase in the annual tax-free amount for workers from 7,664 euros to 8,000 euros .
additionally , the social democrats want to cut the basic tax rate to 12 percent from 15 percent , a move sharply rejected by the conservatives .
economy minister michael glos of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , said the proposal was " not sensible , " while another senior cdu official said it stood " no chance " of being passed .
the spd has rejected a demand from the conservative camp to lower tax rates for low and medium-income earners .
it says it wants to raise taxes for top earners , but that 's an idea merkel has rejected as sending the wrong signal at a time of crisis .
political considerations in forefront bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making political gains : angela merkel the coalition parties are trying to stave off what could be germany 's worst recession in the post-war years , but given the general elections taking place in september , they 're also trying to win points with the electorate .
some analysts have worried that a focus on partisanship could prevent the coalition from doing what 's best for the country .
" i see the risk that this package has been designed more from the point of view of what is politically expedient than from the point of view of what is economically needed , " thomas mayer , chief european economist at deutsche bank told reuters news agency .
" from what i see so far , the three key tests that anti-cyclical fiscal policy should normally meet - timely , temporary and targeted - are unlikely to be met by this package . "
analysts agree that whatever the outcome of the second stimulus package , merkel is likely to reap the most political capital from the deal .
" the bottom line is that merkel will benefit the most , " manfred guellner , managing director of the forsa polling company told bloomberg .
" merkel is very cleverly giving people the feeling she 's helping them , not companies . "
merkel 's rival for the office of chancellor in september is foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- spd -rrb- .
while popular with germans , analysts agree he faces a considerable hurdle as economic policy is not his main area of expertise . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but can they put partisanship aside ? merkel 's coalition of her conservative cdu and the left of center spd have agreed on the broad make-up of germany 's second economic rescue package , but the devil may prove to be in the details , particularly when it comes to the issue of tax cuts .
before monday 's talks , coalition sources said the partners were ready to agree on issues including investing in infrastructure projects and schools .
but some experts have warned that the planned tax cuts could push germany 's deficit back above eu limits .
the two sides seem likely to agree on an increase in the annual tax-free amount for workers from 7,664 euros to 8,000 euros .
additionally , the social democrats want to cut the basic tax rate to 12 percent from 15 percent , a move sharply rejected by the conservatives .
economy minister michael glos of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , said the proposal was " not sensible , " while another senior cdu official said it stood " no chance " of being passed .
the spd has rejected a demand from the conservative camp to lower tax rates for low and medium-income earners .
it says it wants to raise taxes for top earners , but that 's an idea merkel has rejected as sending the wrong signal at a time of crisis .
political considerations in forefront bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making political gains : angela merkel the coalition parties are trying to stave off what could be germany 's worst recession in the post-war years , but given the general elections taking place in september , they 're also trying to win points with the electorate .
some analysts have worried that a focus on partisanship could prevent the coalition from doing what 's best for the country .
" i see the risk that this package has been designed more from the point of view of what is politically expedient than from the point of view of what is economically needed , " thomas mayer , chief european economist at deutsche bank told reuters news agency .
" from what i see so far , the three key tests that anti-cyclical fiscal policy should normally meet - timely , temporary and targeted - are unlikely to be met by this package . "
analysts agree that whatever the outcome of the second stimulus package , merkel is likely to reap the most political capital from the deal .
" the bottom line is that merkel will benefit the most , " manfred guellner , managing director of the forsa polling company told bloomberg .
" merkel is very cleverly giving people the feeling she 's helping them , not companies . "
merkel 's rival for the office of chancellor in september is foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- spd -rrb- .
while popular with germans , analysts agree he faces a considerable hurdle as economic policy is not his main area of expertise . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

11 . russian president dmitry medvedev earlier sunday had rescinded the eu-brokered accord , citing changes by ukraine . he said russia objected to handwritten text added to the formal agreement by the ukrainian side , calling it a " mockery of common sense . " the extra declaration , which was seen by reuters , asserted that ukraine had not siphoned off transit gas and that it had no outstanding debts to gazprom .
that is the issue that stands at the center of the dispute . " i think that those who have signed this document with reservations well understand the legal consequences of their actions , " he told foreign minister sergei lavrov in a televised discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dmitry medvedev , left , meeting foreign minister sergey lavrov on sunday , jan .
11 " as a result , we are obliged to consider the document signed as null and void for us .
we will not apply it as long as this reserve is not overturned , " he added . putin charged that the ukrainian additions had distorted the meaning of the document originally signed by both parties and introduced issues that were unrelated to the gas dispute . the czech republic 's energy envoy , vaclav bartuska , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said the additional conditions added by ukraine would not have changed the legality of the mandate for the eu observer mission . russian refusal to restart supplies moscow had insisted it would not restart gas supplies to europe until a valid deal was signed .
supplies have been halted since wednesday , jan 7 . medvedev had urged eu officials to pressure ukraine into withdrawing its so-called declaration that it issued to accompany the agreement . the european commission says the declaration would not have changed the deal , but lavrov told medvedev that the copy of the deal russia had received contained ukraine 's stipulation that it was only valid along with the declaration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko , left , and putin , right , were contacted by the eu 's head commissioner sunday putin had proposed to european commission president jose manuel barroso that russian and eu officials meet in brussels on monday for talks over the gas row , a russian government source told reuters . putin told barroso over the phone that additions made by ukraine to an agreement on the monitoring of gas transit were " unacceptable .

but can they put partisanship aside ? merkel 's coalition of her conservative cdu and the left of center spd have agreed on the broad make-up of germany 's second economic rescue package , but the devil may prove to be in the details , particularly when it comes to the issue of tax cuts .
before monday 's talks , coalition sources said the partners were ready to agree on issues including investing in infrastructure projects and schools .
but some experts have warned that the planned tax cuts could push germany 's deficit back above eu limits .
the two sides seem likely to agree on an increase in the annual tax-free amount for workers from 7,664 euros to 8,000 euros .
additionally , the social democrats want to cut the basic tax rate to 12 percent from 15 percent , a move sharply rejected by the conservatives .
economy minister michael glos of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , said the proposal was " not sensible , " while another senior cdu official said it stood " no chance " of being passed .
the spd has rejected a demand from the conservative camp to lower tax rates for low and medium-income earners .
it says it wants to raise taxes for top earners , but that 's an idea merkel has rejected as sending the wrong signal at a time of crisis .
political considerations in forefront bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making political gains : angela merkel the coalition parties are trying to stave off what could be germany 's worst recession in the post-war years , but given the general elections taking place in september , they 're also trying to win points with the electorate .
some analysts have worried that a focus on partisanship could prevent the coalition from doing what 's best for the country .
" i see the risk that this package has been designed more from the point of view of what is politically expedient than from the point of view of what is economically needed , " thomas mayer , chief european economist at deutsche bank told reuters news agency .
" from what i see so far , the three key tests that anti-cyclical fiscal policy should normally meet - timely , temporary and targeted - are unlikely to be met by this package . "
analysts agree that whatever the outcome of the second stimulus package , merkel is likely to reap the most political capital from the deal .
" the bottom line is that merkel will benefit the most , " manfred guellner , managing director of the forsa polling company told bloomberg .
" merkel is very cleverly giving people the feeling she 's helping them , not companies . "
merkel 's rival for the office of chancellor in september is foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- spd -rrb- .
while popular with germans , analysts agree he faces a considerable hurdle as economic policy is not his main area of expertise . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the document has been finally signed , " medvedev said at a news conference in brussels .
" if everything goes without problem , most likely in the nearest future we will start pumping the first quantities of gas , " he said .
european union energy ministers had convened an emergency meeting in the morning for russia to resume gas supplies to europe , since all of the conditions set by moscow had been fulfilled .
the talks were designed to shape " concrete measures " needed by the bloc to deal with the gas shortages , provoked by russia blocking all supplies destined for europe via ukrainian pipelines .
strengthening solidarity among eu energy ministers improving the efficiency of the bloc 's energy market was also on the agenda , as well as ways of strengthening solidarity between member states in the face of future crises , the czech presidency said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans are looking to other energy sources to reduce their dependance on russian gas at the moment , hungary is supplying some of its gas to eu hopeful serbia , while poland is sending trucks loaded with gas to slovakia .
the czech eu presidency will also be called upon to mediate in a brewing row between slovakia and its neighbor , austria .
austrian furor over re-launch of slovakian nuclear reactor bratislava has infuriated vienna by deciding to make up for its shortages by re-opening its soviet-era bohunice nuclear power plant complex , which it had to shut down for security reasons as part of the conditions set for it to join the bloc in 2004 .
" shutting off the plant was one of the fundamental conditions fo -lrb- slovakia 's entry into the eu -rrb- , and it can not simply be cancelled now , " austrian environment minister nikolaus berlakovich said over the weekend .
the eu 's top energy official , andris piebalgs , said the european commission is willing to discuss the matter .
european households without heating the weeks-long gas dispute between russia and ukraine has already left hundreds of thousands of people in central and southern europe without heating in one of the coldest winters in decades .
the eu had worked hard to try and break the stalemate by sending a monitoring mission to kiev tasked with ensuring that no gas bound to europe is siphoned off by ukraine , as alleged by moscow .
eu ministers were also expected to focus on the need for the bloc to develop alternative energy supplies , both by building pipelines to bypass ukraine and russia and by turning to other technologies , such as solar , wind and wave power .
" all european member states must do their bit so that more sources -lrb- of energy -rrb- are opened up and delivery routes created , " peter hintze , a top official from the german economics ministry , said in brussels . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" " we have a situation in which not only is iran exporting terrorism through hamas , through hezbollah , but they are pursuing a nuclear weapon that could potentially trigger a nuclear arms race in the middle east , " obama said . obama has previously expressed his willingness to conduct more direct diplomacy with iran , a change from the bush administration 's refusal to negotiate directly until the islamic republic stops enriching uranium , a process that can produce weapons-grade bomb fuel .
tehran insists its enrichment activities are for civilian use only and asserts its natural right to do so . " we are going to have to take a new approach , " obama said .
" the international community is going to be taking cues from us in how we want to approach iran . " despite the new course however , obama has refused to rule out military action to stop iran acquiring a nuclear weapon . obama said he intended to send a signal that " we respect the aspirations of the iranian people , but that we also have certain expectations in terms of how an international actor behaves .

austria has urged the eu to take action against its neighbor . slovakia , which depends on russia for almost all of its natural gas that run through ukrainian pipelines , will re-start a controversial nuclear reactor to cope with a potential shortage caused by the energy dispute between moscow and kiev .
officials fear that the gas supply could fall to such a low level that it would soon be impossible to heat slovak households during an unusually cold winter with sub-freezing winter temperatures .
the bohunice plant , which is located a short distance from bratislava , consists of five soviet-type reactors , which have been decommissioned under the terms of slovakia accession to the eu back in 2004 .
violating eu pledge to avoid blackout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hazardous soviet-type reactor was shut down in slovakia 30 years ago the slovak government has justified violating its pledge to brussels in order to avoid a possible blackout during the gas crisis .
at a special cabinet meeting over the weekend , slovakia 's prime minister robert fico announced that his country would now restart the reactor , which should be up and running by the end of the week .
fico told reporters that reneging on the terms of its eu membership was better than taking the risk that his country 's electricity grid would collapse .
" we are facing a blackout here , therefore we have to act fast , " said fico , adding that the government would shut the reactor down again " as soon as the situation is stabilized . "
neighboring austria blasts slovakia the last reactor was shut down only a few weeks ago and the decision to re-launch it is likely to draw protests from neighboring austria , which has campaigned for decades against the hazards of old soviet style nuclear plants of its former communist bloc neighbors . one reactor that caused a major accident in 1977 led to its shutdown two years later .
" we can not accept the re-opening of this unsafe reactor at bohunice , " austrian environment minister nikolaus berlakovich said in a statement .
" in a community , agreements must be respected .
the -lrb- plant 's -rrb- shutdown was a key condition -lrb- to slovakia 's entry into the eu -rrb- for us and ca n't just be erased , " he added .
" now it 's up to the european commission to strongly urge compliance with the accession agreement . "
the nuclear issue has even united all of austria 's opposition parties making political bedfellows of two far-right parties and the environmental greens , who have slammed slovakia , arguing that bohunice was " one of the three most dangerous nuclear plants in europe " .
opposition leaders are urging the austrian government and the eu to take legal and diplomatic measures against slovakia .
eu under czech leadership sympathetic to slovakia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague , which holds the eu presidency , defended slovakia in brussels , the european commission said there was " no legal basis " for the nuclear re-launch , but conceded that slovakia had a " real problem " with the gas shortage .
the czech republic , which was the other half of the former czechoslovakia and just kicked off its current six month eu presidency , was even more sympathetic to slovakia 's plight .
czech prime minister mirek topolanek rejected all criticism on sunday , pointing out the shortcomings of the eu 's energy and security policies .

" the document has been finally signed , " medvedev said at a news conference in brussels .
" if everything goes without problem , most likely in the nearest future we will start pumping the first quantities of gas , " he said .
european union energy ministers had convened an emergency meeting in the morning for russia to resume gas supplies to europe , since all of the conditions set by moscow had been fulfilled .
the talks were designed to shape " concrete measures " needed by the bloc to deal with the gas shortages , provoked by russia blocking all supplies destined for europe via ukrainian pipelines .
strengthening solidarity among eu energy ministers improving the efficiency of the bloc 's energy market was also on the agenda , as well as ways of strengthening solidarity between member states in the face of future crises , the czech presidency said .

the czech eu presidency will also be called upon to mediate in a brewing row between slovakia and its neighbor , austria .
austrian furor over re-launch of slovakian nuclear reactor bratislava has infuriated vienna by deciding to make up for its shortages by re-opening its soviet-era bohunice nuclear power plant complex , which it had to shut down for security reasons as part of the conditions set for it to join the bloc in 2004 .
" shutting off the plant was one of the fundamental conditions fo -lrb- slovakia 's entry into the eu -rrb- , and it can not simply be cancelled now , " austrian environment minister nikolaus berlakovich said over the weekend .
the eu 's top energy official , andris piebalgs , said the european commission is willing to discuss the matter .
european households without heating the weeks-long gas dispute between russia and ukraine has already left hundreds of thousands of people in central and southern europe without heating in one of the coldest winters in decades .
the eu had worked hard to try and break the stalemate by sending a monitoring mission to kiev tasked with ensuring that no gas bound to europe is siphoned off by ukraine , as alleged by moscow .
eu ministers were also expected to focus on the need for the bloc to develop alternative energy supplies , both by building pipelines to bypass ukraine and russia and by turning to other technologies , such as solar , wind and wave power .
" all european member states must do their bit so that more sources -lrb- of energy -rrb- are opened up and delivery routes created , " peter hintze , a top official from the german economics ministry , said in brussels . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but can they put partisanship aside ? merkel 's coalition of her conservative cdu and the left of center spd have agreed on the broad make-up of germany 's second economic rescue package , but the devil may prove to be in the details , particularly when it comes to the issue of tax cuts .
before monday 's talks , coalition sources said the partners were ready to agree on issues including investing in infrastructure projects and schools .
but some experts have warned that the planned tax cuts could push germany 's deficit back above eu limits .
the two sides seem likely to agree on an increase in the annual tax-free amount for workers from 7,664 euros to 8,000 euros .
additionally , the social democrats want to cut the basic tax rate to 12 percent from 15 percent , a move sharply rejected by the conservatives .
economy minister michael glos of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , said the proposal was " not sensible , " while another senior cdu official said it stood " no chance " of being passed .
the spd has rejected a demand from the conservative camp to lower tax rates for low and medium-income earners .
it says it wants to raise taxes for top earners , but that 's an idea merkel has rejected as sending the wrong signal at a time of crisis .
political considerations in forefront bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making political gains : angela merkel the coalition parties are trying to stave off what could be germany 's worst recession in the post-war years , but given the general elections taking place in september , they 're also trying to win points with the electorate .
some analysts have worried that a focus on partisanship could prevent the coalition from doing what 's best for the country .
" i see the risk that this package has been designed more from the point of view of what is politically expedient than from the point of view of what is economically needed , " thomas mayer , chief european economist at deutsche bank told reuters news agency .
" from what i see so far , the three key tests that anti-cyclical fiscal policy should normally meet - timely , temporary and targeted - are unlikely to be met by this package . "
analysts agree that whatever the outcome of the second stimulus package , merkel is likely to reap the most political capital from the deal .
" the bottom line is that merkel will benefit the most , " manfred guellner , managing director of the forsa polling company told bloomberg .
" merkel is very cleverly giving people the feeling she 's helping them , not companies . "
merkel 's rival for the office of chancellor in september is foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- spd -rrb- .
while popular with germans , analysts agree he faces a considerable hurdle as economic policy is not his main area of expertise . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the document has been finally signed , " medvedev said at a news conference in brussels .
" if everything goes without problem , most likely in the nearest future we will start pumping the first quantities of gas , " he said .
european union energy ministers had convened an emergency meeting in the morning for russia to resume gas supplies to europe , since all of the conditions set by moscow had been fulfilled .
the talks were designed to shape " concrete measures " needed by the bloc to deal with the gas shortages , provoked by russia blocking all supplies destined for europe via ukrainian pipelines .
strengthening solidarity among eu energy ministers improving the efficiency of the bloc 's energy market was also on the agenda , as well as ways of strengthening solidarity between member states in the face of future crises , the czech presidency said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans are looking to other energy sources to reduce their dependance on russian gas at the moment , hungary is supplying some of its gas to eu hopeful serbia , while poland is sending trucks loaded with gas to slovakia .
the czech eu presidency will also be called upon to mediate in a brewing row between slovakia and its neighbor , austria .
austrian furor over re-launch of slovakian nuclear reactor bratislava has infuriated vienna by deciding to make up for its shortages by re-opening its soviet-era bohunice nuclear power plant complex , which it had to shut down for security reasons as part of the conditions set for it to join the bloc in 2004 .
" shutting off the plant was one of the fundamental conditions fo -lrb- slovakia 's entry into the eu -rrb- , and it can not simply be cancelled now , " austrian environment minister nikolaus berlakovich said over the weekend .
the eu 's top energy official , andris piebalgs , said the european commission is willing to discuss the matter .
european households without heating the weeks-long gas dispute between russia and ukraine has already left hundreds of thousands of people in central and southern europe without heating in one of the coldest winters in decades .
the eu had worked hard to try and break the stalemate by sending a monitoring mission to kiev tasked with ensuring that no gas bound to europe is siphoned off by ukraine , as alleged by moscow .
eu ministers were also expected to focus on the need for the bloc to develop alternative energy supplies , both by building pipelines to bypass ukraine and russia and by turning to other technologies , such as solar , wind and wave power .
" all european member states must do their bit so that more sources -lrb- of energy -rrb- are opened up and delivery routes created , " peter hintze , a top official from the german economics ministry , said in brussels . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the document has been finally signed , " medvedev said at a news conference in brussels .
" if everything goes without problem , most likely in the nearest future we will start pumping the first quantities of gas , " he said .
european union energy ministers had convened an emergency meeting in the morning for russia to resume gas supplies to europe , since all of the conditions set by moscow had been fulfilled .
the talks were designed to shape " concrete measures " needed by the bloc to deal with the gas shortages , provoked by russia blocking all supplies destined for europe via ukrainian pipelines .
strengthening solidarity among eu energy ministers improving the efficiency of the bloc 's energy market was also on the agenda , as well as ways of strengthening solidarity between member states in the face of future crises , the czech presidency said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans are looking to other energy sources to reduce their dependance on russian gas at the moment , hungary is supplying some of its gas to eu hopeful serbia , while poland is sending trucks loaded with gas to slovakia .
the czech eu presidency will also be called upon to mediate in a brewing row between slovakia and its neighbor , austria .
austrian furor over re-launch of slovakian nuclear reactor bratislava has infuriated vienna by deciding to make up for its shortages by re-opening its soviet-era bohunice nuclear power plant complex , which it had to shut down for security reasons as part of the conditions set for it to join the bloc in 2004 .
" shutting off the plant was one of the fundamental conditions fo -lrb- slovakia 's entry into the eu -rrb- , and it can not simply be cancelled now , " austrian environment minister nikolaus berlakovich said over the weekend .
the eu 's top energy official , andris piebalgs , said the european commission is willing to discuss the matter .
european households without heating the weeks-long gas dispute between russia and ukraine has already left hundreds of thousands of people in central and southern europe without heating in one of the coldest winters in decades .
the eu had worked hard to try and break the stalemate by sending a monitoring mission to kiev tasked with ensuring that no gas bound to europe is siphoned off by ukraine , as alleged by moscow .
eu ministers were also expected to focus on the need for the bloc to develop alternative energy supplies , both by building pipelines to bypass ukraine and russia and by turning to other technologies , such as solar , wind and wave power .
" all european member states must do their bit so that more sources -lrb- of energy -rrb- are opened up and delivery routes created , " peter hintze , a top official from the german economics ministry , said in brussels . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

normally , neural crest cells stop dividing .
but neuroblastoma lose this capacity , and they go on to spawn deadly neuroblastoma cells . now for the first time , researchers at wuerzburg university in germany have isolated the so-called aurka gene which scientists know nurtures another gene called mycn , which is a key culprit in the spread of neuroblastoma tumours . " we speculated that genes that are expressed in a mycn dependent manner might be required specifically for the growth of mycn-amplified neuroblastomas and that mycn-amplified neuroblastomas might depend not only on n-myc itself , but also on upstream regulatory factors or downstream target genes , " explained senior study author , dr. martin eilers , from the university of wuerzburg . hope for new treatments dr. eilers and colleagues performed a genetic screen of nearly 200 genes that are dependent on amplified mycn in human neuroblastoma or are direct targets of myc . " our results show that stabilization of n-myc is a critical oncogenic function of aurora a in childhood neuroblastoma ; the challenge will now be to find ways to interfere with this function in order to find new approaches for the therapy of these tumours , " said dr. eilers .
" the findings also suggest that the current views about why aurora a is oncogenic may need to be re-evaluated . " neuroblastoma accounts for 15 percent of childhood cancer deaths , with just a 40 percent survival rate even though it only causes about 7 percent of all pediatric cancers . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ceo zetsche expects recovery for second half of 2009 . german car manufacturer daimler introduced reduced working hours monday for employees at factories across germany .
shifts are being cut to three or four days a week for 30,000 workers at core manufacturing sites in the company 's home town of stuttgart and its main plant in the suburb of sindelfingen alone .
until sunday , many daimler plants had been closed since mid-december for an extended winter break .
the measures , set to last until the end of march , will also affect operations in berlin and the towns of rastatt and ludwigsfelde .
workers are to receive reduced pay and government welfare benefits for the days when they are idle .
most german carmakers , like their counterparts elsewhere , are reeling under the effects of the economic crisis and have been forced to slash production to offset a fall in consumer demand .
speaking sunday at the detroit motor show , the chief executive of daimler , dieter zetsche , said the consequences of the financial crisis had been underestimated in the car industry .
however he was cautiously optimistic for the remainder of 2009 , saying it was conceivable that global demand would recover in the second half of the year .

one that did was rotkaeppchen sparkling wine .
the company even managed to buy out western rivals and today it 's a market leader . it came as no surprise that east germans wasted little time trading in the brands they had grown up with for the west germans products they had believed would remain out of their reach forever . perhaps it is more surprising that any east german products survived at all .
but in fact , quite a few did , from the florena cosmetics label , now owned by beiersdorf , to spee laundry detergent , which was bought up henkel . one even went on to become not only a favorite among nostalgic east germans - it also swallowed its rivals and spat them out like a corked wine .
today , rotkaeppchen sparkling wine is germany ’ s market leader . the dry spell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the company was founded over 150 years ago the company 's meteoric success is one of the quirkier outcomes of reunification .
the rotkaeppchen - little red riding hood - wine cellar first opened in freyburg an der unstrut , south of leipzig , in 1856 , and today the 650-hectare vineyard is one of the smallest in germany .
but only a fraction of the grapes that go into the sparking wine are grown here , while the rest come from france , italy , spain and western germany . the company was turned into a collective during the communist era , producing 15 million bottles of bubbly a year . for a brief interlude after the fall of the berlin wall , east germans drunk on the temptations of capitalism spurned rotkaeppchen in favor of more glamorous western labels , and for a while the company floundered .
in 1991 , only 2.9 million of the red-topped green bottles were sold . the management buyout but its fortunes changed in 1993 when gunter heise , the company 's technical director , decided to take matters in to his own hands .
in a management buyout , he and four of his colleagues took over the malingering business from the trust created in 1990 to privatize the east german enterprises owned as public property . entrepreneur harald eckes-chantre and his family footed the lion 's share of the bill , while the five company employees put up the rest .
today , the eckes-chantre family still owns more than 50 percent of the company , while the rest belongs to heise and three of the original investors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sparkling wine got its name from little red riding hood herself in 1994 , the team began their efforts to break in to the western german market . they were so successful that by 2000 , sales of 50 millions bottles a year made the company germany 's number one sparkling wine maker . world domination by 2002 , heise and co. were feeling confident enough to take over their hessen-based rivals mumm , jules mumm and mm extra from canadian drinks manufacturer seagram .
one year later , they snapped up the small but upmarket geldermann company from bavaria . by 2007 , rotkaeppchen reportedly owned nearly 40 percent of the german sparkling wine market . the second-largest share is owned by spanish company freixenet , with a mere 17 percent - although freixenet leads on the international market .
rotkaeppchen , nonetheless , occupies an admirable second place . liquored-up the latest addition to the rotkaeppchen empire was made in late 2006 , when the company bought the western german liquor manufacturer eckes spirituosen & wein , which makes chantre and mariacron brandy , eckes cherry liqueur and nordhaeuser schnapps . the acquisition shot the company to the top of the german liquor market . 2007 was the company 's most profitable year ever with sales up by 10.5 percent .
a total of 186 million bottles were sold , with sales of sparkling wine , the company 's main product , up by 12.6 percent since the previous year .
at 709.5 million euros , turnover grew by 8.9 percent since 2006 . communist chic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rotkaeppchen ceo gunter heise re-enacts the brand 's television commercial joachim schuetz is ceo of markenverband , the german brands association , which numbers rotkaeppchen among its members . he says the company 's owes its success to its change of strategy in 1993 . " after the management buy-out , the company chose to promote rotkaeppchen as a pan-german brand , " he said .
even though it was known as a quintessentially east german brand , it had wider potential and its new owners made the most of the opportunity . " they were successful because they acted fast , " said schuetz . nonetheless , at a time when nostalgia for east german culture and kitsch shows no signs of abating , its image as communist champagne has by no means damaged rotkaeppchen 's reputation . the company itself insists it has never deliberately tried to milk this trend .
in fact , it sees the association has something of a hangover it ca n't shake . " we would rather shed the east german connection entirely , " said a company spokesperson . management actually refuses requests from journalists wanting to report on the company as a specifically east german success story . " our gdr past was only one chapter in our history , " said the company .

one that did was rotkaeppchen sparkling wine .
the company even managed to buy out western rivals and today it 's a market leader . it came as no surprise that east germans wasted little time trading in the brands they had grown up with for the west germans products they had believed would remain out of their reach forever . perhaps it is more surprising that any east german products survived at all .
but in fact , quite a few did , from the florena cosmetics label , now owned by beiersdorf , to spee laundry detergent , which was bought up henkel . one even went on to become not only a favorite among nostalgic east germans - it also swallowed its rivals and spat them out like a corked wine .
today , rotkaeppchen sparkling wine is germany ’ s market leader . the dry spell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the company was founded over 150 years ago the company 's meteoric success is one of the quirkier outcomes of reunification .

but can they put partisanship aside ? merkel 's coalition of her conservative cdu and the left of center spd have agreed on the broad make-up of germany 's second economic rescue package , but the devil may prove to be in the details , particularly when it comes to the issue of tax cuts .
before monday 's talks , coalition sources said the partners were ready to agree on issues including investing in infrastructure projects and schools .
but some experts have warned that the planned tax cuts could push germany 's deficit back above eu limits .
the two sides seem likely to agree on an increase in the annual tax-free amount for workers from 7,664 euros to 8,000 euros .
additionally , the social democrats want to cut the basic tax rate to 12 percent from 15 percent , a move sharply rejected by the conservatives .
economy minister michael glos of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , said the proposal was " not sensible , " while another senior cdu official said it stood " no chance " of being passed .
the spd has rejected a demand from the conservative camp to lower tax rates for low and medium-income earners .

some analysts have worried that a focus on partisanship could prevent the coalition from doing what 's best for the country .
" i see the risk that this package has been designed more from the point of view of what is politically expedient than from the point of view of what is economically needed , " thomas mayer , chief european economist at deutsche bank told reuters news agency .
" from what i see so far , the three key tests that anti-cyclical fiscal policy should normally meet - timely , temporary and targeted - are unlikely to be met by this package . "
analysts agree that whatever the outcome of the second stimulus package , merkel is likely to reap the most political capital from the deal .
" the bottom line is that merkel will benefit the most , " manfred guellner , managing director of the forsa polling company told bloomberg .
" merkel is very cleverly giving people the feeling she 's helping them , not companies . "

but can they put partisanship aside ? merkel 's coalition of her conservative cdu and the left of center spd have agreed on the broad make-up of germany 's second economic rescue package , but the devil may prove to be in the details , particularly when it comes to the issue of tax cuts .
before monday 's talks , coalition sources said the partners were ready to agree on issues including investing in infrastructure projects and schools .
but some experts have warned that the planned tax cuts could push germany 's deficit back above eu limits .
the two sides seem likely to agree on an increase in the annual tax-free amount for workers from 7,664 euros to 8,000 euros .
additionally , the social democrats want to cut the basic tax rate to 12 percent from 15 percent , a move sharply rejected by the conservatives .
economy minister michael glos of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , said the proposal was " not sensible , " while another senior cdu official said it stood " no chance " of being passed .
the spd has rejected a demand from the conservative camp to lower tax rates for low and medium-income earners .
it says it wants to raise taxes for top earners , but that 's an idea merkel has rejected as sending the wrong signal at a time of crisis .
political considerations in forefront bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making political gains : angela merkel the coalition parties are trying to stave off what could be germany 's worst recession in the post-war years , but given the general elections taking place in september , they 're also trying to win points with the electorate .
some analysts have worried that a focus on partisanship could prevent the coalition from doing what 's best for the country .
" i see the risk that this package has been designed more from the point of view of what is politically expedient than from the point of view of what is economically needed , " thomas mayer , chief european economist at deutsche bank told reuters news agency .
" from what i see so far , the three key tests that anti-cyclical fiscal policy should normally meet - timely , temporary and targeted - are unlikely to be met by this package . "
analysts agree that whatever the outcome of the second stimulus package , merkel is likely to reap the most political capital from the deal .
" the bottom line is that merkel will benefit the most , " manfred guellner , managing director of the forsa polling company told bloomberg .
" merkel is very cleverly giving people the feeling she 's helping them , not companies . "
merkel 's rival for the office of chancellor in september is foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- spd -rrb- .
while popular with germans , analysts agree he faces a considerable hurdle as economic policy is not his main area of expertise . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

normally , neural crest cells stop dividing .
but neuroblastoma lose this capacity , and they go on to spawn deadly neuroblastoma cells . now for the first time , researchers at wuerzburg university in germany have isolated the so-called aurka gene which scientists know nurtures another gene called mycn , which is a key culprit in the spread of neuroblastoma tumours . " we speculated that genes that are expressed in a mycn dependent manner might be required specifically for the growth of mycn-amplified neuroblastomas and that mycn-amplified neuroblastomas might depend not only on n-myc itself , but also on upstream regulatory factors or downstream target genes , " explained senior study author , dr. martin eilers , from the university of wuerzburg . hope for new treatments dr. eilers and colleagues performed a genetic screen of nearly 200 genes that are dependent on amplified mycn in human neuroblastoma or are direct targets of myc . " our results show that stabilization of n-myc is a critical oncogenic function of aurora a in childhood neuroblastoma ; the challenge will now be to find ways to interfere with this function in order to find new approaches for the therapy of these tumours , " said dr. eilers .

normally , neural crest cells stop dividing .
but neuroblastoma lose this capacity , and they go on to spawn deadly neuroblastoma cells . now for the first time , researchers at wuerzburg university in germany have isolated the so-called aurka gene which scientists know nurtures another gene called mycn , which is a key culprit in the spread of neuroblastoma tumours . " we speculated that genes that are expressed in a mycn dependent manner might be required specifically for the growth of mycn-amplified neuroblastomas and that mycn-amplified neuroblastomas might depend not only on n-myc itself , but also on upstream regulatory factors or downstream target genes , " explained senior study author , dr. martin eilers , from the university of wuerzburg . hope for new treatments dr. eilers and colleagues performed a genetic screen of nearly 200 genes that are dependent on amplified mycn in human neuroblastoma or are direct targets of myc . " our results show that stabilization of n-myc is a critical oncogenic function of aurora a in childhood neuroblastoma ; the challenge will now be to find ways to interfere with this function in order to find new approaches for the therapy of these tumours , " said dr. eilers .
" the findings also suggest that the current views about why aurora a is oncogenic may need to be re-evaluated .

normally , neural crest cells stop dividing .
but neuroblastoma lose this capacity , and they go on to spawn deadly neuroblastoma cells . now for the first time , researchers at wuerzburg university in germany have isolated the so-called aurka gene which scientists know nurtures another gene called mycn , which is a key culprit in the spread of neuroblastoma tumours . " we speculated that genes that are expressed in a mycn dependent manner might be required specifically for the growth of mycn-amplified neuroblastomas and that mycn-amplified neuroblastomas might depend not only on n-myc itself , but also on upstream regulatory factors or downstream target genes , " explained senior study author , dr. martin eilers , from the university of wuerzburg . hope for new treatments dr. eilers and colleagues performed a genetic screen of nearly 200 genes that are dependent on amplified mycn in human neuroblastoma or are direct targets of myc . " our results show that stabilization of n-myc is a critical oncogenic function of aurora a in childhood neuroblastoma ; the challenge will now be to find ways to interfere with this function in order to find new approaches for the therapy of these tumours , " said dr. eilers .

ceo zetsche expects recovery for second half of 2009 . german car manufacturer daimler introduced reduced working hours monday for employees at factories across germany .
shifts are being cut to three or four days a week for 30,000 workers at core manufacturing sites in the company 's home town of stuttgart and its main plant in the suburb of sindelfingen alone .
until sunday , many daimler plants had been closed since mid-december for an extended winter break .
the measures , set to last until the end of march , will also affect operations in berlin and the towns of rastatt and ludwigsfelde .
workers are to receive reduced pay and government welfare benefits for the days when they are idle .
most german carmakers , like their counterparts elsewhere , are reeling under the effects of the economic crisis and have been forced to slash production to offset a fall in consumer demand .
speaking sunday at the detroit motor show , the chief executive of daimler , dieter zetsche , said the consequences of the financial crisis had been underestimated in the car industry .
however he was cautiously optimistic for the remainder of 2009 , saying it was conceivable that global demand would recover in the second half of the year .
in 2008 daimler saw sales of its flagship brand mercedes-benz drop 5.4 percent .

ceo zetsche expects recovery for second half of 2009 . german car manufacturer daimler introduced reduced working hours monday for employees at factories across germany .
shifts are being cut to three or four days a week for 30,000 workers at core manufacturing sites in the company 's home town of stuttgart and its main plant in the suburb of sindelfingen alone .
until sunday , many daimler plants had been closed since mid-december for an extended winter break .
the measures , set to last until the end of march , will also affect operations in berlin and the towns of rastatt and ludwigsfelde .
workers are to receive reduced pay and government welfare benefits for the days when they are idle .
most german carmakers , like their counterparts elsewhere , are reeling under the effects of the economic crisis and have been forced to slash production to offset a fall in consumer demand .
speaking sunday at the detroit motor show , the chief executive of daimler , dieter zetsche , said the consequences of the financial crisis had been underestimated in the car industry .
however he was cautiously optimistic for the remainder of 2009 , saying it was conceivable that global demand would recover in the second half of the year .
in 2008 daimler saw sales of its flagship brand mercedes-benz drop 5.4 percent .
new car sales in germany fell by almost two per cent in 2008 , to 3.09 million new registrations .
these are the lowest figures since german reunification in 1990 . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 12.01.2009 slovakia re-starts nuclear reactor to avoid blackout großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the energy dispute could make gas levels go under the level needed to heat households by re-launching a reactor that it recently shut down , slovakia has violated a pledge to the eu to decommission its soviet-designed nuclear plants .
austria has urged the eu to take action against its neighbor . slovakia , which depends on russia for almost all of its natural gas that run through ukrainian pipelines , will re-start a controversial nuclear reactor to cope with a potential shortage caused by the energy dispute between moscow and kiev .
officials fear that the gas supply could fall to such a low level that it would soon be impossible to heat slovak households during an unusually cold winter with sub-freezing winter temperatures .
the bohunice plant , which is located a short distance from bratislava , consists of five soviet-type reactors , which have been decommissioned under the terms of slovakia accession to the eu back in 2004 .
violating eu pledge to avoid blackout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hazardous soviet-type reactor was shut down in slovakia 30 years ago the slovak government has justified violating its pledge to brussels in order to avoid a possible blackout during the gas crisis .
at a special cabinet meeting over the weekend , slovakia 's prime minister robert fico announced that his country would now restart the reactor , which should be up and running by the end of the week .
fico told reporters that reneging on the terms of its eu membership was better than taking the risk that his country 's electricity grid would collapse .
" we are facing a blackout here , therefore we have to act fast , " said fico , adding that the government would shut the reactor down again " as soon as the situation is stabilized . "
neighboring austria blasts slovakia the last reactor was shut down only a few weeks ago and the decision to re-launch it is likely to draw protests from neighboring austria , which has campaigned for decades against the hazards of old soviet style nuclear plants of its former communist bloc neighbors . one reactor that caused a major accident in 1977 led to its shutdown two years later .
" we can not accept the re-opening of this unsafe reactor at bohunice , " austrian environment minister nikolaus berlakovich said in a statement .
" in a community , agreements must be respected .
the -lrb- plant 's -rrb- shutdown was a key condition -lrb- to slovakia 's entry into the eu -rrb- for us and ca n't just be erased , " he added .
" now it 's up to the european commission to strongly urge compliance with the accession agreement . "
the nuclear issue has even united all of austria 's opposition parties making political bedfellows of two far-right parties and the environmental greens , who have slammed slovakia , arguing that bohunice was " one of the three most dangerous nuclear plants in europe " .
opposition leaders are urging the austrian government and the eu to take legal and diplomatic measures against slovakia .
eu under czech leadership sympathetic to slovakia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague , which holds the eu presidency , defended slovakia in brussels , the european commission said there was " no legal basis " for the nuclear re-launch , but conceded that slovakia had a " real problem " with the gas shortage .
the czech republic , which was the other half of the former czechoslovakia and just kicked off its current six month eu presidency , was even more sympathetic to slovakia 's plight .
czech prime minister mirek topolanek rejected all criticism on sunday , pointing out the shortcomings of the eu 's energy and security policies .
" at the moment , i take it rather as a demonstration of -lrb- fico 's -rrb- readiness to tackle an issue that the european union can not resolve for slovakia - a looming blackout , " he said in prague . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 12.01.2009 slovakia re-starts nuclear reactor to avoid blackout großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the energy dispute could make gas levels go under the level needed to heat households by re-launching a reactor that it recently shut down , slovakia has violated a pledge to the eu to decommission its soviet-designed nuclear plants .
austria has urged the eu to take action against its neighbor . slovakia , which depends on russia for almost all of its natural gas that run through ukrainian pipelines , will re-start a controversial nuclear reactor to cope with a potential shortage caused by the energy dispute between moscow and kiev .
officials fear that the gas supply could fall to such a low level that it would soon be impossible to heat slovak households during an unusually cold winter with sub-freezing winter temperatures .
the bohunice plant , which is located a short distance from bratislava , consists of five soviet-type reactors , which have been decommissioned under the terms of slovakia accession to the eu back in 2004 .
violating eu pledge to avoid blackout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hazardous soviet-type reactor was shut down in slovakia 30 years ago the slovak government has justified violating its pledge to brussels in order to avoid a possible blackout during the gas crisis .
at a special cabinet meeting over the weekend , slovakia 's prime minister robert fico announced that his country would now restart the reactor , which should be up and running by the end of the week .
fico told reporters that reneging on the terms of its eu membership was better than taking the risk that his country 's electricity grid would collapse .
" we are facing a blackout here , therefore we have to act fast , " said fico , adding that the government would shut the reactor down again " as soon as the situation is stabilized . "
neighboring austria blasts slovakia the last reactor was shut down only a few weeks ago and the decision to re-launch it is likely to draw protests from neighboring austria , which has campaigned for decades against the hazards of old soviet style nuclear plants of its former communist bloc neighbors . one reactor that caused a major accident in 1977 led to its shutdown two years later .
" we can not accept the re-opening of this unsafe reactor at bohunice , " austrian environment minister nikolaus berlakovich said in a statement .
" in a community , agreements must be respected .
the -lrb- plant 's -rrb- shutdown was a key condition -lrb- to slovakia 's entry into the eu -rrb- for us and ca n't just be erased , " he added .
" now it 's up to the european commission to strongly urge compliance with the accession agreement . "
the nuclear issue has even united all of austria 's opposition parties making political bedfellows of two far-right parties and the environmental greens , who have slammed slovakia , arguing that bohunice was " one of the three most dangerous nuclear plants in europe " .
opposition leaders are urging the austrian government and the eu to take legal and diplomatic measures against slovakia .
eu under czech leadership sympathetic to slovakia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague , which holds the eu presidency , defended slovakia in brussels , the european commission said there was " no legal basis " for the nuclear re-launch , but conceded that slovakia had a " real problem " with the gas shortage .
the czech republic , which was the other half of the former czechoslovakia and just kicked off its current six month eu presidency , was even more sympathetic to slovakia 's plight .
czech prime minister mirek topolanek rejected all criticism on sunday , pointing out the shortcomings of the eu 's energy and security policies .
" at the moment , i take it rather as a demonstration of -lrb- fico 's -rrb- readiness to tackle an issue that the european union can not resolve for slovakia - a looming blackout , " he said in prague . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the document has been finally signed , " medvedev said at a news conference in brussels .
" if everything goes without problem , most likely in the nearest future we will start pumping the first quantities of gas , " he said .
european union energy ministers had convened an emergency meeting in the morning for russia to resume gas supplies to europe , since all of the conditions set by moscow had been fulfilled .
the talks were designed to shape " concrete measures " needed by the bloc to deal with the gas shortages , provoked by russia blocking all supplies destined for europe via ukrainian pipelines .
strengthening solidarity among eu energy ministers improving the efficiency of the bloc 's energy market was also on the agenda , as well as ways of strengthening solidarity between member states in the face of future crises , the czech presidency said .

the eu had worked hard to try and break the stalemate by sending a monitoring mission to kiev tasked with ensuring that no gas bound to europe is siphoned off by ukraine , as alleged by moscow .
eu ministers were also expected to focus on the need for the bloc to develop alternative energy supplies , both by building pipelines to bypass ukraine and russia and by turning to other technologies , such as solar , wind and wave power .

european union energy ministers had convened an emergency meeting in the morning for russia to resume gas supplies to europe , since all of the conditions set by moscow had been fulfilled .
the talks were designed to shape " concrete measures " needed by the bloc to deal with the gas shortages , provoked by russia blocking all supplies destined for europe via ukrainian pipelines .
strengthening solidarity among eu energy ministers improving the efficiency of the bloc 's energy market was also on the agenda , as well as ways of strengthening solidarity between member states in the face of future crises , the czech presidency said .

11 . russian president dmitry medvedev earlier sunday had rescinded the eu-brokered accord , citing changes by ukraine . he said russia objected to handwritten text added to the formal agreement by the ukrainian side , calling it a " mockery of common sense . " the extra declaration , which was seen by reuters , asserted that ukraine had not siphoned off transit gas and that it had no outstanding debts to gazprom .
that is the issue that stands at the center of the dispute . " i think that those who have signed this document with reservations well understand the legal consequences of their actions , " he told foreign minister sergei lavrov in a televised discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dmitry medvedev , left , meeting foreign minister sergey lavrov on sunday , jan .
11 " as a result , we are obliged to consider the document signed as null and void for us .
we will not apply it as long as this reserve is not overturned , " he added . putin charged that the ukrainian additions had distorted the meaning of the document originally signed by both parties and introduced issues that were unrelated to the gas dispute . the czech republic 's energy envoy , vaclav bartuska , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said the additional conditions added by ukraine would not have changed the legality of the mandate for the eu observer mission . russian refusal to restart supplies moscow had insisted it would not restart gas supplies to europe until a valid deal was signed .
supplies have been halted since wednesday , jan 7 . medvedev had urged eu officials to pressure ukraine into withdrawing its so-called declaration that it issued to accompany the agreement . the european commission says the declaration would not have changed the deal , but lavrov told medvedev that the copy of the deal russia had received contained ukraine 's stipulation that it was only valid along with the declaration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko , left , and putin , right , were contacted by the eu 's head commissioner sunday putin had proposed to european commission president jose manuel barroso that russian and eu officials meet in brussels on monday for talks over the gas row , a russian government source told reuters . putin told barroso over the phone that additions made by ukraine to an agreement on the monitoring of gas transit were " unacceptable .

11 . russian president dmitry medvedev earlier sunday had rescinded the eu-brokered accord , citing changes by ukraine . he said russia objected to handwritten text added to the formal agreement by the ukrainian side , calling it a " mockery of common sense . " the extra declaration , which was seen by reuters , asserted that ukraine had not siphoned off transit gas and that it had no outstanding debts to gazprom .
that is the issue that stands at the center of the dispute . " i think that those who have signed this document with reservations well understand the legal consequences of their actions , " he told foreign minister sergei lavrov in a televised discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dmitry medvedev , left , meeting foreign minister sergey lavrov on sunday , jan .
11 " as a result , we are obliged to consider the document signed as null and void for us .
we will not apply it as long as this reserve is not overturned , " he added . putin charged that the ukrainian additions had distorted the meaning of the document originally signed by both parties and introduced issues that were unrelated to the gas dispute . the czech republic 's energy envoy , vaclav bartuska , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said the additional conditions added by ukraine would not have changed the legality of the mandate for the eu observer mission . russian refusal to restart supplies moscow had insisted it would not restart gas supplies to europe until a valid deal was signed .
supplies have been halted since wednesday , jan 7 . medvedev had urged eu officials to pressure ukraine into withdrawing its so-called declaration that it issued to accompany the agreement . the european commission says the declaration would not have changed the deal , but lavrov told medvedev that the copy of the deal russia had received contained ukraine 's stipulation that it was only valid along with the declaration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko , left , and putin , right , were contacted by the eu 's head commissioner sunday putin had proposed to european commission president jose manuel barroso that russian and eu officials meet in brussels on monday for talks over the gas row , a russian government source told reuters . putin told barroso over the phone that additions made by ukraine to an agreement on the monitoring of gas transit were " unacceptable . "
the russian leader proposed the brussels meeting to seek a solution , the source said . dw staff -lrb- dfm / jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the strict rules are meant to underpin the common currency and keep it stable . the newsmagazine der spiegel offered a smaller figure for the supplementary budget : 20 billion euros . merkel declined saturday to predict how much new borrowing would be needed . asked if germany would meet the maastricht criteria in the next few years , she said , " it would be irresponsible to set absolute figures .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 12.01.2009 german leaders hammer out details of stimulus package großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with key issues still to hash out , the talks are set to last late into the night senior members of german chancellor angela merkel 's coalition are meeting monday to work out the last details of a second stimulus plan worth up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- .
but can they put partisanship aside ? merkel 's coalition of her conservative cdu and the left of center spd have agreed on the broad make-up of germany 's second economic rescue package , but the devil may prove to be in the details , particularly when it comes to the issue of tax cuts .
before monday 's talks , coalition sources said the partners were ready to agree on issues including investing in infrastructure projects and schools .
but some experts have warned that the planned tax cuts could push germany 's deficit back above eu limits .
the two sides seem likely to agree on an increase in the annual tax-free amount for workers from 7,664 euros to 8,000 euros .
additionally , the social democrats want to cut the basic tax rate to 12 percent from 15 percent , a move sharply rejected by the conservatives .
economy minister michael glos of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , said the proposal was " not sensible , " while another senior cdu official said it stood " no chance " of being passed .
the spd has rejected a demand from the conservative camp to lower tax rates for low and medium-income earners .
it says it wants to raise taxes for top earners , but that 's an idea merkel has rejected as sending the wrong signal at a time of crisis .
political considerations in forefront bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making political gains : angela merkel the coalition parties are trying to stave off what could be germany 's worst recession in the post-war years , but given the general elections taking place in september , they 're also trying to win points with the electorate .
some analysts have worried that a focus on partisanship could prevent the coalition from doing what 's best for the country .
" i see the risk that this package has been designed more from the point of view of what is politically expedient than from the point of view of what is economically needed , " thomas mayer , chief european economist at deutsche bank told reuters news agency .
" from what i see so far , the three key tests that anti-cyclical fiscal policy should normally meet - timely , temporary and targeted - are unlikely to be met by this package . "
analysts agree that whatever the outcome of the second stimulus package , merkel is likely to reap the most political capital from the deal .
" the bottom line is that merkel will benefit the most , " manfred guellner , managing director of the forsa polling company told bloomberg .
" merkel is very cleverly giving people the feeling she 's helping them , not companies . "
merkel 's rival for the office of chancellor in september is foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- spd -rrb- .
while popular with germans , analysts agree he faces a considerable hurdle as economic policy is not his main area of expertise . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the document has been finally signed , " medvedev said at a news conference in brussels .
" if everything goes without problem , most likely in the nearest future we will start pumping the first quantities of gas , " he said .
european union energy ministers had convened an emergency meeting in the morning for russia to resume gas supplies to europe , since all of the conditions set by moscow had been fulfilled .
the talks were designed to shape " concrete measures " needed by the bloc to deal with the gas shortages , provoked by russia blocking all supplies destined for europe via ukrainian pipelines .
strengthening solidarity among eu energy ministers improving the efficiency of the bloc 's energy market was also on the agenda , as well as ways of strengthening solidarity between member states in the face of future crises , the czech presidency said .

the czech eu presidency will also be called upon to mediate in a brewing row between slovakia and its neighbor , austria .
austrian furor over re-launch of slovakian nuclear reactor bratislava has infuriated vienna by deciding to make up for its shortages by re-opening its soviet-era bohunice nuclear power plant complex , which it had to shut down for security reasons as part of the conditions set for it to join the bloc in 2004 .
" shutting off the plant was one of the fundamental conditions fo -lrb- slovakia 's entry into the eu -rrb- , and it can not simply be cancelled now , " austrian environment minister nikolaus berlakovich said over the weekend .
the eu 's top energy official , andris piebalgs , said the european commission is willing to discuss the matter .
european households without heating the weeks-long gas dispute between russia and ukraine has already left hundreds of thousands of people in central and southern europe without heating in one of the coldest winters in decades .
the eu had worked hard to try and break the stalemate by sending a monitoring mission to kiev tasked with ensuring that no gas bound to europe is siphoned off by ukraine , as alleged by moscow .
eu ministers were also expected to focus on the need for the bloc to develop alternative energy supplies , both by building pipelines to bypass ukraine and russia and by turning to other technologies , such as solar , wind and wave power .
" all european member states must do their bit so that more sources -lrb- of energy -rrb- are opened up and delivery routes created , " peter hintze , a top official from the german economics ministry , said in brussels . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the strict rules are meant to underpin the common currency and keep it stable . the newsmagazine der spiegel offered a smaller figure for the supplementary budget : 20 billion euros . merkel declined saturday to predict how much new borrowing would be needed . asked if germany would meet the maastricht criteria in the next few years , she said , " it would be irresponsible to set absolute figures .

" " we have a situation in which not only is iran exporting terrorism through hamas , through hezbollah , but they are pursuing a nuclear weapon that could potentially trigger a nuclear arms race in the middle east , " obama said . obama has previously expressed his willingness to conduct more direct diplomacy with iran , a change from the bush administration 's refusal to negotiate directly until the islamic republic stops enriching uranium , a process that can produce weapons-grade bomb fuel .
tehran insists its enrichment activities are for civilian use only and asserts its natural right to do so . " we are going to have to take a new approach , " obama said .
" the international community is going to be taking cues from us in how we want to approach iran . " despite the new course however , obama has refused to rule out military action to stop iran acquiring a nuclear weapon . obama said he intended to send a signal that " we respect the aspirations of the iranian people , but that we also have certain expectations in terms of how an international actor behaves .

austria has urged the eu to take action against its neighbor . slovakia , which depends on russia for almost all of its natural gas that run through ukrainian pipelines , will re-start a controversial nuclear reactor to cope with a potential shortage caused by the energy dispute between moscow and kiev .
officials fear that the gas supply could fall to such a low level that it would soon be impossible to heat slovak households during an unusually cold winter with sub-freezing winter temperatures .
the bohunice plant , which is located a short distance from bratislava , consists of five soviet-type reactors , which have been decommissioned under the terms of slovakia accession to the eu back in 2004 .
violating eu pledge to avoid blackout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hazardous soviet-type reactor was shut down in slovakia 30 years ago the slovak government has justified violating its pledge to brussels in order to avoid a possible blackout during the gas crisis .
at a special cabinet meeting over the weekend , slovakia 's prime minister robert fico announced that his country would now restart the reactor , which should be up and running by the end of the week .
fico told reporters that reneging on the terms of its eu membership was better than taking the risk that his country 's electricity grid would collapse .
" we are facing a blackout here , therefore we have to act fast , " said fico , adding that the government would shut the reactor down again " as soon as the situation is stabilized . "
neighboring austria blasts slovakia the last reactor was shut down only a few weeks ago and the decision to re-launch it is likely to draw protests from neighboring austria , which has campaigned for decades against the hazards of old soviet style nuclear plants of its former communist bloc neighbors . one reactor that caused a major accident in 1977 led to its shutdown two years later .
" we can not accept the re-opening of this unsafe reactor at bohunice , " austrian environment minister nikolaus berlakovich said in a statement .
" in a community , agreements must be respected .
the -lrb- plant 's -rrb- shutdown was a key condition -lrb- to slovakia 's entry into the eu -rrb- for us and ca n't just be erased , " he added .
" now it 's up to the european commission to strongly urge compliance with the accession agreement . "
the nuclear issue has even united all of austria 's opposition parties making political bedfellows of two far-right parties and the environmental greens , who have slammed slovakia , arguing that bohunice was " one of the three most dangerous nuclear plants in europe " .
opposition leaders are urging the austrian government and the eu to take legal and diplomatic measures against slovakia .
eu under czech leadership sympathetic to slovakia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague , which holds the eu presidency , defended slovakia in brussels , the european commission said there was " no legal basis " for the nuclear re-launch , but conceded that slovakia had a " real problem " with the gas shortage .
the czech republic , which was the other half of the former czechoslovakia and just kicked off its current six month eu presidency , was even more sympathetic to slovakia 's plight .
czech prime minister mirek topolanek rejected all criticism on sunday , pointing out the shortcomings of the eu 's energy and security policies .
" at the moment , i take it rather as a demonstration of -lrb- fico 's -rrb- readiness to tackle an issue that the european union can not resolve for slovakia - a looming blackout , " he said in prague . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

violating eu pledge to avoid blackout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hazardous soviet-type reactor was shut down in slovakia 30 years ago the slovak government has justified violating its pledge to brussels in order to avoid a possible blackout during the gas crisis .
at a special cabinet meeting over the weekend , slovakia 's prime minister robert fico announced that his country would now restart the reactor , which should be up and running by the end of the week .
fico told reporters that reneging on the terms of its eu membership was better than taking the risk that his country 's electricity grid would collapse .
" we are facing a blackout here , therefore we have to act fast , " said fico , adding that the government would shut the reactor down again " as soon as the situation is stabilized . "
neighboring austria blasts slovakia the last reactor was shut down only a few weeks ago and the decision to re-launch it is likely to draw protests from neighboring austria , which has campaigned for decades against the hazards of old soviet style nuclear plants of its former communist bloc neighbors . one reactor that caused a major accident in 1977 led to its shutdown two years later .
" we can not accept the re-opening of this unsafe reactor at bohunice , " austrian environment minister nikolaus berlakovich said in a statement .
" in a community , agreements must be respected .
the -lrb- plant 's -rrb- shutdown was a key condition -lrb- to slovakia 's entry into the eu -rrb- for us and ca n't just be erased , " he added .
" now it 's up to the european commission to strongly urge compliance with the accession agreement . "
the nuclear issue has even united all of austria 's opposition parties making political bedfellows of two far-right parties and the environmental greens , who have slammed slovakia , arguing that bohunice was " one of the three most dangerous nuclear plants in europe " .
opposition leaders are urging the austrian government and the eu to take legal and diplomatic measures against slovakia .
eu under czech leadership sympathetic to slovakia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague , which holds the eu presidency , defended slovakia in brussels , the european commission said there was " no legal basis " for the nuclear re-launch , but conceded that slovakia had a " real problem " with the gas shortage .
the czech republic , which was the other half of the former czechoslovakia and just kicked off its current six month eu presidency , was even more sympathetic to slovakia 's plight .
czech prime minister mirek topolanek rejected all criticism on sunday , pointing out the shortcomings of the eu 's energy and security policies .
" at the moment , i take it rather as a demonstration of -lrb- fico 's -rrb- readiness to tackle an issue that the european union can not resolve for slovakia - a looming blackout , " he said in prague . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european union energy ministers had convened an emergency meeting in the morning for russia to resume gas supplies to europe , since all of the conditions set by moscow had been fulfilled .
the talks were designed to shape " concrete measures " needed by the bloc to deal with the gas shortages , provoked by russia blocking all supplies destined for europe via ukrainian pipelines .

european union energy ministers had convened an emergency meeting in the morning for russia to resume gas supplies to europe , since all of the conditions set by moscow had been fulfilled .
the talks were designed to shape " concrete measures " needed by the bloc to deal with the gas shortages , provoked by russia blocking all supplies destined for europe via ukrainian pipelines .

shifts are being cut to three or four days a week for 30,000 workers at core manufacturing sites in the company 's home town of stuttgart and its main plant in the suburb of sindelfingen alone .

ceo zetsche expects recovery for second half of 2009 . german car manufacturer daimler introduced reduced working hours monday for employees at factories across germany .
shifts are being cut to three or four days a week for 30,000 workers at core manufacturing sites in the company 's home town of stuttgart and its main plant in the suburb of sindelfingen alone .
until sunday , many daimler plants had been closed since mid-december for an extended winter break .
the measures , set to last until the end of march , will also affect operations in berlin and the towns of rastatt and ludwigsfelde .
workers are to receive reduced pay and government welfare benefits for the days when they are idle .
most german carmakers , like their counterparts elsewhere , are reeling under the effects of the economic crisis and have been forced to slash production to offset a fall in consumer demand .
speaking sunday at the detroit motor show , the chief executive of daimler , dieter zetsche , said the consequences of the financial crisis had been underestimated in the car industry .
however he was cautiously optimistic for the remainder of 2009 , saying it was conceivable that global demand would recover in the second half of the year .
in 2008 daimler saw sales of its flagship brand mercedes-benz drop 5.4 percent .
new car sales in germany fell by almost two per cent in 2008 , to 3.09 million new registrations .

" we speculated that genes that are expressed in a mycn dependent manner might be required specifically for the growth of mycn-amplified neuroblastomas and that mycn-amplified neuroblastomas might depend not only on n-myc itself , but also on upstream regulatory factors or downstream target genes , " explained senior study author , dr. martin eilers , from the university of wuerzburg . hope for new treatments dr. eilers and colleagues performed a genetic screen of nearly 200 genes that are dependent on amplified mycn in human neuroblastoma or are direct targets of myc . " our results show that stabilization of n-myc is a critical oncogenic function of aurora a in childhood neuroblastoma ; the challenge will now be to find ways to interfere with this function in order to find new approaches for the therapy of these tumours , " said dr. eilers .

but can they put partisanship aside ? merkel 's coalition of her conservative cdu and the left of center spd have agreed on the broad make-up of germany 's second economic rescue package , but the devil may prove to be in the details , particularly when it comes to the issue of tax cuts .
before monday 's talks , coalition sources said the partners were ready to agree on issues including investing in infrastructure projects and schools .
but some experts have warned that the planned tax cuts could push germany 's deficit back above eu limits .
the two sides seem likely to agree on an increase in the annual tax-free amount for workers from 7,664 euros to 8,000 euros .
additionally , the social democrats want to cut the basic tax rate to 12 percent from 15 percent , a move sharply rejected by the conservatives .
economy minister michael glos of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , said the proposal was " not sensible , " while another senior cdu official said it stood " no chance " of being passed .
the spd has rejected a demand from the conservative camp to lower tax rates for low and medium-income earners .
it says it wants to raise taxes for top earners , but that 's an idea merkel has rejected as sending the wrong signal at a time of crisis .

some analysts have worried that a focus on partisanship could prevent the coalition from doing what 's best for the country .
" i see the risk that this package has been designed more from the point of view of what is politically expedient than from the point of view of what is economically needed , " thomas mayer , chief european economist at deutsche bank told reuters news agency .
" from what i see so far , the three key tests that anti-cyclical fiscal policy should normally meet - timely , temporary and targeted - are unlikely to be met by this package . "
analysts agree that whatever the outcome of the second stimulus package , merkel is likely to reap the most political capital from the deal .
" the bottom line is that merkel will benefit the most , " manfred guellner , managing director of the forsa polling company told bloomberg .
" merkel is very cleverly giving people the feeling she 's helping them , not companies . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.01.2009 a toast to communist champagne , germany 's favorite drink großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rotkaeppchen did more than just survive the reunification barely a handful of east german products were able to hold their own after reunification .
one that did was rotkaeppchen sparkling wine .
the company even managed to buy out western rivals and today it 's a market leader . it came as no surprise that east germans wasted little time trading in the brands they had grown up with for the west germans products they had believed would remain out of their reach forever . perhaps it is more surprising that any east german products survived at all .
but in fact , quite a few did , from the florena cosmetics label , now owned by beiersdorf , to spee laundry detergent , which was bought up henkel . one even went on to become not only a favorite among nostalgic east germans - it also swallowed its rivals and spat them out like a corked wine .
today , rotkaeppchen sparkling wine is germany ’ s market leader . the dry spell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the company was founded over 150 years ago the company 's meteoric success is one of the quirkier outcomes of reunification .
the rotkaeppchen - little red riding hood - wine cellar first opened in freyburg an der unstrut , south of leipzig , in 1856 , and today the 650-hectare vineyard is one of the smallest in germany .
but only a fraction of the grapes that go into the sparking wine are grown here , while the rest come from france , italy , spain and western germany . the company was turned into a collective during the communist era , producing 15 million bottles of bubbly a year . for a brief interlude after the fall of the berlin wall , east germans drunk on the temptations of capitalism spurned rotkaeppchen in favor of more glamorous western labels , and for a while the company floundered .
in 1991 , only 2.9 million of the red-topped green bottles were sold . the management buyout but its fortunes changed in 1993 when gunter heise , the company 's technical director , decided to take matters in to his own hands .
in a management buyout , he and four of his colleagues took over the malingering business from the trust created in 1990 to privatize the east german enterprises owned as public property . entrepreneur harald eckes-chantre and his family footed the lion 's share of the bill , while the five company employees put up the rest .
today , the eckes-chantre family still owns more than 50 percent of the company , while the rest belongs to heise and three of the original investors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sparkling wine got its name from little red riding hood herself in 1994 , the team began their efforts to break in to the western german market . they were so successful that by 2000 , sales of 50 millions bottles a year made the company germany 's number one sparkling wine maker . world domination by 2002 , heise and co. were feeling confident enough to take over their hessen-based rivals mumm , jules mumm and mm extra from canadian drinks manufacturer seagram .
one year later , they snapped up the small but upmarket geldermann company from bavaria . by 2007 , rotkaeppchen reportedly owned nearly 40 percent of the german sparkling wine market . the second-largest share is owned by spanish company freixenet , with a mere 17 percent - although freixenet leads on the international market .
rotkaeppchen , nonetheless , occupies an admirable second place . liquored-up the latest addition to the rotkaeppchen empire was made in late 2006 , when the company bought the western german liquor manufacturer eckes spirituosen & wein , which makes chantre and mariacron brandy , eckes cherry liqueur and nordhaeuser schnapps . the acquisition shot the company to the top of the german liquor market . 2007 was the company 's most profitable year ever with sales up by 10.5 percent .
a total of 186 million bottles were sold , with sales of sparkling wine , the company 's main product , up by 12.6 percent since the previous year .
at 709.5 million euros , turnover grew by 8.9 percent since 2006 . communist chic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rotkaeppchen ceo gunter heise re-enacts the brand 's television commercial joachim schuetz is ceo of markenverband , the german brands association , which numbers rotkaeppchen among its members . he says the company 's owes its success to its change of strategy in 1993 . " after the management buy-out , the company chose to promote rotkaeppchen as a pan-german brand , " he said .
even though it was known as a quintessentially east german brand , it had wider potential and its new owners made the most of the opportunity . " they were successful because they acted fast , " said schuetz . nonetheless , at a time when nostalgia for east german culture and kitsch shows no signs of abating , its image as communist champagne has by no means damaged rotkaeppchen 's reputation . the company itself insists it has never deliberately tried to milk this trend .
in fact , it sees the association has something of a hangover it ca n't shake . " we would rather shed the east german connection entirely , " said a company spokesperson . management actually refuses requests from journalists wanting to report on the company as a specifically east german success story . " our gdr past was only one chapter in our history , " said the company .
" we would rather concentrate on the future . " sales suggest that this approach seems to work . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 12.01.2009 slovakia re-starts nuclear reactor to avoid blackout großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the energy dispute could make gas levels go under the level needed to heat households by re-launching a reactor that it recently shut down , slovakia has violated a pledge to the eu to decommission its soviet-designed nuclear plants .
austria has urged the eu to take action against its neighbor . slovakia , which depends on russia for almost all of its natural gas that run through ukrainian pipelines , will re-start a controversial nuclear reactor to cope with a potential shortage caused by the energy dispute between moscow and kiev .
officials fear that the gas supply could fall to such a low level that it would soon be impossible to heat slovak households during an unusually cold winter with sub-freezing winter temperatures .
the bohunice plant , which is located a short distance from bratislava , consists of five soviet-type reactors , which have been decommissioned under the terms of slovakia accession to the eu back in 2004 .
violating eu pledge to avoid blackout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hazardous soviet-type reactor was shut down in slovakia 30 years ago the slovak government has justified violating its pledge to brussels in order to avoid a possible blackout during the gas crisis .
at a special cabinet meeting over the weekend , slovakia 's prime minister robert fico announced that his country would now restart the reactor , which should be up and running by the end of the week .
fico told reporters that reneging on the terms of its eu membership was better than taking the risk that his country 's electricity grid would collapse .
" we are facing a blackout here , therefore we have to act fast , " said fico , adding that the government would shut the reactor down again " as soon as the situation is stabilized . "
neighboring austria blasts slovakia the last reactor was shut down only a few weeks ago and the decision to re-launch it is likely to draw protests from neighboring austria , which has campaigned for decades against the hazards of old soviet style nuclear plants of its former communist bloc neighbors . one reactor that caused a major accident in 1977 led to its shutdown two years later .
" we can not accept the re-opening of this unsafe reactor at bohunice , " austrian environment minister nikolaus berlakovich said in a statement .
" in a community , agreements must be respected .
the -lrb- plant 's -rrb- shutdown was a key condition -lrb- to slovakia 's entry into the eu -rrb- for us and ca n't just be erased , " he added .
" now it 's up to the european commission to strongly urge compliance with the accession agreement . "
the nuclear issue has even united all of austria 's opposition parties making political bedfellows of two far-right parties and the environmental greens , who have slammed slovakia , arguing that bohunice was " one of the three most dangerous nuclear plants in europe " .
opposition leaders are urging the austrian government and the eu to take legal and diplomatic measures against slovakia .
eu under czech leadership sympathetic to slovakia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague , which holds the eu presidency , defended slovakia in brussels , the european commission said there was " no legal basis " for the nuclear re-launch , but conceded that slovakia had a " real problem " with the gas shortage .
the czech republic , which was the other half of the former czechoslovakia and just kicked off its current six month eu presidency , was even more sympathetic to slovakia 's plight .
czech prime minister mirek topolanek rejected all criticism on sunday , pointing out the shortcomings of the eu 's energy and security policies .
" at the moment , i take it rather as a demonstration of -lrb- fico 's -rrb- readiness to tackle an issue that the european union can not resolve for slovakia - a looming blackout , " he said in prague . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the internet method is soothing for many victims because they do not have to speak to anyone specific or sit opposite someone , " said christine knaevelsrud , a psychologist at berlin 's center for the treatment of torture victims -lrb- bzfo -rrb- the free service , called interapy , consists of three stages .
first , victims must write four e-mails detailing what they saw and felt during their ordeal . next , the individual must write four letters to an imaginary friend who has experienced the same trauma - this helps the victim rid themselves of any feelings of guilt associated with their suffering . finally , the patient is encouraged to write a further two letters , one to him- or herself and the other to the perpetrator of the wrongdoing .
this step helps the victim say " you no longer have a role in my life . " " some victims have been raped , some kidnapped , " knaevelsrud said .
" others have been maltreated during arrests or have seen mutilated bodies . " around 250 victims - mostly from iraq , but also from sudan , syria , or palestinian regions - have used the online service . the web-based therapy was created to fill a massive hole in the availability of psychological treatment in iraq 's more dangerous southern provinces . the bzfo currently has a therapy center in kirkuk , in northern iraq , and has plans to set up two more clinics for traumatized iraqis in the middle east country . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the internet method is soothing for many victims because they do not have to speak to anyone specific or sit opposite someone , " said christine knaevelsrud , a psychologist at berlin 's center for the treatment of torture victims -lrb- bzfo -rrb- the free service , called interapy , consists of three stages .
first , victims must write four e-mails detailing what they saw and felt during their ordeal . next , the individual must write four letters to an imaginary friend who has experienced the same trauma - this helps the victim rid themselves of any feelings of guilt associated with their suffering . finally , the patient is encouraged to write a further two letters , one to him- or herself and the other to the perpetrator of the wrongdoing .
this step helps the victim say " you no longer have a role in my life . " " some victims have been raped , some kidnapped , " knaevelsrud said .
" others have been maltreated during arrests or have seen mutilated bodies . " around 250 victims - mostly from iraq , but also from sudan , syria , or palestinian regions - have used the online service . the web-based therapy was created to fill a massive hole in the availability of psychological treatment in iraq 's more dangerous southern provinces . the bzfo currently has a therapy center in kirkuk , in northern iraq , and has plans to set up two more clinics for traumatized iraqis in the middle east country . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but can they put partisanship aside ? merkel 's coalition of her conservative cdu and the left of center spd have agreed on the broad make-up of germany 's second economic rescue package , but the devil may prove to be in the details , particularly when it comes to the issue of tax cuts .
before monday 's talks , coalition sources said the partners were ready to agree on issues including investing in infrastructure projects and schools .
but some experts have warned that the planned tax cuts could push germany 's deficit back above eu limits .
the two sides seem likely to agree on an increase in the annual tax-free amount for workers from 7,664 euros to 8,000 euros .
additionally , the social democrats want to cut the basic tax rate to 12 percent from 15 percent , a move sharply rejected by the conservatives .
economy minister michael glos of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , said the proposal was " not sensible , " while another senior cdu official said it stood " no chance " of being passed .
the spd has rejected a demand from the conservative camp to lower tax rates for low and medium-income earners .
it says it wants to raise taxes for top earners , but that 's an idea merkel has rejected as sending the wrong signal at a time of crisis .
political considerations in forefront bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making political gains : angela merkel the coalition parties are trying to stave off what could be germany 's worst recession in the post-war years , but given the general elections taking place in september , they 're also trying to win points with the electorate .
some analysts have worried that a focus on partisanship could prevent the coalition from doing what 's best for the country .
" i see the risk that this package has been designed more from the point of view of what is politically expedient than from the point of view of what is economically needed , " thomas mayer , chief european economist at deutsche bank told reuters news agency .
" from what i see so far , the three key tests that anti-cyclical fiscal policy should normally meet - timely , temporary and targeted - are unlikely to be met by this package . "
analysts agree that whatever the outcome of the second stimulus package , merkel is likely to reap the most political capital from the deal .
" the bottom line is that merkel will benefit the most , " manfred guellner , managing director of the forsa polling company told bloomberg .
" merkel is very cleverly giving people the feeling she 's helping them , not companies . "

11 . russian president dmitry medvedev earlier sunday had rescinded the eu-brokered accord , citing changes by ukraine . he said russia objected to handwritten text added to the formal agreement by the ukrainian side , calling it a " mockery of common sense . " the extra declaration , which was seen by reuters , asserted that ukraine had not siphoned off transit gas and that it had no outstanding debts to gazprom .
that is the issue that stands at the center of the dispute . " i think that those who have signed this document with reservations well understand the legal consequences of their actions , " he told foreign minister sergei lavrov in a televised discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dmitry medvedev , left , meeting foreign minister sergey lavrov on sunday , jan .
11 " as a result , we are obliged to consider the document signed as null and void for us .
we will not apply it as long as this reserve is not overturned , " he added . putin charged that the ukrainian additions had distorted the meaning of the document originally signed by both parties and introduced issues that were unrelated to the gas dispute . the czech republic 's energy envoy , vaclav bartuska , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said the additional conditions added by ukraine would not have changed the legality of the mandate for the eu observer mission . russian refusal to restart supplies moscow had insisted it would not restart gas supplies to europe until a valid deal was signed .
supplies have been halted since wednesday , jan 7 . medvedev had urged eu officials to pressure ukraine into withdrawing its so-called declaration that it issued to accompany the agreement . the european commission says the declaration would not have changed the deal , but lavrov told medvedev that the copy of the deal russia had received contained ukraine 's stipulation that it was only valid along with the declaration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko , left , and putin , right , were contacted by the eu 's head commissioner sunday putin had proposed to european commission president jose manuel barroso that russian and eu officials meet in brussels on monday for talks over the gas row , a russian government source told reuters . putin told barroso over the phone that additions made by ukraine to an agreement on the monitoring of gas transit were " unacceptable .

the strict rules are meant to underpin the common currency and keep it stable . the newsmagazine der spiegel offered a smaller figure for the supplementary budget : 20 billion euros . merkel declined saturday to predict how much new borrowing would be needed . asked if germany would meet the maastricht criteria in the next few years , she said , " it would be irresponsible to set absolute figures .

austria has urged the eu to take action against its neighbor . slovakia , which depends on russia for almost all of its natural gas that run through ukrainian pipelines , will re-start a controversial nuclear reactor to cope with a potential shortage caused by the energy dispute between moscow and kiev .
officials fear that the gas supply could fall to such a low level that it would soon be impossible to heat slovak households during an unusually cold winter with sub-freezing winter temperatures .
the bohunice plant , which is located a short distance from bratislava , consists of five soviet-type reactors , which have been decommissioned under the terms of slovakia accession to the eu back in 2004 .
violating eu pledge to avoid blackout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hazardous soviet-type reactor was shut down in slovakia 30 years ago the slovak government has justified violating its pledge to brussels in order to avoid a possible blackout during the gas crisis .
at a special cabinet meeting over the weekend , slovakia 's prime minister robert fico announced that his country would now restart the reactor , which should be up and running by the end of the week .
fico told reporters that reneging on the terms of its eu membership was better than taking the risk that his country 's electricity grid would collapse .
" we are facing a blackout here , therefore we have to act fast , " said fico , adding that the government would shut the reactor down again " as soon as the situation is stabilized . "
neighboring austria blasts slovakia the last reactor was shut down only a few weeks ago and the decision to re-launch it is likely to draw protests from neighboring austria , which has campaigned for decades against the hazards of old soviet style nuclear plants of its former communist bloc neighbors . one reactor that caused a major accident in 1977 led to its shutdown two years later .
" we can not accept the re-opening of this unsafe reactor at bohunice , " austrian environment minister nikolaus berlakovich said in a statement .
" in a community , agreements must be respected .
the -lrb- plant 's -rrb- shutdown was a key condition -lrb- to slovakia 's entry into the eu -rrb- for us and ca n't just be erased , " he added .
" now it 's up to the european commission to strongly urge compliance with the accession agreement . "
the nuclear issue has even united all of austria 's opposition parties making political bedfellows of two far-right parties and the environmental greens , who have slammed slovakia , arguing that bohunice was " one of the three most dangerous nuclear plants in europe " .
opposition leaders are urging the austrian government and the eu to take legal and diplomatic measures against slovakia .

the czech republic , which was the other half of the former czechoslovakia and just kicked off its current six month eu presidency , was even more sympathetic to slovakia 's plight .

austria has urged the eu to take action against its neighbor . slovakia , which depends on russia for almost all of its natural gas that run through ukrainian pipelines , will re-start a controversial nuclear reactor to cope with a potential shortage caused by the energy dispute between moscow and kiev .
officials fear that the gas supply could fall to such a low level that it would soon be impossible to heat slovak households during an unusually cold winter with sub-freezing winter temperatures .
the bohunice plant , which is located a short distance from bratislava , consists of five soviet-type reactors , which have been decommissioned under the terms of slovakia accession to the eu back in 2004 .
violating eu pledge to avoid blackout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hazardous soviet-type reactor was shut down in slovakia 30 years ago the slovak government has justified violating its pledge to brussels in order to avoid a possible blackout during the gas crisis .

" the document has been finally signed , " medvedev said at a news conference in brussels .
" if everything goes without problem , most likely in the nearest future we will start pumping the first quantities of gas , " he said .
european union energy ministers had convened an emergency meeting in the morning for russia to resume gas supplies to europe , since all of the conditions set by moscow had been fulfilled .
the talks were designed to shape " concrete measures " needed by the bloc to deal with the gas shortages , provoked by russia blocking all supplies destined for europe via ukrainian pipelines .
strengthening solidarity among eu energy ministers improving the efficiency of the bloc 's energy market was also on the agenda , as well as ways of strengthening solidarity between member states in the face of future crises , the czech presidency said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans are looking to other energy sources to reduce their dependance on russian gas at the moment , hungary is supplying some of its gas to eu hopeful serbia , while poland is sending trucks loaded with gas to slovakia .
the czech eu presidency will also be called upon to mediate in a brewing row between slovakia and its neighbor , austria .
austrian furor over re-launch of slovakian nuclear reactor bratislava has infuriated vienna by deciding to make up for its shortages by re-opening its soviet-era bohunice nuclear power plant complex , which it had to shut down for security reasons as part of the conditions set for it to join the bloc in 2004 .
" shutting off the plant was one of the fundamental conditions fo -lrb- slovakia 's entry into the eu -rrb- , and it can not simply be cancelled now , " austrian environment minister nikolaus berlakovich said over the weekend .
the eu 's top energy official , andris piebalgs , said the european commission is willing to discuss the matter .
european households without heating the weeks-long gas dispute between russia and ukraine has already left hundreds of thousands of people in central and southern europe without heating in one of the coldest winters in decades .
the eu had worked hard to try and break the stalemate by sending a monitoring mission to kiev tasked with ensuring that no gas bound to europe is siphoned off by ukraine , as alleged by moscow .
eu ministers were also expected to focus on the need for the bloc to develop alternative energy supplies , both by building pipelines to bypass ukraine and russia and by turning to other technologies , such as solar , wind and wave power .
" all european member states must do their bit so that more sources -lrb- of energy -rrb- are opened up and delivery routes created , " peter hintze , a top official from the german economics ministry , said in brussels . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

11 . russian president dmitry medvedev earlier sunday had rescinded the eu-brokered accord , citing changes by ukraine . he said russia objected to handwritten text added to the formal agreement by the ukrainian side , calling it a " mockery of common sense . " the extra declaration , which was seen by reuters , asserted that ukraine had not siphoned off transit gas and that it had no outstanding debts to gazprom .
that is the issue that stands at the center of the dispute . " i think that those who have signed this document with reservations well understand the legal consequences of their actions , " he told foreign minister sergei lavrov in a televised discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dmitry medvedev , left , meeting foreign minister sergey lavrov on sunday , jan .
11 " as a result , we are obliged to consider the document signed as null and void for us .
we will not apply it as long as this reserve is not overturned , " he added . putin charged that the ukrainian additions had distorted the meaning of the document originally signed by both parties and introduced issues that were unrelated to the gas dispute . the czech republic 's energy envoy , vaclav bartuska , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said the additional conditions added by ukraine would not have changed the legality of the mandate for the eu observer mission . russian refusal to restart supplies moscow had insisted it would not restart gas supplies to europe until a valid deal was signed .
supplies have been halted since wednesday , jan 7 . medvedev had urged eu officials to pressure ukraine into withdrawing its so-called declaration that it issued to accompany the agreement . the european commission says the declaration would not have changed the deal , but lavrov told medvedev that the copy of the deal russia had received contained ukraine 's stipulation that it was only valid along with the declaration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko , left , and putin , right , were contacted by the eu 's head commissioner sunday putin had proposed to european commission president jose manuel barroso that russian and eu officials meet in brussels on monday for talks over the gas row , a russian government source told reuters . putin told barroso over the phone that additions made by ukraine to an agreement on the monitoring of gas transit were " unacceptable .

european union energy ministers had convened an emergency meeting in the morning for russia to resume gas supplies to europe , since all of the conditions set by moscow had been fulfilled .
the talks were designed to shape " concrete measures " needed by the bloc to deal with the gas shortages , provoked by russia blocking all supplies destined for europe via ukrainian pipelines .

" the document has been finally signed , " medvedev said at a news conference in brussels .
" if everything goes without problem , most likely in the nearest future we will start pumping the first quantities of gas , " he said .
european union energy ministers had convened an emergency meeting in the morning for russia to resume gas supplies to europe , since all of the conditions set by moscow had been fulfilled .
the talks were designed to shape " concrete measures " needed by the bloc to deal with the gas shortages , provoked by russia blocking all supplies destined for europe via ukrainian pipelines .
strengthening solidarity among eu energy ministers improving the efficiency of the bloc 's energy market was also on the agenda , as well as ways of strengthening solidarity between member states in the face of future crises , the czech presidency said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans are looking to other energy sources to reduce their dependance on russian gas at the moment , hungary is supplying some of its gas to eu hopeful serbia , while poland is sending trucks loaded with gas to slovakia .
the czech eu presidency will also be called upon to mediate in a brewing row between slovakia and its neighbor , austria .
austrian furor over re-launch of slovakian nuclear reactor bratislava has infuriated vienna by deciding to make up for its shortages by re-opening its soviet-era bohunice nuclear power plant complex , which it had to shut down for security reasons as part of the conditions set for it to join the bloc in 2004 .
" shutting off the plant was one of the fundamental conditions fo -lrb- slovakia 's entry into the eu -rrb- , and it can not simply be cancelled now , " austrian environment minister nikolaus berlakovich said over the weekend .
the eu 's top energy official , andris piebalgs , said the european commission is willing to discuss the matter .
european households without heating the weeks-long gas dispute between russia and ukraine has already left hundreds of thousands of people in central and southern europe without heating in one of the coldest winters in decades .

11 . russian president dmitry medvedev earlier sunday had rescinded the eu-brokered accord , citing changes by ukraine . he said russia objected to handwritten text added to the formal agreement by the ukrainian side , calling it a " mockery of common sense . " the extra declaration , which was seen by reuters , asserted that ukraine had not siphoned off transit gas and that it had no outstanding debts to gazprom .
that is the issue that stands at the center of the dispute . " i think that those who have signed this document with reservations well understand the legal consequences of their actions , " he told foreign minister sergei lavrov in a televised discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dmitry medvedev , left , meeting foreign minister sergey lavrov on sunday , jan .
11 " as a result , we are obliged to consider the document signed as null and void for us .
we will not apply it as long as this reserve is not overturned , " he added . putin charged that the ukrainian additions had distorted the meaning of the document originally signed by both parties and introduced issues that were unrelated to the gas dispute . the czech republic 's energy envoy , vaclav bartuska , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said the additional conditions added by ukraine would not have changed the legality of the mandate for the eu observer mission . russian refusal to restart supplies moscow had insisted it would not restart gas supplies to europe until a valid deal was signed .
supplies have been halted since wednesday , jan 7 . medvedev had urged eu officials to pressure ukraine into withdrawing its so-called declaration that it issued to accompany the agreement . the european commission says the declaration would not have changed the deal , but lavrov told medvedev that the copy of the deal russia had received contained ukraine 's stipulation that it was only valid along with the declaration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko , left , and putin , right , were contacted by the eu 's head commissioner sunday putin had proposed to european commission president jose manuel barroso that russian and eu officials meet in brussels on monday for talks over the gas row , a russian government source told reuters . putin told barroso over the phone that additions made by ukraine to an agreement on the monitoring of gas transit were " unacceptable .

the strict rules are meant to underpin the common currency and keep it stable . the newsmagazine der spiegel offered a smaller figure for the supplementary budget : 20 billion euros . merkel declined saturday to predict how much new borrowing would be needed . asked if germany would meet the maastricht criteria in the next few years , she said , " it would be irresponsible to set absolute figures .

" the internet method is soothing for many victims because they do not have to speak to anyone specific or sit opposite someone , " said christine knaevelsrud , a psychologist at berlin 's center for the treatment of torture victims -lrb- bzfo -rrb- the free service , called interapy , consists of three stages .
first , victims must write four e-mails detailing what they saw and felt during their ordeal . next , the individual must write four letters to an imaginary friend who has experienced the same trauma - this helps the victim rid themselves of any feelings of guilt associated with their suffering . finally , the patient is encouraged to write a further two letters , one to him- or herself and the other to the perpetrator of the wrongdoing .
this step helps the victim say " you no longer have a role in my life . " " some victims have been raped , some kidnapped , " knaevelsrud said .
" others have been maltreated during arrests or have seen mutilated bodies . " around 250 victims - mostly from iraq , but also from sudan , syria , or palestinian regions - have used the online service . the web-based therapy was created to fill a massive hole in the availability of psychological treatment in iraq 's more dangerous southern provinces . the bzfo currently has a therapy center in kirkuk , in northern iraq , and has plans to set up two more clinics for traumatized iraqis in the middle east country . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ceo zetsche expects recovery for second half of 2009 . german car manufacturer daimler introduced reduced working hours monday for employees at factories across germany .
shifts are being cut to three or four days a week for 30,000 workers at core manufacturing sites in the company 's home town of stuttgart and its main plant in the suburb of sindelfingen alone .
until sunday , many daimler plants had been closed since mid-december for an extended winter break .
the measures , set to last until the end of march , will also affect operations in berlin and the towns of rastatt and ludwigsfelde .
workers are to receive reduced pay and government welfare benefits for the days when they are idle .
most german carmakers , like their counterparts elsewhere , are reeling under the effects of the economic crisis and have been forced to slash production to offset a fall in consumer demand .
speaking sunday at the detroit motor show , the chief executive of daimler , dieter zetsche , said the consequences of the financial crisis had been underestimated in the car industry .
however he was cautiously optimistic for the remainder of 2009 , saying it was conceivable that global demand would recover in the second half of the year .
in 2008 daimler saw sales of its flagship brand mercedes-benz drop 5.4 percent .
new car sales in germany fell by almost two per cent in 2008 , to 3.09 million new registrations .

but can they put partisanship aside ? merkel 's coalition of her conservative cdu and the left of center spd have agreed on the broad make-up of germany 's second economic rescue package , but the devil may prove to be in the details , particularly when it comes to the issue of tax cuts .
before monday 's talks , coalition sources said the partners were ready to agree on issues including investing in infrastructure projects and schools .
but some experts have warned that the planned tax cuts could push germany 's deficit back above eu limits .
the two sides seem likely to agree on an increase in the annual tax-free amount for workers from 7,664 euros to 8,000 euros .
additionally , the social democrats want to cut the basic tax rate to 12 percent from 15 percent , a move sharply rejected by the conservatives .
economy minister michael glos of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , said the proposal was " not sensible , " while another senior cdu official said it stood " no chance " of being passed .
the spd has rejected a demand from the conservative camp to lower tax rates for low and medium-income earners .

but can they put partisanship aside ? merkel 's coalition of her conservative cdu and the left of center spd have agreed on the broad make-up of germany 's second economic rescue package , but the devil may prove to be in the details , particularly when it comes to the issue of tax cuts .
before monday 's talks , coalition sources said the partners were ready to agree on issues including investing in infrastructure projects and schools .

the two sides seem likely to agree on an increase in the annual tax-free amount for workers from 7,664 euros to 8,000 euros .

first , victims must write four e-mails detailing what they saw and felt during their ordeal . next , the individual must write four letters to an imaginary friend who has experienced the same trauma - this helps the victim rid themselves of any feelings of guilt associated with their suffering . finally , the patient is encouraged to write a further two letters , one to him- or herself and the other to the perpetrator of the wrongdoing .
this step helps the victim say " you no longer have a role in my life . " " some victims have been raped , some kidnapped , " knaevelsrud said .
" others have been maltreated during arrests or have seen mutilated bodies . " around 250 victims - mostly from iraq , but also from sudan , syria , or palestinian regions - have used the online service . the web-based therapy was created to fill a massive hole in the availability of psychological treatment in iraq 's more dangerous southern provinces . the bzfo currently has a therapy center in kirkuk , in northern iraq , and has plans to set up two more clinics for traumatized iraqis in the middle east country . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the document has been finally signed , " medvedev said at a news conference in brussels .
" if everything goes without problem , most likely in the nearest future we will start pumping the first quantities of gas , " he said .
european union energy ministers had convened an emergency meeting in the morning for russia to resume gas supplies to europe , since all of the conditions set by moscow had been fulfilled .
the talks were designed to shape " concrete measures " needed by the bloc to deal with the gas shortages , provoked by russia blocking all supplies destined for europe via ukrainian pipelines .
strengthening solidarity among eu energy ministers improving the efficiency of the bloc 's energy market was also on the agenda , as well as ways of strengthening solidarity between member states in the face of future crises , the czech presidency said .

the czech eu presidency will also be called upon to mediate in a brewing row between slovakia and its neighbor , austria .
austrian furor over re-launch of slovakian nuclear reactor bratislava has infuriated vienna by deciding to make up for its shortages by re-opening its soviet-era bohunice nuclear power plant complex , which it had to shut down for security reasons as part of the conditions set for it to join the bloc in 2004 .
" shutting off the plant was one of the fundamental conditions fo -lrb- slovakia 's entry into the eu -rrb- , and it can not simply be cancelled now , " austrian environment minister nikolaus berlakovich said over the weekend .
the eu 's top energy official , andris piebalgs , said the european commission is willing to discuss the matter .
european households without heating the weeks-long gas dispute between russia and ukraine has already left hundreds of thousands of people in central and southern europe without heating in one of the coldest winters in decades .
the eu had worked hard to try and break the stalemate by sending a monitoring mission to kiev tasked with ensuring that no gas bound to europe is siphoned off by ukraine , as alleged by moscow .
eu ministers were also expected to focus on the need for the bloc to develop alternative energy supplies , both by building pipelines to bypass ukraine and russia and by turning to other technologies , such as solar , wind and wave power .
" all european member states must do their bit so that more sources -lrb- of energy -rrb- are opened up and delivery routes created , " peter hintze , a top official from the german economics ministry , said in brussels . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ceo zetsche expects recovery for second half of 2009 . german car manufacturer daimler introduced reduced working hours monday for employees at factories across germany .
shifts are being cut to three or four days a week for 30,000 workers at core manufacturing sites in the company 's home town of stuttgart and its main plant in the suburb of sindelfingen alone .
until sunday , many daimler plants had been closed since mid-december for an extended winter break .
the measures , set to last until the end of march , will also affect operations in berlin and the towns of rastatt and ludwigsfelde .
workers are to receive reduced pay and government welfare benefits for the days when they are idle .
most german carmakers , like their counterparts elsewhere , are reeling under the effects of the economic crisis and have been forced to slash production to offset a fall in consumer demand .
speaking sunday at the detroit motor show , the chief executive of daimler , dieter zetsche , said the consequences of the financial crisis had been underestimated in the car industry .
however he was cautiously optimistic for the remainder of 2009 , saying it was conceivable that global demand would recover in the second half of the year .
in 2008 daimler saw sales of its flagship brand mercedes-benz drop 5.4 percent .
new car sales in germany fell by almost two per cent in 2008 , to 3.09 million new registrations .

11 . russian president dmitry medvedev earlier sunday had rescinded the eu-brokered accord , citing changes by ukraine . he said russia objected to handwritten text added to the formal agreement by the ukrainian side , calling it a " mockery of common sense . " the extra declaration , which was seen by reuters , asserted that ukraine had not siphoned off transit gas and that it had no outstanding debts to gazprom .
that is the issue that stands at the center of the dispute . " i think that those who have signed this document with reservations well understand the legal consequences of their actions , " he told foreign minister sergei lavrov in a televised discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dmitry medvedev , left , meeting foreign minister sergey lavrov on sunday , jan .
11 " as a result , we are obliged to consider the document signed as null and void for us .
we will not apply it as long as this reserve is not overturned , " he added . putin charged that the ukrainian additions had distorted the meaning of the document originally signed by both parties and introduced issues that were unrelated to the gas dispute . the czech republic 's energy envoy , vaclav bartuska , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said the additional conditions added by ukraine would not have changed the legality of the mandate for the eu observer mission . russian refusal to restart supplies moscow had insisted it would not restart gas supplies to europe until a valid deal was signed .

" the document has been finally signed , " medvedev said at a news conference in brussels .
" if everything goes without problem , most likely in the nearest future we will start pumping the first quantities of gas , " he said .
european union energy ministers had convened an emergency meeting in the morning for russia to resume gas supplies to europe , since all of the conditions set by moscow had been fulfilled .
the talks were designed to shape " concrete measures " needed by the bloc to deal with the gas shortages , provoked by russia blocking all supplies destined for europe via ukrainian pipelines .
strengthening solidarity among eu energy ministers improving the efficiency of the bloc 's energy market was also on the agenda , as well as ways of strengthening solidarity between member states in the face of future crises , the czech presidency said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans are looking to other energy sources to reduce their dependance on russian gas at the moment , hungary is supplying some of its gas to eu hopeful serbia , while poland is sending trucks loaded with gas to slovakia .
the czech eu presidency will also be called upon to mediate in a brewing row between slovakia and its neighbor , austria .
austrian furor over re-launch of slovakian nuclear reactor bratislava has infuriated vienna by deciding to make up for its shortages by re-opening its soviet-era bohunice nuclear power plant complex , which it had to shut down for security reasons as part of the conditions set for it to join the bloc in 2004 .
" shutting off the plant was one of the fundamental conditions fo -lrb- slovakia 's entry into the eu -rrb- , and it can not simply be cancelled now , " austrian environment minister nikolaus berlakovich said over the weekend .
the eu 's top energy official , andris piebalgs , said the european commission is willing to discuss the matter .
european households without heating the weeks-long gas dispute between russia and ukraine has already left hundreds of thousands of people in central and southern europe without heating in one of the coldest winters in decades .
the eu had worked hard to try and break the stalemate by sending a monitoring mission to kiev tasked with ensuring that no gas bound to europe is siphoned off by ukraine , as alleged by moscow .
eu ministers were also expected to focus on the need for the bloc to develop alternative energy supplies , both by building pipelines to bypass ukraine and russia and by turning to other technologies , such as solar , wind and wave power .
" all european member states must do their bit so that more sources -lrb- of energy -rrb- are opened up and delivery routes created , " peter hintze , a top official from the german economics ministry , said in brussels . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 12.01.2009 slovakia re-starts nuclear reactor to avoid blackout großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the energy dispute could make gas levels go under the level needed to heat households by re-launching a reactor that it recently shut down , slovakia has violated a pledge to the eu to decommission its soviet-designed nuclear plants .
austria has urged the eu to take action against its neighbor . slovakia , which depends on russia for almost all of its natural gas that run through ukrainian pipelines , will re-start a controversial nuclear reactor to cope with a potential shortage caused by the energy dispute between moscow and kiev .
officials fear that the gas supply could fall to such a low level that it would soon be impossible to heat slovak households during an unusually cold winter with sub-freezing winter temperatures .
the bohunice plant , which is located a short distance from bratislava , consists of five soviet-type reactors , which have been decommissioned under the terms of slovakia accession to the eu back in 2004 .
violating eu pledge to avoid blackout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hazardous soviet-type reactor was shut down in slovakia 30 years ago the slovak government has justified violating its pledge to brussels in order to avoid a possible blackout during the gas crisis .
at a special cabinet meeting over the weekend , slovakia 's prime minister robert fico announced that his country would now restart the reactor , which should be up and running by the end of the week .
fico told reporters that reneging on the terms of its eu membership was better than taking the risk that his country 's electricity grid would collapse .
" we are facing a blackout here , therefore we have to act fast , " said fico , adding that the government would shut the reactor down again " as soon as the situation is stabilized . "
neighboring austria blasts slovakia the last reactor was shut down only a few weeks ago and the decision to re-launch it is likely to draw protests from neighboring austria , which has campaigned for decades against the hazards of old soviet style nuclear plants of its former communist bloc neighbors . one reactor that caused a major accident in 1977 led to its shutdown two years later .
" we can not accept the re-opening of this unsafe reactor at bohunice , " austrian environment minister nikolaus berlakovich said in a statement .
" in a community , agreements must be respected .
the -lrb- plant 's -rrb- shutdown was a key condition -lrb- to slovakia 's entry into the eu -rrb- for us and ca n't just be erased , " he added .
" now it 's up to the european commission to strongly urge compliance with the accession agreement . "
the nuclear issue has even united all of austria 's opposition parties making political bedfellows of two far-right parties and the environmental greens , who have slammed slovakia , arguing that bohunice was " one of the three most dangerous nuclear plants in europe " .
opposition leaders are urging the austrian government and the eu to take legal and diplomatic measures against slovakia .
eu under czech leadership sympathetic to slovakia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague , which holds the eu presidency , defended slovakia in brussels , the european commission said there was " no legal basis " for the nuclear re-launch , but conceded that slovakia had a " real problem " with the gas shortage .
the czech republic , which was the other half of the former czechoslovakia and just kicked off its current six month eu presidency , was even more sympathetic to slovakia 's plight .
czech prime minister mirek topolanek rejected all criticism on sunday , pointing out the shortcomings of the eu 's energy and security policies .
" at the moment , i take it rather as a demonstration of -lrb- fico 's -rrb- readiness to tackle an issue that the european union can not resolve for slovakia - a looming blackout , " he said in prague . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the strict rules are meant to underpin the common currency and keep it stable . the newsmagazine der spiegel offered a smaller figure for the supplementary budget : 20 billion euros . merkel declined saturday to predict how much new borrowing would be needed . asked if germany would meet the maastricht criteria in the next few years , she said , " it would be irresponsible to set absolute figures .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 12.01.2009 slovakia re-starts nuclear reactor to avoid blackout großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the energy dispute could make gas levels go under the level needed to heat households by re-launching a reactor that it recently shut down , slovakia has violated a pledge to the eu to decommission its soviet-designed nuclear plants .
austria has urged the eu to take action against its neighbor . slovakia , which depends on russia for almost all of its natural gas that run through ukrainian pipelines , will re-start a controversial nuclear reactor to cope with a potential shortage caused by the energy dispute between moscow and kiev .
officials fear that the gas supply could fall to such a low level that it would soon be impossible to heat slovak households during an unusually cold winter with sub-freezing winter temperatures .
the bohunice plant , which is located a short distance from bratislava , consists of five soviet-type reactors , which have been decommissioned under the terms of slovakia accession to the eu back in 2004 .
violating eu pledge to avoid blackout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hazardous soviet-type reactor was shut down in slovakia 30 years ago the slovak government has justified violating its pledge to brussels in order to avoid a possible blackout during the gas crisis .
at a special cabinet meeting over the weekend , slovakia 's prime minister robert fico announced that his country would now restart the reactor , which should be up and running by the end of the week .
fico told reporters that reneging on the terms of its eu membership was better than taking the risk that his country 's electricity grid would collapse .
" we are facing a blackout here , therefore we have to act fast , " said fico , adding that the government would shut the reactor down again " as soon as the situation is stabilized . "
neighboring austria blasts slovakia the last reactor was shut down only a few weeks ago and the decision to re-launch it is likely to draw protests from neighboring austria , which has campaigned for decades against the hazards of old soviet style nuclear plants of its former communist bloc neighbors . one reactor that caused a major accident in 1977 led to its shutdown two years later .
" we can not accept the re-opening of this unsafe reactor at bohunice , " austrian environment minister nikolaus berlakovich said in a statement .
" in a community , agreements must be respected .
the -lrb- plant 's -rrb- shutdown was a key condition -lrb- to slovakia 's entry into the eu -rrb- for us and ca n't just be erased , " he added .
" now it 's up to the european commission to strongly urge compliance with the accession agreement . "
the nuclear issue has even united all of austria 's opposition parties making political bedfellows of two far-right parties and the environmental greens , who have slammed slovakia , arguing that bohunice was " one of the three most dangerous nuclear plants in europe " .
opposition leaders are urging the austrian government and the eu to take legal and diplomatic measures against slovakia .
eu under czech leadership sympathetic to slovakia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague , which holds the eu presidency , defended slovakia in brussels , the european commission said there was " no legal basis " for the nuclear re-launch , but conceded that slovakia had a " real problem " with the gas shortage .
the czech republic , which was the other half of the former czechoslovakia and just kicked off its current six month eu presidency , was even more sympathetic to slovakia 's plight .
czech prime minister mirek topolanek rejected all criticism on sunday , pointing out the shortcomings of the eu 's energy and security policies .
" at the moment , i take it rather as a demonstration of -lrb- fico 's -rrb- readiness to tackle an issue that the european union can not resolve for slovakia - a looming blackout , " he said in prague . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ceo zetsche expects recovery for second half of 2009 . german car manufacturer daimler introduced reduced working hours monday for employees at factories across germany .
shifts are being cut to three or four days a week for 30,000 workers at core manufacturing sites in the company 's home town of stuttgart and its main plant in the suburb of sindelfingen alone .
until sunday , many daimler plants had been closed since mid-december for an extended winter break .
the measures , set to last until the end of march , will also affect operations in berlin and the towns of rastatt and ludwigsfelde .
workers are to receive reduced pay and government welfare benefits for the days when they are idle .
most german carmakers , like their counterparts elsewhere , are reeling under the effects of the economic crisis and have been forced to slash production to offset a fall in consumer demand .

normally , neural crest cells stop dividing .
but neuroblastoma lose this capacity , and they go on to spawn deadly neuroblastoma cells . now for the first time , researchers at wuerzburg university in germany have isolated the so-called aurka gene which scientists know nurtures another gene called mycn , which is a key culprit in the spread of neuroblastoma tumours . " we speculated that genes that are expressed in a mycn dependent manner might be required specifically for the growth of mycn-amplified neuroblastomas and that mycn-amplified neuroblastomas might depend not only on n-myc itself , but also on upstream regulatory factors or downstream target genes , " explained senior study author , dr. martin eilers , from the university of wuerzburg . hope for new treatments dr. eilers and colleagues performed a genetic screen of nearly 200 genes that are dependent on amplified mycn in human neuroblastoma or are direct targets of myc . " our results show that stabilization of n-myc is a critical oncogenic function of aurora a in childhood neuroblastoma ; the challenge will now be to find ways to interfere with this function in order to find new approaches for the therapy of these tumours , " said dr. eilers .
" the findings also suggest that the current views about why aurora a is oncogenic may need to be re-evaluated . " neuroblastoma accounts for 15 percent of childhood cancer deaths , with just a 40 percent survival rate even though it only causes about 7 percent of all pediatric cancers . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we speculated that genes that are expressed in a mycn dependent manner might be required specifically for the growth of mycn-amplified neuroblastomas and that mycn-amplified neuroblastomas might depend not only on n-myc itself , but also on upstream regulatory factors or downstream target genes , " explained senior study author , dr. martin eilers , from the university of wuerzburg . hope for new treatments dr. eilers and colleagues performed a genetic screen of nearly 200 genes that are dependent on amplified mycn in human neuroblastoma or are direct targets of myc .

" the internet method is soothing for many victims because they do not have to speak to anyone specific or sit opposite someone , " said christine knaevelsrud , a psychologist at berlin 's center for the treatment of torture victims -lrb- bzfo -rrb- the free service , called interapy , consists of three stages .
first , victims must write four e-mails detailing what they saw and felt during their ordeal . next , the individual must write four letters to an imaginary friend who has experienced the same trauma - this helps the victim rid themselves of any feelings of guilt associated with their suffering . finally , the patient is encouraged to write a further two letters , one to him- or herself and the other to the perpetrator of the wrongdoing .
this step helps the victim say " you no longer have a role in my life . " " some victims have been raped , some kidnapped , " knaevelsrud said .
" others have been maltreated during arrests or have seen mutilated bodies . " around 250 victims - mostly from iraq , but also from sudan , syria , or palestinian regions - have used the online service . the web-based therapy was created to fill a massive hole in the availability of psychological treatment in iraq 's more dangerous southern provinces . the bzfo currently has a therapy center in kirkuk , in northern iraq , and has plans to set up two more clinics for traumatized iraqis in the middle east country . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

we will not apply it as long as this reserve is not overturned , " he added . putin charged that the ukrainian additions had distorted the meaning of the document originally signed by both parties and introduced issues that were unrelated to the gas dispute . the czech republic 's energy envoy , vaclav bartuska , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said the additional conditions added by ukraine would not have changed the legality of the mandate for the eu observer mission . russian refusal to restart supplies moscow had insisted it would not restart gas supplies to europe until a valid deal was signed .
supplies have been halted since wednesday , jan 7 . medvedev had urged eu officials to pressure ukraine into withdrawing its so-called declaration that it issued to accompany the agreement . the european commission says the declaration would not have changed the deal , but lavrov told medvedev that the copy of the deal russia had received contained ukraine 's stipulation that it was only valid along with the declaration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko , left , and putin , right , were contacted by the eu 's head commissioner sunday putin had proposed to european commission president jose manuel barroso that russian and eu officials meet in brussels on monday for talks over the gas row , a russian government source told reuters . putin told barroso over the phone that additions made by ukraine to an agreement on the monitoring of gas transit were " unacceptable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 12.01.2009 slovakia re-starts nuclear reactor to avoid blackout großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the energy dispute could make gas levels go under the level needed to heat households by re-launching a reactor that it recently shut down , slovakia has violated a pledge to the eu to decommission its soviet-designed nuclear plants .
austria has urged the eu to take action against its neighbor . slovakia , which depends on russia for almost all of its natural gas that run through ukrainian pipelines , will re-start a controversial nuclear reactor to cope with a potential shortage caused by the energy dispute between moscow and kiev .
officials fear that the gas supply could fall to such a low level that it would soon be impossible to heat slovak households during an unusually cold winter with sub-freezing winter temperatures .
the bohunice plant , which is located a short distance from bratislava , consists of five soviet-type reactors , which have been decommissioned under the terms of slovakia accession to the eu back in 2004 .
violating eu pledge to avoid blackout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hazardous soviet-type reactor was shut down in slovakia 30 years ago the slovak government has justified violating its pledge to brussels in order to avoid a possible blackout during the gas crisis .
at a special cabinet meeting over the weekend , slovakia 's prime minister robert fico announced that his country would now restart the reactor , which should be up and running by the end of the week .
fico told reporters that reneging on the terms of its eu membership was better than taking the risk that his country 's electricity grid would collapse .
" we are facing a blackout here , therefore we have to act fast , " said fico , adding that the government would shut the reactor down again " as soon as the situation is stabilized . "
neighboring austria blasts slovakia the last reactor was shut down only a few weeks ago and the decision to re-launch it is likely to draw protests from neighboring austria , which has campaigned for decades against the hazards of old soviet style nuclear plants of its former communist bloc neighbors . one reactor that caused a major accident in 1977 led to its shutdown two years later .
" we can not accept the re-opening of this unsafe reactor at bohunice , " austrian environment minister nikolaus berlakovich said in a statement .
" in a community , agreements must be respected .
the -lrb- plant 's -rrb- shutdown was a key condition -lrb- to slovakia 's entry into the eu -rrb- for us and ca n't just be erased , " he added .
" now it 's up to the european commission to strongly urge compliance with the accession agreement . "
the nuclear issue has even united all of austria 's opposition parties making political bedfellows of two far-right parties and the environmental greens , who have slammed slovakia , arguing that bohunice was " one of the three most dangerous nuclear plants in europe " .
opposition leaders are urging the austrian government and the eu to take legal and diplomatic measures against slovakia .
eu under czech leadership sympathetic to slovakia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague , which holds the eu presidency , defended slovakia in brussels , the european commission said there was " no legal basis " for the nuclear re-launch , but conceded that slovakia had a " real problem " with the gas shortage .
the czech republic , which was the other half of the former czechoslovakia and just kicked off its current six month eu presidency , was even more sympathetic to slovakia 's plight .
czech prime minister mirek topolanek rejected all criticism on sunday , pointing out the shortcomings of the eu 's energy and security policies .
" at the moment , i take it rather as a demonstration of -lrb- fico 's -rrb- readiness to tackle an issue that the european union can not resolve for slovakia - a looming blackout , " he said in prague . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one that did was rotkaeppchen sparkling wine .
the company even managed to buy out western rivals and today it 's a market leader . it came as no surprise that east germans wasted little time trading in the brands they had grown up with for the west germans products they had believed would remain out of their reach forever . perhaps it is more surprising that any east german products survived at all .
but in fact , quite a few did , from the florena cosmetics label , now owned by beiersdorf , to spee laundry detergent , which was bought up henkel . one even went on to become not only a favorite among nostalgic east germans - it also swallowed its rivals and spat them out like a corked wine .
today , rotkaeppchen sparkling wine is germany ’ s market leader . the dry spell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the company was founded over 150 years ago the company 's meteoric success is one of the quirkier outcomes of reunification .
the rotkaeppchen - little red riding hood - wine cellar first opened in freyburg an der unstrut , south of leipzig , in 1856 , and today the 650-hectare vineyard is one of the smallest in germany .
but only a fraction of the grapes that go into the sparking wine are grown here , while the rest come from france , italy , spain and western germany . the company was turned into a collective during the communist era , producing 15 million bottles of bubbly a year . for a brief interlude after the fall of the berlin wall , east germans drunk on the temptations of capitalism spurned rotkaeppchen in favor of more glamorous western labels , and for a while the company floundered .
in 1991 , only 2.9 million of the red-topped green bottles were sold . the management buyout but its fortunes changed in 1993 when gunter heise , the company 's technical director , decided to take matters in to his own hands .
in a management buyout , he and four of his colleagues took over the malingering business from the trust created in 1990 to privatize the east german enterprises owned as public property . entrepreneur harald eckes-chantre and his family footed the lion 's share of the bill , while the five company employees put up the rest .
today , the eckes-chantre family still owns more than 50 percent of the company , while the rest belongs to heise and three of the original investors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sparkling wine got its name from little red riding hood herself in 1994 , the team began their efforts to break in to the western german market . they were so successful that by 2000 , sales of 50 millions bottles a year made the company germany 's number one sparkling wine maker . world domination by 2002 , heise and co. were feeling confident enough to take over their hessen-based rivals mumm , jules mumm and mm extra from canadian drinks manufacturer seagram .
one year later , they snapped up the small but upmarket geldermann company from bavaria . by 2007 , rotkaeppchen reportedly owned nearly 40 percent of the german sparkling wine market . the second-largest share is owned by spanish company freixenet , with a mere 17 percent - although freixenet leads on the international market .
rotkaeppchen , nonetheless , occupies an admirable second place . liquored-up the latest addition to the rotkaeppchen empire was made in late 2006 , when the company bought the western german liquor manufacturer eckes spirituosen & wein , which makes chantre and mariacron brandy , eckes cherry liqueur and nordhaeuser schnapps . the acquisition shot the company to the top of the german liquor market . 2007 was the company 's most profitable year ever with sales up by 10.5 percent .
a total of 186 million bottles were sold , with sales of sparkling wine , the company 's main product , up by 12.6 percent since the previous year .
at 709.5 million euros , turnover grew by 8.9 percent since 2006 . communist chic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rotkaeppchen ceo gunter heise re-enacts the brand 's television commercial joachim schuetz is ceo of markenverband , the german brands association , which numbers rotkaeppchen among its members . he says the company 's owes its success to its change of strategy in 1993 . " after the management buy-out , the company chose to promote rotkaeppchen as a pan-german brand , " he said .
even though it was known as a quintessentially east german brand , it had wider potential and its new owners made the most of the opportunity . " they were successful because they acted fast , " said schuetz . nonetheless , at a time when nostalgia for east german culture and kitsch shows no signs of abating , its image as communist champagne has by no means damaged rotkaeppchen 's reputation . the company itself insists it has never deliberately tried to milk this trend .

european union energy ministers had convened an emergency meeting in the morning for russia to resume gas supplies to europe , since all of the conditions set by moscow had been fulfilled .
the talks were designed to shape " concrete measures " needed by the bloc to deal with the gas shortages , provoked by russia blocking all supplies destined for europe via ukrainian pipelines .

eu ministers were also expected to focus on the need for the bloc to develop alternative energy supplies , both by building pipelines to bypass ukraine and russia and by turning to other technologies , such as solar , wind and wave power .

normally , neural crest cells stop dividing .
but neuroblastoma lose this capacity , and they go on to spawn deadly neuroblastoma cells . now for the first time , researchers at wuerzburg university in germany have isolated the so-called aurka gene which scientists know nurtures another gene called mycn , which is a key culprit in the spread of neuroblastoma tumours . " we speculated that genes that are expressed in a mycn dependent manner might be required specifically for the growth of mycn-amplified neuroblastomas and that mycn-amplified neuroblastomas might depend not only on n-myc itself , but also on upstream regulatory factors or downstream target genes , " explained senior study author , dr. martin eilers , from the university of wuerzburg . hope for new treatments dr. eilers and colleagues performed a genetic screen of nearly 200 genes that are dependent on amplified mycn in human neuroblastoma or are direct targets of myc . " our results show that stabilization of n-myc is a critical oncogenic function of aurora a in childhood neuroblastoma ; the challenge will now be to find ways to interfere with this function in order to find new approaches for the therapy of these tumours , " said dr. eilers .
" the findings also suggest that the current views about why aurora a is oncogenic may need to be re-evaluated . " neuroblastoma accounts for 15 percent of childhood cancer deaths , with just a 40 percent survival rate even though it only causes about 7 percent of all pediatric cancers . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

austria has urged the eu to take action against its neighbor . slovakia , which depends on russia for almost all of its natural gas that run through ukrainian pipelines , will re-start a controversial nuclear reactor to cope with a potential shortage caused by the energy dispute between moscow and kiev .
officials fear that the gas supply could fall to such a low level that it would soon be impossible to heat slovak households during an unusually cold winter with sub-freezing winter temperatures .
the bohunice plant , which is located a short distance from bratislava , consists of five soviet-type reactors , which have been decommissioned under the terms of slovakia accession to the eu back in 2004 .
violating eu pledge to avoid blackout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hazardous soviet-type reactor was shut down in slovakia 30 years ago the slovak government has justified violating its pledge to brussels in order to avoid a possible blackout during the gas crisis .
at a special cabinet meeting over the weekend , slovakia 's prime minister robert fico announced that his country would now restart the reactor , which should be up and running by the end of the week .
fico told reporters that reneging on the terms of its eu membership was better than taking the risk that his country 's electricity grid would collapse .
" we are facing a blackout here , therefore we have to act fast , " said fico , adding that the government would shut the reactor down again " as soon as the situation is stabilized . "
neighboring austria blasts slovakia the last reactor was shut down only a few weeks ago and the decision to re-launch it is likely to draw protests from neighboring austria , which has campaigned for decades against the hazards of old soviet style nuclear plants of its former communist bloc neighbors . one reactor that caused a major accident in 1977 led to its shutdown two years later .
" we can not accept the re-opening of this unsafe reactor at bohunice , " austrian environment minister nikolaus berlakovich said in a statement .
" in a community , agreements must be respected .
the -lrb- plant 's -rrb- shutdown was a key condition -lrb- to slovakia 's entry into the eu -rrb- for us and ca n't just be erased , " he added .
" now it 's up to the european commission to strongly urge compliance with the accession agreement . "
the nuclear issue has even united all of austria 's opposition parties making political bedfellows of two far-right parties and the environmental greens , who have slammed slovakia , arguing that bohunice was " one of the three most dangerous nuclear plants in europe " .
opposition leaders are urging the austrian government and the eu to take legal and diplomatic measures against slovakia .
eu under czech leadership sympathetic to slovakia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague , which holds the eu presidency , defended slovakia in brussels , the european commission said there was " no legal basis " for the nuclear re-launch , but conceded that slovakia had a " real problem " with the gas shortage .
the czech republic , which was the other half of the former czechoslovakia and just kicked off its current six month eu presidency , was even more sympathetic to slovakia 's plight .
czech prime minister mirek topolanek rejected all criticism on sunday , pointing out the shortcomings of the eu 's energy and security policies .

austria has urged the eu to take action against its neighbor . slovakia , which depends on russia for almost all of its natural gas that run through ukrainian pipelines , will re-start a controversial nuclear reactor to cope with a potential shortage caused by the energy dispute between moscow and kiev .
officials fear that the gas supply could fall to such a low level that it would soon be impossible to heat slovak households during an unusually cold winter with sub-freezing winter temperatures .
the bohunice plant , which is located a short distance from bratislava , consists of five soviet-type reactors , which have been decommissioned under the terms of slovakia accession to the eu back in 2004 .
violating eu pledge to avoid blackout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hazardous soviet-type reactor was shut down in slovakia 30 years ago the slovak government has justified violating its pledge to brussels in order to avoid a possible blackout during the gas crisis .
at a special cabinet meeting over the weekend , slovakia 's prime minister robert fico announced that his country would now restart the reactor , which should be up and running by the end of the week .
fico told reporters that reneging on the terms of its eu membership was better than taking the risk that his country 's electricity grid would collapse .
" we are facing a blackout here , therefore we have to act fast , " said fico , adding that the government would shut the reactor down again " as soon as the situation is stabilized . "
neighboring austria blasts slovakia the last reactor was shut down only a few weeks ago and the decision to re-launch it is likely to draw protests from neighboring austria , which has campaigned for decades against the hazards of old soviet style nuclear plants of its former communist bloc neighbors . one reactor that caused a major accident in 1977 led to its shutdown two years later .
" we can not accept the re-opening of this unsafe reactor at bohunice , " austrian environment minister nikolaus berlakovich said in a statement .
" in a community , agreements must be respected .
the -lrb- plant 's -rrb- shutdown was a key condition -lrb- to slovakia 's entry into the eu -rrb- for us and ca n't just be erased , " he added .
" now it 's up to the european commission to strongly urge compliance with the accession agreement . "
the nuclear issue has even united all of austria 's opposition parties making political bedfellows of two far-right parties and the environmental greens , who have slammed slovakia , arguing that bohunice was " one of the three most dangerous nuclear plants in europe " .
opposition leaders are urging the austrian government and the eu to take legal and diplomatic measures against slovakia .
eu under czech leadership sympathetic to slovakia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague , which holds the eu presidency , defended slovakia in brussels , the european commission said there was " no legal basis " for the nuclear re-launch , but conceded that slovakia had a " real problem " with the gas shortage .

the bohunice plant , which is located a short distance from bratislava , consists of five soviet-type reactors , which have been decommissioned under the terms of slovakia accession to the eu back in 2004 .
violating eu pledge to avoid blackout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hazardous soviet-type reactor was shut down in slovakia 30 years ago the slovak government has justified violating its pledge to brussels in order to avoid a possible blackout during the gas crisis .
at a special cabinet meeting over the weekend , slovakia 's prime minister robert fico announced that his country would now restart the reactor , which should be up and running by the end of the week .
fico told reporters that reneging on the terms of its eu membership was better than taking the risk that his country 's electricity grid would collapse .
" we are facing a blackout here , therefore we have to act fast , " said fico , adding that the government would shut the reactor down again " as soon as the situation is stabilized . "
neighboring austria blasts slovakia the last reactor was shut down only a few weeks ago and the decision to re-launch it is likely to draw protests from neighboring austria , which has campaigned for decades against the hazards of old soviet style nuclear plants of its former communist bloc neighbors . one reactor that caused a major accident in 1977 led to its shutdown two years later .
" we can not accept the re-opening of this unsafe reactor at bohunice , " austrian environment minister nikolaus berlakovich said in a statement .
" in a community , agreements must be respected .
the -lrb- plant 's -rrb- shutdown was a key condition -lrb- to slovakia 's entry into the eu -rrb- for us and ca n't just be erased , " he added .
" now it 's up to the european commission to strongly urge compliance with the accession agreement . "
the nuclear issue has even united all of austria 's opposition parties making political bedfellows of two far-right parties and the environmental greens , who have slammed slovakia , arguing that bohunice was " one of the three most dangerous nuclear plants in europe " .
opposition leaders are urging the austrian government and the eu to take legal and diplomatic measures against slovakia .
eu under czech leadership sympathetic to slovakia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague , which holds the eu presidency , defended slovakia in brussels , the european commission said there was " no legal basis " for the nuclear re-launch , but conceded that slovakia had a " real problem " with the gas shortage .
the czech republic , which was the other half of the former czechoslovakia and just kicked off its current six month eu presidency , was even more sympathetic to slovakia 's plight .
czech prime minister mirek topolanek rejected all criticism on sunday , pointing out the shortcomings of the eu 's energy and security policies .
" at the moment , i take it rather as a demonstration of -lrb- fico 's -rrb- readiness to tackle an issue that the european union can not resolve for slovakia - a looming blackout , " he said in prague . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

11 . russian president dmitry medvedev earlier sunday had rescinded the eu-brokered accord , citing changes by ukraine . he said russia objected to handwritten text added to the formal agreement by the ukrainian side , calling it a " mockery of common sense . " the extra declaration , which was seen by reuters , asserted that ukraine had not siphoned off transit gas and that it had no outstanding debts to gazprom .
that is the issue that stands at the center of the dispute . " i think that those who have signed this document with reservations well understand the legal consequences of their actions , " he told foreign minister sergei lavrov in a televised discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dmitry medvedev , left , meeting foreign minister sergey lavrov on sunday , jan .
11 " as a result , we are obliged to consider the document signed as null and void for us .
we will not apply it as long as this reserve is not overturned , " he added . putin charged that the ukrainian additions had distorted the meaning of the document originally signed by both parties and introduced issues that were unrelated to the gas dispute . the czech republic 's energy envoy , vaclav bartuska , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said the additional conditions added by ukraine would not have changed the legality of the mandate for the eu observer mission . russian refusal to restart supplies moscow had insisted it would not restart gas supplies to europe until a valid deal was signed .
supplies have been halted since wednesday , jan 7 . medvedev had urged eu officials to pressure ukraine into withdrawing its so-called declaration that it issued to accompany the agreement . the european commission says the declaration would not have changed the deal , but lavrov told medvedev that the copy of the deal russia had received contained ukraine 's stipulation that it was only valid along with the declaration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko , left , and putin , right , were contacted by the eu 's head commissioner sunday putin had proposed to european commission president jose manuel barroso that russian and eu officials meet in brussels on monday for talks over the gas row , a russian government source told reuters . putin told barroso over the phone that additions made by ukraine to an agreement on the monitoring of gas transit were " unacceptable . "

but can they put partisanship aside ? merkel 's coalition of her conservative cdu and the left of center spd have agreed on the broad make-up of germany 's second economic rescue package , but the devil may prove to be in the details , particularly when it comes to the issue of tax cuts .
before monday 's talks , coalition sources said the partners were ready to agree on issues including investing in infrastructure projects and schools .
but some experts have warned that the planned tax cuts could push germany 's deficit back above eu limits .
the two sides seem likely to agree on an increase in the annual tax-free amount for workers from 7,664 euros to 8,000 euros .
additionally , the social democrats want to cut the basic tax rate to 12 percent from 15 percent , a move sharply rejected by the conservatives .
economy minister michael glos of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , said the proposal was " not sensible , " while another senior cdu official said it stood " no chance " of being passed .
the spd has rejected a demand from the conservative camp to lower tax rates for low and medium-income earners .

some analysts have worried that a focus on partisanship could prevent the coalition from doing what 's best for the country .
" i see the risk that this package has been designed more from the point of view of what is politically expedient than from the point of view of what is economically needed , " thomas mayer , chief european economist at deutsche bank told reuters news agency .
" from what i see so far , the three key tests that anti-cyclical fiscal policy should normally meet - timely , temporary and targeted - are unlikely to be met by this package . "
analysts agree that whatever the outcome of the second stimulus package , merkel is likely to reap the most political capital from the deal .

but can they put partisanship aside ? merkel 's coalition of her conservative cdu and the left of center spd have agreed on the broad make-up of germany 's second economic rescue package , but the devil may prove to be in the details , particularly when it comes to the issue of tax cuts .
before monday 's talks , coalition sources said the partners were ready to agree on issues including investing in infrastructure projects and schools .
but some experts have warned that the planned tax cuts could push germany 's deficit back above eu limits .
the two sides seem likely to agree on an increase in the annual tax-free amount for workers from 7,664 euros to 8,000 euros .
additionally , the social democrats want to cut the basic tax rate to 12 percent from 15 percent , a move sharply rejected by the conservatives .
economy minister michael glos of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , said the proposal was " not sensible , " while another senior cdu official said it stood " no chance " of being passed .
the spd has rejected a demand from the conservative camp to lower tax rates for low and medium-income earners .
it says it wants to raise taxes for top earners , but that 's an idea merkel has rejected as sending the wrong signal at a time of crisis .
political considerations in forefront bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making political gains : angela merkel the coalition parties are trying to stave off what could be germany 's worst recession in the post-war years , but given the general elections taking place in september , they 're also trying to win points with the electorate .
some analysts have worried that a focus on partisanship could prevent the coalition from doing what 's best for the country .
" i see the risk that this package has been designed more from the point of view of what is politically expedient than from the point of view of what is economically needed , " thomas mayer , chief european economist at deutsche bank told reuters news agency .
" from what i see so far , the three key tests that anti-cyclical fiscal policy should normally meet - timely , temporary and targeted - are unlikely to be met by this package . "
analysts agree that whatever the outcome of the second stimulus package , merkel is likely to reap the most political capital from the deal .
" the bottom line is that merkel will benefit the most , " manfred guellner , managing director of the forsa polling company told bloomberg .
" merkel is very cleverly giving people the feeling she 's helping them , not companies . "
merkel 's rival for the office of chancellor in september is foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- spd -rrb- .
while popular with germans , analysts agree he faces a considerable hurdle as economic policy is not his main area of expertise . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

supplies have been halted since wednesday , jan 7 . medvedev had urged eu officials to pressure ukraine into withdrawing its so-called declaration that it issued to accompany the agreement . the european commission says the declaration would not have changed the deal , but lavrov told medvedev that the copy of the deal russia had received contained ukraine 's stipulation that it was only valid along with the declaration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko , left , and putin , right , were contacted by the eu 's head commissioner sunday putin had proposed to european commission president jose manuel barroso that russian and eu officials meet in brussels on monday for talks over the gas row , a russian government source told reuters . putin told barroso over the phone that additions made by ukraine to an agreement on the monitoring of gas transit were " unacceptable .

" we speculated that genes that are expressed in a mycn dependent manner might be required specifically for the growth of mycn-amplified neuroblastomas and that mycn-amplified neuroblastomas might depend not only on n-myc itself , but also on upstream regulatory factors or downstream target genes , " explained senior study author , dr. martin eilers , from the university of wuerzburg . hope for new treatments dr. eilers and colleagues performed a genetic screen of nearly 200 genes that are dependent on amplified mycn in human neuroblastoma or are direct targets of myc . " our results show that stabilization of n-myc is a critical oncogenic function of aurora a in childhood neuroblastoma ; the challenge will now be to find ways to interfere with this function in order to find new approaches for the therapy of these tumours , " said dr. eilers .

normally , neural crest cells stop dividing .
but neuroblastoma lose this capacity , and they go on to spawn deadly neuroblastoma cells . now for the first time , researchers at wuerzburg university in germany have isolated the so-called aurka gene which scientists know nurtures another gene called mycn , which is a key culprit in the spread of neuroblastoma tumours . " we speculated that genes that are expressed in a mycn dependent manner might be required specifically for the growth of mycn-amplified neuroblastomas and that mycn-amplified neuroblastomas might depend not only on n-myc itself , but also on upstream regulatory factors or downstream target genes , " explained senior study author , dr. martin eilers , from the university of wuerzburg . hope for new treatments dr. eilers and colleagues performed a genetic screen of nearly 200 genes that are dependent on amplified mycn in human neuroblastoma or are direct targets of myc . " our results show that stabilization of n-myc is a critical oncogenic function of aurora a in childhood neuroblastoma ; the challenge will now be to find ways to interfere with this function in order to find new approaches for the therapy of these tumours , " said dr. eilers .

ceo zetsche expects recovery for second half of 2009 . german car manufacturer daimler introduced reduced working hours monday for employees at factories across germany .
shifts are being cut to three or four days a week for 30,000 workers at core manufacturing sites in the company 's home town of stuttgart and its main plant in the suburb of sindelfingen alone .
until sunday , many daimler plants had been closed since mid-december for an extended winter break .

most german carmakers , like their counterparts elsewhere , are reeling under the effects of the economic crisis and have been forced to slash production to offset a fall in consumer demand .
speaking sunday at the detroit motor show , the chief executive of daimler , dieter zetsche , said the consequences of the financial crisis had been underestimated in the car industry .

austria has urged the eu to take action against its neighbor . slovakia , which depends on russia for almost all of its natural gas that run through ukrainian pipelines , will re-start a controversial nuclear reactor to cope with a potential shortage caused by the energy dispute between moscow and kiev .
officials fear that the gas supply could fall to such a low level that it would soon be impossible to heat slovak households during an unusually cold winter with sub-freezing winter temperatures .
the bohunice plant , which is located a short distance from bratislava , consists of five soviet-type reactors , which have been decommissioned under the terms of slovakia accession to the eu back in 2004 .
violating eu pledge to avoid blackout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hazardous soviet-type reactor was shut down in slovakia 30 years ago the slovak government has justified violating its pledge to brussels in order to avoid a possible blackout during the gas crisis .
at a special cabinet meeting over the weekend , slovakia 's prime minister robert fico announced that his country would now restart the reactor , which should be up and running by the end of the week .
fico told reporters that reneging on the terms of its eu membership was better than taking the risk that his country 's electricity grid would collapse .
" we are facing a blackout here , therefore we have to act fast , " said fico , adding that the government would shut the reactor down again " as soon as the situation is stabilized . "
neighboring austria blasts slovakia the last reactor was shut down only a few weeks ago and the decision to re-launch it is likely to draw protests from neighboring austria , which has campaigned for decades against the hazards of old soviet style nuclear plants of its former communist bloc neighbors . one reactor that caused a major accident in 1977 led to its shutdown two years later .
" we can not accept the re-opening of this unsafe reactor at bohunice , " austrian environment minister nikolaus berlakovich said in a statement .
" in a community , agreements must be respected .
the -lrb- plant 's -rrb- shutdown was a key condition -lrb- to slovakia 's entry into the eu -rrb- for us and ca n't just be erased , " he added .
" now it 's up to the european commission to strongly urge compliance with the accession agreement . "
the nuclear issue has even united all of austria 's opposition parties making political bedfellows of two far-right parties and the environmental greens , who have slammed slovakia , arguing that bohunice was " one of the three most dangerous nuclear plants in europe " .
opposition leaders are urging the austrian government and the eu to take legal and diplomatic measures against slovakia .
eu under czech leadership sympathetic to slovakia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague , which holds the eu presidency , defended slovakia in brussels , the european commission said there was " no legal basis " for the nuclear re-launch , but conceded that slovakia had a " real problem " with the gas shortage .
the czech republic , which was the other half of the former czechoslovakia and just kicked off its current six month eu presidency , was even more sympathetic to slovakia 's plight .
czech prime minister mirek topolanek rejected all criticism on sunday , pointing out the shortcomings of the eu 's energy and security policies .
" at the moment , i take it rather as a demonstration of -lrb- fico 's -rrb- readiness to tackle an issue that the european union can not resolve for slovakia - a looming blackout , " he said in prague . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

11 . russian president dmitry medvedev earlier sunday had rescinded the eu-brokered accord , citing changes by ukraine . he said russia objected to handwritten text added to the formal agreement by the ukrainian side , calling it a " mockery of common sense . " the extra declaration , which was seen by reuters , asserted that ukraine had not siphoned off transit gas and that it had no outstanding debts to gazprom .
that is the issue that stands at the center of the dispute . " i think that those who have signed this document with reservations well understand the legal consequences of their actions , " he told foreign minister sergei lavrov in a televised discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dmitry medvedev , left , meeting foreign minister sergey lavrov on sunday , jan .
11 " as a result , we are obliged to consider the document signed as null and void for us .
we will not apply it as long as this reserve is not overturned , " he added . putin charged that the ukrainian additions had distorted the meaning of the document originally signed by both parties and introduced issues that were unrelated to the gas dispute . the czech republic 's energy envoy , vaclav bartuska , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said the additional conditions added by ukraine would not have changed the legality of the mandate for the eu observer mission . russian refusal to restart supplies moscow had insisted it would not restart gas supplies to europe until a valid deal was signed .
supplies have been halted since wednesday , jan 7 . medvedev had urged eu officials to pressure ukraine into withdrawing its so-called declaration that it issued to accompany the agreement . the european commission says the declaration would not have changed the deal , but lavrov told medvedev that the copy of the deal russia had received contained ukraine 's stipulation that it was only valid along with the declaration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko , left , and putin , right , were contacted by the eu 's head commissioner sunday putin had proposed to european commission president jose manuel barroso that russian and eu officials meet in brussels on monday for talks over the gas row , a russian government source told reuters . putin told barroso over the phone that additions made by ukraine to an agreement on the monitoring of gas transit were " unacceptable .

austria has urged the eu to take action against its neighbor . slovakia , which depends on russia for almost all of its natural gas that run through ukrainian pipelines , will re-start a controversial nuclear reactor to cope with a potential shortage caused by the energy dispute between moscow and kiev .
officials fear that the gas supply could fall to such a low level that it would soon be impossible to heat slovak households during an unusually cold winter with sub-freezing winter temperatures .
the bohunice plant , which is located a short distance from bratislava , consists of five soviet-type reactors , which have been decommissioned under the terms of slovakia accession to the eu back in 2004 .
violating eu pledge to avoid blackout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hazardous soviet-type reactor was shut down in slovakia 30 years ago the slovak government has justified violating its pledge to brussels in order to avoid a possible blackout during the gas crisis .
at a special cabinet meeting over the weekend , slovakia 's prime minister robert fico announced that his country would now restart the reactor , which should be up and running by the end of the week .
fico told reporters that reneging on the terms of its eu membership was better than taking the risk that his country 's electricity grid would collapse .
" we are facing a blackout here , therefore we have to act fast , " said fico , adding that the government would shut the reactor down again " as soon as the situation is stabilized . "
neighboring austria blasts slovakia the last reactor was shut down only a few weeks ago and the decision to re-launch it is likely to draw protests from neighboring austria , which has campaigned for decades against the hazards of old soviet style nuclear plants of its former communist bloc neighbors . one reactor that caused a major accident in 1977 led to its shutdown two years later .
" we can not accept the re-opening of this unsafe reactor at bohunice , " austrian environment minister nikolaus berlakovich said in a statement .
" in a community , agreements must be respected .
the -lrb- plant 's -rrb- shutdown was a key condition -lrb- to slovakia 's entry into the eu -rrb- for us and ca n't just be erased , " he added .
" now it 's up to the european commission to strongly urge compliance with the accession agreement . "
the nuclear issue has even united all of austria 's opposition parties making political bedfellows of two far-right parties and the environmental greens , who have slammed slovakia , arguing that bohunice was " one of the three most dangerous nuclear plants in europe " .
opposition leaders are urging the austrian government and the eu to take legal and diplomatic measures against slovakia .
eu under czech leadership sympathetic to slovakia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague , which holds the eu presidency , defended slovakia in brussels , the european commission said there was " no legal basis " for the nuclear re-launch , but conceded that slovakia had a " real problem " with the gas shortage .
the czech republic , which was the other half of the former czechoslovakia and just kicked off its current six month eu presidency , was even more sympathetic to slovakia 's plight .
czech prime minister mirek topolanek rejected all criticism on sunday , pointing out the shortcomings of the eu 's energy and security policies .
" at the moment , i take it rather as a demonstration of -lrb- fico 's -rrb- readiness to tackle an issue that the european union can not resolve for slovakia - a looming blackout , " he said in prague . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the document has been finally signed , " medvedev said at a news conference in brussels .

ceo zetsche expects recovery for second half of 2009 . german car manufacturer daimler introduced reduced working hours monday for employees at factories across germany .
shifts are being cut to three or four days a week for 30,000 workers at core manufacturing sites in the company 's home town of stuttgart and its main plant in the suburb of sindelfingen alone .
until sunday , many daimler plants had been closed since mid-december for an extended winter break .
the measures , set to last until the end of march , will also affect operations in berlin and the towns of rastatt and ludwigsfelde .
workers are to receive reduced pay and government welfare benefits for the days when they are idle .
most german carmakers , like their counterparts elsewhere , are reeling under the effects of the economic crisis and have been forced to slash production to offset a fall in consumer demand .
speaking sunday at the detroit motor show , the chief executive of daimler , dieter zetsche , said the consequences of the financial crisis had been underestimated in the car industry .
however he was cautiously optimistic for the remainder of 2009 , saying it was conceivable that global demand would recover in the second half of the year .

ceo zetsche expects recovery for second half of 2009 . german car manufacturer daimler introduced reduced working hours monday for employees at factories across germany .
shifts are being cut to three or four days a week for 30,000 workers at core manufacturing sites in the company 's home town of stuttgart and its main plant in the suburb of sindelfingen alone .
until sunday , many daimler plants had been closed since mid-december for an extended winter break .
the measures , set to last until the end of march , will also affect operations in berlin and the towns of rastatt and ludwigsfelde .
workers are to receive reduced pay and government welfare benefits for the days when they are idle .
most german carmakers , like their counterparts elsewhere , are reeling under the effects of the economic crisis and have been forced to slash production to offset a fall in consumer demand .
speaking sunday at the detroit motor show , the chief executive of daimler , dieter zetsche , said the consequences of the financial crisis had been underestimated in the car industry .
however he was cautiously optimistic for the remainder of 2009 , saying it was conceivable that global demand would recover in the second half of the year .
in 2008 daimler saw sales of its flagship brand mercedes-benz drop 5.4 percent .
new car sales in germany fell by almost two per cent in 2008 , to 3.09 million new registrations .

normally , neural crest cells stop dividing .
but neuroblastoma lose this capacity , and they go on to spawn deadly neuroblastoma cells . now for the first time , researchers at wuerzburg university in germany have isolated the so-called aurka gene which scientists know nurtures another gene called mycn , which is a key culprit in the spread of neuroblastoma tumours . " we speculated that genes that are expressed in a mycn dependent manner might be required specifically for the growth of mycn-amplified neuroblastomas and that mycn-amplified neuroblastomas might depend not only on n-myc itself , but also on upstream regulatory factors or downstream target genes , " explained senior study author , dr. martin eilers , from the university of wuerzburg . hope for new treatments dr. eilers and colleagues performed a genetic screen of nearly 200 genes that are dependent on amplified mycn in human neuroblastoma or are direct targets of myc . " our results show that stabilization of n-myc is a critical oncogenic function of aurora a in childhood neuroblastoma ; the challenge will now be to find ways to interfere with this function in order to find new approaches for the therapy of these tumours , " said dr. eilers .
" the findings also suggest that the current views about why aurora a is oncogenic may need to be re-evaluated .

" our results show that stabilization of n-myc is a critical oncogenic function of aurora a in childhood neuroblastoma ; the challenge will now be to find ways to interfere with this function in order to find new approaches for the therapy of these tumours , " said dr. eilers .
" the findings also suggest that the current views about why aurora a is oncogenic may need to be re-evaluated . " neuroblastoma accounts for 15 percent of childhood cancer deaths , with just a 40 percent survival rate even though it only causes about 7 percent of all pediatric cancers . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but can they put partisanship aside ? merkel 's coalition of her conservative cdu and the left of center spd have agreed on the broad make-up of germany 's second economic rescue package , but the devil may prove to be in the details , particularly when it comes to the issue of tax cuts .
before monday 's talks , coalition sources said the partners were ready to agree on issues including investing in infrastructure projects and schools .
but some experts have warned that the planned tax cuts could push germany 's deficit back above eu limits .
the two sides seem likely to agree on an increase in the annual tax-free amount for workers from 7,664 euros to 8,000 euros .
additionally , the social democrats want to cut the basic tax rate to 12 percent from 15 percent , a move sharply rejected by the conservatives .
economy minister michael glos of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , said the proposal was " not sensible , " while another senior cdu official said it stood " no chance " of being passed .

one that did was rotkaeppchen sparkling wine .

" the document has been finally signed , " medvedev said at a news conference in brussels .
" if everything goes without problem , most likely in the nearest future we will start pumping the first quantities of gas , " he said .
european union energy ministers had convened an emergency meeting in the morning for russia to resume gas supplies to europe , since all of the conditions set by moscow had been fulfilled .
the talks were designed to shape " concrete measures " needed by the bloc to deal with the gas shortages , provoked by russia blocking all supplies destined for europe via ukrainian pipelines .
strengthening solidarity among eu energy ministers improving the efficiency of the bloc 's energy market was also on the agenda , as well as ways of strengthening solidarity between member states in the face of future crises , the czech presidency said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans are looking to other energy sources to reduce their dependance on russian gas at the moment , hungary is supplying some of its gas to eu hopeful serbia , while poland is sending trucks loaded with gas to slovakia .
the czech eu presidency will also be called upon to mediate in a brewing row between slovakia and its neighbor , austria .
austrian furor over re-launch of slovakian nuclear reactor bratislava has infuriated vienna by deciding to make up for its shortages by re-opening its soviet-era bohunice nuclear power plant complex , which it had to shut down for security reasons as part of the conditions set for it to join the bloc in 2004 .
" shutting off the plant was one of the fundamental conditions fo -lrb- slovakia 's entry into the eu -rrb- , and it can not simply be cancelled now , " austrian environment minister nikolaus berlakovich said over the weekend .
the eu 's top energy official , andris piebalgs , said the european commission is willing to discuss the matter .
european households without heating the weeks-long gas dispute between russia and ukraine has already left hundreds of thousands of people in central and southern europe without heating in one of the coldest winters in decades .
the eu had worked hard to try and break the stalemate by sending a monitoring mission to kiev tasked with ensuring that no gas bound to europe is siphoned off by ukraine , as alleged by moscow .
eu ministers were also expected to focus on the need for the bloc to develop alternative energy supplies , both by building pipelines to bypass ukraine and russia and by turning to other technologies , such as solar , wind and wave power .
" all european member states must do their bit so that more sources -lrb- of energy -rrb- are opened up and delivery routes created , " peter hintze , a top official from the german economics ministry , said in brussels . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de dw-world : slovakia re-starts nuclear reactor to avoid blackout by re-launching a reactor that it recently shut down , slovakia has violated a pledge to the eu to decommission its soviet-designed nuclear plants .
austria has urged the eu to take action against its neighbor .

thousands of people have had to move into evacuation centres and the downpours are expected to continue .
a state of emergency has been declared in western parts of the main island of viti levu , when flooding inundated the tourist centre of nadi .
the military government said it was trying to cope with damage including disruption to power and water supplies .
four people were believed drowned over the weekend and two more were buried in landslides in the pacific nation , local reports said .
the highway linking nadi - where the country 's main international airport is situated - and the capital , suva , was reopened monday but many areas remained affected by floods .
more than 6,000 people were reported to have sought refuge at 114 evacuation centres around the country since the weekend .
" widespread flooding , including severe flooding of major rivers and streams , is expected on wednesday and thursday .
the western division is likely to be worse affected once again , " said fiji 's director of meteorology , rajendra prasad .
sugar cane crops have been flooded , roads severed and bridges submerged by surging floodwaters .
the new zealand government announced it would send aid through the fiji red cross , despite fractured relations following the military coup in fiji that brought frank bainimarama to power in december 2006 .
relations with neighbours new zealand and australia have deteriorated amid a series of mutual diplomatic expulsions .
fiji has endured four military coups since 1987 .

early on 19 september 1997 wales looked set to say no to the idea of its own assembly , a second rejection in 18 years .
scotland had shouted a resounding yes a week earlier but as the results from the 22 welsh counties came into the counting centre at the welsh college of music and drama in cardiff , wales seemed set to reject yet more politicians , rather than yes to making its own decisions about its own future .
before each result - starting with a no from wrexham - came an interminably long jingle .
after each result the yes campaigners looked just that little bit more defeated .
it looked , felt , smelt like a no betsan powys on referendum night 1997 , before the result i was working for radio 5 , trying to spot welsh secretary ron davies and herd him to our table .
he was n't around very much - what we took to be a bad sign in itself .
welsh office minister peter hain arrived looking grim , as did plaid cymru leader dafydd wigley .
they both spoke of the difficulties the government and yes campaigners had faced .
it looked , felt , smelt like a no .
would that have been a surprise ?
no .
labour had been elected to government in may 1997 having been out of power for 18 years .
prime minister tony blair had promised to hit the ground running .
steps to welsh devolution 1950 : launch of cross-party " parliament for wales " campaign 1964 : jim griffiths becomes the first secretary of state for wales as labour creates the welsh office 1973 : the establishment of a non law-making welsh assembly is recommended by a royal commission 1979 : in a referendum wales ' voters overwhelmingly reject labour proposals for an assembly 1997 : a second referendum narrowly backs an assembly 1999 : the national assembly for wales opens 2006 : the government of wales act allows the assembly to acquire law-making powers , subject to a referendum he enthusiastically announced that he was giving the bank of england the power to set interest rates and perhaps rather less enthusiastically honoured a pledge by his predecessor as leader , john smith , to offer a referendum on devolution in scotland and wales .
no-one doubted that scotland would say yes .
it had said yes in 1979 , after all , but by too slim a majority .
wales had n't just said no .
it had said no with a vengeance : 80 % to 20 % .
eighteen years later yes campaigners knew they had a mountain to climb .
despite all the main parties - except the conservatives - working together for a yes vote , plenty of seasoned campaigners thought they were about to lose .
the polling booths were quiet .
just about 50 % turned out to vote .
the fax machine which spewed results out for professor eric sunderland to read , was just out of my reach .
" go on .
lean over and take a peek " said eddie mair live on air .
i did n't dare , but by the time the final page of the final count to be declared - carmarthenshire - appeared , a kind , rather elated soul had already stuck the result under my nose .
he 'd even done the maths : 50.1 % wanted a welsh assembly , while 49.7 % did not .

the ayes had it and ran with it .
the national assembly for wales was created by the government of wales act 1998 .
in 1999 the first assembly members were elected .
wales had its own elected government , its own civil service in the making .
the first act of devolution was to transfer the collection of powers already devolved from whitehall to the welsh office to the assembly .
it had no powers to bring about primary legislation - it could n't make its own welsh laws .
then in 2006 came another government of wales act .
' devolution-lite ' although the assembly government had responsibility over the same areas of policy as before - areas like health , education , economic development , local government funding , rural affairs - over time the new act allowed further powers to be devolved , after specific requests have been approved by both houses of parliament .
" devolution-lite " say those like plaid 's adam price mp who want full scottish-style powers and for wales to be able to make decisions without the say-so of parliament .
slowly dismembered and hollowed-out in full view , and with the tacit consent , of the political classes conservative mp stephen crabb 's view of the uk under devolution a case of the united kingdom " being slowly dismembered and hollowed-out in full view , and with the tacit consent , of the political classes " says conservative mp stephen crabb .
he does n't argue for the abolition of the assembly because it " is not currently saleable " , but he would not want wales to vote yes in the next referendum , when it comes .
next referendum ?
ah , yes .
enshrined in the government of wales act 2006 was the prospect of wales achieving a parliament more like scotland 's - subject to another referendum .
this week the executive committee of the all wales convention will kick-start its journey around the country listening , gauging , engaging as it goes .
it is in the process of explaining to us all the present system of powers available to the assembly , while at the same time gauging whether wales wants a chance to grant its assembly more powers .
by now the man at the helm , sir emyr jones parry , the former uk ambassador to the united nations , will know back to front how we voted in 1979 .
he 'll know how we voted and even perhaps why we voted as we did in 1997 .
by the end of the year his job will be to tell the welsh assembly government how he thinks we would vote in a referendum held on or before may 2011 - and why .
the all wales convention will hold the first of a series of public consultation meetings at the seaside social and labour club in port talbot on wednesday , 14 january , -lrb- 1830 - 2030 gmt -rrb- .
there will be similar events in all welsh counties , ending in cardiff in june .

the national assembly for wales was created by the government of wales act 1998 .
in 1999 the first assembly members were elected .
wales had its own elected government , its own civil service in the making .
the first act of devolution was to transfer the collection of powers already devolved from whitehall to the welsh office to the assembly .
it had no powers to bring about primary legislation - it could n't make its own welsh laws .
then in 2006 came another government of wales act .
' devolution-lite ' although the assembly government had responsibility over the same areas of policy as before - areas like health , education , economic development , local government funding , rural affairs - over time the new act allowed further powers to be devolved , after specific requests have been approved by both houses of parliament .
" devolution-lite " say those like plaid 's adam price mp who want full scottish-style powers and for wales to be able to make decisions without the say-so of parliament .

early on 19 september 1997 wales looked set to say no to the idea of its own assembly , a second rejection in 18 years .
scotland had shouted a resounding yes a week earlier but as the results from the 22 welsh counties came into the counting centre at the welsh college of music and drama in cardiff , wales seemed set to reject yet more politicians , rather than yes to making its own decisions about its own future .
before each result - starting with a no from wrexham - came an interminably long jingle .
after each result the yes campaigners looked just that little bit more defeated .
it looked , felt , smelt like a no betsan powys on referendum night 1997 , before the result i was working for radio 5 , trying to spot welsh secretary ron davies and herd him to our table .
he was n't around very much - what we took to be a bad sign in itself .
welsh office minister peter hain arrived looking grim , as did plaid cymru leader dafydd wigley .
they both spoke of the difficulties the government and yes campaigners had faced .
it looked , felt , smelt like a no .
would that have been a surprise ?
no .
labour had been elected to government in may 1997 having been out of power for 18 years .
prime minister tony blair had promised to hit the ground running .

no-one doubted that scotland would say yes .
it had said yes in 1979 , after all , but by too slim a majority .
wales had n't just said no .
it had said no with a vengeance : 80 % to 20 % .
eighteen years later yes campaigners knew they had a mountain to climb .
despite all the main parties - except the conservatives - working together for a yes vote , plenty of seasoned campaigners thought they were about to lose .

early on 19 september 1997 wales looked set to say no to the idea of its own assembly , a second rejection in 18 years .
scotland had shouted a resounding yes a week earlier but as the results from the 22 welsh counties came into the counting centre at the welsh college of music and drama in cardiff , wales seemed set to reject yet more politicians , rather than yes to making its own decisions about its own future .
before each result - starting with a no from wrexham - came an interminably long jingle .
after each result the yes campaigners looked just that little bit more defeated . "
it looked , felt , smelt like a no " betsan powys on referendum night 1997 , before the result i was working for radio 5 , trying to spot welsh secretary ron davies and herd him to our table .
he was n't around very much - what we took to be a bad sign in itself .
welsh office minister peter hain arrived looking grim , as did plaid cymru leader dafydd wigley .
they both spoke of the difficulties the government and yes campaigners had faced .
it looked , felt , smelt like a no .
would that have been a surprise ?
no .
labour had been elected to government in may 1997 having been out of power for 18 years .
prime minister tony blair had promised to hit the ground running .
steps to welsh devolution 1950 : launch of cross-party " parliament for wales " campaign 1964 : jim griffiths becomes the first secretary of state for wales as labour creates the welsh office 1973 : the establishment of a non law-making welsh assembly is recommended by a royal commission 1979 : in a referendum wales ' voters overwhelmingly reject labour proposals for an assembly 1997 : a second referendum narrowly backs an assembly 1999 : the national assembly for wales opens 2006 : the government of wales act allows the assembly to acquire law-making powers , subject to a referendum he enthusiastically announced that he was giving the bank of england the power to set interest rates and perhaps rather less enthusiastically honoured a pledge by his predecessor as leader , john smith , to offer a referendum on devolution in scotland and wales .
no-one doubted that scotland would say yes .
it had said yes in 1979 , after all , but by too slim a majority .
wales had n't just said no .
it had said no with a vengeance : 80 % to 20 % .
eighteen years later yes campaigners knew they had a mountain to climb .
despite all the main parties - except the conservatives - working together for a yes vote , plenty of seasoned campaigners thought they were about to lose .
the polling booths were quiet .
just about 50 % turned out to vote .
the fax machine which spewed results out for professor eric sunderland to read , was just out of my reach .
" go on .
lean over and take a peek " said eddie mair live on air .
i did n't dare , but by the time the final page of the final count to be declared - carmarthenshire - appeared , a kind , rather elated soul had already stuck the result under my nose .
he 'd even done the maths : 50.1 % wanted a welsh assembly , while 49.7 % did not .
the ayes had it and ran with it .
the national assembly for wales was created by the government of wales act 1998 .
in 1999 the first assembly members were elected .
wales had its own elected government , its own civil service in the making .
the first act of devolution was to transfer the collection of powers already devolved from whitehall to the welsh office to the assembly .
it had no powers to bring about primary legislation - it could n't make its own welsh laws .
then in 2006 came another government of wales act .
' devolution-lite ' although the assembly government had responsibility over the same areas of policy as before - areas like health , education , economic development , local government funding , rural affairs - over time the new act allowed further powers to be devolved , after specific requests have been approved by both houses of parliament .
" devolution-lite " say those like plaid 's adam price mp who want full scottish-style powers and for wales to be able to make decisions without the say-so of parliament . "
slowly dismembered and hollowed-out in full view , and with the tacit consent , of the political classes " conservative mp stephen crabb 's view of the uk under devolution a case of the united kingdom " being slowly dismembered and hollowed-out in full view , and with the tacit consent , of the political classes " says conservative mp stephen crabb .
he does n't argue for the abolition of the assembly because it " is not currently saleable " , but he would not want wales to vote yes in the next referendum , when it comes .
next referendum ?
ah , yes .
enshrined in the government of wales act 2006 was the prospect of wales achieving a parliament more like scotland 's - subject to another referendum .
this week the executive committee of the all wales convention will kick-start its journey around the country listening , gauging , engaging as it goes .
it is in the process of explaining to us all the present system of powers available to the assembly , while at the same time gauging whether wales wants a chance to grant its assembly more powers .
by now the man at the helm , sir emyr jones parry , the former uk ambassador to the united nations , will know back to front how we voted in 1979 .
he 'll know how we voted and even perhaps why we voted as we did in 1997 .
by the end of the year his job will be to tell the welsh assembly government how he thinks we would vote in a referendum held on or before may 2011 - and why .
the all wales convention will hold the first of a series of public consultation meetings at the seaside social and labour club in port talbot on wednesday , 14 january , -lrb- 1830 - 2030 gmt -rrb- .
there will be similar events in all welsh counties , ending in cardiff in june .

the discovery is the first evidence to suggest that genetics may partly explain why more women than men tend to develop the disease .
the key variant was found in a gene on the x chromosome , of which females have two copies , but males only one .
the study , by the us-based mayo clinic college of medicine , features in the journal nature genetics .
the cause of alzheimer 's is unknown , but it is likely that a mixture of environmental and genetic factors is involved rebecca wood alzheimer 's research trust the mayo team carried out a detailed genetic analysis of patients with alzheimer 's disease .
they identified a particular variant of a gene called pcdh11x which appeared to be closely linked to a higher risk of the disease .
however , further analysis showed that the association was almost entirely restricted to women .
the raised risk of alzheimer 's was not statistically significant in men who carried one copy of the rogue gene variant , and only marginally so in women with just one copy .
but the raised risk was much more significant in women who carried two copies - one inherited from each parent .
cell communication pcdh11x controls production of a protein called a protocadherin , part of a family of molecules that help cells in the central nervous system to communicate with each other .
some evidence has suggested that protocadherins may be broken down by an enzyme which has been linked to some forms of alzheimer 's disease .
lead researcher dr steven younkin said it was likely that many genes contributed to the overall risk of alzheimer 's , and that age was probably a more significant factor .
he said : " it is exciting to find a new gene for alzheimer 's , particularly the first that has a gender-specific effect , but we have a lot more work to do to resolve the complex genetics of the disease . "
rebecca wood , of the alzheimer 's research trust , described the research as " important " .
she said : " finding genes associated with alzheimer 's will tell researchers about the biology of the disease , which could lead to new treatments being developed .
" at present , the cause of alzheimer 's is unknown , but it is likely that a mixture of environmental and genetic factors is involved .
" two thirds of people with dementia are women , but this is partly because women live longer and risk of developing dementia increases with age . "
neil hunt , of the alzheimer 's society , said research by his organisation showed that twice as many women than men over 65 have dementia .
" it is likely that a combination of factors cause alzheimer 's disease .
genetics play a part , but whilst dementia is n't a natural part of ageing , age is the biggest risk factor . "
it is estimated that 700,000 people in the uk have dementia .

the discovery is the first evidence to suggest that genetics may partly explain why more women than men tend to develop the disease .

the cause of alzheimer 's is unknown , but it is likely that a mixture of environmental and genetic factors is involved rebecca wood alzheimer 's research trust the mayo team carried out a detailed genetic analysis of patients with alzheimer 's disease .
they identified a particular variant of a gene called pcdh11x which appeared to be closely linked to a higher risk of the disease .
however , further analysis showed that the association was almost entirely restricted to women .
the raised risk of alzheimer 's was not statistically significant in men who carried one copy of the rogue gene variant , and only marginally so in women with just one copy .
but the raised risk was much more significant in women who carried two copies - one inherited from each parent .
cell communication pcdh11x controls production of a protein called a protocadherin , part of a family of molecules that help cells in the central nervous system to communicate with each other .
some evidence has suggested that protocadherins may be broken down by an enzyme which has been linked to some forms of alzheimer 's disease .
lead researcher dr steven younkin said it was likely that many genes contributed to the overall risk of alzheimer 's , and that age was probably a more significant factor .
he said : " it is exciting to find a new gene for alzheimer 's , particularly the first that has a gender-specific effect , but we have a lot more work to do to resolve the complex genetics of the disease . "

people in morpeth and redcar will benefit from the scheme which will be distributed by the northumbria regional flood defence committee -lrb- rfdc -rrb- .
the cash will be used to protect more than 2,000 homes by raising the sea wall and replacing ageing defences .
the project comes after the areas have been ravaged by floods during the past several years .
climate change regional flood and coastal risk manager phil younge said : " this year we will continue to make good progress with schemes such as morpeth and redcar .
" together , these schemes will offer better levels of protection against flooding .
" however , the onslaught of climate change means that we have to look at alternative ways of flood protection .
