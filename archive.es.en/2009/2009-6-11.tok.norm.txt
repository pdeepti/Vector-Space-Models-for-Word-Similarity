he has expressed the hope that israeli-palestinian peace efforts would resume in the near future . " a lot of important things are taking place , " he told reporters in jerusalem .
the eu 's foreign policy coordinator said that us president barack obama 's recent speech to the muslim world had been a crucial step in the right direction .
obama had urged the two sides in the middle east conflict to find a lasting settlement .
solana also mentioned last week 's elections in lebanon where iranian-backed hezbollah failed to capitalize on anti-israeli sentiment .
solana said it was a good time to " see how we can bring back the situation to something that can be moving in the right direction . "
last year , the peace process was dealt a setback by the israeli military offensive in the gaza strip .
solana added that he expected israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to endorse a two-state solution and to freeze israeli settlement in the palestinian territories .
" that 's what we expect to hear and i am sure something of that nature will happen , " solana said in reference to a speech netanyahu announced for sunday where he will outline his government 's policies on the peace process .
so far , netanyahu who heads a right-of-center coalition , has refused to publicly back a palestinian state or order a halt to settlement construction .
solana is to continue his tour of the middle east by meeting with palestinian , lebanese and egyptian leaders. ai / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" important personnel and policy decisions must be taken immediately .
that is why germany and france support jose manuel barroso , " merkel said at a joint press conference with sarkozy in paris .
there is a " strong desire " in the newly-elected eu parliament that the choice of a new ec head should not take the entire summer , she said .
" we will support the candidacy of mr. barroso , without ambiguity , " sarkozy said at a joint news conference at the elysee presidential palace .
but the support for the incumbent was not unconditional , sarkozy added .
" madame merkel and i support barroso , " he said .
" but we call on him before a second term to clarify , and in a way make formal , his position , " the french president said .

eu leaders meeting are set to grant a second five-year term to barroso , the only candidate for the top post , at their summit in brussels next thursday and friday .
barroso 's mandate expires in october , but he is seeking a second term despite the european union 's struggle to reform and criticism of its response to the financial crisis .
leaders pledge to press lisbon 's case sarkozy added that he would be prepared to travel to ireland to help gather support for a referendum over the european union 's stalled lisbon treaty .
" mrs. merkel and i will do everything we can to help the irish make the choice for lisbon , " he told the joint news conference .
" if it is of use , i would even be ready to travel to ireland to support them , " he said .
the two leaders also expressed their concern for the well-being of imprisoned burmese opposition leader aung san suu kyi .

the court said a group of indiana pension funds opposed to the deal had failed to show " that the circumstances justify " delaying proceedings to accommodate their challenge .
the funds had argued that the white house-backed sale of chrysler to fiat is unconstitutional because it puts the rights of junior creditors ahead of the rights of senior lenders .

chrysler filed for bankruptcy on april 30 and is seeking to re-emerge within the next 30 to 60 days .

" there is no doubt in my mind that we will get the job done , " marchionne said in a letter to employees .
he called the alliance a " bold first step to implement " lessons learned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fiat chief sergio marchionne is upbeat about the merged company 's chances marchionne said earlier that the merged chrysler and fiat ranked as the world 's sixth largest automaker .
marchionne said fiat will begin the process of transferring fiat 's technology , platforms and powertrains to chrysler plants in the next few months .
the white house welcomed the completion of the deal and said the new alliance was " poised to emerge as a competitive , viable automaker . "
us court paves way for deal the deal 's completion came a day after the us supreme court lifted a stay on a lower court 's approval of the deal .
the court said a group of indiana pension funds opposed to the deal had failed to show " that the circumstances justify " delaying proceedings to accommodate their challenge .
the funds had argued that the white house-backed sale of chrysler to fiat is unconstitutional because it puts the rights of junior creditors ahead of the rights of senior lenders .
they also said the us treasury had overstepped its legal authority by using some $ 12 billion in financial bailout funds to reorganize chrysler when congress had intended the money for banks .
chrysler 's sale to fiat , a union-aligned trust and the us and canadian governments is aimed at pulling the company out of bankruptcy and reorganizing it to cope with changing economic conditions and consumer tastes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrysler may get a new life under fiat but it still needs to overcome past problems the court gave the transaction the green light after the government filed a brief warning that fiat could walk away from the chrysler deal if it was not finalized by june 15 .
" if fiat is released from the obligation to consummate the transaction as currently structured , it will be free to demand additional concessions before concluding a new agreement , " the justice dpartment brief said .
the statement said that because chrysler is not manufacturing cars , each day of bankruptcy was costing the company approximately $ 100 million .
chrysler filed for bankruptcy on april 30 and is seeking to re-emerge within the next 30 to 60 days .
its rapid turnaround plan is expected to serve as a precedent for general motors , which has filed for creditor protection as part of a plan that offloads its german subsidiary opel and gives the us government a majority stake in the new gm .
" cash for clunkers " bill approved meanwhile , the " cash for clunkers " bill , one of president obama 's consumer incentives for new car purchases , was approved by the house of representatives this week .
the bill aims to boost new car sales by allowing consumers to turn in their gas-guzzling cars and trucks for vouchers worth up to $ 4,500 toward more fuel-efficient vehicles . the measure is part of the obama 's administration 's efforts to stimulate car sales and increase the fleet of fuel-efficient vehicles on the nation 's highways . the us car industry has been searching for new incentives after months of poor car sale .
in may , overall auto sales were 34 percent lower than a year ago . sje / reuters / dpa / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu leaders meeting are set to grant a second five-year term to barroso , the only candidate for the top post , at their summit in brussels next thursday and friday .
barroso 's mandate expires in october , but he is seeking a second term despite the european union 's struggle to reform and criticism of its response to the financial crisis .
leaders pledge to press lisbon 's case sarkozy added that he would be prepared to travel to ireland to help gather support for a referendum over the european union 's stalled lisbon treaty .
" mrs. merkel and i will do everything we can to help the irish make the choice for lisbon , " he told the joint news conference .

" let me stress : this is a formal statement about the geographical spread of the disease ...
it is not in itself a cause for alarm , " the un secretary general told a press conference . " though infectious , this new virus has so far not been as severe as had been feared and death rates have been low , " he added .
" we must therefore be prepared .
our best response is a firm demonstration of global solidarity . " who director general margaret chan emphasized in geneva earlier thursday that the term pandemic indicates the geographical spread of the virus , not its severity .
sustained local transmissions outside the americas , have led it to raise the alert to six - indicating a full-blown pandemic chan added that the declaration of a " moderate " pandemic should not be a cause for panic and did not mean the global death toll of 150 from the a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- virus would sharply increase " the higher level of the pandemic does not necessarily mean we are going to see a more dangerous virus or see many more people falling severely ill or dying , " she said . however , she also said that she and the other health experts had determined that " the virus is spreading to a number of countries and is not stoppable . " the un body said it was neither recommending the closure of borders nor restrictions in movement of people , goods and services in the wake of its declaration . nations such as australia , britain , chile and japan – which are reporting growing numbers of infections – are being watched carefully as they are outside the americas , where swine flu was first detected in april . us already reacting in pandemic mode bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states have been acting at level six for weeks reactions to the pandemic announcement in the united states were muted as health officials confirmed that the us had been acting as if a pandemic was under way for weeks . thomas frieden , director of the center for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- , told a news conference the who declaration did not come as a surprise .

the latest eu report puts greece and cyprus in the top spots for the cleanest beaches . the overall quality of bathing water in the eu has markedly improved since 1990 .
according to the latest annual bathing water report by the european commission and european environment agency eea , most of europe 's 21,400 bathing sites have clean water .
" high quality bathing water is essential for the well-being of european citizens and the environment , " environment commissioner stavros dimas told reporters on thursday .
" europe 's bathing sites remain clean and water quality is high . "
during the 2008 bathing season , 96 percent of coastal bathing areas and 92 percent of bathing sites in rivers and lakes complied with minimum standards , dimas said .
compliance with such mandatory values were 80 percent and 52 percent respectively in 1990 .
greece and cyprus have the cleanest beaches in the eu , while some of the purest lakes and rivers can be found in finland , sweden and germany , the report said .
however , the commission also said that clean water did not necessarily mean that the beaches themselves were also clean .
poland is the worst country in europe to go swimming in , whether in the sea , rivers or lakes , with 14.4 percent of all bathing water non-compliant with mandatory standards .
the report found that many areas of the baltic sea are suffering from an overgrowth of algae , while a relatively high number of dirty waters are found around denmark , poland and britain .
testing is still lagging behind in new eu member states romania and bulgaria .
getting people involved each year , the eu tests its waters for possible bacteriological contamination deriving from industrial waste or agriculture .
water color , acidity , and the presence of residues from detergents are also tested .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy is home to more than one third of the eu 's beaches but the report can do more than just inform europeans and tourists about where they can safely take the plunge .
it also serves as a guide to get more people involved in their local surroundings , said eea 's executive director jacqueline mcglade .
" information sources like this report and our web-based viewing tools enable citizens not only to check the quality of the bathing water in their local community or holiday destination , but also to allow them to get more actively involved in the protection of their environment , " mcglade said .
italy closed most sites more than one third of the eu 's 14,500 beaches are found in italy .
the report showed that the mediterranean country stood out with 553 coastal beaches and freshwater sites where bathing had been closed or banned throughout the 2008 season .
this was far more than in other countries .
mcglade said it was " too early to say " whether there had been an improvement at those sites since last year as the data was not yet available .
of the 14,551 coastal bathing areas in the european union , bathing was banned or closed throughout the season in only 307 sites and was found not to be complying with eu standards in 208 sites .
among the 6,890 freshwater sites , bathing was banned at 315 sites and was not up to eu standards in 196. sac / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no matter who wins , observers agree that it 's time for iran and the us to sit down at the negotiating table .
and the european union could act as a vital mediator . three candidates are running against iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is seeking a second term in friday 's presidential elections .
observers forecast that the reformists under former prime minister mir hossein mousavi have the best chances of beating ahmadinejad .
yet no matter who wins , the time has come for serious negotiations with the west regarding iran 's controversial nuclear program , said christian-peter hanelt , a middle east expert from the bertelsmann foundation .
" it is time for a rapprochement between iran , its neighbors and the west , " hanelt said .
" in order to pre-empt another confrontation in the middle east and further escalation as a result of the iranian nuclear program , american-iranian relations must be put on a sustainable footing after the iranian presidential elections . "
the european union could play a significant mediatory role in this process , said konstantin kosten , an expert on iran at the german council on foreign relations , dgap .
" the eu could certainly act as a bridge and door opener , " kosten said .
" direct contacts exist already with the iranian government and the most significant negotiating circles . "
the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana has been leading talks between iran and the so-called eu3 -lrb- referring to france , britain and germany -rrb- for years .
due to these contacts , eu officials could provide us diplomats with expertise and support .
us has full eu support the us administration has chosen a new path in its dealings with iran .
whereas former president george w. bush opted for confrontation , placing iran as part of its " axis of evil , " president barack obama is going for direct diplomacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uranium conversion facility in isfahan contributes to iran 's nuclear program in march , obama directly addressed the country 's leaders in a message to the iranian people on the occasion of nowruz , the iranian new year .
he offered tehran direct talks without any preconditions .
the us president has full backing from the eu , whose foreign ministers urged iran to take advantage of the change in us policy to seal a deal and end the stand-off over its nuclear ambitions .
" the eu warmly supports the new direction of us policy towards iran , which opens a window of opportunity for negotiations on all aspects of iran 's nuclear program and more broadly for engagement with iran , " the eu foreign ministers said in a statement in april .
washington can count on support by its european partners .
" the eu reaffirms its full and unequivocal support for efforts to find a negotiated long-term solution to the iranian nuclear issue , " the ministers said .
in addition to making it clear to tehran that the eu stands behind us policy , it 's also important to send signals of eu support to washington , said michael bauer , head of the middle east project at the center for applied policy research at the university of munich .
" there are not only proponents of this new policy towards iran in washington so i think a first step would be to essentially support the advocates and make clear to them that the european position clearly welcomes this willingness for talks , " bauer said .
compromise is necessary the main point of contention continues to be iran 's nuclear program and the country 's unwillingness to permit comprehensive and strict controls .
despite the eu 's repeated efforts to find a solution , negotiations have failed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's confrontational tone is popular among the rural poor hanelt said that only the us could provide the desired security guarantees for the territory of iran and recognition of its political system .
" for this reason , europe can now achieve more it if simply provides robust support for the us administration in its forthcoming rapprochement with tehran , " hanelt said .
bauer said iran wanted to be viewed as a " legitimate political actor " with the corresponding security guarantees .
" iran is first and foremost interested in recognition of its regime by the us , " bauer said .
" this is something the europeans ca n't offer . "
but iran was also in a strong position at the moment and its support was needed for positive developments in the region , he said .
" the us and barack obama will need iran to keep iraq stable , " bauer said .
" iran is needed to get a grip on the problems in afghanistan to some extent .
iran is an important player here . "
nuclear program will continue any hopes that iran will abandon its nuclear program are futile , though .
kosten said iran will want to remain at the helm when it comes to uranium enrichment and civilian use of nuclear power .
" the question is more whether a solution can be found which enables enrichment on iranian soil , " kosten said .
" there has to be an idea how iran can exercise its rights and therefore save face . "
even an attack by israel on iran 's nuclear facilities would put the program back by a few years , but would not stop it .
iran 's nuclear program as such is not up for discussion , bauer said .
" that has to be clear and i think it is to barack obama , " bauer said .
he said the west could at most hope to gain from iran a degree of transparency of its nuclear program through cooperation with the international atomic energy agency , which can ensure that it is a civilian nuclear program .
a turning point in iran the iranian people are considered to be among the most pro-western in the middle east .
and many , especially younger people , are fed up with ahmadinejad 's confrontational tone .
mousavi supporters have been taking to tehran 's streets for nightly demonstrations to express their discontent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mousavi supporter shows where he stands ruprecht polenz , chairman of the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee , said ahmadinejad 's defeat would mean a lot for the future of young iranians .
" when you consider what needs to happen so that the economic situation improves , so that all the young people who finish university each year really have an opportunity to find a good job , then economic reform is necessary , " polenz said .
" more intense trade relations are necessary especially with developed nations , such as european countries . "
but this requires iran to change its confrontational foreign policy and focus on cooperation , he said .
ultimately , though , the real power in iran is held by its supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei .
" indeed the ayatollah is the central player in iran 's political system , even when it comes to such matters like the nuclear program , " bauer said .
" in the end , the compromise will have to be made with the revolutionary leader . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uranium conversion facility in isfahan contributes to iran 's nuclear program in march , obama directly addressed the country 's leaders in a message to the iranian people on the occasion of nowruz , the iranian new year .
he offered tehran direct talks without any preconditions .
the us president has full backing from the eu , whose foreign ministers urged iran to take advantage of the change in us policy to seal a deal and end the stand-off over its nuclear ambitions .
" the eu warmly supports the new direction of us policy towards iran , which opens a window of opportunity for negotiations on all aspects of iran 's nuclear program and more broadly for engagement with iran , " the eu foreign ministers said in a statement in april .
washington can count on support by its european partners .
" the eu reaffirms its full and unequivocal support for efforts to find a negotiated long-term solution to the iranian nuclear issue , " the ministers said .
in addition to making it clear to tehran that the eu stands behind us policy , it 's also important to send signals of eu support to washington , said michael bauer , head of the middle east project at the center for applied policy research at the university of munich .
" there are not only proponents of this new policy towards iran in washington so i think a first step would be to essentially support the advocates and make clear to them that the european position clearly welcomes this willingness for talks , " bauer said .
compromise is necessary the main point of contention continues to be iran 's nuclear program and the country 's unwillingness to permit comprehensive and strict controls .
despite the eu 's repeated efforts to find a solution , negotiations have failed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's confrontational tone is popular among the rural poor hanelt said that only the us could provide the desired security guarantees for the territory of iran and recognition of its political system .
" for this reason , europe can now achieve more it if simply provides robust support for the us administration in its forthcoming rapprochement with tehran , " hanelt said .
bauer said iran wanted to be viewed as a " legitimate political actor " with the corresponding security guarantees .
" iran is first and foremost interested in recognition of its regime by the us , " bauer said .
" this is something the europeans ca n't offer . "
but iran was also in a strong position at the moment and its support was needed for positive developments in the region , he said .
" the us and barack obama will need iran to keep iraq stable , " bauer said .
" iran is needed to get a grip on the problems in afghanistan to some extent .
iran is an important player here . "
nuclear program will continue any hopes that iran will abandon its nuclear program are futile , though .
kosten said iran will want to remain at the helm when it comes to uranium enrichment and civilian use of nuclear power .
" the question is more whether a solution can be found which enables enrichment on iranian soil , " kosten said .
" there has to be an idea how iran can exercise its rights and therefore save face . "
even an attack by israel on iran 's nuclear facilities would put the program back by a few years , but would not stop it .
iran 's nuclear program as such is not up for discussion , bauer said .
" that has to be clear and i think it is to barack obama , " bauer said .
he said the west could at most hope to gain from iran a degree of transparency of its nuclear program through cooperation with the international atomic energy agency , which can ensure that it is a civilian nuclear program .
a turning point in iran the iranian people are considered to be among the most pro-western in the middle east .
and many , especially younger people , are fed up with ahmadinejad 's confrontational tone .
mousavi supporters have been taking to tehran 's streets for nightly demonstrations to express their discontent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mousavi supporter shows where he stands ruprecht polenz , chairman of the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee , said ahmadinejad 's defeat would mean a lot for the future of young iranians .
" when you consider what needs to happen so that the economic situation improves , so that all the young people who finish university each year really have an opportunity to find a good job , then economic reform is necessary , " polenz said .
" more intense trade relations are necessary especially with developed nations , such as european countries . "
but this requires iran to change its confrontational foreign policy and focus on cooperation , he said .
ultimately , though , the real power in iran is held by its supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei .
" indeed the ayatollah is the central player in iran 's political system , even when it comes to such matters like the nuclear program , " bauer said .
" in the end , the compromise will have to be made with the revolutionary leader . "

nuclear program will continue any hopes that iran will abandon its nuclear program are futile , though .
kosten said iran will want to remain at the helm when it comes to uranium enrichment and civilian use of nuclear power .
" the question is more whether a solution can be found which enables enrichment on iranian soil , " kosten said .
" there has to be an idea how iran can exercise its rights and therefore save face . "
even an attack by israel on iran 's nuclear facilities would put the program back by a few years , but would not stop it .
iran 's nuclear program as such is not up for discussion , bauer said .
" that has to be clear and i think it is to barack obama , " bauer said .
he said the west could at most hope to gain from iran a degree of transparency of its nuclear program through cooperation with the international atomic energy agency , which can ensure that it is a civilian nuclear program .
a turning point in iran the iranian people are considered to be among the most pro-western in the middle east .
and many , especially younger people , are fed up with ahmadinejad 's confrontational tone .
mousavi supporters have been taking to tehran 's streets for nightly demonstrations to express their discontent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mousavi supporter shows where he stands ruprecht polenz , chairman of the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee , said ahmadinejad 's defeat would mean a lot for the future of young iranians .
" when you consider what needs to happen so that the economic situation improves , so that all the young people who finish university each year really have an opportunity to find a good job , then economic reform is necessary , " polenz said .
" more intense trade relations are necessary especially with developed nations , such as european countries . "
but this requires iran to change its confrontational foreign policy and focus on cooperation , he said .
ultimately , though , the real power in iran is held by its supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei .
" indeed the ayatollah is the central player in iran 's political system , even when it comes to such matters like the nuclear program , " bauer said .
" in the end , the compromise will have to be made with the revolutionary leader . "

" with the entry into office of president obama , there is a genuine chance for new cooperation between the united states , the european union and russia , " steinmeier said .
" the ghost of the cold war has been banished ...
so i would like to say that the extended hand of the us president should be boldly accepted , " he said .
earlier , steinmeier told reporters that the security council 's five permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - as well as japan and south korea had agreed to toughen their stance against north korea after pyongyang tested a nuclear device and launched several missiles in recent weeks .
" the efforts made for a resolution were rewarded with success , " steinmeier said at a joint press conference with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov in moscow on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea has tested several missiles this year diplomats say the latest draft resolution " calls upon " countries to inspect north korean ships carrying suspicious cargo that might violate a partial un trade and arms embargo , although it does not demand it .
the document does , however , require governemnts to deny fuel to any suspicious north korea vessles and direct them to dock at " an appropriate and convenient port . "
reaching out disarmament was a key theme throughout steinmeier 's two-day visit to moscow , during which he also met with russian president dmitry medvedev .
in his address to the russian academy of science , steinmeier said that all nations should make constructive efforts to disarm .
" this has to be the year when international disarmament efforts move back to the top of the agenda , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said medvedev seemed ready to reduce its nuclear arsenal steinmeier stressed that the talks between russia and the us on replacing the 1991 strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- were " a vital step on the difficult path towards a world free of nuclear weapons . "
steinmeier called the warming of relations between the kremlin and the us a " unique historic opportunity . "
thawing fronts ?
us president obama is scheduled to travel to moscow early next month for key talks on a follow-up to start , which expires on december 5 .
us and russian negotiators have been holding preliminary meetings ahead of those talks .
moscow has said it wants to link the nuclear talks to washington 's plans to deploy an anti-missile shield in central europe - a plan the kremlin firmly opposes .
russian prime minister vladimir putin said the kremlin would consider getting rid of its nuclear arsenal if all other countries agreed to do so as well .
after meeting the german foreign minister , putin was asked if he could imagine a russia without nuclear weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what do we need nuclear weapons for ? "
putin asked " of course , " he answered .
" what do we need nuclear weapons for ? "
putin 's answer did have one caveat , however .
" if those who invented the atomic bomb , and used it , are prepared to do away with atom bombs , then we would welcome this , " he said , suggesting his country 's involvement is dependent on us disarmament .
the russian news agency interfax , however , has reported that russia wants to keep at least 1,500 nuclear warheads .
other business in addition to disarmament , steinmeier also spoke with russian leaders about combating the effects of the global financial crisis .
putin praised berlin 's active role in negotiating a plan to rescue struggling carmaker opel , which now counts russian state-owned lender sberbank as one of its major stakeholders .
the three leaders agreed to increase cooperation in the energy sector , particularly in renewable fuel sources and efficiency .
steinmeier also addressed the controversial topics of human rights and moscow 's relations with tbilisi in the wake of last year 's military conflict between russia and georgia .
he urged moscow to adopt a " constructive " role in the caucasus and stressed that unresolved territorial disputes did not have a place in the europe of the 21st century .
during a visit to the editorial office of the novaya gazeta , a newspaper known for being critical of the kremlin , steinmeier wrote that democracy and a free press go together like breathing and air. sje / hf / dpa / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the latest eu report puts greece and cyprus in the top spots for the cleanest beaches . the overall quality of bathing water in the eu has markedly improved since 1990 .
according to the latest annual bathing water report by the european commission and european environment agency eea , most of europe 's 21,400 bathing sites have clean water .
" high quality bathing water is essential for the well-being of european citizens and the environment , " environment commissioner stavros dimas told reporters on thursday .
" europe 's bathing sites remain clean and water quality is high . "
during the 2008 bathing season , 96 percent of coastal bathing areas and 92 percent of bathing sites in rivers and lakes complied with minimum standards , dimas said .
compliance with such mandatory values were 80 percent and 52 percent respectively in 1990 .
greece and cyprus have the cleanest beaches in the eu , while some of the purest lakes and rivers can be found in finland , sweden and germany , the report said .
however , the commission also said that clean water did not necessarily mean that the beaches themselves were also clean .
poland is the worst country in europe to go swimming in , whether in the sea , rivers or lakes , with 14.4 percent of all bathing water non-compliant with mandatory standards .
the report found that many areas of the baltic sea are suffering from an overgrowth of algae , while a relatively high number of dirty waters are found around denmark , poland and britain .
testing is still lagging behind in new eu member states romania and bulgaria .
getting people involved each year , the eu tests its waters for possible bacteriological contamination deriving from industrial waste or agriculture .
water color , acidity , and the presence of residues from detergents are also tested .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy is home to more than one third of the eu 's beaches but the report can do more than just inform europeans and tourists about where they can safely take the plunge .
it also serves as a guide to get more people involved in their local surroundings , said eea 's executive director jacqueline mcglade .
" information sources like this report and our web-based viewing tools enable citizens not only to check the quality of the bathing water in their local community or holiday destination , but also to allow them to get more actively involved in the protection of their environment , " mcglade said .
italy closed most sites more than one third of the eu 's 14,500 beaches are found in italy .
the report showed that the mediterranean country stood out with 553 coastal beaches and freshwater sites where bathing had been closed or banned throughout the 2008 season .
this was far more than in other countries .
mcglade said it was " too early to say " whether there had been an improvement at those sites since last year as the data was not yet available .
of the 14,551 coastal bathing areas in the european union , bathing was banned or closed throughout the season in only 307 sites and was found not to be complying with eu standards in 208 sites .
among the 6,890 freshwater sites , bathing was banned at 315 sites and was not up to eu standards in 196. sac / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the latest eu report puts greece and cyprus in the top spots for the cleanest beaches . the overall quality of bathing water in the eu has markedly improved since 1990 .
according to the latest annual bathing water report by the european commission and european environment agency eea , most of europe 's 21,400 bathing sites have clean water .
" high quality bathing water is essential for the well-being of european citizens and the environment , " environment commissioner stavros dimas told reporters on thursday .
" europe 's bathing sites remain clean and water quality is high . "
during the 2008 bathing season , 96 percent of coastal bathing areas and 92 percent of bathing sites in rivers and lakes complied with minimum standards , dimas said .
compliance with such mandatory values were 80 percent and 52 percent respectively in 1990 .
greece and cyprus have the cleanest beaches in the eu , while some of the purest lakes and rivers can be found in finland , sweden and germany , the report said .
however , the commission also said that clean water did not necessarily mean that the beaches themselves were also clean .
poland is the worst country in europe to go swimming in , whether in the sea , rivers or lakes , with 14.4 percent of all bathing water non-compliant with mandatory standards .
the report found that many areas of the baltic sea are suffering from an overgrowth of algae , while a relatively high number of dirty waters are found around denmark , poland and britain .
testing is still lagging behind in new eu member states romania and bulgaria .
getting people involved each year , the eu tests its waters for possible bacteriological contamination deriving from industrial waste or agriculture .
water color , acidity , and the presence of residues from detergents are also tested .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy is home to more than one third of the eu 's beaches but the report can do more than just inform europeans and tourists about where they can safely take the plunge .
it also serves as a guide to get more people involved in their local surroundings , said eea 's executive director jacqueline mcglade .
" information sources like this report and our web-based viewing tools enable citizens not only to check the quality of the bathing water in their local community or holiday destination , but also to allow them to get more actively involved in the protection of their environment , " mcglade said .
italy closed most sites more than one third of the eu 's 14,500 beaches are found in italy .
the report showed that the mediterranean country stood out with 553 coastal beaches and freshwater sites where bathing had been closed or banned throughout the 2008 season .
this was far more than in other countries .
mcglade said it was " too early to say " whether there had been an improvement at those sites since last year as the data was not yet available .
of the 14,551 coastal bathing areas in the european union , bathing was banned or closed throughout the season in only 307 sites and was found not to be complying with eu standards in 208 sites .
among the 6,890 freshwater sites , bathing was banned at 315 sites and was not up to eu standards in 196. sac / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the ghost of the cold war has been banished ...

" the efforts made for a resolution were rewarded with success , " steinmeier said at a joint press conference with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov in moscow on wednesday .

us president obama is scheduled to travel to moscow early next month for key talks on a follow-up to start , which expires on december 5 .
us and russian negotiators have been holding preliminary meetings ahead of those talks .
moscow has said it wants to link the nuclear talks to washington 's plans to deploy an anti-missile shield in central europe - a plan the kremlin firmly opposes .
russian prime minister vladimir putin said the kremlin would consider getting rid of its nuclear arsenal if all other countries agreed to do so as well .

" with the entry into office of president obama , there is a genuine chance for new cooperation between the united states , the european union and russia , " steinmeier said .
" the ghost of the cold war has been banished ...
so i would like to say that the extended hand of the us president should be boldly accepted , " he said .
earlier , steinmeier told reporters that the security council 's five permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - as well as japan and south korea had agreed to toughen their stance against north korea after pyongyang tested a nuclear device and launched several missiles in recent weeks .
" the efforts made for a resolution were rewarded with success , " steinmeier said at a joint press conference with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov in moscow on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea has tested several missiles this year diplomats say the latest draft resolution " calls upon " countries to inspect north korean ships carrying suspicious cargo that might violate a partial un trade and arms embargo , although it does not demand it .
the document does , however , require governemnts to deny fuel to any suspicious north korea vessles and direct them to dock at " an appropriate and convenient port . "
reaching out disarmament was a key theme throughout steinmeier 's two-day visit to moscow , during which he also met with russian president dmitry medvedev .
in his address to the russian academy of science , steinmeier said that all nations should make constructive efforts to disarm .
" this has to be the year when international disarmament efforts move back to the top of the agenda , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said medvedev seemed ready to reduce its nuclear arsenal steinmeier stressed that the talks between russia and the us on replacing the 1991 strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- were " a vital step on the difficult path towards a world free of nuclear weapons . "
steinmeier called the warming of relations between the kremlin and the us a " unique historic opportunity . "
thawing fronts ?
us president obama is scheduled to travel to moscow early next month for key talks on a follow-up to start , which expires on december 5 .
us and russian negotiators have been holding preliminary meetings ahead of those talks .
moscow has said it wants to link the nuclear talks to washington 's plans to deploy an anti-missile shield in central europe - a plan the kremlin firmly opposes .
russian prime minister vladimir putin said the kremlin would consider getting rid of its nuclear arsenal if all other countries agreed to do so as well .
after meeting the german foreign minister , putin was asked if he could imagine a russia without nuclear weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what do we need nuclear weapons for ? "
putin asked " of course , " he answered .
" what do we need nuclear weapons for ? "
putin 's answer did have one caveat , however .
" if those who invented the atomic bomb , and used it , are prepared to do away with atom bombs , then we would welcome this , " he said , suggesting his country 's involvement is dependent on us disarmament .
the russian news agency interfax , however , has reported that russia wants to keep at least 1,500 nuclear warheads .

he has expressed the hope that israeli-palestinian peace efforts would resume in the near future . " a lot of important things are taking place , " he told reporters in jerusalem .
the eu 's foreign policy coordinator said that us president barack obama 's recent speech to the muslim world had been a crucial step in the right direction .
obama had urged the two sides in the middle east conflict to find a lasting settlement .
solana also mentioned last week 's elections in lebanon where iranian-backed hezbollah failed to capitalize on anti-israeli sentiment .
solana said it was a good time to " see how we can bring back the situation to something that can be moving in the right direction . "
last year , the peace process was dealt a setback by the israeli military offensive in the gaza strip .
solana added that he expected israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to endorse a two-state solution and to freeze israeli settlement in the palestinian territories .
" that 's what we expect to hear and i am sure something of that nature will happen , " solana said in reference to a speech netanyahu announced for sunday where he will outline his government 's policies on the peace process .
so far , netanyahu who heads a right-of-center coalition , has refused to publicly back a palestinian state or order a halt to settlement construction .
solana is to continue his tour of the middle east by meeting with palestinian , lebanese and egyptian leaders. ai / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 11.06.2009 gunman kills guard at washington holocaust museum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alleged gunman has a history of anti-semitic activity officials say an 88-year-old gunman with an anti-semitic past opened fire inside the national holocaust memorial museum in washington wednesday , killing a security guard before being shot by return fire . police in washington said the security guard was pronounced dead after being rushed to a hospital .
the gunman remains in a critical condition , mayor adrian fenty said .
the lone gunman 's identity or connections to anti-semitic groups could not be confirmed but media reports said he was believed to be known as white supremacist james w von brunn .
von brunn is thought to be behind numerous anti-semitic articles posted on the internet , including a book called " kill the best gentiles , " which he calls " a new hard-hitting expose of the jewish conspiracy to destroy the white gene pool . "
" it appears to be a lone gunman who entered into the museum and opened fire with what appears to be a rifle at this point , " washington police chief cathy lanier said .
museum officials identified the guard as officer stephen tyrone johns , who had worked at the museum for six years .
" i am shocked and saddened by today 's shooting at the us holocaust memorial museum , " us president barack obama said in a statement .
" this outrageous act reminds us that we must remain vigilant against anti-semitism and prejudice in all its forms .
" no american institution is more important to this effort than the holocaust museum , and no act of violence will diminish our determination to honor those who were lost by building a more peaceful and tolerant world , " he added .
obama last week became the first us president to visit the nazi death camp in buchenwald , germany where he renewed a historic commitment to israel .
the armed man carrying a long rifle entered the museum just blocks from the national mall and washington monument shortly before 1 pm -lrb- 1800 cet -rrb- and immediately fired at armed security guards , police chief lanier told reporters .
two security guards returned fire and johns and the gunman were wounded .
local media reports said a third person was hit by glass but the extent of those injuries are unknown .
museum no stranger to threats and abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum opened in 1993 security director joseph rosboschil said the museum receives occasional threats but there had been " nothing significant of late . "
rosboschil also said the museum had more security measures than other washington museums .
sara j bloomfield , director of the museum , said this apparent act of intolerance and hatred was " even more reason for this museum to exist . "
the council on american-islamic relations , a muslim civil liberties and advocacy group , said in a statement that it condemned " this apparent bias-motivated attack " and stands with the " jewish community and with americans of all faiths in repudiating the kind of hatred and intolerance that can lead to such disturbing incidents . "
more than 30 million people have visited the museum since its opening in 1993 , including 85 heads of state. nda , afp / dpa / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the government says it needs more details before it can make a decision . the interior ministry said on thursday that it was unable to accept the us request based on the data provided .
" we 're examining two new cases , " ministry spokesman stefan paris said in berlin .
" the information provided by the united states is not sufficient for now for us to give the green light for taking in the two men . "
the interior ministry would need to check whether the prisoners represented a security risk , he said .
also , berlin needed to know why the men could not be taken in by the us and what ties they had to germany .
paris would not disclose the nationality of the two men .
security sources said one was syrian , the other tunisian .
resistance at home and abroad in april , the us made an initial request , presenting the german government with a list of nine chinese uighur detainees for berlin to " consider . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palau is offering 17 uighers a new temporary home interior minister wolfgang schaeuble had also replied in that case that the information provided was insufficient to warrant a positive reply .
us president barack obama has pledged to close the facility at the us naval base at guantanamo bay , cuba by early next year .
many of the inmates have already been cleared for release .
but us officials are having difficulty finding countries that will take them in , and meeting resistance at home to housing them on us soil .
the tiny pacific nation palau on agreed wednesday to take in up to 17 uighur guantanamo detainees .
four further uighur men who had been held at the prison camp were sent to bermuda on thursday .
sharp political debate german politicians have disagreed on the issue .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat candidate to challenge chancellor angela merkel in september 's federal election , has spoken in favor of accepting inmates .
but interior minister schaeuble has voiced skepticism .
on a visit to germany last week , obama said after talks with merkel that he had neither asked for nor received any hard commitments from berlin on taking guantanamo detainees .
he said merkel had been " very open " to discussions on the issue .
opposition politicians have been very critical of the government 's stance .
claudia roth , co-leader of the green party , said schaeuble was using " stalling tactics . "
" he 's acting on the maxim : we do n't know anything , we have to check things first , we have to deliberate so long until someone else takes this decision of our hands , " roth said in reference to the uighur case .
michael leutert , the human rights spokesman for the left party 's parliamentary group , said accepting the inmates was " a simple humanitarian act . "
" it is not plausible that two people proven innocent pose an uncalculated security risk for germany , " leutert said .

" he 's acting on the maxim : we do n't know anything , we have to check things first , we have to deliberate so long until someone else takes this decision of our hands , " roth said in reference to the uighur case .
michael leutert , the human rights spokesman for the left party 's parliamentary group , said accepting the inmates was " a simple humanitarian act . "
" it is not plausible that two people proven innocent pose an uncalculated security risk for germany , " leutert said .
he said the german government needed to promptly " consider favorably " the us request. sac / afp / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a bureaucratic blunder had allowed him to reside legally in bonn for half a year , despite his name being on a blacklist . former thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra spent six months almost unnoticed in the former german capital bonn .

" we asked bonn to revoke the permit and they responded immediately , " hanns schumacher , germany 's ambassador to thailand , told reuters on wednesday .
bonn authorities said thaksin 's name had not been on a list of people barred from germany and he had presented all the necessary documents .
this included a certificate from a german federal justice agency saying he had no criminal record .
he had also proved he had adequate funds to live and a valid passport .
officials said the absence of his name from the list of barred persons was the result of a data-entry oversight by staff of the german foreign ministry .
" we informed the lawyer that the permit was revoked and should thaksin still be in germany , his stay would be illegal and he would face detention , " schumacher said .

the draft urges countries to inspect north korean vessels , to cut back financial ties and expand the arms embargo . the five permanent members of the security council plus japan and south korea on wednesday agreed on a package of expanded sanctions against pyongyang .
the draft resolution " condemns in the strongest terms " north korea 's nuclear test last month and demands that it " not conduct any further nuclear test or any launch using ballistic missile technology . "
the draft calls for tougher inspections of north korean cargo vessels and for a cutting of financial ties with the country .
the existing arms embargo is to be stepped up . " the efforts made for a resolution were rewarded with success , " germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said during a visit to moscow .
" we expect a vote at the security council by friday at the latest , " he told a news conference after talks with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov .
the draft is a compromise as both china and russia had objected to earlier versions which would have required all countries to inspect north korean ships carrying suspicious cargo .
the latest draft now merely " calls upon " states to inspect the vessels .

rice said north korea 's behaviour was unacceptable and stressed that the objective of the new resolution was to get pyongyang to enter international talks .
" they must pay a price , they are to return without conditions to a process of negotiations and that the consequences they will face are significant , " rice told reporters .
" this sanctions regime , if passed by the security council , will bite in a meaningful way , " she said . north korea launched a long-range missile in april , triggering a rebuke from the un security council .
the regime in pyongyang then responded by declaring it had staged a successful nuclear weapons test , following one in 2006 .
according to russian and south korean officials , north korea is currently preparing yet another test-launch of a long-range missile. ai / ap / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" let me stress : this is a formal statement about the geographical spread of the disease ...
it is not in itself a cause for alarm , " the un secretary general told a press conference . " though infectious , this new virus has so far not been as severe as had been feared and death rates have been low , " he added .
" we must therefore be prepared .
our best response is a firm demonstration of global solidarity . " who director general margaret chan emphasized in geneva earlier thursday that the term pandemic indicates the geographical spread of the virus , not its severity .
sustained local transmissions outside the americas , have led it to raise the alert to six - indicating a full-blown pandemic chan added that the declaration of a " moderate " pandemic should not be a cause for panic and did not mean the global death toll of 150 from the a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- virus would sharply increase " the higher level of the pandemic does not necessarily mean we are going to see a more dangerous virus or see many more people falling severely ill or dying , " she said . however , she also said that she and the other health experts had determined that " the virus is spreading to a number of countries and is not stoppable . " the un body said it was neither recommending the closure of borders nor restrictions in movement of people , goods and services in the wake of its declaration . nations such as australia , britain , chile and japan – which are reporting growing numbers of infections – are being watched carefully as they are outside the americas , where swine flu was first detected in april . us already reacting in pandemic mode bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states have been acting at level six for weeks reactions to the pandemic announcement in the united states were muted as health officials confirmed that the us had been acting as if a pandemic was under way for weeks . thomas frieden , director of the center for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- , told a news conference the who declaration did not come as a surprise .
" there are no practical implications for most state and local governments , " he added . " here in the united states , the basic declaration is n't going to change our day-to-day activities , " added the cdc 's anne schuchat . according to the us experience , a global pandemic will have a number of specific features : the new h1n1 virus disproportionately makes younger people sick .
schuchat said 57 percent of us cases were among people aged 5 to 24 , and 41 percent of those hospitalized were in this younger age group . " the highest rates of hospitalization are actually in children under 5 , " schuchat said .
pregnant women , people with asthma or other chronic respiratory disease and diabetics needed to take special care and call a doctor if they had symptoms . the cdc said that all 50 states have had cases of infection by the h1n1 virus to such an extent that patients with specific flu-like symptoms - a fever above 104 degrees f , cough or other respiratory symptoms – are presumed to have the new virus . fears rise as southern hemisphere enters ' flu season bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the who is concerned how the developing world will cope health officials monitoring the spread of the disease are particularly concerned for countries in the southern hemisphere , where flu season is just getting under way .
the who ’ s margaret chan also said they were unsure how the virus would behave under the conditions of developing countries , which have thus far been largely spared from the virus . in other parts of the world , the big worry is that seasonal h1n1 and h3n2 viruses are still circulating .
the seasonal h1n1 has mutated into a form that resists the tamiflu vaccine , although it is still susceptible to the relenza alternative . experts fear if someone got infected with two strains at the same time , the viruses could recombine in the patient 's body and acquire new strengths and new drug resistance . outbreaks close schools in germany , hong kong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as many as 32 pupils were infected at the duesseldorf school meanwhile , city health officials confirmed that 32 students at the japanese international school in duesseldorf were infected with the h1n1 virus in the most concentrated outbreak of the virus so far in germany . most of the cases are not severe , only one of the students had to be treated at the city 's university hospital , said heiko schneitler , head of the duesseldorf health office .
all children have been placed in quarantine at home . most of the children affected were japanese , schneitler said .
duesseldorf is home to a large japanese community kathrin rebbe , a spokeswoman at the north-rhine westphalia health ministry said four additional cases of h1n1 had been detected at a school in nearby cologne . germany now has more than 100 confirmed cases of the swine flu virus .
the head of the robert koch institute , joerg hacker said he expected infections to rise . in hong kong , authorities took the decision to close all primary schools , kindergartens , child care centers and special schools for two weeks in an effort to control the spread of the virus after 12 pupils at a city secondary school were found to have contracted the a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- virus , chief executive donald tsang said . nda / hf / dpa / reuters / afp editor : charles penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite soaking up billions of euros in subsidies , germany 's eastern states still suffer from higher unemployment and lower productivity and per capita wealth .
migration is also a big problem .
but it appears that germany 's deepest recession since world war ii is having an unexpected side effect .
" so far , the east has not been hit as hard , " tiefensee said .
" twenty years after the peaceful revolution and the fall of the wall , the achievements of the east germans are being recognized in 2009 , " tiefensee told reporters after presenting the report to the cabinet .
smaller enterprises aiding eastern states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee presents the 2009 unity report tiefensee said that the eastern states are home to a larger proportion of smaller firms which are more flexible than big companies and less dependent on exports , which have slumped in the last few months .
he pointed in particular to the technology sector , where growth is higher in eastern states , especially in the solar energy sector which is strong there .
meanwhile the manufacturing industry in the west , which is heavily reliant on exports , has borne the brunt of the global downturn .
tiefensee noted that the western states ' " unprecedented solidarity " with the east , including more than one trillion euros in subsidies since national unification in 1990 , had been crucial to getting the region back on its feet .
gross national product per person in the east rose to 71 percent of that of a westerner last year , compared to 67 percent in 2000 , the report said .
industry in the east has grown by 7.5 percent over the last three years , compared to 4.3 percent in the west .
unemployment still a germany-wide problem tiefensee said that while unemployment had stayed roughly stable in eastern states in the last year , it had risen to 6.9 percent in may in western states from 6.4 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has stabilized in the east but is still high dspite the positive figures , divisions between eastern and western germany are still wide .
jobless figures are still twice as high in the east as in western states and long-term unemployment is a major problem .
unemployment stands at 13.3 percent in eastern states and is likely to rise further still in the coming months .
job migration is also a big problem .
young people , especially women , tend to abandon the east in search of work , leaving some areas as a wasteland .
about 90,000 people ditched the east for the west each year in the recent past , against just 40,000 people moving east .
" we have come a long way , but there is still a lot of work to do , " tiefensee said , adding that so-called " solidarity tax " payments to the east would likely continue for another decade , until 2019 .
by that time , he said , some of the eastern states could even overtake poorer western regions in terms of gross domestic product .
opposition accuses minister of election games opposition parties seized on the report to accuse tiefensee of scoring points for his social democrats , the junior partners in germany 's ruling coalition with chancellor merkel 's conservatives , ahead of the september general election .
" it is a clumsy attempt to win votes in the east when you tell people that the rest of the job will be finished in 10 years , " expert on eastern affairs for the liberal free democrats , joachim guenther , said. nda , afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite soaking up billions of euros in subsidies , germany 's eastern states still suffer from higher unemployment and lower productivity and per capita wealth .
migration is also a big problem .
but it appears that germany 's deepest recession since world war ii is having an unexpected side effect .
" so far , the east has not been hit as hard , " tiefensee said .
" twenty years after the peaceful revolution and the fall of the wall , the achievements of the east germans are being recognized in 2009 , " tiefensee told reporters after presenting the report to the cabinet .
smaller enterprises aiding eastern states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee presents the 2009 unity report tiefensee said that the eastern states are home to a larger proportion of smaller firms which are more flexible than big companies and less dependent on exports , which have slumped in the last few months .
he pointed in particular to the technology sector , where growth is higher in eastern states , especially in the solar energy sector which is strong there .
meanwhile the manufacturing industry in the west , which is heavily reliant on exports , has borne the brunt of the global downturn .
tiefensee noted that the western states ' " unprecedented solidarity " with the east , including more than one trillion euros in subsidies since national unification in 1990 , had been crucial to getting the region back on its feet .
gross national product per person in the east rose to 71 percent of that of a westerner last year , compared to 67 percent in 2000 , the report said .
industry in the east has grown by 7.5 percent over the last three years , compared to 4.3 percent in the west .
unemployment still a germany-wide problem tiefensee said that while unemployment had stayed roughly stable in eastern states in the last year , it had risen to 6.9 percent in may in western states from 6.4 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has stabilized in the east but is still high dspite the positive figures , divisions between eastern and western germany are still wide .
jobless figures are still twice as high in the east as in western states and long-term unemployment is a major problem .
unemployment stands at 13.3 percent in eastern states and is likely to rise further still in the coming months .
job migration is also a big problem .
young people , especially women , tend to abandon the east in search of work , leaving some areas as a wasteland .
about 90,000 people ditched the east for the west each year in the recent past , against just 40,000 people moving east .
" we have come a long way , but there is still a lot of work to do , " tiefensee said , adding that so-called " solidarity tax " payments to the east would likely continue for another decade , until 2019 .
by that time , he said , some of the eastern states could even overtake poorer western regions in terms of gross domestic product .
opposition accuses minister of election games opposition parties seized on the report to accuse tiefensee of scoring points for his social democrats , the junior partners in germany 's ruling coalition with chancellor merkel 's conservatives , ahead of the september general election .
" it is a clumsy attempt to win votes in the east when you tell people that the rest of the job will be finished in 10 years , " expert on eastern affairs for the liberal free democrats , joachim guenther , said. nda , afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has expressed the hope that israeli-palestinian peace efforts would resume in the near future . " a lot of important things are taking place , " he told reporters in jerusalem .
the eu 's foreign policy coordinator said that us president barack obama 's recent speech to the muslim world had been a crucial step in the right direction .
obama had urged the two sides in the middle east conflict to find a lasting settlement .
solana also mentioned last week 's elections in lebanon where iranian-backed hezbollah failed to capitalize on anti-israeli sentiment .
solana said it was a good time to " see how we can bring back the situation to something that can be moving in the right direction . "
last year , the peace process was dealt a setback by the israeli military offensive in the gaza strip .
solana added that he expected israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to endorse a two-state solution and to freeze israeli settlement in the palestinian territories .
" that 's what we expect to hear and i am sure something of that nature will happen , " solana said in reference to a speech netanyahu announced for sunday where he will outline his government 's policies on the peace process .
so far , netanyahu who heads a right-of-center coalition , has refused to publicly back a palestinian state or order a halt to settlement construction .
solana is to continue his tour of the middle east by meeting with palestinian , lebanese and egyptian leaders. ai / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has expressed the hope that israeli-palestinian peace efforts would resume in the near future . " a lot of important things are taking place , " he told reporters in jerusalem .
the eu 's foreign policy coordinator said that us president barack obama 's recent speech to the muslim world had been a crucial step in the right direction .
obama had urged the two sides in the middle east conflict to find a lasting settlement .
solana also mentioned last week 's elections in lebanon where iranian-backed hezbollah failed to capitalize on anti-israeli sentiment .
solana said it was a good time to " see how we can bring back the situation to something that can be moving in the right direction . "
last year , the peace process was dealt a setback by the israeli military offensive in the gaza strip .
solana added that he expected israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to endorse a two-state solution and to freeze israeli settlement in the palestinian territories .
" that 's what we expect to hear and i am sure something of that nature will happen , " solana said in reference to a speech netanyahu announced for sunday where he will outline his government 's policies on the peace process .
so far , netanyahu who heads a right-of-center coalition , has refused to publicly back a palestinian state or order a halt to settlement construction .
solana is to continue his tour of the middle east by meeting with palestinian , lebanese and egyptian leaders. ai / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is no doubt in my mind that we will get the job done , " marchionne said in a letter to employees .
he called the alliance a " bold first step to implement " lessons learned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fiat chief sergio marchionne is upbeat about the merged company 's chances marchionne said earlier that the merged chrysler and fiat ranked as the world 's sixth largest automaker .
marchionne said fiat will begin the process of transferring fiat 's technology , platforms and powertrains to chrysler plants in the next few months .
the white house welcomed the completion of the deal and said the new alliance was " poised to emerge as a competitive , viable automaker . "
us court paves way for deal the deal 's completion came a day after the us supreme court lifted a stay on a lower court 's approval of the deal .
the court said a group of indiana pension funds opposed to the deal had failed to show " that the circumstances justify " delaying proceedings to accommodate their challenge .
the funds had argued that the white house-backed sale of chrysler to fiat is unconstitutional because it puts the rights of junior creditors ahead of the rights of senior lenders .
they also said the us treasury had overstepped its legal authority by using some $ 12 billion in financial bailout funds to reorganize chrysler when congress had intended the money for banks .

the statement said that because chrysler is not manufacturing cars , each day of bankruptcy was costing the company approximately $ 100 million .
chrysler filed for bankruptcy on april 30 and is seeking to re-emerge within the next 30 to 60 days .
its rapid turnaround plan is expected to serve as a precedent for general motors , which has filed for creditor protection as part of a plan that offloads its german subsidiary opel and gives the us government a majority stake in the new gm .
" cash for clunkers " bill approved meanwhile , the " cash for clunkers " bill , one of president obama 's consumer incentives for new car purchases , was approved by the house of representatives this week .
the bill aims to boost new car sales by allowing consumers to turn in their gas-guzzling cars and trucks for vouchers worth up to $ 4,500 toward more fuel-efficient vehicles . the measure is part of the obama 's administration 's efforts to stimulate car sales and increase the fleet of fuel-efficient vehicles on the nation 's highways . the us car industry has been searching for new incentives after months of poor car sale .

the draft urges countries to inspect north korean vessels , to cut back financial ties and expand the arms embargo . the five permanent members of the security council plus japan and south korea on wednesday agreed on a package of expanded sanctions against pyongyang .
the draft resolution " condemns in the strongest terms " north korea 's nuclear test last month and demands that it " not conduct any further nuclear test or any launch using ballistic missile technology . "
the draft calls for tougher inspections of north korean cargo vessels and for a cutting of financial ties with the country .
the existing arms embargo is to be stepped up . " the efforts made for a resolution were rewarded with success , " germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said during a visit to moscow .
" we expect a vote at the security council by friday at the latest , " he told a news conference after talks with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov .

" with the entry into office of president obama , there is a genuine chance for new cooperation between the united states , the european union and russia , " steinmeier said .
" the ghost of the cold war has been banished ...
so i would like to say that the extended hand of the us president should be boldly accepted , " he said .
earlier , steinmeier told reporters that the security council 's five permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - as well as japan and south korea had agreed to toughen their stance against north korea after pyongyang tested a nuclear device and launched several missiles in recent weeks .
" the efforts made for a resolution were rewarded with success , " steinmeier said at a joint press conference with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov in moscow on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea has tested several missiles this year diplomats say the latest draft resolution " calls upon " countries to inspect north korean ships carrying suspicious cargo that might violate a partial un trade and arms embargo , although it does not demand it .
the document does , however , require governemnts to deny fuel to any suspicious north korea vessles and direct them to dock at " an appropriate and convenient port . "
reaching out disarmament was a key theme throughout steinmeier 's two-day visit to moscow , during which he also met with russian president dmitry medvedev .
in his address to the russian academy of science , steinmeier said that all nations should make constructive efforts to disarm .
" this has to be the year when international disarmament efforts move back to the top of the agenda , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said medvedev seemed ready to reduce its nuclear arsenal steinmeier stressed that the talks between russia and the us on replacing the 1991 strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- were " a vital step on the difficult path towards a world free of nuclear weapons . "
steinmeier called the warming of relations between the kremlin and the us a " unique historic opportunity . "
thawing fronts ?
us president obama is scheduled to travel to moscow early next month for key talks on a follow-up to start , which expires on december 5 .
us and russian negotiators have been holding preliminary meetings ahead of those talks .
moscow has said it wants to link the nuclear talks to washington 's plans to deploy an anti-missile shield in central europe - a plan the kremlin firmly opposes .
russian prime minister vladimir putin said the kremlin would consider getting rid of its nuclear arsenal if all other countries agreed to do so as well .
after meeting the german foreign minister , putin was asked if he could imagine a russia without nuclear weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what do we need nuclear weapons for ? "
putin asked " of course , " he answered .
" what do we need nuclear weapons for ? "
putin 's answer did have one caveat , however .
" if those who invented the atomic bomb , and used it , are prepared to do away with atom bombs , then we would welcome this , " he said , suggesting his country 's involvement is dependent on us disarmament .
the russian news agency interfax , however , has reported that russia wants to keep at least 1,500 nuclear warheads .
other business in addition to disarmament , steinmeier also spoke with russian leaders about combating the effects of the global financial crisis .
putin praised berlin 's active role in negotiating a plan to rescue struggling carmaker opel , which now counts russian state-owned lender sberbank as one of its major stakeholders .
the three leaders agreed to increase cooperation in the energy sector , particularly in renewable fuel sources and efficiency .
steinmeier also addressed the controversial topics of human rights and moscow 's relations with tbilisi in the wake of last year 's military conflict between russia and georgia .
he urged moscow to adopt a " constructive " role in the caucasus and stressed that unresolved territorial disputes did not have a place in the europe of the 21st century .
during a visit to the editorial office of the novaya gazeta , a newspaper known for being critical of the kremlin , steinmeier wrote that democracy and a free press go together like breathing and air. sje / hf / dpa / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" let me stress : this is a formal statement about the geographical spread of the disease ...
it is not in itself a cause for alarm , " the un secretary general told a press conference . " though infectious , this new virus has so far not been as severe as had been feared and death rates have been low , " he added .
" we must therefore be prepared .
our best response is a firm demonstration of global solidarity . " who director general margaret chan emphasized in geneva earlier thursday that the term pandemic indicates the geographical spread of the virus , not its severity .
sustained local transmissions outside the americas , have led it to raise the alert to six - indicating a full-blown pandemic chan added that the declaration of a " moderate " pandemic should not be a cause for panic and did not mean the global death toll of 150 from the a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- virus would sharply increase " the higher level of the pandemic does not necessarily mean we are going to see a more dangerous virus or see many more people falling severely ill or dying , " she said . however , she also said that she and the other health experts had determined that " the virus is spreading to a number of countries and is not stoppable . " the un body said it was neither recommending the closure of borders nor restrictions in movement of people , goods and services in the wake of its declaration . nations such as australia , britain , chile and japan – which are reporting growing numbers of infections – are being watched carefully as they are outside the americas , where swine flu was first detected in april . us already reacting in pandemic mode bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states have been acting at level six for weeks reactions to the pandemic announcement in the united states were muted as health officials confirmed that the us had been acting as if a pandemic was under way for weeks . thomas frieden , director of the center for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- , told a news conference the who declaration did not come as a surprise .
" there are no practical implications for most state and local governments , " he added . " here in the united states , the basic declaration is n't going to change our day-to-day activities , " added the cdc 's anne schuchat . according to the us experience , a global pandemic will have a number of specific features : the new h1n1 virus disproportionately makes younger people sick .
schuchat said 57 percent of us cases were among people aged 5 to 24 , and 41 percent of those hospitalized were in this younger age group . " the highest rates of hospitalization are actually in children under 5 , " schuchat said .
pregnant women , people with asthma or other chronic respiratory disease and diabetics needed to take special care and call a doctor if they had symptoms . the cdc said that all 50 states have had cases of infection by the h1n1 virus to such an extent that patients with specific flu-like symptoms - a fever above 104 degrees f , cough or other respiratory symptoms – are presumed to have the new virus . fears rise as southern hemisphere enters ' flu season bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the who is concerned how the developing world will cope health officials monitoring the spread of the disease are particularly concerned for countries in the southern hemisphere , where flu season is just getting under way .
the who ’ s margaret chan also said they were unsure how the virus would behave under the conditions of developing countries , which have thus far been largely spared from the virus . in other parts of the world , the big worry is that seasonal h1n1 and h3n2 viruses are still circulating .
the seasonal h1n1 has mutated into a form that resists the tamiflu vaccine , although it is still susceptible to the relenza alternative . experts fear if someone got infected with two strains at the same time , the viruses could recombine in the patient 's body and acquire new strengths and new drug resistance . outbreaks close schools in germany , hong kong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as many as 32 pupils were infected at the duesseldorf school meanwhile , city health officials confirmed that 32 students at the japanese international school in duesseldorf were infected with the h1n1 virus in the most concentrated outbreak of the virus so far in germany . most of the cases are not severe , only one of the students had to be treated at the city 's university hospital , said heiko schneitler , head of the duesseldorf health office .
all children have been placed in quarantine at home . most of the children affected were japanese , schneitler said .
duesseldorf is home to a large japanese community kathrin rebbe , a spokeswoman at the north-rhine westphalia health ministry said four additional cases of h1n1 had been detected at a school in nearby cologne . germany now has more than 100 confirmed cases of the swine flu virus .
the head of the robert koch institute , joerg hacker said he expected infections to rise . in hong kong , authorities took the decision to close all primary schools , kindergartens , child care centers and special schools for two weeks in an effort to control the spread of the virus after 12 pupils at a city secondary school were found to have contracted the a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- virus , chief executive donald tsang said . nda / hf / dpa / reuters / afp editor : charles penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no matter who wins , observers agree that it 's time for iran and the us to sit down at the negotiating table .
and the european union could act as a vital mediator . three candidates are running against iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is seeking a second term in friday 's presidential elections .
observers forecast that the reformists under former prime minister mir hossein mousavi have the best chances of beating ahmadinejad .
yet no matter who wins , the time has come for serious negotiations with the west regarding iran 's controversial nuclear program , said christian-peter hanelt , a middle east expert from the bertelsmann foundation .
" it is time for a rapprochement between iran , its neighbors and the west , " hanelt said .
" in order to pre-empt another confrontation in the middle east and further escalation as a result of the iranian nuclear program , american-iranian relations must be put on a sustainable footing after the iranian presidential elections . "
the european union could play a significant mediatory role in this process , said konstantin kosten , an expert on iran at the german council on foreign relations , dgap .
" the eu could certainly act as a bridge and door opener , " kosten said .
" direct contacts exist already with the iranian government and the most significant negotiating circles . "
the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana has been leading talks between iran and the so-called eu3 -lrb- referring to france , britain and germany -rrb- for years .
due to these contacts , eu officials could provide us diplomats with expertise and support .
us has full eu support the us administration has chosen a new path in its dealings with iran .
whereas former president george w. bush opted for confrontation , placing iran as part of its " axis of evil , " president barack obama is going for direct diplomacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uranium conversion facility in isfahan contributes to iran 's nuclear program in march , obama directly addressed the country 's leaders in a message to the iranian people on the occasion of nowruz , the iranian new year .
he offered tehran direct talks without any preconditions .
the us president has full backing from the eu , whose foreign ministers urged iran to take advantage of the change in us policy to seal a deal and end the stand-off over its nuclear ambitions .
" the eu warmly supports the new direction of us policy towards iran , which opens a window of opportunity for negotiations on all aspects of iran 's nuclear program and more broadly for engagement with iran , " the eu foreign ministers said in a statement in april .
washington can count on support by its european partners .
" the eu reaffirms its full and unequivocal support for efforts to find a negotiated long-term solution to the iranian nuclear issue , " the ministers said .
in addition to making it clear to tehran that the eu stands behind us policy , it 's also important to send signals of eu support to washington , said michael bauer , head of the middle east project at the center for applied policy research at the university of munich .
" there are not only proponents of this new policy towards iran in washington so i think a first step would be to essentially support the advocates and make clear to them that the european position clearly welcomes this willingness for talks , " bauer said .
compromise is necessary the main point of contention continues to be iran 's nuclear program and the country 's unwillingness to permit comprehensive and strict controls .
despite the eu 's repeated efforts to find a solution , negotiations have failed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's confrontational tone is popular among the rural poor hanelt said that only the us could provide the desired security guarantees for the territory of iran and recognition of its political system .
" for this reason , europe can now achieve more it if simply provides robust support for the us administration in its forthcoming rapprochement with tehran , " hanelt said .
bauer said iran wanted to be viewed as a " legitimate political actor " with the corresponding security guarantees .
" iran is first and foremost interested in recognition of its regime by the us , " bauer said .
" this is something the europeans ca n't offer . "
but iran was also in a strong position at the moment and its support was needed for positive developments in the region , he said .
" the us and barack obama will need iran to keep iraq stable , " bauer said .
" iran is needed to get a grip on the problems in afghanistan to some extent .
iran is an important player here . "
nuclear program will continue any hopes that iran will abandon its nuclear program are futile , though .
kosten said iran will want to remain at the helm when it comes to uranium enrichment and civilian use of nuclear power .
" the question is more whether a solution can be found which enables enrichment on iranian soil , " kosten said .
" there has to be an idea how iran can exercise its rights and therefore save face . "
even an attack by israel on iran 's nuclear facilities would put the program back by a few years , but would not stop it .
iran 's nuclear program as such is not up for discussion , bauer said .
" that has to be clear and i think it is to barack obama , " bauer said .
he said the west could at most hope to gain from iran a degree of transparency of its nuclear program through cooperation with the international atomic energy agency , which can ensure that it is a civilian nuclear program .
a turning point in iran the iranian people are considered to be among the most pro-western in the middle east .
and many , especially younger people , are fed up with ahmadinejad 's confrontational tone .
mousavi supporters have been taking to tehran 's streets for nightly demonstrations to express their discontent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mousavi supporter shows where he stands ruprecht polenz , chairman of the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee , said ahmadinejad 's defeat would mean a lot for the future of young iranians .
" when you consider what needs to happen so that the economic situation improves , so that all the young people who finish university each year really have an opportunity to find a good job , then economic reform is necessary , " polenz said .
" more intense trade relations are necessary especially with developed nations , such as european countries . "
but this requires iran to change its confrontational foreign policy and focus on cooperation , he said .
ultimately , though , the real power in iran is held by its supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei .
" indeed the ayatollah is the central player in iran 's political system , even when it comes to such matters like the nuclear program , " bauer said .
" in the end , the compromise will have to be made with the revolutionary leader . "

" the question is more whether a solution can be found which enables enrichment on iranian soil , " kosten said .
" there has to be an idea how iran can exercise its rights and therefore save face . "
even an attack by israel on iran 's nuclear facilities would put the program back by a few years , but would not stop it .
iran 's nuclear program as such is not up for discussion , bauer said .
" that has to be clear and i think it is to barack obama , " bauer said .
he said the west could at most hope to gain from iran a degree of transparency of its nuclear program through cooperation with the international atomic energy agency , which can ensure that it is a civilian nuclear program .
a turning point in iran the iranian people are considered to be among the most pro-western in the middle east .
and many , especially younger people , are fed up with ahmadinejad 's confrontational tone .
mousavi supporters have been taking to tehran 's streets for nightly demonstrations to express their discontent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mousavi supporter shows where he stands ruprecht polenz , chairman of the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee , said ahmadinejad 's defeat would mean a lot for the future of young iranians .
" when you consider what needs to happen so that the economic situation improves , so that all the young people who finish university each year really have an opportunity to find a good job , then economic reform is necessary , " polenz said .
" more intense trade relations are necessary especially with developed nations , such as european countries . "
but this requires iran to change its confrontational foreign policy and focus on cooperation , he said .
ultimately , though , the real power in iran is held by its supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei .
" indeed the ayatollah is the central player in iran 's political system , even when it comes to such matters like the nuclear program , " bauer said .
" in the end , the compromise will have to be made with the revolutionary leader . "

no matter who wins , observers agree that it 's time for iran and the us to sit down at the negotiating table .
and the european union could act as a vital mediator . three candidates are running against iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is seeking a second term in friday 's presidential elections .
observers forecast that the reformists under former prime minister mir hossein mousavi have the best chances of beating ahmadinejad .
yet no matter who wins , the time has come for serious negotiations with the west regarding iran 's controversial nuclear program , said christian-peter hanelt , a middle east expert from the bertelsmann foundation .
" it is time for a rapprochement between iran , its neighbors and the west , " hanelt said .
" in order to pre-empt another confrontation in the middle east and further escalation as a result of the iranian nuclear program , american-iranian relations must be put on a sustainable footing after the iranian presidential elections . "
the european union could play a significant mediatory role in this process , said konstantin kosten , an expert on iran at the german council on foreign relations , dgap .
" the eu could certainly act as a bridge and door opener , " kosten said .
" direct contacts exist already with the iranian government and the most significant negotiating circles . "
the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana has been leading talks between iran and the so-called eu3 -lrb- referring to france , britain and germany -rrb- for years .
due to these contacts , eu officials could provide us diplomats with expertise and support .
us has full eu support the us administration has chosen a new path in its dealings with iran .
whereas former president george w. bush opted for confrontation , placing iran as part of its " axis of evil , " president barack obama is going for direct diplomacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uranium conversion facility in isfahan contributes to iran 's nuclear program in march , obama directly addressed the country 's leaders in a message to the iranian people on the occasion of nowruz , the iranian new year .
he offered tehran direct talks without any preconditions .
the us president has full backing from the eu , whose foreign ministers urged iran to take advantage of the change in us policy to seal a deal and end the stand-off over its nuclear ambitions .
" the eu warmly supports the new direction of us policy towards iran , which opens a window of opportunity for negotiations on all aspects of iran 's nuclear program and more broadly for engagement with iran , " the eu foreign ministers said in a statement in april .
washington can count on support by its european partners .
" the eu reaffirms its full and unequivocal support for efforts to find a negotiated long-term solution to the iranian nuclear issue , " the ministers said .
in addition to making it clear to tehran that the eu stands behind us policy , it 's also important to send signals of eu support to washington , said michael bauer , head of the middle east project at the center for applied policy research at the university of munich .
" there are not only proponents of this new policy towards iran in washington so i think a first step would be to essentially support the advocates and make clear to them that the european position clearly welcomes this willingness for talks , " bauer said .
compromise is necessary the main point of contention continues to be iran 's nuclear program and the country 's unwillingness to permit comprehensive and strict controls .
despite the eu 's repeated efforts to find a solution , negotiations have failed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's confrontational tone is popular among the rural poor hanelt said that only the us could provide the desired security guarantees for the territory of iran and recognition of its political system .
" for this reason , europe can now achieve more it if simply provides robust support for the us administration in its forthcoming rapprochement with tehran , " hanelt said .
bauer said iran wanted to be viewed as a " legitimate political actor " with the corresponding security guarantees .
" iran is first and foremost interested in recognition of its regime by the us , " bauer said .
" this is something the europeans ca n't offer . "
but iran was also in a strong position at the moment and its support was needed for positive developments in the region , he said .
" the us and barack obama will need iran to keep iraq stable , " bauer said .
" iran is needed to get a grip on the problems in afghanistan to some extent .
iran is an important player here . "
nuclear program will continue any hopes that iran will abandon its nuclear program are futile , though .
kosten said iran will want to remain at the helm when it comes to uranium enrichment and civilian use of nuclear power .
" the question is more whether a solution can be found which enables enrichment on iranian soil , " kosten said .

it allows a person to travel through much of the european union on a single visa .

federal officials only learned about it in april and ordered it revoked .
" we asked bonn to revoke the permit and they responded immediately , " hanns schumacher , germany 's ambassador to thailand , told reuters on wednesday .
bonn authorities said thaksin 's name had not been on a list of people barred from germany and he had presented all the necessary documents .
this included a certificate from a german federal justice agency saying he had no criminal record .
he had also proved he had adequate funds to live and a valid passport .
officials said the absence of his name from the list of barred persons was the result of a data-entry oversight by staff of the german foreign ministry .
" we informed the lawyer that the permit was revoked and should thaksin still be in germany , his stay would be illegal and he would face detention , " schumacher said .

federal officials only learned about it in april and ordered it revoked .
" we asked bonn to revoke the permit and they responded immediately , " hanns schumacher , germany 's ambassador to thailand , told reuters on wednesday .
bonn authorities said thaksin 's name had not been on a list of people barred from germany and he had presented all the necessary documents .
this included a certificate from a german federal justice agency saying he had no criminal record .
he had also proved he had adequate funds to live and a valid passport .
officials said the absence of his name from the list of barred persons was the result of a data-entry oversight by staff of the german foreign ministry .
" we informed the lawyer that the permit was revoked and should thaksin still be in germany , his stay would be illegal and he would face detention , " schumacher said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 11.06.2009 eu should play key role in us negotiations with iran , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranians head to the polls on friday in a bitterly fought election iranians elect a new president on friday .
no matter who wins , observers agree that it 's time for iran and the us to sit down at the negotiating table .
and the european union could act as a vital mediator . three candidates are running against iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is seeking a second term in friday 's presidential elections .
observers forecast that the reformists under former prime minister mir hossein mousavi have the best chances of beating ahmadinejad .
yet no matter who wins , the time has come for serious negotiations with the west regarding iran 's controversial nuclear program , said christian-peter hanelt , a middle east expert from the bertelsmann foundation .
" it is time for a rapprochement between iran , its neighbors and the west , " hanelt said .
" in order to pre-empt another confrontation in the middle east and further escalation as a result of the iranian nuclear program , american-iranian relations must be put on a sustainable footing after the iranian presidential elections . "
the european union could play a significant mediatory role in this process , said konstantin kosten , an expert on iran at the german council on foreign relations , dgap .
" the eu could certainly act as a bridge and door opener , " kosten said .
" direct contacts exist already with the iranian government and the most significant negotiating circles . "
the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana has been leading talks between iran and the so-called eu3 -lrb- referring to france , britain and germany -rrb- for years .
due to these contacts , eu officials could provide us diplomats with expertise and support .
us has full eu support the us administration has chosen a new path in its dealings with iran .
whereas former president george w. bush opted for confrontation , placing iran as part of its " axis of evil , " president barack obama is going for direct diplomacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uranium conversion facility in isfahan contributes to iran 's nuclear program in march , obama directly addressed the country 's leaders in a message to the iranian people on the occasion of nowruz , the iranian new year .
he offered tehran direct talks without any preconditions .
the us president has full backing from the eu , whose foreign ministers urged iran to take advantage of the change in us policy to seal a deal and end the stand-off over its nuclear ambitions .
" the eu warmly supports the new direction of us policy towards iran , which opens a window of opportunity for negotiations on all aspects of iran 's nuclear program and more broadly for engagement with iran , " the eu foreign ministers said in a statement in april .
washington can count on support by its european partners .
" the eu reaffirms its full and unequivocal support for efforts to find a negotiated long-term solution to the iranian nuclear issue , " the ministers said .
in addition to making it clear to tehran that the eu stands behind us policy , it 's also important to send signals of eu support to washington , said michael bauer , head of the middle east project at the center for applied policy research at the university of munich .
" there are not only proponents of this new policy towards iran in washington so i think a first step would be to essentially support the advocates and make clear to them that the european position clearly welcomes this willingness for talks , " bauer said .
compromise is necessary the main point of contention continues to be iran 's nuclear program and the country 's unwillingness to permit comprehensive and strict controls .
despite the eu 's repeated efforts to find a solution , negotiations have failed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's confrontational tone is popular among the rural poor hanelt said that only the us could provide the desired security guarantees for the territory of iran and recognition of its political system .
" for this reason , europe can now achieve more it if simply provides robust support for the us administration in its forthcoming rapprochement with tehran , " hanelt said .
bauer said iran wanted to be viewed as a " legitimate political actor " with the corresponding security guarantees .
" iran is first and foremost interested in recognition of its regime by the us , " bauer said .
" this is something the europeans ca n't offer . "
but iran was also in a strong position at the moment and its support was needed for positive developments in the region , he said .
" the us and barack obama will need iran to keep iraq stable , " bauer said .
" iran is needed to get a grip on the problems in afghanistan to some extent .
iran is an important player here . "
nuclear program will continue any hopes that iran will abandon its nuclear program are futile , though .
kosten said iran will want to remain at the helm when it comes to uranium enrichment and civilian use of nuclear power .
" the question is more whether a solution can be found which enables enrichment on iranian soil , " kosten said .
" there has to be an idea how iran can exercise its rights and therefore save face . "
even an attack by israel on iran 's nuclear facilities would put the program back by a few years , but would not stop it .
iran 's nuclear program as such is not up for discussion , bauer said .
" that has to be clear and i think it is to barack obama , " bauer said .
he said the west could at most hope to gain from iran a degree of transparency of its nuclear program through cooperation with the international atomic energy agency , which can ensure that it is a civilian nuclear program .
a turning point in iran the iranian people are considered to be among the most pro-western in the middle east .
and many , especially younger people , are fed up with ahmadinejad 's confrontational tone .
mousavi supporters have been taking to tehran 's streets for nightly demonstrations to express their discontent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mousavi supporter shows where he stands ruprecht polenz , chairman of the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee , said ahmadinejad 's defeat would mean a lot for the future of young iranians .
" when you consider what needs to happen so that the economic situation improves , so that all the young people who finish university each year really have an opportunity to find a good job , then economic reform is necessary , " polenz said .
" more intense trade relations are necessary especially with developed nations , such as european countries . "
but this requires iran to change its confrontational foreign policy and focus on cooperation , he said .
ultimately , though , the real power in iran is held by its supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei .
" indeed the ayatollah is the central player in iran 's political system , even when it comes to such matters like the nuclear program , " bauer said .
" in the end , the compromise will have to be made with the revolutionary leader . "

the draft urges countries to inspect north korean vessels , to cut back financial ties and expand the arms embargo . the five permanent members of the security council plus japan and south korea on wednesday agreed on a package of expanded sanctions against pyongyang .
the draft resolution " condemns in the strongest terms " north korea 's nuclear test last month and demands that it " not conduct any further nuclear test or any launch using ballistic missile technology . "
the draft calls for tougher inspections of north korean cargo vessels and for a cutting of financial ties with the country .
the existing arms embargo is to be stepped up . " the efforts made for a resolution were rewarded with success , " germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said during a visit to moscow .
" we expect a vote at the security council by friday at the latest , " he told a news conference after talks with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov .
the draft is a compromise as both china and russia had objected to earlier versions which would have required all countries to inspect north korean ships carrying suspicious cargo .
the latest draft now merely " calls upon " states to inspect the vessels .

rice said north korea 's behaviour was unacceptable and stressed that the objective of the new resolution was to get pyongyang to enter international talks .
" they must pay a price , they are to return without conditions to a process of negotiations and that the consequences they will face are significant , " rice told reporters .
" this sanctions regime , if passed by the security council , will bite in a meaningful way , " she said . north korea launched a long-range missile in april , triggering a rebuke from the un security council .
the regime in pyongyang then responded by declaring it had staged a successful nuclear weapons test , following one in 2006 .
according to russian and south korean officials , north korea is currently preparing yet another test-launch of a long-range missile. ai / ap / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite soaking up billions of euros in subsidies , germany 's eastern states still suffer from higher unemployment and lower productivity and per capita wealth .
migration is also a big problem .
but it appears that germany 's deepest recession since world war ii is having an unexpected side effect .
" so far , the east has not been hit as hard , " tiefensee said .
" twenty years after the peaceful revolution and the fall of the wall , the achievements of the east germans are being recognized in 2009 , " tiefensee told reporters after presenting the report to the cabinet .
smaller enterprises aiding eastern states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee presents the 2009 unity report tiefensee said that the eastern states are home to a larger proportion of smaller firms which are more flexible than big companies and less dependent on exports , which have slumped in the last few months .
he pointed in particular to the technology sector , where growth is higher in eastern states , especially in the solar energy sector which is strong there .
meanwhile the manufacturing industry in the west , which is heavily reliant on exports , has borne the brunt of the global downturn .
tiefensee noted that the western states ' " unprecedented solidarity " with the east , including more than one trillion euros in subsidies since national unification in 1990 , had been crucial to getting the region back on its feet .
gross national product per person in the east rose to 71 percent of that of a westerner last year , compared to 67 percent in 2000 , the report said .
industry in the east has grown by 7.5 percent over the last three years , compared to 4.3 percent in the west .
unemployment still a germany-wide problem tiefensee said that while unemployment had stayed roughly stable in eastern states in the last year , it had risen to 6.9 percent in may in western states from 6.4 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has stabilized in the east but is still high dspite the positive figures , divisions between eastern and western germany are still wide .
jobless figures are still twice as high in the east as in western states and long-term unemployment is a major problem .
unemployment stands at 13.3 percent in eastern states and is likely to rise further still in the coming months .
job migration is also a big problem .
young people , especially women , tend to abandon the east in search of work , leaving some areas as a wasteland .
about 90,000 people ditched the east for the west each year in the recent past , against just 40,000 people moving east .
" we have come a long way , but there is still a lot of work to do , " tiefensee said , adding that so-called " solidarity tax " payments to the east would likely continue for another decade , until 2019 .
by that time , he said , some of the eastern states could even overtake poorer western regions in terms of gross domestic product .
opposition accuses minister of election games opposition parties seized on the report to accuse tiefensee of scoring points for his social democrats , the junior partners in germany 's ruling coalition with chancellor merkel 's conservatives , ahead of the september general election .
" it is a clumsy attempt to win votes in the east when you tell people that the rest of the job will be finished in 10 years , " expert on eastern affairs for the liberal free democrats , joachim guenther , said. nda , afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has expressed the hope that israeli-palestinian peace efforts would resume in the near future . " a lot of important things are taking place , " he told reporters in jerusalem .
the eu 's foreign policy coordinator said that us president barack obama 's recent speech to the muslim world had been a crucial step in the right direction .
obama had urged the two sides in the middle east conflict to find a lasting settlement .
solana also mentioned last week 's elections in lebanon where iranian-backed hezbollah failed to capitalize on anti-israeli sentiment .
solana said it was a good time to " see how we can bring back the situation to something that can be moving in the right direction . "
last year , the peace process was dealt a setback by the israeli military offensive in the gaza strip .
solana added that he expected israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to endorse a two-state solution and to freeze israeli settlement in the palestinian territories .
" that 's what we expect to hear and i am sure something of that nature will happen , " solana said in reference to a speech netanyahu announced for sunday where he will outline his government 's policies on the peace process .
so far , netanyahu who heads a right-of-center coalition , has refused to publicly back a palestinian state or order a halt to settlement construction .
solana is to continue his tour of the middle east by meeting with palestinian , lebanese and egyptian leaders. ai / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the draft urges countries to inspect north korean vessels , to cut back financial ties and expand the arms embargo . the five permanent members of the security council plus japan and south korea on wednesday agreed on a package of expanded sanctions against pyongyang .
the draft resolution " condemns in the strongest terms " north korea 's nuclear test last month and demands that it " not conduct any further nuclear test or any launch using ballistic missile technology . "
the draft calls for tougher inspections of north korean cargo vessels and for a cutting of financial ties with the country .

the gunman remains in a critical condition , mayor adrian fenty said .
the lone gunman 's identity or connections to anti-semitic groups could not be confirmed but media reports said he was believed to be known as white supremacist james w von brunn .
von brunn is thought to be behind numerous anti-semitic articles posted on the internet , including a book called " kill the best gentiles , " which he calls " a new hard-hitting expose of the jewish conspiracy to destroy the white gene pool . "
" it appears to be a lone gunman who entered into the museum and opened fire with what appears to be a rifle at this point , " washington police chief cathy lanier said .
museum officials identified the guard as officer stephen tyrone johns , who had worked at the museum for six years .
" i am shocked and saddened by today 's shooting at the us holocaust memorial museum , " us president barack obama said in a statement .
" this outrageous act reminds us that we must remain vigilant against anti-semitism and prejudice in all its forms .
" no american institution is more important to this effort than the holocaust museum , and no act of violence will diminish our determination to honor those who were lost by building a more peaceful and tolerant world , " he added .

the gunman remains in a critical condition , mayor adrian fenty said .
the lone gunman 's identity or connections to anti-semitic groups could not be confirmed but media reports said he was believed to be known as white supremacist james w von brunn .
von brunn is thought to be behind numerous anti-semitic articles posted on the internet , including a book called " kill the best gentiles , " which he calls " a new hard-hitting expose of the jewish conspiracy to destroy the white gene pool . "
" it appears to be a lone gunman who entered into the museum and opened fire with what appears to be a rifle at this point , " washington police chief cathy lanier said .
museum officials identified the guard as officer stephen tyrone johns , who had worked at the museum for six years .
" i am shocked and saddened by today 's shooting at the us holocaust memorial museum , " us president barack obama said in a statement .
" this outrageous act reminds us that we must remain vigilant against anti-semitism and prejudice in all its forms .
" no american institution is more important to this effort than the holocaust museum , and no act of violence will diminish our determination to honor those who were lost by building a more peaceful and tolerant world , " he added .

he has expressed the hope that israeli-palestinian peace efforts would resume in the near future . " a lot of important things are taking place , " he told reporters in jerusalem .
the eu 's foreign policy coordinator said that us president barack obama 's recent speech to the muslim world had been a crucial step in the right direction .
obama had urged the two sides in the middle east conflict to find a lasting settlement .
solana also mentioned last week 's elections in lebanon where iranian-backed hezbollah failed to capitalize on anti-israeli sentiment .
solana said it was a good time to " see how we can bring back the situation to something that can be moving in the right direction . "
last year , the peace process was dealt a setback by the israeli military offensive in the gaza strip .
solana added that he expected israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to endorse a two-state solution and to freeze israeli settlement in the palestinian territories .
" that 's what we expect to hear and i am sure something of that nature will happen , " solana said in reference to a speech netanyahu announced for sunday where he will outline his government 's policies on the peace process .
so far , netanyahu who heads a right-of-center coalition , has refused to publicly back a palestinian state or order a halt to settlement construction .

the lone gunman 's identity or connections to anti-semitic groups could not be confirmed but media reports said he was believed to be known as white supremacist james w von brunn .
von brunn is thought to be behind numerous anti-semitic articles posted on the internet , including a book called " kill the best gentiles , " which he calls " a new hard-hitting expose of the jewish conspiracy to destroy the white gene pool . "
" it appears to be a lone gunman who entered into the museum and opened fire with what appears to be a rifle at this point , " washington police chief cathy lanier said .
museum officials identified the guard as officer stephen tyrone johns , who had worked at the museum for six years .
" i am shocked and saddened by today 's shooting at the us holocaust memorial museum , " us president barack obama said in a statement .
" this outrageous act reminds us that we must remain vigilant against anti-semitism and prejudice in all its forms .
" no american institution is more important to this effort than the holocaust museum , and no act of violence will diminish our determination to honor those who were lost by building a more peaceful and tolerant world , " he added .
obama last week became the first us president to visit the nazi death camp in buchenwald , germany where he renewed a historic commitment to israel .
the armed man carrying a long rifle entered the museum just blocks from the national mall and washington monument shortly before 1 pm -lrb- 1800 cet -rrb- and immediately fired at armed security guards , police chief lanier told reporters .
two security guards returned fire and johns and the gunman were wounded .
local media reports said a third person was hit by glass but the extent of those injuries are unknown .
museum no stranger to threats and abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum opened in 1993 security director joseph rosboschil said the museum receives occasional threats but there had been " nothing significant of late . "
rosboschil also said the museum had more security measures than other washington museums .
sara j bloomfield , director of the museum , said this apparent act of intolerance and hatred was " even more reason for this museum to exist . "
the council on american-islamic relations , a muslim civil liberties and advocacy group , said in a statement that it condemned " this apparent bias-motivated attack " and stands with the " jewish community and with americans of all faiths in repudiating the kind of hatred and intolerance that can lead to such disturbing incidents . "
more than 30 million people have visited the museum since its opening in 1993 , including 85 heads of state. nda , afp / dpa / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has expressed the hope that israeli-palestinian peace efforts would resume in the near future . " a lot of important things are taking place , " he told reporters in jerusalem .
the eu 's foreign policy coordinator said that us president barack obama 's recent speech to the muslim world had been a crucial step in the right direction .
obama had urged the two sides in the middle east conflict to find a lasting settlement .
solana also mentioned last week 's elections in lebanon where iranian-backed hezbollah failed to capitalize on anti-israeli sentiment .
solana said it was a good time to " see how we can bring back the situation to something that can be moving in the right direction . "
last year , the peace process was dealt a setback by the israeli military offensive in the gaza strip .
solana added that he expected israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to endorse a two-state solution and to freeze israeli settlement in the palestinian territories .
" that 's what we expect to hear and i am sure something of that nature will happen , " solana said in reference to a speech netanyahu announced for sunday where he will outline his government 's policies on the peace process .
so far , netanyahu who heads a right-of-center coalition , has refused to publicly back a palestinian state or order a halt to settlement construction .
solana is to continue his tour of the middle east by meeting with palestinian , lebanese and egyptian leaders. ai / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 11.06.2009 eu should play key role in us negotiations with iran , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranians head to the polls on friday in a bitterly fought election iranians elect a new president on friday .
no matter who wins , observers agree that it 's time for iran and the us to sit down at the negotiating table .
and the european union could act as a vital mediator . three candidates are running against iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is seeking a second term in friday 's presidential elections .
observers forecast that the reformists under former prime minister mir hossein mousavi have the best chances of beating ahmadinejad .
yet no matter who wins , the time has come for serious negotiations with the west regarding iran 's controversial nuclear program , said christian-peter hanelt , a middle east expert from the bertelsmann foundation .
" it is time for a rapprochement between iran , its neighbors and the west , " hanelt said .
" in order to pre-empt another confrontation in the middle east and further escalation as a result of the iranian nuclear program , american-iranian relations must be put on a sustainable footing after the iranian presidential elections . "
the european union could play a significant mediatory role in this process , said konstantin kosten , an expert on iran at the german council on foreign relations , dgap .
" the eu could certainly act as a bridge and door opener , " kosten said .
" direct contacts exist already with the iranian government and the most significant negotiating circles . "
the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana has been leading talks between iran and the so-called eu3 -lrb- referring to france , britain and germany -rrb- for years .
due to these contacts , eu officials could provide us diplomats with expertise and support .
us has full eu support the us administration has chosen a new path in its dealings with iran .
whereas former president george w. bush opted for confrontation , placing iran as part of its " axis of evil , " president barack obama is going for direct diplomacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uranium conversion facility in isfahan contributes to iran 's nuclear program in march , obama directly addressed the country 's leaders in a message to the iranian people on the occasion of nowruz , the iranian new year .
he offered tehran direct talks without any preconditions .
the us president has full backing from the eu , whose foreign ministers urged iran to take advantage of the change in us policy to seal a deal and end the stand-off over its nuclear ambitions .
" the eu warmly supports the new direction of us policy towards iran , which opens a window of opportunity for negotiations on all aspects of iran 's nuclear program and more broadly for engagement with iran , " the eu foreign ministers said in a statement in april .
washington can count on support by its european partners .
" the eu reaffirms its full and unequivocal support for efforts to find a negotiated long-term solution to the iranian nuclear issue , " the ministers said .
in addition to making it clear to tehran that the eu stands behind us policy , it 's also important to send signals of eu support to washington , said michael bauer , head of the middle east project at the center for applied policy research at the university of munich .
" there are not only proponents of this new policy towards iran in washington so i think a first step would be to essentially support the advocates and make clear to them that the european position clearly welcomes this willingness for talks , " bauer said .
compromise is necessary the main point of contention continues to be iran 's nuclear program and the country 's unwillingness to permit comprehensive and strict controls .
despite the eu 's repeated efforts to find a solution , negotiations have failed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's confrontational tone is popular among the rural poor hanelt said that only the us could provide the desired security guarantees for the territory of iran and recognition of its political system .
" for this reason , europe can now achieve more it if simply provides robust support for the us administration in its forthcoming rapprochement with tehran , " hanelt said .
bauer said iran wanted to be viewed as a " legitimate political actor " with the corresponding security guarantees .
" iran is first and foremost interested in recognition of its regime by the us , " bauer said .
" this is something the europeans ca n't offer . "
but iran was also in a strong position at the moment and its support was needed for positive developments in the region , he said .
" the us and barack obama will need iran to keep iraq stable , " bauer said .
" iran is needed to get a grip on the problems in afghanistan to some extent .
iran is an important player here . "
nuclear program will continue any hopes that iran will abandon its nuclear program are futile , though .
kosten said iran will want to remain at the helm when it comes to uranium enrichment and civilian use of nuclear power .
" the question is more whether a solution can be found which enables enrichment on iranian soil , " kosten said .
" there has to be an idea how iran can exercise its rights and therefore save face . "
even an attack by israel on iran 's nuclear facilities would put the program back by a few years , but would not stop it .
iran 's nuclear program as such is not up for discussion , bauer said .
" that has to be clear and i think it is to barack obama , " bauer said .
he said the west could at most hope to gain from iran a degree of transparency of its nuclear program through cooperation with the international atomic energy agency , which can ensure that it is a civilian nuclear program .
a turning point in iran the iranian people are considered to be among the most pro-western in the middle east .
and many , especially younger people , are fed up with ahmadinejad 's confrontational tone .
mousavi supporters have been taking to tehran 's streets for nightly demonstrations to express their discontent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mousavi supporter shows where he stands ruprecht polenz , chairman of the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee , said ahmadinejad 's defeat would mean a lot for the future of young iranians .
" when you consider what needs to happen so that the economic situation improves , so that all the young people who finish university each year really have an opportunity to find a good job , then economic reform is necessary , " polenz said .
" more intense trade relations are necessary especially with developed nations , such as european countries . "
but this requires iran to change its confrontational foreign policy and focus on cooperation , he said .
ultimately , though , the real power in iran is held by its supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei .
" indeed the ayatollah is the central player in iran 's political system , even when it comes to such matters like the nuclear program , " bauer said .
" in the end , the compromise will have to be made with the revolutionary leader . "

but the government says it needs more details before it can make a decision . the interior ministry said on thursday that it was unable to accept the us request based on the data provided .
" we 're examining two new cases , " ministry spokesman stefan paris said in berlin .
" the information provided by the united states is not sufficient for now for us to give the green light for taking in the two men . "
the interior ministry would need to check whether the prisoners represented a security risk , he said .
also , berlin needed to know why the men could not be taken in by the us and what ties they had to germany .
paris would not disclose the nationality of the two men .
security sources said one was syrian , the other tunisian .
resistance at home and abroad in april , the us made an initial request , presenting the german government with a list of nine chinese uighur detainees for berlin to " consider . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palau is offering 17 uighers a new temporary home interior minister wolfgang schaeuble had also replied in that case that the information provided was insufficient to warrant a positive reply .
us president barack obama has pledged to close the facility at the us naval base at guantanamo bay , cuba by early next year .
many of the inmates have already been cleared for release .
but us officials are having difficulty finding countries that will take them in , and meeting resistance at home to housing them on us soil .
the tiny pacific nation palau on agreed wednesday to take in up to 17 uighur guantanamo detainees .
four further uighur men who had been held at the prison camp were sent to bermuda on thursday .
sharp political debate german politicians have disagreed on the issue .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat candidate to challenge chancellor angela merkel in september 's federal election , has spoken in favor of accepting inmates .
but interior minister schaeuble has voiced skepticism .
on a visit to germany last week , obama said after talks with merkel that he had neither asked for nor received any hard commitments from berlin on taking guantanamo detainees .
he said merkel had been " very open " to discussions on the issue .
opposition politicians have been very critical of the government 's stance .
claudia roth , co-leader of the green party , said schaeuble was using " stalling tactics . "
" he 's acting on the maxim : we do n't know anything , we have to check things first , we have to deliberate so long until someone else takes this decision of our hands , " roth said in reference to the uighur case .
michael leutert , the human rights spokesman for the left party 's parliamentary group , said accepting the inmates was " a simple humanitarian act . "
" it is not plausible that two people proven innocent pose an uncalculated security risk for germany , " leutert said .
he said the german government needed to promptly " consider favorably " the us request. sac / afp / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has expressed the hope that israeli-palestinian peace efforts would resume in the near future . " a lot of important things are taking place , " he told reporters in jerusalem .

obama had urged the two sides in the middle east conflict to find a lasting settlement .
solana also mentioned last week 's elections in lebanon where iranian-backed hezbollah failed to capitalize on anti-israeli sentiment .
solana said it was a good time to " see how we can bring back the situation to something that can be moving in the right direction . "
last year , the peace process was dealt a setback by the israeli military offensive in the gaza strip .
solana added that he expected israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to endorse a two-state solution and to freeze israeli settlement in the palestinian territories .
" that 's what we expect to hear and i am sure something of that nature will happen , " solana said in reference to a speech netanyahu announced for sunday where he will outline his government 's policies on the peace process .
so far , netanyahu who heads a right-of-center coalition , has refused to publicly back a palestinian state or order a halt to settlement construction .

" important personnel and policy decisions must be taken immediately .
that is why germany and france support jose manuel barroso , " merkel said at a joint press conference with sarkozy in paris .
there is a " strong desire " in the newly-elected eu parliament that the choice of a new ec head should not take the entire summer , she said .
" we will support the candidacy of mr. barroso , without ambiguity , " sarkozy said at a joint news conference at the elysee presidential palace .
but the support for the incumbent was not unconditional , sarkozy added .
" madame merkel and i support barroso , " he said .
" but we call on him before a second term to clarify , and in a way make formal , his position , " the french president said .
barroso must commit himself to a europe that protects its citizens , sarkozy said .
the portuguese ec president has been criticized for waffling on a number of important issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso , right , will stand unchallenged for a second term french green party politician daniel cohn-bendit , whose pro-environment coalition scored an impressive success in last sunday 's eu elections , said earlier this week he would try to cobble together a majority in the eu parliament to " get rid of " barroso .
eu leaders meeting are set to grant a second five-year term to barroso , the only candidate for the top post , at their summit in brussels next thursday and friday .
barroso 's mandate expires in october , but he is seeking a second term despite the european union 's struggle to reform and criticism of its response to the financial crisis .
leaders pledge to press lisbon 's case sarkozy added that he would be prepared to travel to ireland to help gather support for a referendum over the european union 's stalled lisbon treaty .
" mrs. merkel and i will do everything we can to help the irish make the choice for lisbon , " he told the joint news conference .
" if it is of use , i would even be ready to travel to ireland to support them , " he said .
the two leaders also expressed their concern for the well-being of imprisoned burmese opposition leader aung san suu kyi .

despite soaking up billions of euros in subsidies , germany 's eastern states still suffer from higher unemployment and lower productivity and per capita wealth .
migration is also a big problem .
but it appears that germany 's deepest recession since world war ii is having an unexpected side effect .
" so far , the east has not been hit as hard , " tiefensee said .
" twenty years after the peaceful revolution and the fall of the wall , the achievements of the east germans are being recognized in 2009 , " tiefensee told reporters after presenting the report to the cabinet .
smaller enterprises aiding eastern states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee presents the 2009 unity report tiefensee said that the eastern states are home to a larger proportion of smaller firms which are more flexible than big companies and less dependent on exports , which have slumped in the last few months .
he pointed in particular to the technology sector , where growth is higher in eastern states , especially in the solar energy sector which is strong there .
meanwhile the manufacturing industry in the west , which is heavily reliant on exports , has borne the brunt of the global downturn .
tiefensee noted that the western states ' " unprecedented solidarity " with the east , including more than one trillion euros in subsidies since national unification in 1990 , had been crucial to getting the region back on its feet .
gross national product per person in the east rose to 71 percent of that of a westerner last year , compared to 67 percent in 2000 , the report said .
industry in the east has grown by 7.5 percent over the last three years , compared to 4.3 percent in the west .
unemployment still a germany-wide problem tiefensee said that while unemployment had stayed roughly stable in eastern states in the last year , it had risen to 6.9 percent in may in western states from 6.4 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has stabilized in the east but is still high dspite the positive figures , divisions between eastern and western germany are still wide .
jobless figures are still twice as high in the east as in western states and long-term unemployment is a major problem .
unemployment stands at 13.3 percent in eastern states and is likely to rise further still in the coming months .
job migration is also a big problem .
young people , especially women , tend to abandon the east in search of work , leaving some areas as a wasteland .
about 90,000 people ditched the east for the west each year in the recent past , against just 40,000 people moving east .
" we have come a long way , but there is still a lot of work to do , " tiefensee said , adding that so-called " solidarity tax " payments to the east would likely continue for another decade , until 2019 .
by that time , he said , some of the eastern states could even overtake poorer western regions in terms of gross domestic product .
opposition accuses minister of election games opposition parties seized on the report to accuse tiefensee of scoring points for his social democrats , the junior partners in germany 's ruling coalition with chancellor merkel 's conservatives , ahead of the september general election .
" it is a clumsy attempt to win votes in the east when you tell people that the rest of the job will be finished in 10 years , " expert on eastern affairs for the liberal free democrats , joachim guenther , said. nda , afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the latest eu report puts greece and cyprus in the top spots for the cleanest beaches . the overall quality of bathing water in the eu has markedly improved since 1990 .
according to the latest annual bathing water report by the european commission and european environment agency eea , most of europe 's 21,400 bathing sites have clean water .
" high quality bathing water is essential for the well-being of european citizens and the environment , " environment commissioner stavros dimas told reporters on thursday .
" europe 's bathing sites remain clean and water quality is high . "
during the 2008 bathing season , 96 percent of coastal bathing areas and 92 percent of bathing sites in rivers and lakes complied with minimum standards , dimas said .
compliance with such mandatory values were 80 percent and 52 percent respectively in 1990 .
greece and cyprus have the cleanest beaches in the eu , while some of the purest lakes and rivers can be found in finland , sweden and germany , the report said .
however , the commission also said that clean water did not necessarily mean that the beaches themselves were also clean .
poland is the worst country in europe to go swimming in , whether in the sea , rivers or lakes , with 14.4 percent of all bathing water non-compliant with mandatory standards .
the report found that many areas of the baltic sea are suffering from an overgrowth of algae , while a relatively high number of dirty waters are found around denmark , poland and britain .
testing is still lagging behind in new eu member states romania and bulgaria .
getting people involved each year , the eu tests its waters for possible bacteriological contamination deriving from industrial waste or agriculture .
water color , acidity , and the presence of residues from detergents are also tested .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy is home to more than one third of the eu 's beaches but the report can do more than just inform europeans and tourists about where they can safely take the plunge .
it also serves as a guide to get more people involved in their local surroundings , said eea 's executive director jacqueline mcglade .
" information sources like this report and our web-based viewing tools enable citizens not only to check the quality of the bathing water in their local community or holiday destination , but also to allow them to get more actively involved in the protection of their environment , " mcglade said .
italy closed most sites more than one third of the eu 's 14,500 beaches are found in italy .
the report showed that the mediterranean country stood out with 553 coastal beaches and freshwater sites where bathing had been closed or banned throughout the 2008 season .
this was far more than in other countries .
mcglade said it was " too early to say " whether there had been an improvement at those sites since last year as the data was not yet available .
of the 14,551 coastal bathing areas in the european union , bathing was banned or closed throughout the season in only 307 sites and was found not to be complying with eu standards in 208 sites .
among the 6,890 freshwater sites , bathing was banned at 315 sites and was not up to eu standards in 196. sac / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the latest eu report puts greece and cyprus in the top spots for the cleanest beaches . the overall quality of bathing water in the eu has markedly improved since 1990 .
according to the latest annual bathing water report by the european commission and european environment agency eea , most of europe 's 21,400 bathing sites have clean water .
" high quality bathing water is essential for the well-being of european citizens and the environment , " environment commissioner stavros dimas told reporters on thursday .
" europe 's bathing sites remain clean and water quality is high . "
during the 2008 bathing season , 96 percent of coastal bathing areas and 92 percent of bathing sites in rivers and lakes complied with minimum standards , dimas said .
compliance with such mandatory values were 80 percent and 52 percent respectively in 1990 .
greece and cyprus have the cleanest beaches in the eu , while some of the purest lakes and rivers can be found in finland , sweden and germany , the report said .
however , the commission also said that clean water did not necessarily mean that the beaches themselves were also clean .
poland is the worst country in europe to go swimming in , whether in the sea , rivers or lakes , with 14.4 percent of all bathing water non-compliant with mandatory standards .
the report found that many areas of the baltic sea are suffering from an overgrowth of algae , while a relatively high number of dirty waters are found around denmark , poland and britain .
testing is still lagging behind in new eu member states romania and bulgaria .
getting people involved each year , the eu tests its waters for possible bacteriological contamination deriving from industrial waste or agriculture .
water color , acidity , and the presence of residues from detergents are also tested .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy is home to more than one third of the eu 's beaches but the report can do more than just inform europeans and tourists about where they can safely take the plunge .
it also serves as a guide to get more people involved in their local surroundings , said eea 's executive director jacqueline mcglade .
" information sources like this report and our web-based viewing tools enable citizens not only to check the quality of the bathing water in their local community or holiday destination , but also to allow them to get more actively involved in the protection of their environment , " mcglade said .
italy closed most sites more than one third of the eu 's 14,500 beaches are found in italy .
the report showed that the mediterranean country stood out with 553 coastal beaches and freshwater sites where bathing had been closed or banned throughout the 2008 season .
this was far more than in other countries .
mcglade said it was " too early to say " whether there had been an improvement at those sites since last year as the data was not yet available .
of the 14,551 coastal bathing areas in the european union , bathing was banned or closed throughout the season in only 307 sites and was found not to be complying with eu standards in 208 sites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 11.06.2009 steinmeier pushes for arms cuts on moscow visit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's agenda in moscow covered a lot of ground german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on a visit to moscow urged russian leaders not to miss an opportunity for improved ties with the us and a new deal on global nuclear disarmament . " with the entry into office of president obama , there is a genuine chance for new cooperation between the united states , the european union and russia , " steinmeier said .
" the ghost of the cold war has been banished ...
so i would like to say that the extended hand of the us president should be boldly accepted , " he said .
earlier , steinmeier told reporters that the security council 's five permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - as well as japan and south korea had agreed to toughen their stance against north korea after pyongyang tested a nuclear device and launched several missiles in recent weeks .
" the efforts made for a resolution were rewarded with success , " steinmeier said at a joint press conference with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov in moscow on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea has tested several missiles this year diplomats say the latest draft resolution " calls upon " countries to inspect north korean ships carrying suspicious cargo that might violate a partial un trade and arms embargo , although it does not demand it .
the document does , however , require governemnts to deny fuel to any suspicious north korea vessles and direct them to dock at " an appropriate and convenient port . "
reaching out disarmament was a key theme throughout steinmeier 's two-day visit to moscow , during which he also met with russian president dmitry medvedev .
in his address to the russian academy of science , steinmeier said that all nations should make constructive efforts to disarm .
" this has to be the year when international disarmament efforts move back to the top of the agenda , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said medvedev seemed ready to reduce its nuclear arsenal steinmeier stressed that the talks between russia and the us on replacing the 1991 strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- were " a vital step on the difficult path towards a world free of nuclear weapons . "
steinmeier called the warming of relations between the kremlin and the us a " unique historic opportunity . "
thawing fronts ?
us president obama is scheduled to travel to moscow early next month for key talks on a follow-up to start , which expires on december 5 .
us and russian negotiators have been holding preliminary meetings ahead of those talks .
moscow has said it wants to link the nuclear talks to washington 's plans to deploy an anti-missile shield in central europe - a plan the kremlin firmly opposes .
russian prime minister vladimir putin said the kremlin would consider getting rid of its nuclear arsenal if all other countries agreed to do so as well .
after meeting the german foreign minister , putin was asked if he could imagine a russia without nuclear weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what do we need nuclear weapons for ? "
putin asked " of course , " he answered .
" what do we need nuclear weapons for ? "
putin 's answer did have one caveat , however .
" if those who invented the atomic bomb , and used it , are prepared to do away with atom bombs , then we would welcome this , " he said , suggesting his country 's involvement is dependent on us disarmament .
the russian news agency interfax , however , has reported that russia wants to keep at least 1,500 nuclear warheads .
other business in addition to disarmament , steinmeier also spoke with russian leaders about combating the effects of the global financial crisis .
putin praised berlin 's active role in negotiating a plan to rescue struggling carmaker opel , which now counts russian state-owned lender sberbank as one of its major stakeholders .
the three leaders agreed to increase cooperation in the energy sector , particularly in renewable fuel sources and efficiency .
steinmeier also addressed the controversial topics of human rights and moscow 's relations with tbilisi in the wake of last year 's military conflict between russia and georgia .
he urged moscow to adopt a " constructive " role in the caucasus and stressed that unresolved territorial disputes did not have a place in the europe of the 21st century .
during a visit to the editorial office of the novaya gazeta , a newspaper known for being critical of the kremlin , steinmeier wrote that democracy and a free press go together like breathing and air. sje / hf / dpa / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" let me stress : this is a formal statement about the geographical spread of the disease ...
it is not in itself a cause for alarm , " the un secretary general told a press conference . " though infectious , this new virus has so far not been as severe as had been feared and death rates have been low , " he added .
" we must therefore be prepared .
our best response is a firm demonstration of global solidarity . " who director general margaret chan emphasized in geneva earlier thursday that the term pandemic indicates the geographical spread of the virus , not its severity .

but the government says it needs more details before it can make a decision . the interior ministry said on thursday that it was unable to accept the us request based on the data provided .
" we 're examining two new cases , " ministry spokesman stefan paris said in berlin .
" the information provided by the united states is not sufficient for now for us to give the green light for taking in the two men . "
the interior ministry would need to check whether the prisoners represented a security risk , he said .
also , berlin needed to know why the men could not be taken in by the us and what ties they had to germany .
paris would not disclose the nationality of the two men .
security sources said one was syrian , the other tunisian .
resistance at home and abroad in april , the us made an initial request , presenting the german government with a list of nine chinese uighur detainees for berlin to " consider . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palau is offering 17 uighers a new temporary home interior minister wolfgang schaeuble had also replied in that case that the information provided was insufficient to warrant a positive reply .
us president barack obama has pledged to close the facility at the us naval base at guantanamo bay , cuba by early next year .
many of the inmates have already been cleared for release .
but us officials are having difficulty finding countries that will take them in , and meeting resistance at home to housing them on us soil .
the tiny pacific nation palau on agreed wednesday to take in up to 17 uighur guantanamo detainees .
four further uighur men who had been held at the prison camp were sent to bermuda on thursday .
sharp political debate german politicians have disagreed on the issue .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat candidate to challenge chancellor angela merkel in september 's federal election , has spoken in favor of accepting inmates .
but interior minister schaeuble has voiced skepticism .
on a visit to germany last week , obama said after talks with merkel that he had neither asked for nor received any hard commitments from berlin on taking guantanamo detainees .
he said merkel had been " very open " to discussions on the issue .
opposition politicians have been very critical of the government 's stance .
claudia roth , co-leader of the green party , said schaeuble was using " stalling tactics . "
" he 's acting on the maxim : we do n't know anything , we have to check things first , we have to deliberate so long until someone else takes this decision of our hands , " roth said in reference to the uighur case .
michael leutert , the human rights spokesman for the left party 's parliamentary group , said accepting the inmates was " a simple humanitarian act . "
" it is not plausible that two people proven innocent pose an uncalculated security risk for germany , " leutert said .
he said the german government needed to promptly " consider favorably " the us request. sac / afp / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 11.06.2009 gunman kills guard at washington holocaust museum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alleged gunman has a history of anti-semitic activity officials say an 88-year-old gunman with an anti-semitic past opened fire inside the national holocaust memorial museum in washington wednesday , killing a security guard before being shot by return fire . police in washington said the security guard was pronounced dead after being rushed to a hospital .
the gunman remains in a critical condition , mayor adrian fenty said .
the lone gunman 's identity or connections to anti-semitic groups could not be confirmed but media reports said he was believed to be known as white supremacist james w von brunn .
von brunn is thought to be behind numerous anti-semitic articles posted on the internet , including a book called " kill the best gentiles , " which he calls " a new hard-hitting expose of the jewish conspiracy to destroy the white gene pool . "
" it appears to be a lone gunman who entered into the museum and opened fire with what appears to be a rifle at this point , " washington police chief cathy lanier said .
museum officials identified the guard as officer stephen tyrone johns , who had worked at the museum for six years .
" i am shocked and saddened by today 's shooting at the us holocaust memorial museum , " us president barack obama said in a statement .
" this outrageous act reminds us that we must remain vigilant against anti-semitism and prejudice in all its forms .

" let me stress : this is a formal statement about the geographical spread of the disease ...
it is not in itself a cause for alarm , " the un secretary general told a press conference . " though infectious , this new virus has so far not been as severe as had been feared and death rates have been low , " he added .
" we must therefore be prepared .
our best response is a firm demonstration of global solidarity . " who director general margaret chan emphasized in geneva earlier thursday that the term pandemic indicates the geographical spread of the virus , not its severity .
sustained local transmissions outside the americas , have led it to raise the alert to six - indicating a full-blown pandemic chan added that the declaration of a " moderate " pandemic should not be a cause for panic and did not mean the global death toll of 150 from the a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- virus would sharply increase " the higher level of the pandemic does not necessarily mean we are going to see a more dangerous virus or see many more people falling severely ill or dying , " she said . however , she also said that she and the other health experts had determined that " the virus is spreading to a number of countries and is not stoppable . " the un body said it was neither recommending the closure of borders nor restrictions in movement of people , goods and services in the wake of its declaration . nations such as australia , britain , chile and japan – which are reporting growing numbers of infections – are being watched carefully as they are outside the americas , where swine flu was first detected in april . us already reacting in pandemic mode bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states have been acting at level six for weeks reactions to the pandemic announcement in the united states were muted as health officials confirmed that the us had been acting as if a pandemic was under way for weeks . thomas frieden , director of the center for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- , told a news conference the who declaration did not come as a surprise .
" there are no practical implications for most state and local governments , " he added . " here in the united states , the basic declaration is n't going to change our day-to-day activities , " added the cdc 's anne schuchat . according to the us experience , a global pandemic will have a number of specific features : the new h1n1 virus disproportionately makes younger people sick .
schuchat said 57 percent of us cases were among people aged 5 to 24 , and 41 percent of those hospitalized were in this younger age group . " the highest rates of hospitalization are actually in children under 5 , " schuchat said .
pregnant women , people with asthma or other chronic respiratory disease and diabetics needed to take special care and call a doctor if they had symptoms . the cdc said that all 50 states have had cases of infection by the h1n1 virus to such an extent that patients with specific flu-like symptoms - a fever above 104 degrees f , cough or other respiratory symptoms – are presumed to have the new virus . fears rise as southern hemisphere enters ' flu season bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the who is concerned how the developing world will cope health officials monitoring the spread of the disease are particularly concerned for countries in the southern hemisphere , where flu season is just getting under way .
the who ’ s margaret chan also said they were unsure how the virus would behave under the conditions of developing countries , which have thus far been largely spared from the virus . in other parts of the world , the big worry is that seasonal h1n1 and h3n2 viruses are still circulating .
the seasonal h1n1 has mutated into a form that resists the tamiflu vaccine , although it is still susceptible to the relenza alternative . experts fear if someone got infected with two strains at the same time , the viruses could recombine in the patient 's body and acquire new strengths and new drug resistance . outbreaks close schools in germany , hong kong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as many as 32 pupils were infected at the duesseldorf school meanwhile , city health officials confirmed that 32 students at the japanese international school in duesseldorf were infected with the h1n1 virus in the most concentrated outbreak of the virus so far in germany . most of the cases are not severe , only one of the students had to be treated at the city 's university hospital , said heiko schneitler , head of the duesseldorf health office .
all children have been placed in quarantine at home . most of the children affected were japanese , schneitler said .
duesseldorf is home to a large japanese community kathrin rebbe , a spokeswoman at the north-rhine westphalia health ministry said four additional cases of h1n1 had been detected at a school in nearby cologne . germany now has more than 100 confirmed cases of the swine flu virus .
the head of the robert koch institute , joerg hacker said he expected infections to rise . in hong kong , authorities took the decision to close all primary schools , kindergartens , child care centers and special schools for two weeks in an effort to control the spread of the virus after 12 pupils at a city secondary school were found to have contracted the a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- virus , chief executive donald tsang said . nda / hf / dpa / reuters / afp editor : charles penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" with the entry into office of president obama , there is a genuine chance for new cooperation between the united states , the european union and russia , " steinmeier said .
" the ghost of the cold war has been banished ...
so i would like to say that the extended hand of the us president should be boldly accepted , " he said .

" the efforts made for a resolution were rewarded with success , " steinmeier said at a joint press conference with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov in moscow on wednesday .

us president obama is scheduled to travel to moscow early next month for key talks on a follow-up to start , which expires on december 5 .
us and russian negotiators have been holding preliminary meetings ahead of those talks .
moscow has said it wants to link the nuclear talks to washington 's plans to deploy an anti-missile shield in central europe - a plan the kremlin firmly opposes .
russian prime minister vladimir putin said the kremlin would consider getting rid of its nuclear arsenal if all other countries agreed to do so as well .
after meeting the german foreign minister , putin was asked if he could imagine a russia without nuclear weapons .

" that would mean , in the first phase , that we would go from roughly 15,000 to 10,000 towards the end of the year , " he added .
nato 's peacekeeping mission , kfor , has been in kosovo since the alliance 's air campaign against serbia ended 10 years ago .
pressure to reduce its presence mounted in march when spanish defense minister charme chacon told his country 's 500 troops that they would soon be coming home .
spain is one of the few nato countries that have not recognized kosovo 's independence , declared last year , making it difficult to support nation-building efforts .
other nations have also been calling for kfor to be scaled back amidst pressure to move more troops to other areas of conflict like afghanistan or the gulf of aden .
the ministers are also scheduled to debate sending a new anti-piracy mission to the gulf of aden off the coast of somalia .
the current nato mission there was hastily organized in march and is set to sail home at the end of june. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has expressed the hope that israeli-palestinian peace efforts would resume in the near future . " a lot of important things are taking place , " he told reporters in jerusalem .
the eu 's foreign policy coordinator said that us president barack obama 's recent speech to the muslim world had been a crucial step in the right direction .
obama had urged the two sides in the middle east conflict to find a lasting settlement .
solana also mentioned last week 's elections in lebanon where iranian-backed hezbollah failed to capitalize on anti-israeli sentiment .
solana said it was a good time to " see how we can bring back the situation to something that can be moving in the right direction . "
last year , the peace process was dealt a setback by the israeli military offensive in the gaza strip .
solana added that he expected israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to endorse a two-state solution and to freeze israeli settlement in the palestinian territories .
" that 's what we expect to hear and i am sure something of that nature will happen , " solana said in reference to a speech netanyahu announced for sunday where he will outline his government 's policies on the peace process .
so far , netanyahu who heads a right-of-center coalition , has refused to publicly back a palestinian state or order a halt to settlement construction .
solana is to continue his tour of the middle east by meeting with palestinian , lebanese and egyptian leaders. ai / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a bureaucratic blunder had allowed him to reside legally in bonn for half a year , despite his name being on a blacklist . former thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra spent six months almost unnoticed in the former german capital bonn .
though declared a persona non grata , thaksin managed to enter germany on december 29 , 2008 using a schengen visa issued in france .
it allows a person to travel through much of the european union on a single visa .
bonn authorities then issued the residence permit for thaksin , who used his german lawyer 's address .
federal officials only learned about it in april and ordered it revoked .
" we asked bonn to revoke the permit and they responded immediately , " hanns schumacher , germany 's ambassador to thailand , told reuters on wednesday .
bonn authorities said thaksin 's name had not been on a list of people barred from germany and he had presented all the necessary documents .
this included a certificate from a german federal justice agency saying he had no criminal record .
he had also proved he had adequate funds to live and a valid passport .
officials said the absence of his name from the list of barred persons was the result of a data-entry oversight by staff of the german foreign ministry .
" we informed the lawyer that the permit was revoked and should thaksin still be in germany , his stay would be illegal and he would face detention , " schumacher said .
options are waning the former telecoms tycoon , who led thailand for close to six years , was ousted from thailand in a military coup in 2006 .
he was convicted in absentia of corruption and has fled a two-year jail term at home .
germany is the latest country to shun the former leader , who continues to roam the globe with a variety of passports and elude thai authorities who say they are trying to extradite him .
britain revoked his visa last year .
bangkok has sought extradition agreements with the united arab emirates and hong kong , where thaksin has spent time since fleeing the country while on bail .
his current whereabouts are unknown .
the german newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung said the former leader was now traveling on a nicaraguan diplomatic passport .
a thai foreign ministry official said thaksin would be arrested if he returned to thailand .
his thai passport has been revoked. sac / reuters / ap / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the latest eu report puts greece and cyprus in the top spots for the cleanest beaches . the overall quality of bathing water in the eu has markedly improved since 1990 .
according to the latest annual bathing water report by the european commission and european environment agency eea , most of europe 's 21,400 bathing sites have clean water .
" high quality bathing water is essential for the well-being of european citizens and the environment , " environment commissioner stavros dimas told reporters on thursday .
" europe 's bathing sites remain clean and water quality is high . "
during the 2008 bathing season , 96 percent of coastal bathing areas and 92 percent of bathing sites in rivers and lakes complied with minimum standards , dimas said .
compliance with such mandatory values were 80 percent and 52 percent respectively in 1990 .
greece and cyprus have the cleanest beaches in the eu , while some of the purest lakes and rivers can be found in finland , sweden and germany , the report said .
however , the commission also said that clean water did not necessarily mean that the beaches themselves were also clean .
poland is the worst country in europe to go swimming in , whether in the sea , rivers or lakes , with 14.4 percent of all bathing water non-compliant with mandatory standards .
the report found that many areas of the baltic sea are suffering from an overgrowth of algae , while a relatively high number of dirty waters are found around denmark , poland and britain .
testing is still lagging behind in new eu member states romania and bulgaria .
getting people involved each year , the eu tests its waters for possible bacteriological contamination deriving from industrial waste or agriculture .
water color , acidity , and the presence of residues from detergents are also tested .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy is home to more than one third of the eu 's beaches but the report can do more than just inform europeans and tourists about where they can safely take the plunge .
it also serves as a guide to get more people involved in their local surroundings , said eea 's executive director jacqueline mcglade .
" information sources like this report and our web-based viewing tools enable citizens not only to check the quality of the bathing water in their local community or holiday destination , but also to allow them to get more actively involved in the protection of their environment , " mcglade said .
italy closed most sites more than one third of the eu 's 14,500 beaches are found in italy .
the report showed that the mediterranean country stood out with 553 coastal beaches and freshwater sites where bathing had been closed or banned throughout the 2008 season .
this was far more than in other countries .
mcglade said it was " too early to say " whether there had been an improvement at those sites since last year as the data was not yet available .
of the 14,551 coastal bathing areas in the european union , bathing was banned or closed throughout the season in only 307 sites and was found not to be complying with eu standards in 208 sites .
among the 6,890 freshwater sites , bathing was banned at 315 sites and was not up to eu standards in 196. sac / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is no doubt in my mind that we will get the job done , " marchionne said in a letter to employees .
he called the alliance a " bold first step to implement " lessons learned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fiat chief sergio marchionne is upbeat about the merged company 's chances marchionne said earlier that the merged chrysler and fiat ranked as the world 's sixth largest automaker .
marchionne said fiat will begin the process of transferring fiat 's technology , platforms and powertrains to chrysler plants in the next few months .
the white house welcomed the completion of the deal and said the new alliance was " poised to emerge as a competitive , viable automaker . "
us court paves way for deal the deal 's completion came a day after the us supreme court lifted a stay on a lower court 's approval of the deal .
the court said a group of indiana pension funds opposed to the deal had failed to show " that the circumstances justify " delaying proceedings to accommodate their challenge .
the funds had argued that the white house-backed sale of chrysler to fiat is unconstitutional because it puts the rights of junior creditors ahead of the rights of senior lenders .
they also said the us treasury had overstepped its legal authority by using some $ 12 billion in financial bailout funds to reorganize chrysler when congress had intended the money for banks .
chrysler 's sale to fiat , a union-aligned trust and the us and canadian governments is aimed at pulling the company out of bankruptcy and reorganizing it to cope with changing economic conditions and consumer tastes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrysler may get a new life under fiat but it still needs to overcome past problems the court gave the transaction the green light after the government filed a brief warning that fiat could walk away from the chrysler deal if it was not finalized by june 15 .
" if fiat is released from the obligation to consummate the transaction as currently structured , it will be free to demand additional concessions before concluding a new agreement , " the justice dpartment brief said .
the statement said that because chrysler is not manufacturing cars , each day of bankruptcy was costing the company approximately $ 100 million .
chrysler filed for bankruptcy on april 30 and is seeking to re-emerge within the next 30 to 60 days .
its rapid turnaround plan is expected to serve as a precedent for general motors , which has filed for creditor protection as part of a plan that offloads its german subsidiary opel and gives the us government a majority stake in the new gm .
" cash for clunkers " bill approved meanwhile , the " cash for clunkers " bill , one of president obama 's consumer incentives for new car purchases , was approved by the house of representatives this week .
the bill aims to boost new car sales by allowing consumers to turn in their gas-guzzling cars and trucks for vouchers worth up to $ 4,500 toward more fuel-efficient vehicles . the measure is part of the obama 's administration 's efforts to stimulate car sales and increase the fleet of fuel-efficient vehicles on the nation 's highways . the us car industry has been searching for new incentives after months of poor car sale .

no matter who wins , observers agree that it 's time for iran and the us to sit down at the negotiating table .
and the european union could act as a vital mediator . three candidates are running against iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is seeking a second term in friday 's presidential elections .
observers forecast that the reformists under former prime minister mir hossein mousavi have the best chances of beating ahmadinejad .
yet no matter who wins , the time has come for serious negotiations with the west regarding iran 's controversial nuclear program , said christian-peter hanelt , a middle east expert from the bertelsmann foundation .
" it is time for a rapprochement between iran , its neighbors and the west , " hanelt said .
" in order to pre-empt another confrontation in the middle east and further escalation as a result of the iranian nuclear program , american-iranian relations must be put on a sustainable footing after the iranian presidential elections . "
the european union could play a significant mediatory role in this process , said konstantin kosten , an expert on iran at the german council on foreign relations , dgap .
" the eu could certainly act as a bridge and door opener , " kosten said .
" direct contacts exist already with the iranian government and the most significant negotiating circles . "
the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana has been leading talks between iran and the so-called eu3 -lrb- referring to france , britain and germany -rrb- for years .
due to these contacts , eu officials could provide us diplomats with expertise and support .
us has full eu support the us administration has chosen a new path in its dealings with iran .
whereas former president george w. bush opted for confrontation , placing iran as part of its " axis of evil , " president barack obama is going for direct diplomacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uranium conversion facility in isfahan contributes to iran 's nuclear program in march , obama directly addressed the country 's leaders in a message to the iranian people on the occasion of nowruz , the iranian new year .
he offered tehran direct talks without any preconditions .
the us president has full backing from the eu , whose foreign ministers urged iran to take advantage of the change in us policy to seal a deal and end the stand-off over its nuclear ambitions .
" the eu warmly supports the new direction of us policy towards iran , which opens a window of opportunity for negotiations on all aspects of iran 's nuclear program and more broadly for engagement with iran , " the eu foreign ministers said in a statement in april .
washington can count on support by its european partners .
" the eu reaffirms its full and unequivocal support for efforts to find a negotiated long-term solution to the iranian nuclear issue , " the ministers said .
in addition to making it clear to tehran that the eu stands behind us policy , it 's also important to send signals of eu support to washington , said michael bauer , head of the middle east project at the center for applied policy research at the university of munich .
" there are not only proponents of this new policy towards iran in washington so i think a first step would be to essentially support the advocates and make clear to them that the european position clearly welcomes this willingness for talks , " bauer said .
compromise is necessary the main point of contention continues to be iran 's nuclear program and the country 's unwillingness to permit comprehensive and strict controls .
despite the eu 's repeated efforts to find a solution , negotiations have failed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's confrontational tone is popular among the rural poor hanelt said that only the us could provide the desired security guarantees for the territory of iran and recognition of its political system .
" for this reason , europe can now achieve more it if simply provides robust support for the us administration in its forthcoming rapprochement with tehran , " hanelt said .
bauer said iran wanted to be viewed as a " legitimate political actor " with the corresponding security guarantees .
" iran is first and foremost interested in recognition of its regime by the us , " bauer said .
" this is something the europeans ca n't offer . "
but iran was also in a strong position at the moment and its support was needed for positive developments in the region , he said .
" the us and barack obama will need iran to keep iraq stable , " bauer said .
" iran is needed to get a grip on the problems in afghanistan to some extent .
iran is an important player here . "
nuclear program will continue any hopes that iran will abandon its nuclear program are futile , though .
kosten said iran will want to remain at the helm when it comes to uranium enrichment and civilian use of nuclear power .
" the question is more whether a solution can be found which enables enrichment on iranian soil , " kosten said .
" there has to be an idea how iran can exercise its rights and therefore save face . "
even an attack by israel on iran 's nuclear facilities would put the program back by a few years , but would not stop it .
iran 's nuclear program as such is not up for discussion , bauer said .
" that has to be clear and i think it is to barack obama , " bauer said .
he said the west could at most hope to gain from iran a degree of transparency of its nuclear program through cooperation with the international atomic energy agency , which can ensure that it is a civilian nuclear program .
a turning point in iran the iranian people are considered to be among the most pro-western in the middle east .
and many , especially younger people , are fed up with ahmadinejad 's confrontational tone .
mousavi supporters have been taking to tehran 's streets for nightly demonstrations to express their discontent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mousavi supporter shows where he stands ruprecht polenz , chairman of the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee , said ahmadinejad 's defeat would mean a lot for the future of young iranians .
" when you consider what needs to happen so that the economic situation improves , so that all the young people who finish university each year really have an opportunity to find a good job , then economic reform is necessary , " polenz said .
" more intense trade relations are necessary especially with developed nations , such as european countries . "
but this requires iran to change its confrontational foreign policy and focus on cooperation , he said .
ultimately , though , the real power in iran is held by its supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei .
" indeed the ayatollah is the central player in iran 's political system , even when it comes to such matters like the nuclear program , " bauer said .
" in the end , the compromise will have to be made with the revolutionary leader . "

" with the entry into office of president obama , there is a genuine chance for new cooperation between the united states , the european union and russia , " steinmeier said .
" the ghost of the cold war has been banished ...
so i would like to say that the extended hand of the us president should be boldly accepted , " he said .
earlier , steinmeier told reporters that the security council 's five permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - as well as japan and south korea had agreed to toughen their stance against north korea after pyongyang tested a nuclear device and launched several missiles in recent weeks .
" the efforts made for a resolution were rewarded with success , " steinmeier said at a joint press conference with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov in moscow on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea has tested several missiles this year diplomats say the latest draft resolution " calls upon " countries to inspect north korean ships carrying suspicious cargo that might violate a partial un trade and arms embargo , although it does not demand it .
the document does , however , require governemnts to deny fuel to any suspicious north korea vessles and direct them to dock at " an appropriate and convenient port . "
reaching out disarmament was a key theme throughout steinmeier 's two-day visit to moscow , during which he also met with russian president dmitry medvedev .
in his address to the russian academy of science , steinmeier said that all nations should make constructive efforts to disarm .
" this has to be the year when international disarmament efforts move back to the top of the agenda , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said medvedev seemed ready to reduce its nuclear arsenal steinmeier stressed that the talks between russia and the us on replacing the 1991 strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- were " a vital step on the difficult path towards a world free of nuclear weapons . "
steinmeier called the warming of relations between the kremlin and the us a " unique historic opportunity . "
thawing fronts ?
us president obama is scheduled to travel to moscow early next month for key talks on a follow-up to start , which expires on december 5 .
us and russian negotiators have been holding preliminary meetings ahead of those talks .
moscow has said it wants to link the nuclear talks to washington 's plans to deploy an anti-missile shield in central europe - a plan the kremlin firmly opposes .
russian prime minister vladimir putin said the kremlin would consider getting rid of its nuclear arsenal if all other countries agreed to do so as well .
after meeting the german foreign minister , putin was asked if he could imagine a russia without nuclear weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what do we need nuclear weapons for ? "
putin asked " of course , " he answered .
" what do we need nuclear weapons for ? "
putin 's answer did have one caveat , however .
" if those who invented the atomic bomb , and used it , are prepared to do away with atom bombs , then we would welcome this , " he said , suggesting his country 's involvement is dependent on us disarmament .
the russian news agency interfax , however , has reported that russia wants to keep at least 1,500 nuclear warheads .
other business in addition to disarmament , steinmeier also spoke with russian leaders about combating the effects of the global financial crisis .
putin praised berlin 's active role in negotiating a plan to rescue struggling carmaker opel , which now counts russian state-owned lender sberbank as one of its major stakeholders .
the three leaders agreed to increase cooperation in the energy sector , particularly in renewable fuel sources and efficiency .
steinmeier also addressed the controversial topics of human rights and moscow 's relations with tbilisi in the wake of last year 's military conflict between russia and georgia .
he urged moscow to adopt a " constructive " role in the caucasus and stressed that unresolved territorial disputes did not have a place in the europe of the 21st century .
during a visit to the editorial office of the novaya gazeta , a newspaper known for being critical of the kremlin , steinmeier wrote that democracy and a free press go together like breathing and air. sje / hf / dpa / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the gunman remains in a critical condition , mayor adrian fenty said .
the lone gunman 's identity or connections to anti-semitic groups could not be confirmed but media reports said he was believed to be known as white supremacist james w von brunn .
von brunn is thought to be behind numerous anti-semitic articles posted on the internet , including a book called " kill the best gentiles , " which he calls " a new hard-hitting expose of the jewish conspiracy to destroy the white gene pool . "
" it appears to be a lone gunman who entered into the museum and opened fire with what appears to be a rifle at this point , " washington police chief cathy lanier said .
museum officials identified the guard as officer stephen tyrone johns , who had worked at the museum for six years .
" i am shocked and saddened by today 's shooting at the us holocaust memorial museum , " us president barack obama said in a statement .
" this outrageous act reminds us that we must remain vigilant against anti-semitism and prejudice in all its forms .
" no american institution is more important to this effort than the holocaust museum , and no act of violence will diminish our determination to honor those who were lost by building a more peaceful and tolerant world , " he added .
obama last week became the first us president to visit the nazi death camp in buchenwald , germany where he renewed a historic commitment to israel .
the armed man carrying a long rifle entered the museum just blocks from the national mall and washington monument shortly before 1 pm -lrb- 1800 cet -rrb- and immediately fired at armed security guards , police chief lanier told reporters .
two security guards returned fire and johns and the gunman were wounded .
local media reports said a third person was hit by glass but the extent of those injuries are unknown .
museum no stranger to threats and abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum opened in 1993 security director joseph rosboschil said the museum receives occasional threats but there had been " nothing significant of late . "
rosboschil also said the museum had more security measures than other washington museums .
sara j bloomfield , director of the museum , said this apparent act of intolerance and hatred was " even more reason for this museum to exist . "
the council on american-islamic relations , a muslim civil liberties and advocacy group , said in a statement that it condemned " this apparent bias-motivated attack " and stands with the " jewish community and with americans of all faiths in repudiating the kind of hatred and intolerance that can lead to such disturbing incidents . "
more than 30 million people have visited the museum since its opening in 1993 , including 85 heads of state. nda , afp / dpa / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the draft urges countries to inspect north korean vessels , to cut back financial ties and expand the arms embargo . the five permanent members of the security council plus japan and south korea on wednesday agreed on a package of expanded sanctions against pyongyang .
the draft resolution " condemns in the strongest terms " north korea 's nuclear test last month and demands that it " not conduct any further nuclear test or any launch using ballistic missile technology . "
the draft calls for tougher inspections of north korean cargo vessels and for a cutting of financial ties with the country .
the existing arms embargo is to be stepped up . " the efforts made for a resolution were rewarded with success , " germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said during a visit to moscow .
" we expect a vote at the security council by friday at the latest , " he told a news conference after talks with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov .
the draft is a compromise as both china and russia had objected to earlier versions which would have required all countries to inspect north korean ships carrying suspicious cargo .
the latest draft now merely " calls upon " states to inspect the vessels .

" this sanctions regime , if passed by the security council , will bite in a meaningful way , " she said . north korea launched a long-range missile in april , triggering a rebuke from the un security council .
the regime in pyongyang then responded by declaring it had staged a successful nuclear weapons test , following one in 2006 .

despite soaking up billions of euros in subsidies , germany 's eastern states still suffer from higher unemployment and lower productivity and per capita wealth .
migration is also a big problem .
but it appears that germany 's deepest recession since world war ii is having an unexpected side effect .
" so far , the east has not been hit as hard , " tiefensee said .
" twenty years after the peaceful revolution and the fall of the wall , the achievements of the east germans are being recognized in 2009 , " tiefensee told reporters after presenting the report to the cabinet .
smaller enterprises aiding eastern states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee presents the 2009 unity report tiefensee said that the eastern states are home to a larger proportion of smaller firms which are more flexible than big companies and less dependent on exports , which have slumped in the last few months .
he pointed in particular to the technology sector , where growth is higher in eastern states , especially in the solar energy sector which is strong there .
meanwhile the manufacturing industry in the west , which is heavily reliant on exports , has borne the brunt of the global downturn .
tiefensee noted that the western states ' " unprecedented solidarity " with the east , including more than one trillion euros in subsidies since national unification in 1990 , had been crucial to getting the region back on its feet .
gross national product per person in the east rose to 71 percent of that of a westerner last year , compared to 67 percent in 2000 , the report said .
industry in the east has grown by 7.5 percent over the last three years , compared to 4.3 percent in the west .
unemployment still a germany-wide problem tiefensee said that while unemployment had stayed roughly stable in eastern states in the last year , it had risen to 6.9 percent in may in western states from 6.4 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has stabilized in the east but is still high dspite the positive figures , divisions between eastern and western germany are still wide .
jobless figures are still twice as high in the east as in western states and long-term unemployment is a major problem .
unemployment stands at 13.3 percent in eastern states and is likely to rise further still in the coming months .
job migration is also a big problem .
young people , especially women , tend to abandon the east in search of work , leaving some areas as a wasteland .
about 90,000 people ditched the east for the west each year in the recent past , against just 40,000 people moving east .
" we have come a long way , but there is still a lot of work to do , " tiefensee said , adding that so-called " solidarity tax " payments to the east would likely continue for another decade , until 2019 .
by that time , he said , some of the eastern states could even overtake poorer western regions in terms of gross domestic product .
opposition accuses minister of election games opposition parties seized on the report to accuse tiefensee of scoring points for his social democrats , the junior partners in germany 's ruling coalition with chancellor merkel 's conservatives , ahead of the september general election .
" it is a clumsy attempt to win votes in the east when you tell people that the rest of the job will be finished in 10 years , " expert on eastern affairs for the liberal free democrats , joachim guenther , said. nda , afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 11.06.2009 bathing water quality improving across europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has the cleanest waters in europe with the summer holidays approaching , beach lovers can rest assured that most areas in the european union have good water quality .
the latest eu report puts greece and cyprus in the top spots for the cleanest beaches . the overall quality of bathing water in the eu has markedly improved since 1990 .
according to the latest annual bathing water report by the european commission and european environment agency eea , most of europe 's 21,400 bathing sites have clean water .
" high quality bathing water is essential for the well-being of european citizens and the environment , " environment commissioner stavros dimas told reporters on thursday .
" europe 's bathing sites remain clean and water quality is high . "
during the 2008 bathing season , 96 percent of coastal bathing areas and 92 percent of bathing sites in rivers and lakes complied with minimum standards , dimas said .
compliance with such mandatory values were 80 percent and 52 percent respectively in 1990 .
greece and cyprus have the cleanest beaches in the eu , while some of the purest lakes and rivers can be found in finland , sweden and germany , the report said .
however , the commission also said that clean water did not necessarily mean that the beaches themselves were also clean .
poland is the worst country in europe to go swimming in , whether in the sea , rivers or lakes , with 14.4 percent of all bathing water non-compliant with mandatory standards .
the report found that many areas of the baltic sea are suffering from an overgrowth of algae , while a relatively high number of dirty waters are found around denmark , poland and britain .
testing is still lagging behind in new eu member states romania and bulgaria .
getting people involved each year , the eu tests its waters for possible bacteriological contamination deriving from industrial waste or agriculture .
water color , acidity , and the presence of residues from detergents are also tested .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy is home to more than one third of the eu 's beaches but the report can do more than just inform europeans and tourists about where they can safely take the plunge .
it also serves as a guide to get more people involved in their local surroundings , said eea 's executive director jacqueline mcglade .
" information sources like this report and our web-based viewing tools enable citizens not only to check the quality of the bathing water in their local community or holiday destination , but also to allow them to get more actively involved in the protection of their environment , " mcglade said .
italy closed most sites more than one third of the eu 's 14,500 beaches are found in italy .
the report showed that the mediterranean country stood out with 553 coastal beaches and freshwater sites where bathing had been closed or banned throughout the 2008 season .
this was far more than in other countries .
mcglade said it was " too early to say " whether there had been an improvement at those sites since last year as the data was not yet available .
of the 14,551 coastal bathing areas in the european union , bathing was banned or closed throughout the season in only 307 sites and was found not to be complying with eu standards in 208 sites .
among the 6,890 freshwater sites , bathing was banned at 315 sites and was not up to eu standards in 196. sac / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has expressed the hope that israeli-palestinian peace efforts would resume in the near future . " a lot of important things are taking place , " he told reporters in jerusalem .
the eu 's foreign policy coordinator said that us president barack obama 's recent speech to the muslim world had been a crucial step in the right direction .
obama had urged the two sides in the middle east conflict to find a lasting settlement .
solana also mentioned last week 's elections in lebanon where iranian-backed hezbollah failed to capitalize on anti-israeli sentiment .
solana said it was a good time to " see how we can bring back the situation to something that can be moving in the right direction . "
last year , the peace process was dealt a setback by the israeli military offensive in the gaza strip .
solana added that he expected israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to endorse a two-state solution and to freeze israeli settlement in the palestinian territories .
" that 's what we expect to hear and i am sure something of that nature will happen , " solana said in reference to a speech netanyahu announced for sunday where he will outline his government 's policies on the peace process .
so far , netanyahu who heads a right-of-center coalition , has refused to publicly back a palestinian state or order a halt to settlement construction .

eu leaders meeting are set to grant a second five-year term to barroso , the only candidate for the top post , at their summit in brussels next thursday and friday .
barroso 's mandate expires in october , but he is seeking a second term despite the european union 's struggle to reform and criticism of its response to the financial crisis .
leaders pledge to press lisbon 's case sarkozy added that he would be prepared to travel to ireland to help gather support for a referendum over the european union 's stalled lisbon treaty .
" mrs. merkel and i will do everything we can to help the irish make the choice for lisbon , " he told the joint news conference .
" if it is of use , i would even be ready to travel to ireland to support them , " he said .

" that would mean , in the first phase , that we would go from roughly 15,000 to 10,000 towards the end of the year , " he added .
nato 's peacekeeping mission , kfor , has been in kosovo since the alliance 's air campaign against serbia ended 10 years ago .
pressure to reduce its presence mounted in march when spanish defense minister charme chacon told his country 's 500 troops that they would soon be coming home .
spain is one of the few nato countries that have not recognized kosovo 's independence , declared last year , making it difficult to support nation-building efforts .
other nations have also been calling for kfor to be scaled back amidst pressure to move more troops to other areas of conflict like afghanistan or the gulf of aden .
the ministers are also scheduled to debate sending a new anti-piracy mission to the gulf of aden off the coast of somalia .
the current nato mission there was hastily organized in march and is set to sail home at the end of june. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a bureaucratic blunder had allowed him to reside legally in bonn for half a year , despite his name being on a blacklist . former thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra spent six months almost unnoticed in the former german capital bonn .
though declared a persona non grata , thaksin managed to enter germany on december 29 , 2008 using a schengen visa issued in france .
it allows a person to travel through much of the european union on a single visa .
bonn authorities then issued the residence permit for thaksin , who used his german lawyer 's address .
federal officials only learned about it in april and ordered it revoked .
" we asked bonn to revoke the permit and they responded immediately , " hanns schumacher , germany 's ambassador to thailand , told reuters on wednesday .
bonn authorities said thaksin 's name had not been on a list of people barred from germany and he had presented all the necessary documents .
this included a certificate from a german federal justice agency saying he had no criminal record .
he had also proved he had adequate funds to live and a valid passport .
officials said the absence of his name from the list of barred persons was the result of a data-entry oversight by staff of the german foreign ministry .
" we informed the lawyer that the permit was revoked and should thaksin still be in germany , his stay would be illegal and he would face detention , " schumacher said .
options are waning the former telecoms tycoon , who led thailand for close to six years , was ousted from thailand in a military coup in 2006 .
he was convicted in absentia of corruption and has fled a two-year jail term at home .
germany is the latest country to shun the former leader , who continues to roam the globe with a variety of passports and elude thai authorities who say they are trying to extradite him .
britain revoked his visa last year .
bangkok has sought extradition agreements with the united arab emirates and hong kong , where thaksin has spent time since fleeing the country while on bail .
his current whereabouts are unknown .
the german newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung said the former leader was now traveling on a nicaraguan diplomatic passport .
a thai foreign ministry official said thaksin would be arrested if he returned to thailand .
his thai passport has been revoked. sac / reuters / ap / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the latest eu report puts greece and cyprus in the top spots for the cleanest beaches . the overall quality of bathing water in the eu has markedly improved since 1990 .
according to the latest annual bathing water report by the european commission and european environment agency eea , most of europe 's 21,400 bathing sites have clean water .
" high quality bathing water is essential for the well-being of european citizens and the environment , " environment commissioner stavros dimas told reporters on thursday .
" europe 's bathing sites remain clean and water quality is high . "
during the 2008 bathing season , 96 percent of coastal bathing areas and 92 percent of bathing sites in rivers and lakes complied with minimum standards , dimas said .
compliance with such mandatory values were 80 percent and 52 percent respectively in 1990 .
greece and cyprus have the cleanest beaches in the eu , while some of the purest lakes and rivers can be found in finland , sweden and germany , the report said .
however , the commission also said that clean water did not necessarily mean that the beaches themselves were also clean .
poland is the worst country in europe to go swimming in , whether in the sea , rivers or lakes , with 14.4 percent of all bathing water non-compliant with mandatory standards .
the report found that many areas of the baltic sea are suffering from an overgrowth of algae , while a relatively high number of dirty waters are found around denmark , poland and britain .
testing is still lagging behind in new eu member states romania and bulgaria .
getting people involved each year , the eu tests its waters for possible bacteriological contamination deriving from industrial waste or agriculture .
water color , acidity , and the presence of residues from detergents are also tested .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy is home to more than one third of the eu 's beaches but the report can do more than just inform europeans and tourists about where they can safely take the plunge .
it also serves as a guide to get more people involved in their local surroundings , said eea 's executive director jacqueline mcglade .
" information sources like this report and our web-based viewing tools enable citizens not only to check the quality of the bathing water in their local community or holiday destination , but also to allow them to get more actively involved in the protection of their environment , " mcglade said .
italy closed most sites more than one third of the eu 's 14,500 beaches are found in italy .
the report showed that the mediterranean country stood out with 553 coastal beaches and freshwater sites where bathing had been closed or banned throughout the 2008 season .
this was far more than in other countries .
mcglade said it was " too early to say " whether there had been an improvement at those sites since last year as the data was not yet available .
of the 14,551 coastal bathing areas in the european union , bathing was banned or closed throughout the season in only 307 sites and was found not to be complying with eu standards in 208 sites .
among the 6,890 freshwater sites , bathing was banned at 315 sites and was not up to eu standards in 196. sac / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" important personnel and policy decisions must be taken immediately .
that is why germany and france support jose manuel barroso , " merkel said at a joint press conference with sarkozy in paris .
there is a " strong desire " in the newly-elected eu parliament that the choice of a new ec head should not take the entire summer , she said .
" we will support the candidacy of mr. barroso , without ambiguity , " sarkozy said at a joint news conference at the elysee presidential palace .

eu leaders meeting are set to grant a second five-year term to barroso , the only candidate for the top post , at their summit in brussels next thursday and friday .
barroso 's mandate expires in october , but he is seeking a second term despite the european union 's struggle to reform and criticism of its response to the financial crisis .
leaders pledge to press lisbon 's case sarkozy added that he would be prepared to travel to ireland to help gather support for a referendum over the european union 's stalled lisbon treaty .
" mrs. merkel and i will do everything we can to help the irish make the choice for lisbon , " he told the joint news conference .
" if it is of use , i would even be ready to travel to ireland to support them , " he said .
the two leaders also expressed their concern for the well-being of imprisoned burmese opposition leader aung san suu kyi .

a bureaucratic blunder had allowed him to reside legally in bonn for half a year , despite his name being on a blacklist . former thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra spent six months almost unnoticed in the former german capital bonn .

bonn authorities then issued the residence permit for thaksin , who used his german lawyer 's address .
federal officials only learned about it in april and ordered it revoked .
" we asked bonn to revoke the permit and they responded immediately , " hanns schumacher , germany 's ambassador to thailand , told reuters on wednesday .
bonn authorities said thaksin 's name had not been on a list of people barred from germany and he had presented all the necessary documents .
this included a certificate from a german federal justice agency saying he had no criminal record .
he had also proved he had adequate funds to live and a valid passport .
officials said the absence of his name from the list of barred persons was the result of a data-entry oversight by staff of the german foreign ministry .
" we informed the lawyer that the permit was revoked and should thaksin still be in germany , his stay would be illegal and he would face detention , " schumacher said .

he has expressed the hope that israeli-palestinian peace efforts would resume in the near future . " a lot of important things are taking place , " he told reporters in jerusalem .
the eu 's foreign policy coordinator said that us president barack obama 's recent speech to the muslim world had been a crucial step in the right direction .
obama had urged the two sides in the middle east conflict to find a lasting settlement .
solana also mentioned last week 's elections in lebanon where iranian-backed hezbollah failed to capitalize on anti-israeli sentiment .
solana said it was a good time to " see how we can bring back the situation to something that can be moving in the right direction . "
last year , the peace process was dealt a setback by the israeli military offensive in the gaza strip .
solana added that he expected israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to endorse a two-state solution and to freeze israeli settlement in the palestinian territories .
" that 's what we expect to hear and i am sure something of that nature will happen , " solana said in reference to a speech netanyahu announced for sunday where he will outline his government 's policies on the peace process .
so far , netanyahu who heads a right-of-center coalition , has refused to publicly back a palestinian state or order a halt to settlement construction .
solana is to continue his tour of the middle east by meeting with palestinian , lebanese and egyptian leaders. ai / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has expressed the hope that israeli-palestinian peace efforts would resume in the near future . " a lot of important things are taking place , " he told reporters in jerusalem .
the eu 's foreign policy coordinator said that us president barack obama 's recent speech to the muslim world had been a crucial step in the right direction .
obama had urged the two sides in the middle east conflict to find a lasting settlement .
solana also mentioned last week 's elections in lebanon where iranian-backed hezbollah failed to capitalize on anti-israeli sentiment .
solana said it was a good time to " see how we can bring back the situation to something that can be moving in the right direction . "
last year , the peace process was dealt a setback by the israeli military offensive in the gaza strip .
solana added that he expected israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to endorse a two-state solution and to freeze israeli settlement in the palestinian territories .
" that 's what we expect to hear and i am sure something of that nature will happen , " solana said in reference to a speech netanyahu announced for sunday where he will outline his government 's policies on the peace process .
so far , netanyahu who heads a right-of-center coalition , has refused to publicly back a palestinian state or order a halt to settlement construction .

but the government says it needs more details before it can make a decision . the interior ministry said on thursday that it was unable to accept the us request based on the data provided .
" we 're examining two new cases , " ministry spokesman stefan paris said in berlin .
" the information provided by the united states is not sufficient for now for us to give the green light for taking in the two men . "
the interior ministry would need to check whether the prisoners represented a security risk , he said .
also , berlin needed to know why the men could not be taken in by the us and what ties they had to germany .
paris would not disclose the nationality of the two men .
security sources said one was syrian , the other tunisian .

us president barack obama has pledged to close the facility at the us naval base at guantanamo bay , cuba by early next year .
many of the inmates have already been cleared for release .
but us officials are having difficulty finding countries that will take them in , and meeting resistance at home to housing them on us soil .
the tiny pacific nation palau on agreed wednesday to take in up to 17 uighur guantanamo detainees .
four further uighur men who had been held at the prison camp were sent to bermuda on thursday .
sharp political debate german politicians have disagreed on the issue .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat candidate to challenge chancellor angela merkel in september 's federal election , has spoken in favor of accepting inmates .
but interior minister schaeuble has voiced skepticism .
on a visit to germany last week , obama said after talks with merkel that he had neither asked for nor received any hard commitments from berlin on taking guantanamo detainees .
he said merkel had been " very open " to discussions on the issue .
opposition politicians have been very critical of the government 's stance .
claudia roth , co-leader of the green party , said schaeuble was using " stalling tactics . "
" he 's acting on the maxim : we do n't know anything , we have to check things first , we have to deliberate so long until someone else takes this decision of our hands , " roth said in reference to the uighur case .
michael leutert , the human rights spokesman for the left party 's parliamentary group , said accepting the inmates was " a simple humanitarian act . "

on a visit to germany last week , obama said after talks with merkel that he had neither asked for nor received any hard commitments from berlin on taking guantanamo detainees .
he said merkel had been " very open " to discussions on the issue .
opposition politicians have been very critical of the government 's stance .
claudia roth , co-leader of the green party , said schaeuble was using " stalling tactics . "
" he 's acting on the maxim : we do n't know anything , we have to check things first , we have to deliberate so long until someone else takes this decision of our hands , " roth said in reference to the uighur case .
michael leutert , the human rights spokesman for the left party 's parliamentary group , said accepting the inmates was " a simple humanitarian act . "
" it is not plausible that two people proven innocent pose an uncalculated security risk for germany , " leutert said .
he said the german government needed to promptly " consider favorably " the us request. sac / afp / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the latest eu report puts greece and cyprus in the top spots for the cleanest beaches . the overall quality of bathing water in the eu has markedly improved since 1990 .
according to the latest annual bathing water report by the european commission and european environment agency eea , most of europe 's 21,400 bathing sites have clean water .
" high quality bathing water is essential for the well-being of european citizens and the environment , " environment commissioner stavros dimas told reporters on thursday .
" europe 's bathing sites remain clean and water quality is high . "
during the 2008 bathing season , 96 percent of coastal bathing areas and 92 percent of bathing sites in rivers and lakes complied with minimum standards , dimas said .
compliance with such mandatory values were 80 percent and 52 percent respectively in 1990 .
greece and cyprus have the cleanest beaches in the eu , while some of the purest lakes and rivers can be found in finland , sweden and germany , the report said .
however , the commission also said that clean water did not necessarily mean that the beaches themselves were also clean .
poland is the worst country in europe to go swimming in , whether in the sea , rivers or lakes , with 14.4 percent of all bathing water non-compliant with mandatory standards .
the report found that many areas of the baltic sea are suffering from an overgrowth of algae , while a relatively high number of dirty waters are found around denmark , poland and britain .
testing is still lagging behind in new eu member states romania and bulgaria .
getting people involved each year , the eu tests its waters for possible bacteriological contamination deriving from industrial waste or agriculture .
water color , acidity , and the presence of residues from detergents are also tested .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy is home to more than one third of the eu 's beaches but the report can do more than just inform europeans and tourists about where they can safely take the plunge .
it also serves as a guide to get more people involved in their local surroundings , said eea 's executive director jacqueline mcglade .
" information sources like this report and our web-based viewing tools enable citizens not only to check the quality of the bathing water in their local community or holiday destination , but also to allow them to get more actively involved in the protection of their environment , " mcglade said .
italy closed most sites more than one third of the eu 's 14,500 beaches are found in italy .
the report showed that the mediterranean country stood out with 553 coastal beaches and freshwater sites where bathing had been closed or banned throughout the 2008 season .
this was far more than in other countries .
mcglade said it was " too early to say " whether there had been an improvement at those sites since last year as the data was not yet available .
of the 14,551 coastal bathing areas in the european union , bathing was banned or closed throughout the season in only 307 sites and was found not to be complying with eu standards in 208 sites .
among the 6,890 freshwater sites , bathing was banned at 315 sites and was not up to eu standards in 196. sac / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

italy closed most sites more than one third of the eu 's 14,500 beaches are found in italy .
the report showed that the mediterranean country stood out with 553 coastal beaches and freshwater sites where bathing had been closed or banned throughout the 2008 season .
this was far more than in other countries .
mcglade said it was " too early to say " whether there had been an improvement at those sites since last year as the data was not yet available .
of the 14,551 coastal bathing areas in the european union , bathing was banned or closed throughout the season in only 307 sites and was found not to be complying with eu standards in 208 sites .
among the 6,890 freshwater sites , bathing was banned at 315 sites and was not up to eu standards in 196. sac / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has expressed the hope that israeli-palestinian peace efforts would resume in the near future . " a lot of important things are taking place , " he told reporters in jerusalem .
the eu 's foreign policy coordinator said that us president barack obama 's recent speech to the muslim world had been a crucial step in the right direction .
obama had urged the two sides in the middle east conflict to find a lasting settlement .
solana also mentioned last week 's elections in lebanon where iranian-backed hezbollah failed to capitalize on anti-israeli sentiment .
solana said it was a good time to " see how we can bring back the situation to something that can be moving in the right direction . "
last year , the peace process was dealt a setback by the israeli military offensive in the gaza strip .
solana added that he expected israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to endorse a two-state solution and to freeze israeli settlement in the palestinian territories .
" that 's what we expect to hear and i am sure something of that nature will happen , " solana said in reference to a speech netanyahu announced for sunday where he will outline his government 's policies on the peace process .
so far , netanyahu who heads a right-of-center coalition , has refused to publicly back a palestinian state or order a halt to settlement construction .

" that would mean , in the first phase , that we would go from roughly 15,000 to 10,000 towards the end of the year , " he added .
nato 's peacekeeping mission , kfor , has been in kosovo since the alliance 's air campaign against serbia ended 10 years ago .
pressure to reduce its presence mounted in march when spanish defense minister charme chacon told his country 's 500 troops that they would soon be coming home .
spain is one of the few nato countries that have not recognized kosovo 's independence , declared last year , making it difficult to support nation-building efforts .
other nations have also been calling for kfor to be scaled back amidst pressure to move more troops to other areas of conflict like afghanistan or the gulf of aden .
the ministers are also scheduled to debate sending a new anti-piracy mission to the gulf of aden off the coast of somalia .
the current nato mission there was hastily organized in march and is set to sail home at the end of june. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no matter who wins , observers agree that it 's time for iran and the us to sit down at the negotiating table .
and the european union could act as a vital mediator . three candidates are running against iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is seeking a second term in friday 's presidential elections .
observers forecast that the reformists under former prime minister mir hossein mousavi have the best chances of beating ahmadinejad .
yet no matter who wins , the time has come for serious negotiations with the west regarding iran 's controversial nuclear program , said christian-peter hanelt , a middle east expert from the bertelsmann foundation .
" it is time for a rapprochement between iran , its neighbors and the west , " hanelt said .
" in order to pre-empt another confrontation in the middle east and further escalation as a result of the iranian nuclear program , american-iranian relations must be put on a sustainable footing after the iranian presidential elections . "
the european union could play a significant mediatory role in this process , said konstantin kosten , an expert on iran at the german council on foreign relations , dgap .
" the eu could certainly act as a bridge and door opener , " kosten said .
" direct contacts exist already with the iranian government and the most significant negotiating circles . "
the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana has been leading talks between iran and the so-called eu3 -lrb- referring to france , britain and germany -rrb- for years .
due to these contacts , eu officials could provide us diplomats with expertise and support .
us has full eu support the us administration has chosen a new path in its dealings with iran .
whereas former president george w. bush opted for confrontation , placing iran as part of its " axis of evil , " president barack obama is going for direct diplomacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uranium conversion facility in isfahan contributes to iran 's nuclear program in march , obama directly addressed the country 's leaders in a message to the iranian people on the occasion of nowruz , the iranian new year .
he offered tehran direct talks without any preconditions .
the us president has full backing from the eu , whose foreign ministers urged iran to take advantage of the change in us policy to seal a deal and end the stand-off over its nuclear ambitions .
" the eu warmly supports the new direction of us policy towards iran , which opens a window of opportunity for negotiations on all aspects of iran 's nuclear program and more broadly for engagement with iran , " the eu foreign ministers said in a statement in april .
washington can count on support by its european partners .
" the eu reaffirms its full and unequivocal support for efforts to find a negotiated long-term solution to the iranian nuclear issue , " the ministers said .
in addition to making it clear to tehran that the eu stands behind us policy , it 's also important to send signals of eu support to washington , said michael bauer , head of the middle east project at the center for applied policy research at the university of munich .
" there are not only proponents of this new policy towards iran in washington so i think a first step would be to essentially support the advocates and make clear to them that the european position clearly welcomes this willingness for talks , " bauer said .
compromise is necessary the main point of contention continues to be iran 's nuclear program and the country 's unwillingness to permit comprehensive and strict controls .
despite the eu 's repeated efforts to find a solution , negotiations have failed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's confrontational tone is popular among the rural poor hanelt said that only the us could provide the desired security guarantees for the territory of iran and recognition of its political system .
" for this reason , europe can now achieve more it if simply provides robust support for the us administration in its forthcoming rapprochement with tehran , " hanelt said .
bauer said iran wanted to be viewed as a " legitimate political actor " with the corresponding security guarantees .
" iran is first and foremost interested in recognition of its regime by the us , " bauer said .
" this is something the europeans ca n't offer . "
but iran was also in a strong position at the moment and its support was needed for positive developments in the region , he said .
" the us and barack obama will need iran to keep iraq stable , " bauer said .
" iran is needed to get a grip on the problems in afghanistan to some extent .
iran is an important player here . "
nuclear program will continue any hopes that iran will abandon its nuclear program are futile , though .
kosten said iran will want to remain at the helm when it comes to uranium enrichment and civilian use of nuclear power .
" the question is more whether a solution can be found which enables enrichment on iranian soil , " kosten said .
" there has to be an idea how iran can exercise its rights and therefore save face . "
even an attack by israel on iran 's nuclear facilities would put the program back by a few years , but would not stop it .
iran 's nuclear program as such is not up for discussion , bauer said .
" that has to be clear and i think it is to barack obama , " bauer said .
he said the west could at most hope to gain from iran a degree of transparency of its nuclear program through cooperation with the international atomic energy agency , which can ensure that it is a civilian nuclear program .
a turning point in iran the iranian people are considered to be among the most pro-western in the middle east .
and many , especially younger people , are fed up with ahmadinejad 's confrontational tone .
mousavi supporters have been taking to tehran 's streets for nightly demonstrations to express their discontent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mousavi supporter shows where he stands ruprecht polenz , chairman of the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee , said ahmadinejad 's defeat would mean a lot for the future of young iranians .
" when you consider what needs to happen so that the economic situation improves , so that all the young people who finish university each year really have an opportunity to find a good job , then economic reform is necessary , " polenz said .
" more intense trade relations are necessary especially with developed nations , such as european countries . "
but this requires iran to change its confrontational foreign policy and focus on cooperation , he said .
ultimately , though , the real power in iran is held by its supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei .
" indeed the ayatollah is the central player in iran 's political system , even when it comes to such matters like the nuclear program , " bauer said .
" in the end , the compromise will have to be made with the revolutionary leader . "

no matter who wins , observers agree that it 's time for iran and the us to sit down at the negotiating table .
and the european union could act as a vital mediator . three candidates are running against iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is seeking a second term in friday 's presidential elections .
observers forecast that the reformists under former prime minister mir hossein mousavi have the best chances of beating ahmadinejad .
yet no matter who wins , the time has come for serious negotiations with the west regarding iran 's controversial nuclear program , said christian-peter hanelt , a middle east expert from the bertelsmann foundation .
" it is time for a rapprochement between iran , its neighbors and the west , " hanelt said .
" in order to pre-empt another confrontation in the middle east and further escalation as a result of the iranian nuclear program , american-iranian relations must be put on a sustainable footing after the iranian presidential elections . "
the european union could play a significant mediatory role in this process , said konstantin kosten , an expert on iran at the german council on foreign relations , dgap .
" the eu could certainly act as a bridge and door opener , " kosten said .
" direct contacts exist already with the iranian government and the most significant negotiating circles . "
the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana has been leading talks between iran and the so-called eu3 -lrb- referring to france , britain and germany -rrb- for years .
due to these contacts , eu officials could provide us diplomats with expertise and support .
us has full eu support the us administration has chosen a new path in its dealings with iran .
whereas former president george w. bush opted for confrontation , placing iran as part of its " axis of evil , " president barack obama is going for direct diplomacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uranium conversion facility in isfahan contributes to iran 's nuclear program in march , obama directly addressed the country 's leaders in a message to the iranian people on the occasion of nowruz , the iranian new year .
he offered tehran direct talks without any preconditions .
the us president has full backing from the eu , whose foreign ministers urged iran to take advantage of the change in us policy to seal a deal and end the stand-off over its nuclear ambitions .
" the eu warmly supports the new direction of us policy towards iran , which opens a window of opportunity for negotiations on all aspects of iran 's nuclear program and more broadly for engagement with iran , " the eu foreign ministers said in a statement in april .
washington can count on support by its european partners .
" the eu reaffirms its full and unequivocal support for efforts to find a negotiated long-term solution to the iranian nuclear issue , " the ministers said .
in addition to making it clear to tehran that the eu stands behind us policy , it 's also important to send signals of eu support to washington , said michael bauer , head of the middle east project at the center for applied policy research at the university of munich .
" there are not only proponents of this new policy towards iran in washington so i think a first step would be to essentially support the advocates and make clear to them that the european position clearly welcomes this willingness for talks , " bauer said .
compromise is necessary the main point of contention continues to be iran 's nuclear program and the country 's unwillingness to permit comprehensive and strict controls .
despite the eu 's repeated efforts to find a solution , negotiations have failed .

bauer said iran wanted to be viewed as a " legitimate political actor " with the corresponding security guarantees .
" iran is first and foremost interested in recognition of its regime by the us , " bauer said .
" this is something the europeans ca n't offer . "
but iran was also in a strong position at the moment and its support was needed for positive developments in the region , he said .
" the us and barack obama will need iran to keep iraq stable , " bauer said .
" iran is needed to get a grip on the problems in afghanistan to some extent .
iran is an important player here . "

the latest eu report puts greece and cyprus in the top spots for the cleanest beaches . the overall quality of bathing water in the eu has markedly improved since 1990 .
according to the latest annual bathing water report by the european commission and european environment agency eea , most of europe 's 21,400 bathing sites have clean water .
" high quality bathing water is essential for the well-being of european citizens and the environment , " environment commissioner stavros dimas told reporters on thursday .
" europe 's bathing sites remain clean and water quality is high . "
during the 2008 bathing season , 96 percent of coastal bathing areas and 92 percent of bathing sites in rivers and lakes complied with minimum standards , dimas said .
compliance with such mandatory values were 80 percent and 52 percent respectively in 1990 .
greece and cyprus have the cleanest beaches in the eu , while some of the purest lakes and rivers can be found in finland , sweden and germany , the report said .
however , the commission also said that clean water did not necessarily mean that the beaches themselves were also clean .
poland is the worst country in europe to go swimming in , whether in the sea , rivers or lakes , with 14.4 percent of all bathing water non-compliant with mandatory standards .
the report found that many areas of the baltic sea are suffering from an overgrowth of algae , while a relatively high number of dirty waters are found around denmark , poland and britain .
testing is still lagging behind in new eu member states romania and bulgaria .
getting people involved each year , the eu tests its waters for possible bacteriological contamination deriving from industrial waste or agriculture .
water color , acidity , and the presence of residues from detergents are also tested .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy is home to more than one third of the eu 's beaches but the report can do more than just inform europeans and tourists about where they can safely take the plunge .
it also serves as a guide to get more people involved in their local surroundings , said eea 's executive director jacqueline mcglade .
" information sources like this report and our web-based viewing tools enable citizens not only to check the quality of the bathing water in their local community or holiday destination , but also to allow them to get more actively involved in the protection of their environment , " mcglade said .
italy closed most sites more than one third of the eu 's 14,500 beaches are found in italy .
the report showed that the mediterranean country stood out with 553 coastal beaches and freshwater sites where bathing had been closed or banned throughout the 2008 season .
this was far more than in other countries .
mcglade said it was " too early to say " whether there had been an improvement at those sites since last year as the data was not yet available .
of the 14,551 coastal bathing areas in the european union , bathing was banned or closed throughout the season in only 307 sites and was found not to be complying with eu standards in 208 sites .
among the 6,890 freshwater sites , bathing was banned at 315 sites and was not up to eu standards in 196. sac / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

greece and cyprus have the cleanest beaches in the eu , while some of the purest lakes and rivers can be found in finland , sweden and germany , the report said .

poland is the worst country in europe to go swimming in , whether in the sea , rivers or lakes , with 14.4 percent of all bathing water non-compliant with mandatory standards .

but the government says it needs more details before it can make a decision . the interior ministry said on thursday that it was unable to accept the us request based on the data provided .
" we 're examining two new cases , " ministry spokesman stefan paris said in berlin .
" the information provided by the united states is not sufficient for now for us to give the green light for taking in the two men . "
the interior ministry would need to check whether the prisoners represented a security risk , he said .
also , berlin needed to know why the men could not be taken in by the us and what ties they had to germany .
paris would not disclose the nationality of the two men .
security sources said one was syrian , the other tunisian .
resistance at home and abroad in april , the us made an initial request , presenting the german government with a list of nine chinese uighur detainees for berlin to " consider . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palau is offering 17 uighers a new temporary home interior minister wolfgang schaeuble had also replied in that case that the information provided was insufficient to warrant a positive reply .
us president barack obama has pledged to close the facility at the us naval base at guantanamo bay , cuba by early next year .
many of the inmates have already been cleared for release .
but us officials are having difficulty finding countries that will take them in , and meeting resistance at home to housing them on us soil .
the tiny pacific nation palau on agreed wednesday to take in up to 17 uighur guantanamo detainees .
four further uighur men who had been held at the prison camp were sent to bermuda on thursday .
sharp political debate german politicians have disagreed on the issue .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat candidate to challenge chancellor angela merkel in september 's federal election , has spoken in favor of accepting inmates .
but interior minister schaeuble has voiced skepticism .
on a visit to germany last week , obama said after talks with merkel that he had neither asked for nor received any hard commitments from berlin on taking guantanamo detainees .
he said merkel had been " very open " to discussions on the issue .
opposition politicians have been very critical of the government 's stance .
claudia roth , co-leader of the green party , said schaeuble was using " stalling tactics . "
" he 's acting on the maxim : we do n't know anything , we have to check things first , we have to deliberate so long until someone else takes this decision of our hands , " roth said in reference to the uighur case .
michael leutert , the human rights spokesman for the left party 's parliamentary group , said accepting the inmates was " a simple humanitarian act . "
" it is not plausible that two people proven innocent pose an uncalculated security risk for germany , " leutert said .

but the government says it needs more details before it can make a decision . the interior ministry said on thursday that it was unable to accept the us request based on the data provided .
" we 're examining two new cases , " ministry spokesman stefan paris said in berlin .
" the information provided by the united states is not sufficient for now for us to give the green light for taking in the two men . "
the interior ministry would need to check whether the prisoners represented a security risk , he said .
also , berlin needed to know why the men could not be taken in by the us and what ties they had to germany .
paris would not disclose the nationality of the two men .
security sources said one was syrian , the other tunisian .
resistance at home and abroad in april , the us made an initial request , presenting the german government with a list of nine chinese uighur detainees for berlin to " consider . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palau is offering 17 uighers a new temporary home interior minister wolfgang schaeuble had also replied in that case that the information provided was insufficient to warrant a positive reply .
us president barack obama has pledged to close the facility at the us naval base at guantanamo bay , cuba by early next year .
many of the inmates have already been cleared for release .
but us officials are having difficulty finding countries that will take them in , and meeting resistance at home to housing them on us soil .
the tiny pacific nation palau on agreed wednesday to take in up to 17 uighur guantanamo detainees .
four further uighur men who had been held at the prison camp were sent to bermuda on thursday .
sharp political debate german politicians have disagreed on the issue .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat candidate to challenge chancellor angela merkel in september 's federal election , has spoken in favor of accepting inmates .
but interior minister schaeuble has voiced skepticism .
on a visit to germany last week , obama said after talks with merkel that he had neither asked for nor received any hard commitments from berlin on taking guantanamo detainees .
he said merkel had been " very open " to discussions on the issue .
opposition politicians have been very critical of the government 's stance .
claudia roth , co-leader of the green party , said schaeuble was using " stalling tactics . "
" he 's acting on the maxim : we do n't know anything , we have to check things first , we have to deliberate so long until someone else takes this decision of our hands , " roth said in reference to the uighur case .
michael leutert , the human rights spokesman for the left party 's parliamentary group , said accepting the inmates was " a simple humanitarian act . "
" it is not plausible that two people proven innocent pose an uncalculated security risk for germany , " leutert said .

a bureaucratic blunder had allowed him to reside legally in bonn for half a year , despite his name being on a blacklist . former thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra spent six months almost unnoticed in the former german capital bonn .
though declared a persona non grata , thaksin managed to enter germany on december 29 , 2008 using a schengen visa issued in france .
it allows a person to travel through much of the european union on a single visa .
bonn authorities then issued the residence permit for thaksin , who used his german lawyer 's address .
federal officials only learned about it in april and ordered it revoked .
" we asked bonn to revoke the permit and they responded immediately , " hanns schumacher , germany 's ambassador to thailand , told reuters on wednesday .
bonn authorities said thaksin 's name had not been on a list of people barred from germany and he had presented all the necessary documents .
this included a certificate from a german federal justice agency saying he had no criminal record .
he had also proved he had adequate funds to live and a valid passport .
officials said the absence of his name from the list of barred persons was the result of a data-entry oversight by staff of the german foreign ministry .
" we informed the lawyer that the permit was revoked and should thaksin still be in germany , his stay would be illegal and he would face detention , " schumacher said .

a bureaucratic blunder had allowed him to reside legally in bonn for half a year , despite his name being on a blacklist . former thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra spent six months almost unnoticed in the former german capital bonn .
though declared a persona non grata , thaksin managed to enter germany on december 29 , 2008 using a schengen visa issued in france .
it allows a person to travel through much of the european union on a single visa .
bonn authorities then issued the residence permit for thaksin , who used his german lawyer 's address .
federal officials only learned about it in april and ordered it revoked .
" we asked bonn to revoke the permit and they responded immediately , " hanns schumacher , germany 's ambassador to thailand , told reuters on wednesday .
bonn authorities said thaksin 's name had not been on a list of people barred from germany and he had presented all the necessary documents .
this included a certificate from a german federal justice agency saying he had no criminal record .
he had also proved he had adequate funds to live and a valid passport .
officials said the absence of his name from the list of barred persons was the result of a data-entry oversight by staff of the german foreign ministry .
" we informed the lawyer that the permit was revoked and should thaksin still be in germany , his stay would be illegal and he would face detention , " schumacher said .

he has expressed the hope that israeli-palestinian peace efforts would resume in the near future . " a lot of important things are taking place , " he told reporters in jerusalem .
the eu 's foreign policy coordinator said that us president barack obama 's recent speech to the muslim world had been a crucial step in the right direction .
obama had urged the two sides in the middle east conflict to find a lasting settlement .
solana also mentioned last week 's elections in lebanon where iranian-backed hezbollah failed to capitalize on anti-israeli sentiment .
solana said it was a good time to " see how we can bring back the situation to something that can be moving in the right direction . "
last year , the peace process was dealt a setback by the israeli military offensive in the gaza strip .
solana added that he expected israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to endorse a two-state solution and to freeze israeli settlement in the palestinian territories .
" that 's what we expect to hear and i am sure something of that nature will happen , " solana said in reference to a speech netanyahu announced for sunday where he will outline his government 's policies on the peace process .
so far , netanyahu who heads a right-of-center coalition , has refused to publicly back a palestinian state or order a halt to settlement construction .

he has expressed the hope that israeli-palestinian peace efforts would resume in the near future . " a lot of important things are taking place , " he told reporters in jerusalem .
the eu 's foreign policy coordinator said that us president barack obama 's recent speech to the muslim world had been a crucial step in the right direction .
obama had urged the two sides in the middle east conflict to find a lasting settlement .
solana also mentioned last week 's elections in lebanon where iranian-backed hezbollah failed to capitalize on anti-israeli sentiment .
solana said it was a good time to " see how we can bring back the situation to something that can be moving in the right direction . "
last year , the peace process was dealt a setback by the israeli military offensive in the gaza strip .
solana added that he expected israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to endorse a two-state solution and to freeze israeli settlement in the palestinian territories .
" that 's what we expect to hear and i am sure something of that nature will happen , " solana said in reference to a speech netanyahu announced for sunday where he will outline his government 's policies on the peace process .
so far , netanyahu who heads a right-of-center coalition , has refused to publicly back a palestinian state or order a halt to settlement construction .
solana is to continue his tour of the middle east by meeting with palestinian , lebanese and egyptian leaders. ai / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" with the entry into office of president obama , there is a genuine chance for new cooperation between the united states , the european union and russia , " steinmeier said .
" the ghost of the cold war has been banished ...
so i would like to say that the extended hand of the us president should be boldly accepted , " he said .
earlier , steinmeier told reporters that the security council 's five permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - as well as japan and south korea had agreed to toughen their stance against north korea after pyongyang tested a nuclear device and launched several missiles in recent weeks .
" the efforts made for a resolution were rewarded with success , " steinmeier said at a joint press conference with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov in moscow on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea has tested several missiles this year diplomats say the latest draft resolution " calls upon " countries to inspect north korean ships carrying suspicious cargo that might violate a partial un trade and arms embargo , although it does not demand it .
the document does , however , require governemnts to deny fuel to any suspicious north korea vessles and direct them to dock at " an appropriate and convenient port . "
reaching out disarmament was a key theme throughout steinmeier 's two-day visit to moscow , during which he also met with russian president dmitry medvedev .
in his address to the russian academy of science , steinmeier said that all nations should make constructive efforts to disarm .
" this has to be the year when international disarmament efforts move back to the top of the agenda , " he said .

"
steinmeier called the warming of relations between the kremlin and the us a " unique historic opportunity . "

us president obama is scheduled to travel to moscow early next month for key talks on a follow-up to start , which expires on december 5 .
us and russian negotiators have been holding preliminary meetings ahead of those talks .
moscow has said it wants to link the nuclear talks to washington 's plans to deploy an anti-missile shield in central europe - a plan the kremlin firmly opposes .
russian prime minister vladimir putin said the kremlin would consider getting rid of its nuclear arsenal if all other countries agreed to do so as well .
after meeting the german foreign minister , putin was asked if he could imagine a russia without nuclear weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what do we need nuclear weapons for ? "
putin asked " of course , " he answered .
" what do we need nuclear weapons for ? "
putin 's answer did have one caveat , however .
" if those who invented the atomic bomb , and used it , are prepared to do away with atom bombs , then we would welcome this , " he said , suggesting his country 's involvement is dependent on us disarmament .
the russian news agency interfax , however , has reported that russia wants to keep at least 1,500 nuclear warheads .
other business in addition to disarmament , steinmeier also spoke with russian leaders about combating the effects of the global financial crisis .
putin praised berlin 's active role in negotiating a plan to rescue struggling carmaker opel , which now counts russian state-owned lender sberbank as one of its major stakeholders .
the three leaders agreed to increase cooperation in the energy sector , particularly in renewable fuel sources and efficiency .
steinmeier also addressed the controversial topics of human rights and moscow 's relations with tbilisi in the wake of last year 's military conflict between russia and georgia .
he urged moscow to adopt a " constructive " role in the caucasus and stressed that unresolved territorial disputes did not have a place in the europe of the 21st century .
during a visit to the editorial office of the novaya gazeta , a newspaper known for being critical of the kremlin , steinmeier wrote that democracy and a free press go together like breathing and air. sje / hf / dpa / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

us and russian negotiators have been holding preliminary meetings ahead of those talks .
moscow has said it wants to link the nuclear talks to washington 's plans to deploy an anti-missile shield in central europe - a plan the kremlin firmly opposes .

the russian news agency interfax , however , has reported that russia wants to keep at least 1,500 nuclear warheads .

steinmeier also addressed the controversial topics of human rights and moscow 's relations with tbilisi in the wake of last year 's military conflict between russia and georgia .
he urged moscow to adopt a " constructive " role in the caucasus and stressed that unresolved territorial disputes did not have a place in the europe of the 21st century .

" let me stress : this is a formal statement about the geographical spread of the disease ...
it is not in itself a cause for alarm , " the un secretary general told a press conference . " though infectious , this new virus has so far not been as severe as had been feared and death rates have been low , " he added .
" we must therefore be prepared .

chrysler filed for bankruptcy on april 30 and is seeking to re-emerge within the next 30 to 60 days .

" there is no doubt in my mind that we will get the job done , " marchionne said in a letter to employees .
he called the alliance a " bold first step to implement " lessons learned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fiat chief sergio marchionne is upbeat about the merged company 's chances marchionne said earlier that the merged chrysler and fiat ranked as the world 's sixth largest automaker .
marchionne said fiat will begin the process of transferring fiat 's technology , platforms and powertrains to chrysler plants in the next few months .
the white house welcomed the completion of the deal and said the new alliance was " poised to emerge as a competitive , viable automaker . "
us court paves way for deal the deal 's completion came a day after the us supreme court lifted a stay on a lower court 's approval of the deal .
the court said a group of indiana pension funds opposed to the deal had failed to show " that the circumstances justify " delaying proceedings to accommodate their challenge .
the funds had argued that the white house-backed sale of chrysler to fiat is unconstitutional because it puts the rights of junior creditors ahead of the rights of senior lenders .
they also said the us treasury had overstepped its legal authority by using some $ 12 billion in financial bailout funds to reorganize chrysler when congress had intended the money for banks .
chrysler 's sale to fiat , a union-aligned trust and the us and canadian governments is aimed at pulling the company out of bankruptcy and reorganizing it to cope with changing economic conditions and consumer tastes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrysler may get a new life under fiat but it still needs to overcome past problems the court gave the transaction the green light after the government filed a brief warning that fiat could walk away from the chrysler deal if it was not finalized by june 15 .
" if fiat is released from the obligation to consummate the transaction as currently structured , it will be free to demand additional concessions before concluding a new agreement , " the justice dpartment brief said .
the statement said that because chrysler is not manufacturing cars , each day of bankruptcy was costing the company approximately $ 100 million .
chrysler filed for bankruptcy on april 30 and is seeking to re-emerge within the next 30 to 60 days .
its rapid turnaround plan is expected to serve as a precedent for general motors , which has filed for creditor protection as part of a plan that offloads its german subsidiary opel and gives the us government a majority stake in the new gm .
" cash for clunkers " bill approved meanwhile , the " cash for clunkers " bill , one of president obama 's consumer incentives for new car purchases , was approved by the house of representatives this week .
the bill aims to boost new car sales by allowing consumers to turn in their gas-guzzling cars and trucks for vouchers worth up to $ 4,500 toward more fuel-efficient vehicles . the measure is part of the obama 's administration 's efforts to stimulate car sales and increase the fleet of fuel-efficient vehicles on the nation 's highways . the us car industry has been searching for new incentives after months of poor car sale .

" there is no doubt in my mind that we will get the job done , " marchionne said in a letter to employees .
he called the alliance a " bold first step to implement " lessons learned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fiat chief sergio marchionne is upbeat about the merged company 's chances marchionne said earlier that the merged chrysler and fiat ranked as the world 's sixth largest automaker .
marchionne said fiat will begin the process of transferring fiat 's technology , platforms and powertrains to chrysler plants in the next few months .
the white house welcomed the completion of the deal and said the new alliance was " poised to emerge as a competitive , viable automaker . "
us court paves way for deal the deal 's completion came a day after the us supreme court lifted a stay on a lower court 's approval of the deal .
the court said a group of indiana pension funds opposed to the deal had failed to show " that the circumstances justify " delaying proceedings to accommodate their challenge .
the funds had argued that the white house-backed sale of chrysler to fiat is unconstitutional because it puts the rights of junior creditors ahead of the rights of senior lenders .
they also said the us treasury had overstepped its legal authority by using some $ 12 billion in financial bailout funds to reorganize chrysler when congress had intended the money for banks .
chrysler 's sale to fiat , a union-aligned trust and the us and canadian governments is aimed at pulling the company out of bankruptcy and reorganizing it to cope with changing economic conditions and consumer tastes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrysler may get a new life under fiat but it still needs to overcome past problems the court gave the transaction the green light after the government filed a brief warning that fiat could walk away from the chrysler deal if it was not finalized by june 15 .
" if fiat is released from the obligation to consummate the transaction as currently structured , it will be free to demand additional concessions before concluding a new agreement , " the justice dpartment brief said .
the statement said that because chrysler is not manufacturing cars , each day of bankruptcy was costing the company approximately $ 100 million .
chrysler filed for bankruptcy on april 30 and is seeking to re-emerge within the next 30 to 60 days .
its rapid turnaround plan is expected to serve as a precedent for general motors , which has filed for creditor protection as part of a plan that offloads its german subsidiary opel and gives the us government a majority stake in the new gm .
" cash for clunkers " bill approved meanwhile , the " cash for clunkers " bill , one of president obama 's consumer incentives for new car purchases , was approved by the house of representatives this week .
the bill aims to boost new car sales by allowing consumers to turn in their gas-guzzling cars and trucks for vouchers worth up to $ 4,500 toward more fuel-efficient vehicles . the measure is part of the obama 's administration 's efforts to stimulate car sales and increase the fleet of fuel-efficient vehicles on the nation 's highways . the us car industry has been searching for new incentives after months of poor car sale .
in may , overall auto sales were 34 percent lower than a year ago . sje / reuters / dpa / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite soaking up billions of euros in subsidies , germany 's eastern states still suffer from higher unemployment and lower productivity and per capita wealth .
migration is also a big problem .
but it appears that germany 's deepest recession since world war ii is having an unexpected side effect .
" so far , the east has not been hit as hard , " tiefensee said .
" twenty years after the peaceful revolution and the fall of the wall , the achievements of the east germans are being recognized in 2009 , " tiefensee told reporters after presenting the report to the cabinet .
smaller enterprises aiding eastern states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee presents the 2009 unity report tiefensee said that the eastern states are home to a larger proportion of smaller firms which are more flexible than big companies and less dependent on exports , which have slumped in the last few months .
he pointed in particular to the technology sector , where growth is higher in eastern states , especially in the solar energy sector which is strong there .
meanwhile the manufacturing industry in the west , which is heavily reliant on exports , has borne the brunt of the global downturn .
tiefensee noted that the western states ' " unprecedented solidarity " with the east , including more than one trillion euros in subsidies since national unification in 1990 , had been crucial to getting the region back on its feet .
gross national product per person in the east rose to 71 percent of that of a westerner last year , compared to 67 percent in 2000 , the report said .
industry in the east has grown by 7.5 percent over the last three years , compared to 4.3 percent in the west .
unemployment still a germany-wide problem tiefensee said that while unemployment had stayed roughly stable in eastern states in the last year , it had risen to 6.9 percent in may in western states from 6.4 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has stabilized in the east but is still high dspite the positive figures , divisions between eastern and western germany are still wide .
jobless figures are still twice as high in the east as in western states and long-term unemployment is a major problem .
unemployment stands at 13.3 percent in eastern states and is likely to rise further still in the coming months .
job migration is also a big problem .
young people , especially women , tend to abandon the east in search of work , leaving some areas as a wasteland .
about 90,000 people ditched the east for the west each year in the recent past , against just 40,000 people moving east .
" we have come a long way , but there is still a lot of work to do , " tiefensee said , adding that so-called " solidarity tax " payments to the east would likely continue for another decade , until 2019 .
by that time , he said , some of the eastern states could even overtake poorer western regions in terms of gross domestic product .
opposition accuses minister of election games opposition parties seized on the report to accuse tiefensee of scoring points for his social democrats , the junior partners in germany 's ruling coalition with chancellor merkel 's conservatives , ahead of the september general election .
" it is a clumsy attempt to win votes in the east when you tell people that the rest of the job will be finished in 10 years , " expert on eastern affairs for the liberal free democrats , joachim guenther , said. nda , afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gross national product per person in the east rose to 71 percent of that of a westerner last year , compared to 67 percent in 2000 , the report said .
industry in the east has grown by 7.5 percent over the last three years , compared to 4.3 percent in the west .

jobless figures are still twice as high in the east as in western states and long-term unemployment is a major problem .
unemployment stands at 13.3 percent in eastern states and is likely to rise further still in the coming months .
job migration is also a big problem .
young people , especially women , tend to abandon the east in search of work , leaving some areas as a wasteland .
about 90,000 people ditched the east for the west each year in the recent past , against just 40,000 people moving east .
" we have come a long way , but there is still a lot of work to do , " tiefensee said , adding that so-called " solidarity tax " payments to the east would likely continue for another decade , until 2019 .
by that time , he said , some of the eastern states could even overtake poorer western regions in terms of gross domestic product .

the draft urges countries to inspect north korean vessels , to cut back financial ties and expand the arms embargo . the five permanent members of the security council plus japan and south korea on wednesday agreed on a package of expanded sanctions against pyongyang .
the draft resolution " condemns in the strongest terms " north korea 's nuclear test last month and demands that it " not conduct any further nuclear test or any launch using ballistic missile technology . "
the draft calls for tougher inspections of north korean cargo vessels and for a cutting of financial ties with the country .
the existing arms embargo is to be stepped up . " the efforts made for a resolution were rewarded with success , " germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said during a visit to moscow .
" we expect a vote at the security council by friday at the latest , " he told a news conference after talks with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov .
the draft is a compromise as both china and russia had objected to earlier versions which would have required all countries to inspect north korean ships carrying suspicious cargo .

rice said north korea 's behaviour was unacceptable and stressed that the objective of the new resolution was to get pyongyang to enter international talks .
" they must pay a price , they are to return without conditions to a process of negotiations and that the consequences they will face are significant , " rice told reporters .
" this sanctions regime , if passed by the security council , will bite in a meaningful way , " she said . north korea launched a long-range missile in april , triggering a rebuke from the un security council .
the regime in pyongyang then responded by declaring it had staged a successful nuclear weapons test , following one in 2006 .

the draft resolution " condemns in the strongest terms " north korea 's nuclear test last month and demands that it " not conduct any further nuclear test or any launch using ballistic missile technology . "
the draft calls for tougher inspections of north korean cargo vessels and for a cutting of financial ties with the country .

the draft is a compromise as both china and russia had objected to earlier versions which would have required all countries to inspect north korean ships carrying suspicious cargo .

the latest eu report puts greece and cyprus in the top spots for the cleanest beaches . the overall quality of bathing water in the eu has markedly improved since 1990 .
according to the latest annual bathing water report by the european commission and european environment agency eea , most of europe 's 21,400 bathing sites have clean water .
" high quality bathing water is essential for the well-being of european citizens and the environment , " environment commissioner stavros dimas told reporters on thursday .
" europe 's bathing sites remain clean and water quality is high . "
during the 2008 bathing season , 96 percent of coastal bathing areas and 92 percent of bathing sites in rivers and lakes complied with minimum standards , dimas said .
compliance with such mandatory values were 80 percent and 52 percent respectively in 1990 .
greece and cyprus have the cleanest beaches in the eu , while some of the purest lakes and rivers can be found in finland , sweden and germany , the report said .
however , the commission also said that clean water did not necessarily mean that the beaches themselves were also clean .
poland is the worst country in europe to go swimming in , whether in the sea , rivers or lakes , with 14.4 percent of all bathing water non-compliant with mandatory standards .
the report found that many areas of the baltic sea are suffering from an overgrowth of algae , while a relatively high number of dirty waters are found around denmark , poland and britain .
testing is still lagging behind in new eu member states romania and bulgaria .
getting people involved each year , the eu tests its waters for possible bacteriological contamination deriving from industrial waste or agriculture .
water color , acidity , and the presence of residues from detergents are also tested .

" information sources like this report and our web-based viewing tools enable citizens not only to check the quality of the bathing water in their local community or holiday destination , but also to allow them to get more actively involved in the protection of their environment , " mcglade said .
italy closed most sites more than one third of the eu 's 14,500 beaches are found in italy .
the report showed that the mediterranean country stood out with 553 coastal beaches and freshwater sites where bathing had been closed or banned throughout the 2008 season .
this was far more than in other countries .
mcglade said it was " too early to say " whether there had been an improvement at those sites since last year as the data was not yet available .
of the 14,551 coastal bathing areas in the european union , bathing was banned or closed throughout the season in only 307 sites and was found not to be complying with eu standards in 208 sites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 11.06.2009 italian carmaker fiat closes chrysler deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new chrysler group llc ceo sergio marchionne addresses employees in the us fiat on wednesday closed a deal to take over the strongest assets of bankrupt us automaker chrysler , the first step in the italian company 's ambitious drive to create a global car giant . fiat chief executive sergio marchionne , who became ceo of the new chrysler group llc on wednesday , said he was optimistic about the new venture .
" there is no doubt in my mind that we will get the job done , " marchionne said in a letter to employees .
he called the alliance a " bold first step to implement " lessons learned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fiat chief sergio marchionne is upbeat about the merged company 's chances marchionne said earlier that the merged chrysler and fiat ranked as the world 's sixth largest automaker .
marchionne said fiat will begin the process of transferring fiat 's technology , platforms and powertrains to chrysler plants in the next few months .
the white house welcomed the completion of the deal and said the new alliance was " poised to emerge as a competitive , viable automaker . "
us court paves way for deal the deal 's completion came a day after the us supreme court lifted a stay on a lower court 's approval of the deal .
the court said a group of indiana pension funds opposed to the deal had failed to show " that the circumstances justify " delaying proceedings to accommodate their challenge .
the funds had argued that the white house-backed sale of chrysler to fiat is unconstitutional because it puts the rights of junior creditors ahead of the rights of senior lenders .
they also said the us treasury had overstepped its legal authority by using some $ 12 billion in financial bailout funds to reorganize chrysler when congress had intended the money for banks .
chrysler 's sale to fiat , a union-aligned trust and the us and canadian governments is aimed at pulling the company out of bankruptcy and reorganizing it to cope with changing economic conditions and consumer tastes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrysler may get a new life under fiat but it still needs to overcome past problems the court gave the transaction the green light after the government filed a brief warning that fiat could walk away from the chrysler deal if it was not finalized by june 15 .
" if fiat is released from the obligation to consummate the transaction as currently structured , it will be free to demand additional concessions before concluding a new agreement , " the justice dpartment brief said .
the statement said that because chrysler is not manufacturing cars , each day of bankruptcy was costing the company approximately $ 100 million .
chrysler filed for bankruptcy on april 30 and is seeking to re-emerge within the next 30 to 60 days .
its rapid turnaround plan is expected to serve as a precedent for general motors , which has filed for creditor protection as part of a plan that offloads its german subsidiary opel and gives the us government a majority stake in the new gm .

" there is no doubt in my mind that we will get the job done , " marchionne said in a letter to employees .
he called the alliance a " bold first step to implement " lessons learned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fiat chief sergio marchionne is upbeat about the merged company 's chances marchionne said earlier that the merged chrysler and fiat ranked as the world 's sixth largest automaker .
marchionne said fiat will begin the process of transferring fiat 's technology , platforms and powertrains to chrysler plants in the next few months .
the white house welcomed the completion of the deal and said the new alliance was " poised to emerge as a competitive , viable automaker . "
us court paves way for deal the deal 's completion came a day after the us supreme court lifted a stay on a lower court 's approval of the deal .
the court said a group of indiana pension funds opposed to the deal had failed to show " that the circumstances justify " delaying proceedings to accommodate their challenge .
the funds had argued that the white house-backed sale of chrysler to fiat is unconstitutional because it puts the rights of junior creditors ahead of the rights of senior lenders .
they also said the us treasury had overstepped its legal authority by using some $ 12 billion in financial bailout funds to reorganize chrysler when congress had intended the money for banks .
chrysler 's sale to fiat , a union-aligned trust and the us and canadian governments is aimed at pulling the company out of bankruptcy and reorganizing it to cope with changing economic conditions and consumer tastes .

" if fiat is released from the obligation to consummate the transaction as currently structured , it will be free to demand additional concessions before concluding a new agreement , " the justice dpartment brief said .
the statement said that because chrysler is not manufacturing cars , each day of bankruptcy was costing the company approximately $ 100 million .
chrysler filed for bankruptcy on april 30 and is seeking to re-emerge within the next 30 to 60 days .
its rapid turnaround plan is expected to serve as a precedent for general motors , which has filed for creditor protection as part of a plan that offloads its german subsidiary opel and gives the us government a majority stake in the new gm .

" there is no doubt in my mind that we will get the job done , " marchionne said in a letter to employees .
he called the alliance a " bold first step to implement " lessons learned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fiat chief sergio marchionne is upbeat about the merged company 's chances marchionne said earlier that the merged chrysler and fiat ranked as the world 's sixth largest automaker .
marchionne said fiat will begin the process of transferring fiat 's technology , platforms and powertrains to chrysler plants in the next few months .
the white house welcomed the completion of the deal and said the new alliance was " poised to emerge as a competitive , viable automaker . "
us court paves way for deal the deal 's completion came a day after the us supreme court lifted a stay on a lower court 's approval of the deal .
the court said a group of indiana pension funds opposed to the deal had failed to show " that the circumstances justify " delaying proceedings to accommodate their challenge .
the funds had argued that the white house-backed sale of chrysler to fiat is unconstitutional because it puts the rights of junior creditors ahead of the rights of senior lenders .
they also said the us treasury had overstepped its legal authority by using some $ 12 billion in financial bailout funds to reorganize chrysler when congress had intended the money for banks .
chrysler 's sale to fiat , a union-aligned trust and the us and canadian governments is aimed at pulling the company out of bankruptcy and reorganizing it to cope with changing economic conditions and consumer tastes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrysler may get a new life under fiat but it still needs to overcome past problems the court gave the transaction the green light after the government filed a brief warning that fiat could walk away from the chrysler deal if it was not finalized by june 15 .
" if fiat is released from the obligation to consummate the transaction as currently structured , it will be free to demand additional concessions before concluding a new agreement , " the justice dpartment brief said .
the statement said that because chrysler is not manufacturing cars , each day of bankruptcy was costing the company approximately $ 100 million .
chrysler filed for bankruptcy on april 30 and is seeking to re-emerge within the next 30 to 60 days .
its rapid turnaround plan is expected to serve as a precedent for general motors , which has filed for creditor protection as part of a plan that offloads its german subsidiary opel and gives the us government a majority stake in the new gm .
" cash for clunkers " bill approved meanwhile , the " cash for clunkers " bill , one of president obama 's consumer incentives for new car purchases , was approved by the house of representatives this week .
the bill aims to boost new car sales by allowing consumers to turn in their gas-guzzling cars and trucks for vouchers worth up to $ 4,500 toward more fuel-efficient vehicles . the measure is part of the obama 's administration 's efforts to stimulate car sales and increase the fleet of fuel-efficient vehicles on the nation 's highways . the us car industry has been searching for new incentives after months of poor car sale .

no matter who wins , observers agree that it 's time for iran and the us to sit down at the negotiating table .
and the european union could act as a vital mediator . three candidates are running against iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is seeking a second term in friday 's presidential elections .
observers forecast that the reformists under former prime minister mir hossein mousavi have the best chances of beating ahmadinejad .
yet no matter who wins , the time has come for serious negotiations with the west regarding iran 's controversial nuclear program , said christian-peter hanelt , a middle east expert from the bertelsmann foundation .
" it is time for a rapprochement between iran , its neighbors and the west , " hanelt said .
" in order to pre-empt another confrontation in the middle east and further escalation as a result of the iranian nuclear program , american-iranian relations must be put on a sustainable footing after the iranian presidential elections . "
the european union could play a significant mediatory role in this process , said konstantin kosten , an expert on iran at the german council on foreign relations , dgap .
" the eu could certainly act as a bridge and door opener , " kosten said .
" direct contacts exist already with the iranian government and the most significant negotiating circles . "
the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana has been leading talks between iran and the so-called eu3 -lrb- referring to france , britain and germany -rrb- for years .
due to these contacts , eu officials could provide us diplomats with expertise and support .
us has full eu support the us administration has chosen a new path in its dealings with iran .
whereas former president george w. bush opted for confrontation , placing iran as part of its " axis of evil , " president barack obama is going for direct diplomacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uranium conversion facility in isfahan contributes to iran 's nuclear program in march , obama directly addressed the country 's leaders in a message to the iranian people on the occasion of nowruz , the iranian new year .
he offered tehran direct talks without any preconditions .
the us president has full backing from the eu , whose foreign ministers urged iran to take advantage of the change in us policy to seal a deal and end the stand-off over its nuclear ambitions .
" the eu warmly supports the new direction of us policy towards iran , which opens a window of opportunity for negotiations on all aspects of iran 's nuclear program and more broadly for engagement with iran , " the eu foreign ministers said in a statement in april .
washington can count on support by its european partners .
" the eu reaffirms its full and unequivocal support for efforts to find a negotiated long-term solution to the iranian nuclear issue , " the ministers said .
in addition to making it clear to tehran that the eu stands behind us policy , it 's also important to send signals of eu support to washington , said michael bauer , head of the middle east project at the center for applied policy research at the university of munich .
" there are not only proponents of this new policy towards iran in washington so i think a first step would be to essentially support the advocates and make clear to them that the european position clearly welcomes this willingness for talks , " bauer said .
compromise is necessary the main point of contention continues to be iran 's nuclear program and the country 's unwillingness to permit comprehensive and strict controls .
despite the eu 's repeated efforts to find a solution , negotiations have failed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's confrontational tone is popular among the rural poor hanelt said that only the us could provide the desired security guarantees for the territory of iran and recognition of its political system .
" for this reason , europe can now achieve more it if simply provides robust support for the us administration in its forthcoming rapprochement with tehran , " hanelt said .
bauer said iran wanted to be viewed as a " legitimate political actor " with the corresponding security guarantees .
" iran is first and foremost interested in recognition of its regime by the us , " bauer said .
" this is something the europeans ca n't offer . "
but iran was also in a strong position at the moment and its support was needed for positive developments in the region , he said .
" the us and barack obama will need iran to keep iraq stable , " bauer said .
" iran is needed to get a grip on the problems in afghanistan to some extent .
iran is an important player here . "
nuclear program will continue any hopes that iran will abandon its nuclear program are futile , though .
kosten said iran will want to remain at the helm when it comes to uranium enrichment and civilian use of nuclear power .
" the question is more whether a solution can be found which enables enrichment on iranian soil , " kosten said .
" there has to be an idea how iran can exercise its rights and therefore save face . "
even an attack by israel on iran 's nuclear facilities would put the program back by a few years , but would not stop it .
iran 's nuclear program as such is not up for discussion , bauer said .
" that has to be clear and i think it is to barack obama , " bauer said .
he said the west could at most hope to gain from iran a degree of transparency of its nuclear program through cooperation with the international atomic energy agency , which can ensure that it is a civilian nuclear program .
a turning point in iran the iranian people are considered to be among the most pro-western in the middle east .
and many , especially younger people , are fed up with ahmadinejad 's confrontational tone .
mousavi supporters have been taking to tehran 's streets for nightly demonstrations to express their discontent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mousavi supporter shows where he stands ruprecht polenz , chairman of the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee , said ahmadinejad 's defeat would mean a lot for the future of young iranians .
" when you consider what needs to happen so that the economic situation improves , so that all the young people who finish university each year really have an opportunity to find a good job , then economic reform is necessary , " polenz said .
" more intense trade relations are necessary especially with developed nations , such as european countries . "
but this requires iran to change its confrontational foreign policy and focus on cooperation , he said .
ultimately , though , the real power in iran is held by its supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei .
" indeed the ayatollah is the central player in iran 's political system , even when it comes to such matters like the nuclear program , " bauer said .
" in the end , the compromise will have to be made with the revolutionary leader . "

compromise is necessary the main point of contention continues to be iran 's nuclear program and the country 's unwillingness to permit comprehensive and strict controls .
despite the eu 's repeated efforts to find a solution , negotiations have failed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's confrontational tone is popular among the rural poor hanelt said that only the us could provide the desired security guarantees for the territory of iran and recognition of its political system .
" for this reason , europe can now achieve more it if simply provides robust support for the us administration in its forthcoming rapprochement with tehran , " hanelt said .
bauer said iran wanted to be viewed as a " legitimate political actor " with the corresponding security guarantees .
" iran is first and foremost interested in recognition of its regime by the us , " bauer said .
" this is something the europeans ca n't offer . "
but iran was also in a strong position at the moment and its support was needed for positive developments in the region , he said .
" the us and barack obama will need iran to keep iraq stable , " bauer said .
" iran is needed to get a grip on the problems in afghanistan to some extent .
iran is an important player here . "
nuclear program will continue any hopes that iran will abandon its nuclear program are futile , though .
kosten said iran will want to remain at the helm when it comes to uranium enrichment and civilian use of nuclear power .
" the question is more whether a solution can be found which enables enrichment on iranian soil , " kosten said .
" there has to be an idea how iran can exercise its rights and therefore save face . "
even an attack by israel on iran 's nuclear facilities would put the program back by a few years , but would not stop it .
iran 's nuclear program as such is not up for discussion , bauer said .
" that has to be clear and i think it is to barack obama , " bauer said .
he said the west could at most hope to gain from iran a degree of transparency of its nuclear program through cooperation with the international atomic energy agency , which can ensure that it is a civilian nuclear program .
a turning point in iran the iranian people are considered to be among the most pro-western in the middle east .
and many , especially younger people , are fed up with ahmadinejad 's confrontational tone .
mousavi supporters have been taking to tehran 's streets for nightly demonstrations to express their discontent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mousavi supporter shows where he stands ruprecht polenz , chairman of the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee , said ahmadinejad 's defeat would mean a lot for the future of young iranians .
" when you consider what needs to happen so that the economic situation improves , so that all the young people who finish university each year really have an opportunity to find a good job , then economic reform is necessary , " polenz said .
" more intense trade relations are necessary especially with developed nations , such as european countries . "
but this requires iran to change its confrontational foreign policy and focus on cooperation , he said .
ultimately , though , the real power in iran is held by its supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei .
" indeed the ayatollah is the central player in iran 's political system , even when it comes to such matters like the nuclear program , " bauer said .
" in the end , the compromise will have to be made with the revolutionary leader . "

and the european union could act as a vital mediator . three candidates are running against iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is seeking a second term in friday 's presidential elections .
observers forecast that the reformists under former prime minister mir hossein mousavi have the best chances of beating ahmadinejad .
yet no matter who wins , the time has come for serious negotiations with the west regarding iran 's controversial nuclear program , said christian-peter hanelt , a middle east expert from the bertelsmann foundation .
" it is time for a rapprochement between iran , its neighbors and the west , " hanelt said .
" in order to pre-empt another confrontation in the middle east and further escalation as a result of the iranian nuclear program , american-iranian relations must be put on a sustainable footing after the iranian presidential elections . "

" that has to be clear and i think it is to barack obama , " bauer said .
he said the west could at most hope to gain from iran a degree of transparency of its nuclear program through cooperation with the international atomic energy agency , which can ensure that it is a civilian nuclear program .
a turning point in iran the iranian people are considered to be among the most pro-western in the middle east .
and many , especially younger people , are fed up with ahmadinejad 's confrontational tone .
mousavi supporters have been taking to tehran 's streets for nightly demonstrations to express their discontent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mousavi supporter shows where he stands ruprecht polenz , chairman of the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee , said ahmadinejad 's defeat would mean a lot for the future of young iranians .
" when you consider what needs to happen so that the economic situation improves , so that all the young people who finish university each year really have an opportunity to find a good job , then economic reform is necessary , " polenz said .
" more intense trade relations are necessary especially with developed nations , such as european countries . "
but this requires iran to change its confrontational foreign policy and focus on cooperation , he said .
ultimately , though , the real power in iran is held by its supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei .
" indeed the ayatollah is the central player in iran 's political system , even when it comes to such matters like the nuclear program , " bauer said .
" in the end , the compromise will have to be made with the revolutionary leader . "

no matter who wins , observers agree that it 's time for iran and the us to sit down at the negotiating table .
and the european union could act as a vital mediator . three candidates are running against iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is seeking a second term in friday 's presidential elections .
observers forecast that the reformists under former prime minister mir hossein mousavi have the best chances of beating ahmadinejad .
yet no matter who wins , the time has come for serious negotiations with the west regarding iran 's controversial nuclear program , said christian-peter hanelt , a middle east expert from the bertelsmann foundation .
" it is time for a rapprochement between iran , its neighbors and the west , " hanelt said .
" in order to pre-empt another confrontation in the middle east and further escalation as a result of the iranian nuclear program , american-iranian relations must be put on a sustainable footing after the iranian presidential elections . "
the european union could play a significant mediatory role in this process , said konstantin kosten , an expert on iran at the german council on foreign relations , dgap .
" the eu could certainly act as a bridge and door opener , " kosten said .
" direct contacts exist already with the iranian government and the most significant negotiating circles . "
the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana has been leading talks between iran and the so-called eu3 -lrb- referring to france , britain and germany -rrb- for years .
due to these contacts , eu officials could provide us diplomats with expertise and support .
us has full eu support the us administration has chosen a new path in its dealings with iran .
whereas former president george w. bush opted for confrontation , placing iran as part of its " axis of evil , " president barack obama is going for direct diplomacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uranium conversion facility in isfahan contributes to iran 's nuclear program in march , obama directly addressed the country 's leaders in a message to the iranian people on the occasion of nowruz , the iranian new year .
he offered tehran direct talks without any preconditions .
the us president has full backing from the eu , whose foreign ministers urged iran to take advantage of the change in us policy to seal a deal and end the stand-off over its nuclear ambitions .
" the eu warmly supports the new direction of us policy towards iran , which opens a window of opportunity for negotiations on all aspects of iran 's nuclear program and more broadly for engagement with iran , " the eu foreign ministers said in a statement in april .
washington can count on support by its european partners .
" the eu reaffirms its full and unequivocal support for efforts to find a negotiated long-term solution to the iranian nuclear issue , " the ministers said .
in addition to making it clear to tehran that the eu stands behind us policy , it 's also important to send signals of eu support to washington , said michael bauer , head of the middle east project at the center for applied policy research at the university of munich .
" there are not only proponents of this new policy towards iran in washington so i think a first step would be to essentially support the advocates and make clear to them that the european position clearly welcomes this willingness for talks , " bauer said .
compromise is necessary the main point of contention continues to be iran 's nuclear program and the country 's unwillingness to permit comprehensive and strict controls .
despite the eu 's repeated efforts to find a solution , negotiations have failed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's confrontational tone is popular among the rural poor hanelt said that only the us could provide the desired security guarantees for the territory of iran and recognition of its political system .
" for this reason , europe can now achieve more it if simply provides robust support for the us administration in its forthcoming rapprochement with tehran , " hanelt said .
bauer said iran wanted to be viewed as a " legitimate political actor " with the corresponding security guarantees .
" iran is first and foremost interested in recognition of its regime by the us , " bauer said .
" this is something the europeans ca n't offer . "
but iran was also in a strong position at the moment and its support was needed for positive developments in the region , he said .
" the us and barack obama will need iran to keep iraq stable , " bauer said .
" iran is needed to get a grip on the problems in afghanistan to some extent .
iran is an important player here . "
nuclear program will continue any hopes that iran will abandon its nuclear program are futile , though .
kosten said iran will want to remain at the helm when it comes to uranium enrichment and civilian use of nuclear power .
" the question is more whether a solution can be found which enables enrichment on iranian soil , " kosten said .
" there has to be an idea how iran can exercise its rights and therefore save face . "
even an attack by israel on iran 's nuclear facilities would put the program back by a few years , but would not stop it .

the latest eu report puts greece and cyprus in the top spots for the cleanest beaches . the overall quality of bathing water in the eu has markedly improved since 1990 .
according to the latest annual bathing water report by the european commission and european environment agency eea , most of europe 's 21,400 bathing sites have clean water .
" high quality bathing water is essential for the well-being of european citizens and the environment , " environment commissioner stavros dimas told reporters on thursday .
" europe 's bathing sites remain clean and water quality is high . "
during the 2008 bathing season , 96 percent of coastal bathing areas and 92 percent of bathing sites in rivers and lakes complied with minimum standards , dimas said .
compliance with such mandatory values were 80 percent and 52 percent respectively in 1990 .
greece and cyprus have the cleanest beaches in the eu , while some of the purest lakes and rivers can be found in finland , sweden and germany , the report said .
however , the commission also said that clean water did not necessarily mean that the beaches themselves were also clean .
poland is the worst country in europe to go swimming in , whether in the sea , rivers or lakes , with 14.4 percent of all bathing water non-compliant with mandatory standards .
the report found that many areas of the baltic sea are suffering from an overgrowth of algae , while a relatively high number of dirty waters are found around denmark , poland and britain .
testing is still lagging behind in new eu member states romania and bulgaria .
getting people involved each year , the eu tests its waters for possible bacteriological contamination deriving from industrial waste or agriculture .
water color , acidity , and the presence of residues from detergents are also tested .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy is home to more than one third of the eu 's beaches but the report can do more than just inform europeans and tourists about where they can safely take the plunge .
it also serves as a guide to get more people involved in their local surroundings , said eea 's executive director jacqueline mcglade .
" information sources like this report and our web-based viewing tools enable citizens not only to check the quality of the bathing water in their local community or holiday destination , but also to allow them to get more actively involved in the protection of their environment , " mcglade said .
italy closed most sites more than one third of the eu 's 14,500 beaches are found in italy .
the report showed that the mediterranean country stood out with 553 coastal beaches and freshwater sites where bathing had been closed or banned throughout the 2008 season .
this was far more than in other countries .
mcglade said it was " too early to say " whether there had been an improvement at those sites since last year as the data was not yet available .
of the 14,551 coastal bathing areas in the european union , bathing was banned or closed throughout the season in only 307 sites and was found not to be complying with eu standards in 208 sites .
among the 6,890 freshwater sites , bathing was banned at 315 sites and was not up to eu standards in 196. sac / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

us president obama is scheduled to travel to moscow early next month for key talks on a follow-up to start , which expires on december 5 .
us and russian negotiators have been holding preliminary meetings ahead of those talks .
moscow has said it wants to link the nuclear talks to washington 's plans to deploy an anti-missile shield in central europe - a plan the kremlin firmly opposes .

steinmeier also addressed the controversial topics of human rights and moscow 's relations with tbilisi in the wake of last year 's military conflict between russia and georgia .
he urged moscow to adopt a " constructive " role in the caucasus and stressed that unresolved territorial disputes did not have a place in the europe of the 21st century .

" with the entry into office of president obama , there is a genuine chance for new cooperation between the united states , the european union and russia , " steinmeier said .
" the ghost of the cold war has been banished ...
so i would like to say that the extended hand of the us president should be boldly accepted , " he said .
earlier , steinmeier told reporters that the security council 's five permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - as well as japan and south korea had agreed to toughen their stance against north korea after pyongyang tested a nuclear device and launched several missiles in recent weeks .
" the efforts made for a resolution were rewarded with success , " steinmeier said at a joint press conference with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov in moscow on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea has tested several missiles this year diplomats say the latest draft resolution " calls upon " countries to inspect north korean ships carrying suspicious cargo that might violate a partial un trade and arms embargo , although it does not demand it .
the document does , however , require governemnts to deny fuel to any suspicious north korea vessles and direct them to dock at " an appropriate and convenient port . "
reaching out disarmament was a key theme throughout steinmeier 's two-day visit to moscow , during which he also met with russian president dmitry medvedev .
in his address to the russian academy of science , steinmeier said that all nations should make constructive efforts to disarm .
" this has to be the year when international disarmament efforts move back to the top of the agenda , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said medvedev seemed ready to reduce its nuclear arsenal steinmeier stressed that the talks between russia and the us on replacing the 1991 strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- were " a vital step on the difficult path towards a world free of nuclear weapons .

us president obama is scheduled to travel to moscow early next month for key talks on a follow-up to start , which expires on december 5 .
us and russian negotiators have been holding preliminary meetings ahead of those talks .
moscow has said it wants to link the nuclear talks to washington 's plans to deploy an anti-missile shield in central europe - a plan the kremlin firmly opposes .
russian prime minister vladimir putin said the kremlin would consider getting rid of its nuclear arsenal if all other countries agreed to do so as well .
after meeting the german foreign minister , putin was asked if he could imagine a russia without nuclear weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what do we need nuclear weapons for ? "
putin asked " of course , " he answered .
" what do we need nuclear weapons for ? "
putin 's answer did have one caveat , however .
" if those who invented the atomic bomb , and used it , are prepared to do away with atom bombs , then we would welcome this , " he said , suggesting his country 's involvement is dependent on us disarmament .
the russian news agency interfax , however , has reported that russia wants to keep at least 1,500 nuclear warheads .
other business in addition to disarmament , steinmeier also spoke with russian leaders about combating the effects of the global financial crisis .
putin praised berlin 's active role in negotiating a plan to rescue struggling carmaker opel , which now counts russian state-owned lender sberbank as one of its major stakeholders .
the three leaders agreed to increase cooperation in the energy sector , particularly in renewable fuel sources and efficiency .

the gunman remains in a critical condition , mayor adrian fenty said .
the lone gunman 's identity or connections to anti-semitic groups could not be confirmed but media reports said he was believed to be known as white supremacist james w von brunn .
von brunn is thought to be behind numerous anti-semitic articles posted on the internet , including a book called " kill the best gentiles , " which he calls " a new hard-hitting expose of the jewish conspiracy to destroy the white gene pool . "
" it appears to be a lone gunman who entered into the museum and opened fire with what appears to be a rifle at this point , " washington police chief cathy lanier said .
museum officials identified the guard as officer stephen tyrone johns , who had worked at the museum for six years .
" i am shocked and saddened by today 's shooting at the us holocaust memorial museum , " us president barack obama said in a statement .
" this outrageous act reminds us that we must remain vigilant against anti-semitism and prejudice in all its forms .
" no american institution is more important to this effort than the holocaust museum , and no act of violence will diminish our determination to honor those who were lost by building a more peaceful and tolerant world , " he added .
obama last week became the first us president to visit the nazi death camp in buchenwald , germany where he renewed a historic commitment to israel .
the armed man carrying a long rifle entered the museum just blocks from the national mall and washington monument shortly before 1 pm -lrb- 1800 cet -rrb- and immediately fired at armed security guards , police chief lanier told reporters .
two security guards returned fire and johns and the gunman were wounded .
local media reports said a third person was hit by glass but the extent of those injuries are unknown .
museum no stranger to threats and abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum opened in 1993 security director joseph rosboschil said the museum receives occasional threats but there had been " nothing significant of late . "
rosboschil also said the museum had more security measures than other washington museums .
sara j bloomfield , director of the museum , said this apparent act of intolerance and hatred was " even more reason for this museum to exist . "
the council on american-islamic relations , a muslim civil liberties and advocacy group , said in a statement that it condemned " this apparent bias-motivated attack " and stands with the " jewish community and with americans of all faiths in repudiating the kind of hatred and intolerance that can lead to such disturbing incidents . "
more than 30 million people have visited the museum since its opening in 1993 , including 85 heads of state. nda , afp / dpa / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite soaking up billions of euros in subsidies , germany 's eastern states still suffer from higher unemployment and lower productivity and per capita wealth .
migration is also a big problem .
but it appears that germany 's deepest recession since world war ii is having an unexpected side effect .
" so far , the east has not been hit as hard , " tiefensee said .
" twenty years after the peaceful revolution and the fall of the wall , the achievements of the east germans are being recognized in 2009 , " tiefensee told reporters after presenting the report to the cabinet .
smaller enterprises aiding eastern states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee presents the 2009 unity report tiefensee said that the eastern states are home to a larger proportion of smaller firms which are more flexible than big companies and less dependent on exports , which have slumped in the last few months .
he pointed in particular to the technology sector , where growth is higher in eastern states , especially in the solar energy sector which is strong there .
meanwhile the manufacturing industry in the west , which is heavily reliant on exports , has borne the brunt of the global downturn .
tiefensee noted that the western states ' " unprecedented solidarity " with the east , including more than one trillion euros in subsidies since national unification in 1990 , had been crucial to getting the region back on its feet .
gross national product per person in the east rose to 71 percent of that of a westerner last year , compared to 67 percent in 2000 , the report said .
industry in the east has grown by 7.5 percent over the last three years , compared to 4.3 percent in the west .
unemployment still a germany-wide problem tiefensee said that while unemployment had stayed roughly stable in eastern states in the last year , it had risen to 6.9 percent in may in western states from 6.4 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has stabilized in the east but is still high dspite the positive figures , divisions between eastern and western germany are still wide .
jobless figures are still twice as high in the east as in western states and long-term unemployment is a major problem .
unemployment stands at 13.3 percent in eastern states and is likely to rise further still in the coming months .
job migration is also a big problem .
young people , especially women , tend to abandon the east in search of work , leaving some areas as a wasteland .
about 90,000 people ditched the east for the west each year in the recent past , against just 40,000 people moving east .
" we have come a long way , but there is still a lot of work to do , " tiefensee said , adding that so-called " solidarity tax " payments to the east would likely continue for another decade , until 2019 .
by that time , he said , some of the eastern states could even overtake poorer western regions in terms of gross domestic product .
opposition accuses minister of election games opposition parties seized on the report to accuse tiefensee of scoring points for his social democrats , the junior partners in germany 's ruling coalition with chancellor merkel 's conservatives , ahead of the september general election .
" it is a clumsy attempt to win votes in the east when you tell people that the rest of the job will be finished in 10 years , " expert on eastern affairs for the liberal free democrats , joachim guenther , said. nda , afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

industry in the east has grown by 7.5 percent over the last three years , compared to 4.3 percent in the west .
unemployment still a germany-wide problem tiefensee said that while unemployment had stayed roughly stable in eastern states in the last year , it had risen to 6.9 percent in may in western states from 6.4 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has stabilized in the east but is still high dspite the positive figures , divisions between eastern and western germany are still wide .
jobless figures are still twice as high in the east as in western states and long-term unemployment is a major problem .
unemployment stands at 13.3 percent in eastern states and is likely to rise further still in the coming months .
job migration is also a big problem .
young people , especially women , tend to abandon the east in search of work , leaving some areas as a wasteland .
about 90,000 people ditched the east for the west each year in the recent past , against just 40,000 people moving east .
" we have come a long way , but there is still a lot of work to do , " tiefensee said , adding that so-called " solidarity tax " payments to the east would likely continue for another decade , until 2019 .
by that time , he said , some of the eastern states could even overtake poorer western regions in terms of gross domestic product .
opposition accuses minister of election games opposition parties seized on the report to accuse tiefensee of scoring points for his social democrats , the junior partners in germany 's ruling coalition with chancellor merkel 's conservatives , ahead of the september general election .

despite soaking up billions of euros in subsidies , germany 's eastern states still suffer from higher unemployment and lower productivity and per capita wealth .
migration is also a big problem .

" so far , the east has not been hit as hard , " tiefensee said .
" twenty years after the peaceful revolution and the fall of the wall , the achievements of the east germans are being recognized in 2009 , " tiefensee told reporters after presenting the report to the cabinet .

he pointed in particular to the technology sector , where growth is higher in eastern states , especially in the solar energy sector which is strong there .
meanwhile the manufacturing industry in the west , which is heavily reliant on exports , has borne the brunt of the global downturn .

" important personnel and policy decisions must be taken immediately .
that is why germany and france support jose manuel barroso , " merkel said at a joint press conference with sarkozy in paris .
there is a " strong desire " in the newly-elected eu parliament that the choice of a new ec head should not take the entire summer , she said .
" we will support the candidacy of mr. barroso , without ambiguity , " sarkozy said at a joint news conference at the elysee presidential palace .
but the support for the incumbent was not unconditional , sarkozy added .
" madame merkel and i support barroso , " he said .
" but we call on him before a second term to clarify , and in a way make formal , his position , " the french president said .

eu leaders meeting are set to grant a second five-year term to barroso , the only candidate for the top post , at their summit in brussels next thursday and friday .
barroso 's mandate expires in october , but he is seeking a second term despite the european union 's struggle to reform and criticism of its response to the financial crisis .
leaders pledge to press lisbon 's case sarkozy added that he would be prepared to travel to ireland to help gather support for a referendum over the european union 's stalled lisbon treaty .
" mrs. merkel and i will do everything we can to help the irish make the choice for lisbon , " he told the joint news conference .
" if it is of use , i would even be ready to travel to ireland to support them , " he said .
the two leaders also expressed their concern for the well-being of imprisoned burmese opposition leader aung san suu kyi .

solana added that he expected israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to endorse a two-state solution and to freeze israeli settlement in the palestinian territories .

he has expressed the hope that israeli-palestinian peace efforts would resume in the near future . " a lot of important things are taking place , " he told reporters in jerusalem .
the eu 's foreign policy coordinator said that us president barack obama 's recent speech to the muslim world had been a crucial step in the right direction .
obama had urged the two sides in the middle east conflict to find a lasting settlement .
solana also mentioned last week 's elections in lebanon where iranian-backed hezbollah failed to capitalize on anti-israeli sentiment .
solana said it was a good time to " see how we can bring back the situation to something that can be moving in the right direction . "
last year , the peace process was dealt a setback by the israeli military offensive in the gaza strip .
solana added that he expected israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to endorse a two-state solution and to freeze israeli settlement in the palestinian territories .
" that 's what we expect to hear and i am sure something of that nature will happen , " solana said in reference to a speech netanyahu announced for sunday where he will outline his government 's policies on the peace process .
so far , netanyahu who heads a right-of-center coalition , has refused to publicly back a palestinian state or order a halt to settlement construction .

a bureaucratic blunder had allowed him to reside legally in bonn for half a year , despite his name being on a blacklist . former thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra spent six months almost unnoticed in the former german capital bonn .
though declared a persona non grata , thaksin managed to enter germany on december 29 , 2008 using a schengen visa issued in france .
it allows a person to travel through much of the european union on a single visa .
bonn authorities then issued the residence permit for thaksin , who used his german lawyer 's address .
federal officials only learned about it in april and ordered it revoked .
" we asked bonn to revoke the permit and they responded immediately , " hanns schumacher , germany 's ambassador to thailand , told reuters on wednesday .
bonn authorities said thaksin 's name had not been on a list of people barred from germany and he had presented all the necessary documents .
this included a certificate from a german federal justice agency saying he had no criminal record .
he had also proved he had adequate funds to live and a valid passport .
officials said the absence of his name from the list of barred persons was the result of a data-entry oversight by staff of the german foreign ministry .
" we informed the lawyer that the permit was revoked and should thaksin still be in germany , his stay would be illegal and he would face detention , " schumacher said .

a bureaucratic blunder had allowed him to reside legally in bonn for half a year , despite his name being on a blacklist . former thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra spent six months almost unnoticed in the former german capital bonn .
though declared a persona non grata , thaksin managed to enter germany on december 29 , 2008 using a schengen visa issued in france .
it allows a person to travel through much of the european union on a single visa .
bonn authorities then issued the residence permit for thaksin , who used his german lawyer 's address .
federal officials only learned about it in april and ordered it revoked .
" we asked bonn to revoke the permit and they responded immediately , " hanns schumacher , germany 's ambassador to thailand , told reuters on wednesday .
bonn authorities said thaksin 's name had not been on a list of people barred from germany and he had presented all the necessary documents .
this included a certificate from a german federal justice agency saying he had no criminal record .
he had also proved he had adequate funds to live and a valid passport .
officials said the absence of his name from the list of barred persons was the result of a data-entry oversight by staff of the german foreign ministry .
" we informed the lawyer that the permit was revoked and should thaksin still be in germany , his stay would be illegal and he would face detention , " schumacher said .

but the government says it needs more details before it can make a decision . the interior ministry said on thursday that it was unable to accept the us request based on the data provided .
" we 're examining two new cases , " ministry spokesman stefan paris said in berlin .
" the information provided by the united states is not sufficient for now for us to give the green light for taking in the two men . "
the interior ministry would need to check whether the prisoners represented a security risk , he said .
also , berlin needed to know why the men could not be taken in by the us and what ties they had to germany .
paris would not disclose the nationality of the two men .
security sources said one was syrian , the other tunisian .
resistance at home and abroad in april , the us made an initial request , presenting the german government with a list of nine chinese uighur detainees for berlin to " consider . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palau is offering 17 uighers a new temporary home interior minister wolfgang schaeuble had also replied in that case that the information provided was insufficient to warrant a positive reply .
us president barack obama has pledged to close the facility at the us naval base at guantanamo bay , cuba by early next year .
many of the inmates have already been cleared for release .
but us officials are having difficulty finding countries that will take them in , and meeting resistance at home to housing them on us soil .
the tiny pacific nation palau on agreed wednesday to take in up to 17 uighur guantanamo detainees .
four further uighur men who had been held at the prison camp were sent to bermuda on thursday .
sharp political debate german politicians have disagreed on the issue .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat candidate to challenge chancellor angela merkel in september 's federal election , has spoken in favor of accepting inmates .
but interior minister schaeuble has voiced skepticism .
on a visit to germany last week , obama said after talks with merkel that he had neither asked for nor received any hard commitments from berlin on taking guantanamo detainees .
he said merkel had been " very open " to discussions on the issue .
opposition politicians have been very critical of the government 's stance .
claudia roth , co-leader of the green party , said schaeuble was using " stalling tactics . "
" he 's acting on the maxim : we do n't know anything , we have to check things first , we have to deliberate so long until someone else takes this decision of our hands , " roth said in reference to the uighur case .
michael leutert , the human rights spokesman for the left party 's parliamentary group , said accepting the inmates was " a simple humanitarian act . "
" it is not plausible that two people proven innocent pose an uncalculated security risk for germany , " leutert said .
he said the german government needed to promptly " consider favorably " the us request. sac / afp / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said merkel had been " very open " to discussions on the issue .
opposition politicians have been very critical of the government 's stance .
claudia roth , co-leader of the green party , said schaeuble was using " stalling tactics . "
" he 's acting on the maxim : we do n't know anything , we have to check things first , we have to deliberate so long until someone else takes this decision of our hands , " roth said in reference to the uighur case .
michael leutert , the human rights spokesman for the left party 's parliamentary group , said accepting the inmates was " a simple humanitarian act . "
" it is not plausible that two people proven innocent pose an uncalculated security risk for germany , " leutert said .
he said the german government needed to promptly " consider favorably " the us request. sac / afp / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the latest eu report puts greece and cyprus in the top spots for the cleanest beaches . the overall quality of bathing water in the eu has markedly improved since 1990 .
according to the latest annual bathing water report by the european commission and european environment agency eea , most of europe 's 21,400 bathing sites have clean water .
" high quality bathing water is essential for the well-being of european citizens and the environment , " environment commissioner stavros dimas told reporters on thursday .
" europe 's bathing sites remain clean and water quality is high . "
during the 2008 bathing season , 96 percent of coastal bathing areas and 92 percent of bathing sites in rivers and lakes complied with minimum standards , dimas said .
compliance with such mandatory values were 80 percent and 52 percent respectively in 1990 .
greece and cyprus have the cleanest beaches in the eu , while some of the purest lakes and rivers can be found in finland , sweden and germany , the report said .
however , the commission also said that clean water did not necessarily mean that the beaches themselves were also clean .
poland is the worst country in europe to go swimming in , whether in the sea , rivers or lakes , with 14.4 percent of all bathing water non-compliant with mandatory standards .
the report found that many areas of the baltic sea are suffering from an overgrowth of algae , while a relatively high number of dirty waters are found around denmark , poland and britain .
testing is still lagging behind in new eu member states romania and bulgaria .

" information sources like this report and our web-based viewing tools enable citizens not only to check the quality of the bathing water in their local community or holiday destination , but also to allow them to get more actively involved in the protection of their environment , " mcglade said .
italy closed most sites more than one third of the eu 's 14,500 beaches are found in italy .
the report showed that the mediterranean country stood out with 553 coastal beaches and freshwater sites where bathing had been closed or banned throughout the 2008 season .
this was far more than in other countries .
mcglade said it was " too early to say " whether there had been an improvement at those sites since last year as the data was not yet available .
of the 14,551 coastal bathing areas in the european union , bathing was banned or closed throughout the season in only 307 sites and was found not to be complying with eu standards in 208 sites .

the latest eu report puts greece and cyprus in the top spots for the cleanest beaches . the overall quality of bathing water in the eu has markedly improved since 1990 .
according to the latest annual bathing water report by the european commission and european environment agency eea , most of europe 's 21,400 bathing sites have clean water .
" high quality bathing water is essential for the well-being of european citizens and the environment , " environment commissioner stavros dimas told reporters on thursday .
" europe 's bathing sites remain clean and water quality is high . "
during the 2008 bathing season , 96 percent of coastal bathing areas and 92 percent of bathing sites in rivers and lakes complied with minimum standards , dimas said .
compliance with such mandatory values were 80 percent and 52 percent respectively in 1990 .
greece and cyprus have the cleanest beaches in the eu , while some of the purest lakes and rivers can be found in finland , sweden and germany , the report said .
however , the commission also said that clean water did not necessarily mean that the beaches themselves were also clean .
poland is the worst country in europe to go swimming in , whether in the sea , rivers or lakes , with 14.4 percent of all bathing water non-compliant with mandatory standards .
the report found that many areas of the baltic sea are suffering from an overgrowth of algae , while a relatively high number of dirty waters are found around denmark , poland and britain .
testing is still lagging behind in new eu member states romania and bulgaria .
getting people involved each year , the eu tests its waters for possible bacteriological contamination deriving from industrial waste or agriculture .
water color , acidity , and the presence of residues from detergents are also tested .

it also serves as a guide to get more people involved in their local surroundings , said eea 's executive director jacqueline mcglade .
" information sources like this report and our web-based viewing tools enable citizens not only to check the quality of the bathing water in their local community or holiday destination , but also to allow them to get more actively involved in the protection of their environment , " mcglade said .
italy closed most sites more than one third of the eu 's 14,500 beaches are found in italy .
the report showed that the mediterranean country stood out with 553 coastal beaches and freshwater sites where bathing had been closed or banned throughout the 2008 season .
this was far more than in other countries .
mcglade said it was " too early to say " whether there had been an improvement at those sites since last year as the data was not yet available .
of the 14,551 coastal bathing areas in the european union , bathing was banned or closed throughout the season in only 307 sites and was found not to be complying with eu standards in 208 sites .
among the 6,890 freshwater sites , bathing was banned at 315 sites and was not up to eu standards in 196. sac / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has expressed the hope that israeli-palestinian peace efforts would resume in the near future . " a lot of important things are taking place , " he told reporters in jerusalem .
the eu 's foreign policy coordinator said that us president barack obama 's recent speech to the muslim world had been a crucial step in the right direction .
obama had urged the two sides in the middle east conflict to find a lasting settlement .
solana also mentioned last week 's elections in lebanon where iranian-backed hezbollah failed to capitalize on anti-israeli sentiment .
solana said it was a good time to " see how we can bring back the situation to something that can be moving in the right direction . "
last year , the peace process was dealt a setback by the israeli military offensive in the gaza strip .
solana added that he expected israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to endorse a two-state solution and to freeze israeli settlement in the palestinian territories .
" that 's what we expect to hear and i am sure something of that nature will happen , " solana said in reference to a speech netanyahu announced for sunday where he will outline his government 's policies on the peace process .
so far , netanyahu who heads a right-of-center coalition , has refused to publicly back a palestinian state or order a halt to settlement construction .
solana is to continue his tour of the middle east by meeting with palestinian , lebanese and egyptian leaders. ai / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" that would mean , in the first phase , that we would go from roughly 15,000 to 10,000 towards the end of the year , " he added .
nato 's peacekeeping mission , kfor , has been in kosovo since the alliance 's air campaign against serbia ended 10 years ago .
pressure to reduce its presence mounted in march when spanish defense minister charme chacon told his country 's 500 troops that they would soon be coming home .
spain is one of the few nato countries that have not recognized kosovo 's independence , declared last year , making it difficult to support nation-building efforts .
other nations have also been calling for kfor to be scaled back amidst pressure to move more troops to other areas of conflict like afghanistan or the gulf of aden .
the ministers are also scheduled to debate sending a new anti-piracy mission to the gulf of aden off the coast of somalia .
the current nato mission there was hastily organized in march and is set to sail home at the end of june. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" with the entry into office of president obama , there is a genuine chance for new cooperation between the united states , the european union and russia , " steinmeier said .
" the ghost of the cold war has been banished ...
so i would like to say that the extended hand of the us president should be boldly accepted , " he said .
earlier , steinmeier told reporters that the security council 's five permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - as well as japan and south korea had agreed to toughen their stance against north korea after pyongyang tested a nuclear device and launched several missiles in recent weeks .
" the efforts made for a resolution were rewarded with success , " steinmeier said at a joint press conference with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov in moscow on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea has tested several missiles this year diplomats say the latest draft resolution " calls upon " countries to inspect north korean ships carrying suspicious cargo that might violate a partial un trade and arms embargo , although it does not demand it .
the document does , however , require governemnts to deny fuel to any suspicious north korea vessles and direct them to dock at " an appropriate and convenient port . "
reaching out disarmament was a key theme throughout steinmeier 's two-day visit to moscow , during which he also met with russian president dmitry medvedev .
in his address to the russian academy of science , steinmeier said that all nations should make constructive efforts to disarm .
" this has to be the year when international disarmament efforts move back to the top of the agenda , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said medvedev seemed ready to reduce its nuclear arsenal steinmeier stressed that the talks between russia and the us on replacing the 1991 strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- were " a vital step on the difficult path towards a world free of nuclear weapons . "
steinmeier called the warming of relations between the kremlin and the us a " unique historic opportunity . "
thawing fronts ?
us president obama is scheduled to travel to moscow early next month for key talks on a follow-up to start , which expires on december 5 .
us and russian negotiators have been holding preliminary meetings ahead of those talks .
moscow has said it wants to link the nuclear talks to washington 's plans to deploy an anti-missile shield in central europe - a plan the kremlin firmly opposes .
russian prime minister vladimir putin said the kremlin would consider getting rid of its nuclear arsenal if all other countries agreed to do so as well .
after meeting the german foreign minister , putin was asked if he could imagine a russia without nuclear weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what do we need nuclear weapons for ? "
putin asked " of course , " he answered .
" what do we need nuclear weapons for ? "
putin 's answer did have one caveat , however .
" if those who invented the atomic bomb , and used it , are prepared to do away with atom bombs , then we would welcome this , " he said , suggesting his country 's involvement is dependent on us disarmament .
the russian news agency interfax , however , has reported that russia wants to keep at least 1,500 nuclear warheads .
other business in addition to disarmament , steinmeier also spoke with russian leaders about combating the effects of the global financial crisis .
putin praised berlin 's active role in negotiating a plan to rescue struggling carmaker opel , which now counts russian state-owned lender sberbank as one of its major stakeholders .
the three leaders agreed to increase cooperation in the energy sector , particularly in renewable fuel sources and efficiency .
steinmeier also addressed the controversial topics of human rights and moscow 's relations with tbilisi in the wake of last year 's military conflict between russia and georgia .
he urged moscow to adopt a " constructive " role in the caucasus and stressed that unresolved territorial disputes did not have a place in the europe of the 21st century .
during a visit to the editorial office of the novaya gazeta , a newspaper known for being critical of the kremlin , steinmeier wrote that democracy and a free press go together like breathing and air. sje / hf / dpa / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

us president obama is scheduled to travel to moscow early next month for key talks on a follow-up to start , which expires on december 5 .
us and russian negotiators have been holding preliminary meetings ahead of those talks .
moscow has said it wants to link the nuclear talks to washington 's plans to deploy an anti-missile shield in central europe - a plan the kremlin firmly opposes .

steinmeier also addressed the controversial topics of human rights and moscow 's relations with tbilisi in the wake of last year 's military conflict between russia and georgia .
he urged moscow to adopt a " constructive " role in the caucasus and stressed that unresolved territorial disputes did not have a place in the europe of the 21st century .

" that would mean , in the first phase , that we would go from roughly 15,000 to 10,000 towards the end of the year , " he added .
nato 's peacekeeping mission , kfor , has been in kosovo since the alliance 's air campaign against serbia ended 10 years ago .
pressure to reduce its presence mounted in march when spanish defense minister charme chacon told his country 's 500 troops that they would soon be coming home .
spain is one of the few nato countries that have not recognized kosovo 's independence , declared last year , making it difficult to support nation-building efforts .
other nations have also been calling for kfor to be scaled back amidst pressure to move more troops to other areas of conflict like afghanistan or the gulf of aden .
the ministers are also scheduled to debate sending a new anti-piracy mission to the gulf of aden off the coast of somalia .
the current nato mission there was hastily organized in march and is set to sail home at the end of june. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a bureaucratic blunder had allowed him to reside legally in bonn for half a year , despite his name being on a blacklist . former thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra spent six months almost unnoticed in the former german capital bonn .
though declared a persona non grata , thaksin managed to enter germany on december 29 , 2008 using a schengen visa issued in france .
it allows a person to travel through much of the european union on a single visa .
bonn authorities then issued the residence permit for thaksin , who used his german lawyer 's address .
federal officials only learned about it in april and ordered it revoked .
" we asked bonn to revoke the permit and they responded immediately , " hanns schumacher , germany 's ambassador to thailand , told reuters on wednesday .
bonn authorities said thaksin 's name had not been on a list of people barred from germany and he had presented all the necessary documents .
this included a certificate from a german federal justice agency saying he had no criminal record .
he had also proved he had adequate funds to live and a valid passport .
officials said the absence of his name from the list of barred persons was the result of a data-entry oversight by staff of the german foreign ministry .
" we informed the lawyer that the permit was revoked and should thaksin still be in germany , his stay would be illegal and he would face detention , " schumacher said .
options are waning the former telecoms tycoon , who led thailand for close to six years , was ousted from thailand in a military coup in 2006 .

his current whereabouts are unknown .
the german newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung said the former leader was now traveling on a nicaraguan diplomatic passport .

a bureaucratic blunder had allowed him to reside legally in bonn for half a year , despite his name being on a blacklist . former thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra spent six months almost unnoticed in the former german capital bonn .
though declared a persona non grata , thaksin managed to enter germany on december 29 , 2008 using a schengen visa issued in france .
it allows a person to travel through much of the european union on a single visa .
bonn authorities then issued the residence permit for thaksin , who used his german lawyer 's address .
federal officials only learned about it in april and ordered it revoked .
" we asked bonn to revoke the permit and they responded immediately , " hanns schumacher , germany 's ambassador to thailand , told reuters on wednesday .
bonn authorities said thaksin 's name had not been on a list of people barred from germany and he had presented all the necessary documents .
this included a certificate from a german federal justice agency saying he had no criminal record .
he had also proved he had adequate funds to live and a valid passport .
officials said the absence of his name from the list of barred persons was the result of a data-entry oversight by staff of the german foreign ministry .
" we informed the lawyer that the permit was revoked and should thaksin still be in germany , his stay would be illegal and he would face detention , " schumacher said .
options are waning the former telecoms tycoon , who led thailand for close to six years , was ousted from thailand in a military coup in 2006 .
he was convicted in absentia of corruption and has fled a two-year jail term at home .
germany is the latest country to shun the former leader , who continues to roam the globe with a variety of passports and elude thai authorities who say they are trying to extradite him .
britain revoked his visa last year .
bangkok has sought extradition agreements with the united arab emirates and hong kong , where thaksin has spent time since fleeing the country while on bail .
his current whereabouts are unknown .
the german newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung said the former leader was now traveling on a nicaraguan diplomatic passport .
a thai foreign ministry official said thaksin would be arrested if he returned to thailand .
his thai passport has been revoked. sac / reuters / ap / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 11.06.2009 eu should play key role in us negotiations with iran , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranians head to the polls on friday in a bitterly fought election iranians elect a new president on friday .
no matter who wins , observers agree that it 's time for iran and the us to sit down at the negotiating table .
and the european union could act as a vital mediator . three candidates are running against iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is seeking a second term in friday 's presidential elections .
observers forecast that the reformists under former prime minister mir hossein mousavi have the best chances of beating ahmadinejad .
yet no matter who wins , the time has come for serious negotiations with the west regarding iran 's controversial nuclear program , said christian-peter hanelt , a middle east expert from the bertelsmann foundation .
" it is time for a rapprochement between iran , its neighbors and the west , " hanelt said .
" in order to pre-empt another confrontation in the middle east and further escalation as a result of the iranian nuclear program , american-iranian relations must be put on a sustainable footing after the iranian presidential elections . "
the european union could play a significant mediatory role in this process , said konstantin kosten , an expert on iran at the german council on foreign relations , dgap .
" the eu could certainly act as a bridge and door opener , " kosten said .
" direct contacts exist already with the iranian government and the most significant negotiating circles . "
the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana has been leading talks between iran and the so-called eu3 -lrb- referring to france , britain and germany -rrb- for years .
due to these contacts , eu officials could provide us diplomats with expertise and support .
us has full eu support the us administration has chosen a new path in its dealings with iran .
whereas former president george w. bush opted for confrontation , placing iran as part of its " axis of evil , " president barack obama is going for direct diplomacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uranium conversion facility in isfahan contributes to iran 's nuclear program in march , obama directly addressed the country 's leaders in a message to the iranian people on the occasion of nowruz , the iranian new year .
he offered tehran direct talks without any preconditions .
the us president has full backing from the eu , whose foreign ministers urged iran to take advantage of the change in us policy to seal a deal and end the stand-off over its nuclear ambitions .
" the eu warmly supports the new direction of us policy towards iran , which opens a window of opportunity for negotiations on all aspects of iran 's nuclear program and more broadly for engagement with iran , " the eu foreign ministers said in a statement in april .
washington can count on support by its european partners .
" the eu reaffirms its full and unequivocal support for efforts to find a negotiated long-term solution to the iranian nuclear issue , " the ministers said .
in addition to making it clear to tehran that the eu stands behind us policy , it 's also important to send signals of eu support to washington , said michael bauer , head of the middle east project at the center for applied policy research at the university of munich .
" there are not only proponents of this new policy towards iran in washington so i think a first step would be to essentially support the advocates and make clear to them that the european position clearly welcomes this willingness for talks , " bauer said .
compromise is necessary the main point of contention continues to be iran 's nuclear program and the country 's unwillingness to permit comprehensive and strict controls .
despite the eu 's repeated efforts to find a solution , negotiations have failed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's confrontational tone is popular among the rural poor hanelt said that only the us could provide the desired security guarantees for the territory of iran and recognition of its political system .
" for this reason , europe can now achieve more it if simply provides robust support for the us administration in its forthcoming rapprochement with tehran , " hanelt said .
bauer said iran wanted to be viewed as a " legitimate political actor " with the corresponding security guarantees .
" iran is first and foremost interested in recognition of its regime by the us , " bauer said .
" this is something the europeans ca n't offer . "
but iran was also in a strong position at the moment and its support was needed for positive developments in the region , he said .
" the us and barack obama will need iran to keep iraq stable , " bauer said .
" iran is needed to get a grip on the problems in afghanistan to some extent .
iran is an important player here . "
nuclear program will continue any hopes that iran will abandon its nuclear program are futile , though .
kosten said iran will want to remain at the helm when it comes to uranium enrichment and civilian use of nuclear power .
" the question is more whether a solution can be found which enables enrichment on iranian soil , " kosten said .
" there has to be an idea how iran can exercise its rights and therefore save face . "
even an attack by israel on iran 's nuclear facilities would put the program back by a few years , but would not stop it .
iran 's nuclear program as such is not up for discussion , bauer said .
" that has to be clear and i think it is to barack obama , " bauer said .
he said the west could at most hope to gain from iran a degree of transparency of its nuclear program through cooperation with the international atomic energy agency , which can ensure that it is a civilian nuclear program .
a turning point in iran the iranian people are considered to be among the most pro-western in the middle east .
and many , especially younger people , are fed up with ahmadinejad 's confrontational tone .
mousavi supporters have been taking to tehran 's streets for nightly demonstrations to express their discontent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mousavi supporter shows where he stands ruprecht polenz , chairman of the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee , said ahmadinejad 's defeat would mean a lot for the future of young iranians .
" when you consider what needs to happen so that the economic situation improves , so that all the young people who finish university each year really have an opportunity to find a good job , then economic reform is necessary , " polenz said .
" more intense trade relations are necessary especially with developed nations , such as european countries . "
but this requires iran to change its confrontational foreign policy and focus on cooperation , he said .
ultimately , though , the real power in iran is held by its supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei .
" indeed the ayatollah is the central player in iran 's political system , even when it comes to such matters like the nuclear program , " bauer said .
" in the end , the compromise will have to be made with the revolutionary leader . "

iran 's nuclear program as such is not up for discussion , bauer said .

" more intense trade relations are necessary especially with developed nations , such as european countries . "
but this requires iran to change its confrontational foreign policy and focus on cooperation , he said .
ultimately , though , the real power in iran is held by its supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei .
" indeed the ayatollah is the central player in iran 's political system , even when it comes to such matters like the nuclear program , " bauer said .
" in the end , the compromise will have to be made with the revolutionary leader . "

no matter who wins , observers agree that it 's time for iran and the us to sit down at the negotiating table .
and the european union could act as a vital mediator . three candidates are running against iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is seeking a second term in friday 's presidential elections .
observers forecast that the reformists under former prime minister mir hossein mousavi have the best chances of beating ahmadinejad .
yet no matter who wins , the time has come for serious negotiations with the west regarding iran 's controversial nuclear program , said christian-peter hanelt , a middle east expert from the bertelsmann foundation .
" it is time for a rapprochement between iran , its neighbors and the west , " hanelt said .
" in order to pre-empt another confrontation in the middle east and further escalation as a result of the iranian nuclear program , american-iranian relations must be put on a sustainable footing after the iranian presidential elections . "
the european union could play a significant mediatory role in this process , said konstantin kosten , an expert on iran at the german council on foreign relations , dgap .
" the eu could certainly act as a bridge and door opener , " kosten said .
" direct contacts exist already with the iranian government and the most significant negotiating circles . "
the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana has been leading talks between iran and the so-called eu3 -lrb- referring to france , britain and germany -rrb- for years .
due to these contacts , eu officials could provide us diplomats with expertise and support .
us has full eu support the us administration has chosen a new path in its dealings with iran .

he offered tehran direct talks without any preconditions .
the us president has full backing from the eu , whose foreign ministers urged iran to take advantage of the change in us policy to seal a deal and end the stand-off over its nuclear ambitions .
" the eu warmly supports the new direction of us policy towards iran , which opens a window of opportunity for negotiations on all aspects of iran 's nuclear program and more broadly for engagement with iran , " the eu foreign ministers said in a statement in april .
washington can count on support by its european partners .
" the eu reaffirms its full and unequivocal support for efforts to find a negotiated long-term solution to the iranian nuclear issue , " the ministers said .
in addition to making it clear to tehran that the eu stands behind us policy , it 's also important to send signals of eu support to washington , said michael bauer , head of the middle east project at the center for applied policy research at the university of munich .
" there are not only proponents of this new policy towards iran in washington so i think a first step would be to essentially support the advocates and make clear to them that the european position clearly welcomes this willingness for talks , " bauer said .

but this requires iran to change its confrontational foreign policy and focus on cooperation , he said .

" in the end , the compromise will have to be made with the revolutionary leader . "

no matter who wins , observers agree that it 's time for iran and the us to sit down at the negotiating table .
and the european union could act as a vital mediator . three candidates are running against iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is seeking a second term in friday 's presidential elections .
observers forecast that the reformists under former prime minister mir hossein mousavi have the best chances of beating ahmadinejad .
yet no matter who wins , the time has come for serious negotiations with the west regarding iran 's controversial nuclear program , said christian-peter hanelt , a middle east expert from the bertelsmann foundation .
" it is time for a rapprochement between iran , its neighbors and the west , " hanelt said .
" in order to pre-empt another confrontation in the middle east and further escalation as a result of the iranian nuclear program , american-iranian relations must be put on a sustainable footing after the iranian presidential elections . "
the european union could play a significant mediatory role in this process , said konstantin kosten , an expert on iran at the german council on foreign relations , dgap .
" the eu could certainly act as a bridge and door opener , " kosten said .
" direct contacts exist already with the iranian government and the most significant negotiating circles . "
the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana has been leading talks between iran and the so-called eu3 -lrb- referring to france , britain and germany -rrb- for years .
due to these contacts , eu officials could provide us diplomats with expertise and support .
us has full eu support the us administration has chosen a new path in its dealings with iran .
whereas former president george w. bush opted for confrontation , placing iran as part of its " axis of evil , " president barack obama is going for direct diplomacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uranium conversion facility in isfahan contributes to iran 's nuclear program in march , obama directly addressed the country 's leaders in a message to the iranian people on the occasion of nowruz , the iranian new year .
he offered tehran direct talks without any preconditions .
the us president has full backing from the eu , whose foreign ministers urged iran to take advantage of the change in us policy to seal a deal and end the stand-off over its nuclear ambitions .
" the eu warmly supports the new direction of us policy towards iran , which opens a window of opportunity for negotiations on all aspects of iran 's nuclear program and more broadly for engagement with iran , " the eu foreign ministers said in a statement in april .
washington can count on support by its european partners .
" the eu reaffirms its full and unequivocal support for efforts to find a negotiated long-term solution to the iranian nuclear issue , " the ministers said .
in addition to making it clear to tehran that the eu stands behind us policy , it 's also important to send signals of eu support to washington , said michael bauer , head of the middle east project at the center for applied policy research at the university of munich .
" there are not only proponents of this new policy towards iran in washington so i think a first step would be to essentially support the advocates and make clear to them that the european position clearly welcomes this willingness for talks , " bauer said .
compromise is necessary the main point of contention continues to be iran 's nuclear program and the country 's unwillingness to permit comprehensive and strict controls .
despite the eu 's repeated efforts to find a solution , negotiations have failed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's confrontational tone is popular among the rural poor hanelt said that only the us could provide the desired security guarantees for the territory of iran and recognition of its political system .
" for this reason , europe can now achieve more it if simply provides robust support for the us administration in its forthcoming rapprochement with tehran , " hanelt said .
bauer said iran wanted to be viewed as a " legitimate political actor " with the corresponding security guarantees .
" iran is first and foremost interested in recognition of its regime by the us , " bauer said .
" this is something the europeans ca n't offer . "
but iran was also in a strong position at the moment and its support was needed for positive developments in the region , he said .
" the us and barack obama will need iran to keep iraq stable , " bauer said .
" iran is needed to get a grip on the problems in afghanistan to some extent .
iran is an important player here . "
nuclear program will continue any hopes that iran will abandon its nuclear program are futile , though .
kosten said iran will want to remain at the helm when it comes to uranium enrichment and civilian use of nuclear power .
" the question is more whether a solution can be found which enables enrichment on iranian soil , " kosten said .
" there has to be an idea how iran can exercise its rights and therefore save face . "
even an attack by israel on iran 's nuclear facilities would put the program back by a few years , but would not stop it .
iran 's nuclear program as such is not up for discussion , bauer said .
" that has to be clear and i think it is to barack obama , " bauer said .
he said the west could at most hope to gain from iran a degree of transparency of its nuclear program through cooperation with the international atomic energy agency , which can ensure that it is a civilian nuclear program .
a turning point in iran the iranian people are considered to be among the most pro-western in the middle east .
and many , especially younger people , are fed up with ahmadinejad 's confrontational tone .
mousavi supporters have been taking to tehran 's streets for nightly demonstrations to express their discontent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 11.06.2009 bathing water quality improving across europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has the cleanest waters in europe with the summer holidays approaching , beach lovers can rest assured that most areas in the european union have good water quality .
the latest eu report puts greece and cyprus in the top spots for the cleanest beaches . the overall quality of bathing water in the eu has markedly improved since 1990 .
according to the latest annual bathing water report by the european commission and european environment agency eea , most of europe 's 21,400 bathing sites have clean water .
" high quality bathing water is essential for the well-being of european citizens and the environment , " environment commissioner stavros dimas told reporters on thursday .
" europe 's bathing sites remain clean and water quality is high . "
during the 2008 bathing season , 96 percent of coastal bathing areas and 92 percent of bathing sites in rivers and lakes complied with minimum standards , dimas said .
compliance with such mandatory values were 80 percent and 52 percent respectively in 1990 .
greece and cyprus have the cleanest beaches in the eu , while some of the purest lakes and rivers can be found in finland , sweden and germany , the report said .
however , the commission also said that clean water did not necessarily mean that the beaches themselves were also clean .
poland is the worst country in europe to go swimming in , whether in the sea , rivers or lakes , with 14.4 percent of all bathing water non-compliant with mandatory standards .
the report found that many areas of the baltic sea are suffering from an overgrowth of algae , while a relatively high number of dirty waters are found around denmark , poland and britain .
testing is still lagging behind in new eu member states romania and bulgaria .
getting people involved each year , the eu tests its waters for possible bacteriological contamination deriving from industrial waste or agriculture .
water color , acidity , and the presence of residues from detergents are also tested .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy is home to more than one third of the eu 's beaches but the report can do more than just inform europeans and tourists about where they can safely take the plunge .
it also serves as a guide to get more people involved in their local surroundings , said eea 's executive director jacqueline mcglade .
" information sources like this report and our web-based viewing tools enable citizens not only to check the quality of the bathing water in their local community or holiday destination , but also to allow them to get more actively involved in the protection of their environment , " mcglade said .
italy closed most sites more than one third of the eu 's 14,500 beaches are found in italy .
the report showed that the mediterranean country stood out with 553 coastal beaches and freshwater sites where bathing had been closed or banned throughout the 2008 season .
this was far more than in other countries .
mcglade said it was " too early to say " whether there had been an improvement at those sites since last year as the data was not yet available .
of the 14,551 coastal bathing areas in the european union , bathing was banned or closed throughout the season in only 307 sites and was found not to be complying with eu standards in 208 sites .
among the 6,890 freshwater sites , bathing was banned at 315 sites and was not up to eu standards in 196. sac / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the latest eu report puts greece and cyprus in the top spots for the cleanest beaches . the overall quality of bathing water in the eu has markedly improved since 1990 .
according to the latest annual bathing water report by the european commission and european environment agency eea , most of europe 's 21,400 bathing sites have clean water .
" high quality bathing water is essential for the well-being of european citizens and the environment , " environment commissioner stavros dimas told reporters on thursday .
" europe 's bathing sites remain clean and water quality is high . "
during the 2008 bathing season , 96 percent of coastal bathing areas and 92 percent of bathing sites in rivers and lakes complied with minimum standards , dimas said .
compliance with such mandatory values were 80 percent and 52 percent respectively in 1990 .
greece and cyprus have the cleanest beaches in the eu , while some of the purest lakes and rivers can be found in finland , sweden and germany , the report said .
however , the commission also said that clean water did not necessarily mean that the beaches themselves were also clean .
poland is the worst country in europe to go swimming in , whether in the sea , rivers or lakes , with 14.4 percent of all bathing water non-compliant with mandatory standards .
the report found that many areas of the baltic sea are suffering from an overgrowth of algae , while a relatively high number of dirty waters are found around denmark , poland and britain .
testing is still lagging behind in new eu member states romania and bulgaria .
getting people involved each year , the eu tests its waters for possible bacteriological contamination deriving from industrial waste or agriculture .
water color , acidity , and the presence of residues from detergents are also tested .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy is home to more than one third of the eu 's beaches but the report can do more than just inform europeans and tourists about where they can safely take the plunge .
it also serves as a guide to get more people involved in their local surroundings , said eea 's executive director jacqueline mcglade .
" information sources like this report and our web-based viewing tools enable citizens not only to check the quality of the bathing water in their local community or holiday destination , but also to allow them to get more actively involved in the protection of their environment , " mcglade said .
italy closed most sites more than one third of the eu 's 14,500 beaches are found in italy .
the report showed that the mediterranean country stood out with 553 coastal beaches and freshwater sites where bathing had been closed or banned throughout the 2008 season .
this was far more than in other countries .
mcglade said it was " too early to say " whether there had been an improvement at those sites since last year as the data was not yet available .
of the 14,551 coastal bathing areas in the european union , bathing was banned or closed throughout the season in only 307 sites and was found not to be complying with eu standards in 208 sites .
among the 6,890 freshwater sites , bathing was banned at 315 sites and was not up to eu standards in 196. sac / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the gunman remains in a critical condition , mayor adrian fenty said .
the lone gunman 's identity or connections to anti-semitic groups could not be confirmed but media reports said he was believed to be known as white supremacist james w von brunn .
von brunn is thought to be behind numerous anti-semitic articles posted on the internet , including a book called " kill the best gentiles , " which he calls " a new hard-hitting expose of the jewish conspiracy to destroy the white gene pool . "

museum officials identified the guard as officer stephen tyrone johns , who had worked at the museum for six years .
" i am shocked and saddened by today 's shooting at the us holocaust memorial museum , " us president barack obama said in a statement .
" this outrageous act reminds us that we must remain vigilant against anti-semitism and prejudice in all its forms .
" no american institution is more important to this effort than the holocaust museum , and no act of violence will diminish our determination to honor those who were lost by building a more peaceful and tolerant world , " he added .
obama last week became the first us president to visit the nazi death camp in buchenwald , germany where he renewed a historic commitment to israel .
the armed man carrying a long rifle entered the museum just blocks from the national mall and washington monument shortly before 1 pm -lrb- 1800 cet -rrb- and immediately fired at armed security guards , police chief lanier told reporters .
two security guards returned fire and johns and the gunman were wounded .

the latest eu report puts greece and cyprus in the top spots for the cleanest beaches . the overall quality of bathing water in the eu has markedly improved since 1990 .
according to the latest annual bathing water report by the european commission and european environment agency eea , most of europe 's 21,400 bathing sites have clean water .
" high quality bathing water is essential for the well-being of european citizens and the environment , " environment commissioner stavros dimas told reporters on thursday .
" europe 's bathing sites remain clean and water quality is high . "
during the 2008 bathing season , 96 percent of coastal bathing areas and 92 percent of bathing sites in rivers and lakes complied with minimum standards , dimas said .
compliance with such mandatory values were 80 percent and 52 percent respectively in 1990 .
greece and cyprus have the cleanest beaches in the eu , while some of the purest lakes and rivers can be found in finland , sweden and germany , the report said .
however , the commission also said that clean water did not necessarily mean that the beaches themselves were also clean .
poland is the worst country in europe to go swimming in , whether in the sea , rivers or lakes , with 14.4 percent of all bathing water non-compliant with mandatory standards .
the report found that many areas of the baltic sea are suffering from an overgrowth of algae , while a relatively high number of dirty waters are found around denmark , poland and britain .
testing is still lagging behind in new eu member states romania and bulgaria .
getting people involved each year , the eu tests its waters for possible bacteriological contamination deriving from industrial waste or agriculture .
water color , acidity , and the presence of residues from detergents are also tested .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy is home to more than one third of the eu 's beaches but the report can do more than just inform europeans and tourists about where they can safely take the plunge .
it also serves as a guide to get more people involved in their local surroundings , said eea 's executive director jacqueline mcglade .
" information sources like this report and our web-based viewing tools enable citizens not only to check the quality of the bathing water in their local community or holiday destination , but also to allow them to get more actively involved in the protection of their environment , " mcglade said .
italy closed most sites more than one third of the eu 's 14,500 beaches are found in italy .
the report showed that the mediterranean country stood out with 553 coastal beaches and freshwater sites where bathing had been closed or banned throughout the 2008 season .
this was far more than in other countries .
mcglade said it was " too early to say " whether there had been an improvement at those sites since last year as the data was not yet available .
of the 14,551 coastal bathing areas in the european union , bathing was banned or closed throughout the season in only 307 sites and was found not to be complying with eu standards in 208 sites .
among the 6,890 freshwater sites , bathing was banned at 315 sites and was not up to eu standards in 196. sac / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the latest eu report puts greece and cyprus in the top spots for the cleanest beaches . the overall quality of bathing water in the eu has markedly improved since 1990 .
according to the latest annual bathing water report by the european commission and european environment agency eea , most of europe 's 21,400 bathing sites have clean water .
" high quality bathing water is essential for the well-being of european citizens and the environment , " environment commissioner stavros dimas told reporters on thursday .
" europe 's bathing sites remain clean and water quality is high . "
during the 2008 bathing season , 96 percent of coastal bathing areas and 92 percent of bathing sites in rivers and lakes complied with minimum standards , dimas said .
compliance with such mandatory values were 80 percent and 52 percent respectively in 1990 .
greece and cyprus have the cleanest beaches in the eu , while some of the purest lakes and rivers can be found in finland , sweden and germany , the report said .
however , the commission also said that clean water did not necessarily mean that the beaches themselves were also clean .
poland is the worst country in europe to go swimming in , whether in the sea , rivers or lakes , with 14.4 percent of all bathing water non-compliant with mandatory standards .
the report found that many areas of the baltic sea are suffering from an overgrowth of algae , while a relatively high number of dirty waters are found around denmark , poland and britain .
testing is still lagging behind in new eu member states romania and bulgaria .
getting people involved each year , the eu tests its waters for possible bacteriological contamination deriving from industrial waste or agriculture .
water color , acidity , and the presence of residues from detergents are also tested .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy is home to more than one third of the eu 's beaches but the report can do more than just inform europeans and tourists about where they can safely take the plunge .
it also serves as a guide to get more people involved in their local surroundings , said eea 's executive director jacqueline mcglade .
" information sources like this report and our web-based viewing tools enable citizens not only to check the quality of the bathing water in their local community or holiday destination , but also to allow them to get more actively involved in the protection of their environment , " mcglade said .
italy closed most sites more than one third of the eu 's 14,500 beaches are found in italy .
the report showed that the mediterranean country stood out with 553 coastal beaches and freshwater sites where bathing had been closed or banned throughout the 2008 season .
this was far more than in other countries .
mcglade said it was " too early to say " whether there had been an improvement at those sites since last year as the data was not yet available .
of the 14,551 coastal bathing areas in the european union , bathing was banned or closed throughout the season in only 307 sites and was found not to be complying with eu standards in 208 sites .
among the 6,890 freshwater sites , bathing was banned at 315 sites and was not up to eu standards in 196. sac / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the draft urges countries to inspect north korean vessels , to cut back financial ties and expand the arms embargo . the five permanent members of the security council plus japan and south korea on wednesday agreed on a package of expanded sanctions against pyongyang .
the draft resolution " condemns in the strongest terms " north korea 's nuclear test last month and demands that it " not conduct any further nuclear test or any launch using ballistic missile technology . "
the draft calls for tougher inspections of north korean cargo vessels and for a cutting of financial ties with the country .
the existing arms embargo is to be stepped up . " the efforts made for a resolution were rewarded with success , " germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said during a visit to moscow .
" we expect a vote at the security council by friday at the latest , " he told a news conference after talks with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov .
the draft is a compromise as both china and russia had objected to earlier versions which would have required all countries to inspect north korean ships carrying suspicious cargo .
the latest draft now merely " calls upon " states to inspect the vessels .

rice said north korea 's behaviour was unacceptable and stressed that the objective of the new resolution was to get pyongyang to enter international talks .
" they must pay a price , they are to return without conditions to a process of negotiations and that the consequences they will face are significant , " rice told reporters .
" this sanctions regime , if passed by the security council , will bite in a meaningful way , " she said . north korea launched a long-range missile in april , triggering a rebuke from the un security council .
the regime in pyongyang then responded by declaring it had staged a successful nuclear weapons test , following one in 2006 .
according to russian and south korean officials , north korea is currently preparing yet another test-launch of a long-range missile. ai / ap / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite soaking up billions of euros in subsidies , germany 's eastern states still suffer from higher unemployment and lower productivity and per capita wealth .
migration is also a big problem .
but it appears that germany 's deepest recession since world war ii is having an unexpected side effect .
" so far , the east has not been hit as hard , " tiefensee said .
" twenty years after the peaceful revolution and the fall of the wall , the achievements of the east germans are being recognized in 2009 , " tiefensee told reporters after presenting the report to the cabinet .
smaller enterprises aiding eastern states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee presents the 2009 unity report tiefensee said that the eastern states are home to a larger proportion of smaller firms which are more flexible than big companies and less dependent on exports , which have slumped in the last few months .
he pointed in particular to the technology sector , where growth is higher in eastern states , especially in the solar energy sector which is strong there .
meanwhile the manufacturing industry in the west , which is heavily reliant on exports , has borne the brunt of the global downturn .
tiefensee noted that the western states ' " unprecedented solidarity " with the east , including more than one trillion euros in subsidies since national unification in 1990 , had been crucial to getting the region back on its feet .
gross national product per person in the east rose to 71 percent of that of a westerner last year , compared to 67 percent in 2000 , the report said .
industry in the east has grown by 7.5 percent over the last three years , compared to 4.3 percent in the west .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has stabilized in the east but is still high dspite the positive figures , divisions between eastern and western germany are still wide .
jobless figures are still twice as high in the east as in western states and long-term unemployment is a major problem .
unemployment stands at 13.3 percent in eastern states and is likely to rise further still in the coming months .
job migration is also a big problem .
young people , especially women , tend to abandon the east in search of work , leaving some areas as a wasteland .
about 90,000 people ditched the east for the west each year in the recent past , against just 40,000 people moving east .
" we have come a long way , but there is still a lot of work to do , " tiefensee said , adding that so-called " solidarity tax " payments to the east would likely continue for another decade , until 2019 .
by that time , he said , some of the eastern states could even overtake poorer western regions in terms of gross domestic product .

despite soaking up billions of euros in subsidies , germany 's eastern states still suffer from higher unemployment and lower productivity and per capita wealth .
migration is also a big problem .
but it appears that germany 's deepest recession since world war ii is having an unexpected side effect .
" so far , the east has not been hit as hard , " tiefensee said .
" twenty years after the peaceful revolution and the fall of the wall , the achievements of the east germans are being recognized in 2009 , " tiefensee told reporters after presenting the report to the cabinet .
smaller enterprises aiding eastern states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee presents the 2009 unity report tiefensee said that the eastern states are home to a larger proportion of smaller firms which are more flexible than big companies and less dependent on exports , which have slumped in the last few months .
he pointed in particular to the technology sector , where growth is higher in eastern states , especially in the solar energy sector which is strong there .
meanwhile the manufacturing industry in the west , which is heavily reliant on exports , has borne the brunt of the global downturn .
tiefensee noted that the western states ' " unprecedented solidarity " with the east , including more than one trillion euros in subsidies since national unification in 1990 , had been crucial to getting the region back on its feet .
gross national product per person in the east rose to 71 percent of that of a westerner last year , compared to 67 percent in 2000 , the report said .
industry in the east has grown by 7.5 percent over the last three years , compared to 4.3 percent in the west .
unemployment still a germany-wide problem tiefensee said that while unemployment had stayed roughly stable in eastern states in the last year , it had risen to 6.9 percent in may in western states from 6.4 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has stabilized in the east but is still high dspite the positive figures , divisions between eastern and western germany are still wide .
jobless figures are still twice as high in the east as in western states and long-term unemployment is a major problem .
unemployment stands at 13.3 percent in eastern states and is likely to rise further still in the coming months .
job migration is also a big problem .
young people , especially women , tend to abandon the east in search of work , leaving some areas as a wasteland .
about 90,000 people ditched the east for the west each year in the recent past , against just 40,000 people moving east .
" we have come a long way , but there is still a lot of work to do , " tiefensee said , adding that so-called " solidarity tax " payments to the east would likely continue for another decade , until 2019 .
by that time , he said , some of the eastern states could even overtake poorer western regions in terms of gross domestic product .
opposition accuses minister of election games opposition parties seized on the report to accuse tiefensee of scoring points for his social democrats , the junior partners in germany 's ruling coalition with chancellor merkel 's conservatives , ahead of the september general election .
" it is a clumsy attempt to win votes in the east when you tell people that the rest of the job will be finished in 10 years , " expert on eastern affairs for the liberal free democrats , joachim guenther , said. nda , afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" let me stress : this is a formal statement about the geographical spread of the disease ...
it is not in itself a cause for alarm , " the un secretary general told a press conference . " though infectious , this new virus has so far not been as severe as had been feared and death rates have been low , " he added .
" we must therefore be prepared .
our best response is a firm demonstration of global solidarity . " who director general margaret chan emphasized in geneva earlier thursday that the term pandemic indicates the geographical spread of the virus , not its severity .
sustained local transmissions outside the americas , have led it to raise the alert to six - indicating a full-blown pandemic chan added that the declaration of a " moderate " pandemic should not be a cause for panic and did not mean the global death toll of 150 from the a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- virus would sharply increase " the higher level of the pandemic does not necessarily mean we are going to see a more dangerous virus or see many more people falling severely ill or dying , " she said . however , she also said that she and the other health experts had determined that " the virus is spreading to a number of countries and is not stoppable . " the un body said it was neither recommending the closure of borders nor restrictions in movement of people , goods and services in the wake of its declaration . nations such as australia , britain , chile and japan – which are reporting growing numbers of infections – are being watched carefully as they are outside the americas , where swine flu was first detected in april . us already reacting in pandemic mode bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states have been acting at level six for weeks reactions to the pandemic announcement in the united states were muted as health officials confirmed that the us had been acting as if a pandemic was under way for weeks . thomas frieden , director of the center for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- , told a news conference the who declaration did not come as a surprise .
" there are no practical implications for most state and local governments , " he added . " here in the united states , the basic declaration is n't going to change our day-to-day activities , " added the cdc 's anne schuchat . according to the us experience , a global pandemic will have a number of specific features : the new h1n1 virus disproportionately makes younger people sick .
schuchat said 57 percent of us cases were among people aged 5 to 24 , and 41 percent of those hospitalized were in this younger age group . " the highest rates of hospitalization are actually in children under 5 , " schuchat said .
pregnant women , people with asthma or other chronic respiratory disease and diabetics needed to take special care and call a doctor if they had symptoms . the cdc said that all 50 states have had cases of infection by the h1n1 virus to such an extent that patients with specific flu-like symptoms - a fever above 104 degrees f , cough or other respiratory symptoms – are presumed to have the new virus . fears rise as southern hemisphere enters ' flu season bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the who is concerned how the developing world will cope health officials monitoring the spread of the disease are particularly concerned for countries in the southern hemisphere , where flu season is just getting under way .
the who ’ s margaret chan also said they were unsure how the virus would behave under the conditions of developing countries , which have thus far been largely spared from the virus . in other parts of the world , the big worry is that seasonal h1n1 and h3n2 viruses are still circulating .
the seasonal h1n1 has mutated into a form that resists the tamiflu vaccine , although it is still susceptible to the relenza alternative . experts fear if someone got infected with two strains at the same time , the viruses could recombine in the patient 's body and acquire new strengths and new drug resistance . outbreaks close schools in germany , hong kong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as many as 32 pupils were infected at the duesseldorf school meanwhile , city health officials confirmed that 32 students at the japanese international school in duesseldorf were infected with the h1n1 virus in the most concentrated outbreak of the virus so far in germany . most of the cases are not severe , only one of the students had to be treated at the city 's university hospital , said heiko schneitler , head of the duesseldorf health office .

" he 's acting on the maxim : we do n't know anything , we have to check things first , we have to deliberate so long until someone else takes this decision of our hands , " roth said in reference to the uighur case .
michael leutert , the human rights spokesman for the left party 's parliamentary group , said accepting the inmates was " a simple humanitarian act . "
" it is not plausible that two people proven innocent pose an uncalculated security risk for germany , " leutert said .
he said the german government needed to promptly " consider favorably " the us request. sac / afp / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has expressed the hope that israeli-palestinian peace efforts would resume in the near future . " a lot of important things are taking place , " he told reporters in jerusalem .
the eu 's foreign policy coordinator said that us president barack obama 's recent speech to the muslim world had been a crucial step in the right direction .
obama had urged the two sides in the middle east conflict to find a lasting settlement .
solana also mentioned last week 's elections in lebanon where iranian-backed hezbollah failed to capitalize on anti-israeli sentiment .
solana said it was a good time to " see how we can bring back the situation to something that can be moving in the right direction . "
last year , the peace process was dealt a setback by the israeli military offensive in the gaza strip .
solana added that he expected israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to endorse a two-state solution and to freeze israeli settlement in the palestinian territories .
" that 's what we expect to hear and i am sure something of that nature will happen , " solana said in reference to a speech netanyahu announced for sunday where he will outline his government 's policies on the peace process .
so far , netanyahu who heads a right-of-center coalition , has refused to publicly back a palestinian state or order a halt to settlement construction .
solana is to continue his tour of the middle east by meeting with palestinian , lebanese and egyptian leaders. ai / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has expressed the hope that israeli-palestinian peace efforts would resume in the near future . " a lot of important things are taking place , " he told reporters in jerusalem .
the eu 's foreign policy coordinator said that us president barack obama 's recent speech to the muslim world had been a crucial step in the right direction .
obama had urged the two sides in the middle east conflict to find a lasting settlement .
solana also mentioned last week 's elections in lebanon where iranian-backed hezbollah failed to capitalize on anti-israeli sentiment .
solana said it was a good time to " see how we can bring back the situation to something that can be moving in the right direction . "
last year , the peace process was dealt a setback by the israeli military offensive in the gaza strip .
solana added that he expected israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to endorse a two-state solution and to freeze israeli settlement in the palestinian territories .
" that 's what we expect to hear and i am sure something of that nature will happen , " solana said in reference to a speech netanyahu announced for sunday where he will outline his government 's policies on the peace process .
so far , netanyahu who heads a right-of-center coalition , has refused to publicly back a palestinian state or order a halt to settlement construction .
solana is to continue his tour of the middle east by meeting with palestinian , lebanese and egyptian leaders. ai / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is no doubt in my mind that we will get the job done , " marchionne said in a letter to employees .
he called the alliance a " bold first step to implement " lessons learned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fiat chief sergio marchionne is upbeat about the merged company 's chances marchionne said earlier that the merged chrysler and fiat ranked as the world 's sixth largest automaker .
marchionne said fiat will begin the process of transferring fiat 's technology , platforms and powertrains to chrysler plants in the next few months .
the white house welcomed the completion of the deal and said the new alliance was " poised to emerge as a competitive , viable automaker . "
us court paves way for deal the deal 's completion came a day after the us supreme court lifted a stay on a lower court 's approval of the deal .
the court said a group of indiana pension funds opposed to the deal had failed to show " that the circumstances justify " delaying proceedings to accommodate their challenge .
the funds had argued that the white house-backed sale of chrysler to fiat is unconstitutional because it puts the rights of junior creditors ahead of the rights of senior lenders .
they also said the us treasury had overstepped its legal authority by using some $ 12 billion in financial bailout funds to reorganize chrysler when congress had intended the money for banks .

the statement said that because chrysler is not manufacturing cars , each day of bankruptcy was costing the company approximately $ 100 million .
chrysler filed for bankruptcy on april 30 and is seeking to re-emerge within the next 30 to 60 days .
its rapid turnaround plan is expected to serve as a precedent for general motors , which has filed for creditor protection as part of a plan that offloads its german subsidiary opel and gives the us government a majority stake in the new gm .

" there is no doubt in my mind that we will get the job done , " marchionne said in a letter to employees .
he called the alliance a " bold first step to implement " lessons learned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fiat chief sergio marchionne is upbeat about the merged company 's chances marchionne said earlier that the merged chrysler and fiat ranked as the world 's sixth largest automaker .
marchionne said fiat will begin the process of transferring fiat 's technology , platforms and powertrains to chrysler plants in the next few months .
the white house welcomed the completion of the deal and said the new alliance was " poised to emerge as a competitive , viable automaker . "
us court paves way for deal the deal 's completion came a day after the us supreme court lifted a stay on a lower court 's approval of the deal .
the court said a group of indiana pension funds opposed to the deal had failed to show " that the circumstances justify " delaying proceedings to accommodate their challenge .

but the government says it needs more details before it can make a decision . the interior ministry said on thursday that it was unable to accept the us request based on the data provided .
" we 're examining two new cases , " ministry spokesman stefan paris said in berlin .
" the information provided by the united states is not sufficient for now for us to give the green light for taking in the two men . "
the interior ministry would need to check whether the prisoners represented a security risk , he said .
also , berlin needed to know why the men could not be taken in by the us and what ties they had to germany .
paris would not disclose the nationality of the two men .
security sources said one was syrian , the other tunisian .
resistance at home and abroad in april , the us made an initial request , presenting the german government with a list of nine chinese uighur detainees for berlin to " consider . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palau is offering 17 uighers a new temporary home interior minister wolfgang schaeuble had also replied in that case that the information provided was insufficient to warrant a positive reply .
us president barack obama has pledged to close the facility at the us naval base at guantanamo bay , cuba by early next year .
many of the inmates have already been cleared for release .
but us officials are having difficulty finding countries that will take them in , and meeting resistance at home to housing them on us soil .
the tiny pacific nation palau on agreed wednesday to take in up to 17 uighur guantanamo detainees .
four further uighur men who had been held at the prison camp were sent to bermuda on thursday .
sharp political debate german politicians have disagreed on the issue .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat candidate to challenge chancellor angela merkel in september 's federal election , has spoken in favor of accepting inmates .
but interior minister schaeuble has voiced skepticism .
on a visit to germany last week , obama said after talks with merkel that he had neither asked for nor received any hard commitments from berlin on taking guantanamo detainees .
he said merkel had been " very open " to discussions on the issue .
opposition politicians have been very critical of the government 's stance .
claudia roth , co-leader of the green party , said schaeuble was using " stalling tactics . "
" he 's acting on the maxim : we do n't know anything , we have to check things first , we have to deliberate so long until someone else takes this decision of our hands , " roth said in reference to the uighur case .
michael leutert , the human rights spokesman for the left party 's parliamentary group , said accepting the inmates was " a simple humanitarian act . "
" it is not plausible that two people proven innocent pose an uncalculated security risk for germany , " leutert said .
he said the german government needed to promptly " consider favorably " the us request. sac / afp / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has expressed the hope that israeli-palestinian peace efforts would resume in the near future . " a lot of important things are taking place , " he told reporters in jerusalem .
the eu 's foreign policy coordinator said that us president barack obama 's recent speech to the muslim world had been a crucial step in the right direction .
obama had urged the two sides in the middle east conflict to find a lasting settlement .
solana also mentioned last week 's elections in lebanon where iranian-backed hezbollah failed to capitalize on anti-israeli sentiment .
solana said it was a good time to " see how we can bring back the situation to something that can be moving in the right direction . "
last year , the peace process was dealt a setback by the israeli military offensive in the gaza strip .
solana added that he expected israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to endorse a two-state solution and to freeze israeli settlement in the palestinian territories .
" that 's what we expect to hear and i am sure something of that nature will happen , " solana said in reference to a speech netanyahu announced for sunday where he will outline his government 's policies on the peace process .
so far , netanyahu who heads a right-of-center coalition , has refused to publicly back a palestinian state or order a halt to settlement construction .
solana is to continue his tour of the middle east by meeting with palestinian , lebanese and egyptian leaders. ai / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" let me stress : this is a formal statement about the geographical spread of the disease ...
it is not in itself a cause for alarm , " the un secretary general told a press conference . " though infectious , this new virus has so far not been as severe as had been feared and death rates have been low , " he added .
" we must therefore be prepared .
our best response is a firm demonstration of global solidarity . " who director general margaret chan emphasized in geneva earlier thursday that the term pandemic indicates the geographical spread of the virus , not its severity .
sustained local transmissions outside the americas , have led it to raise the alert to six - indicating a full-blown pandemic chan added that the declaration of a " moderate " pandemic should not be a cause for panic and did not mean the global death toll of 150 from the a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- virus would sharply increase " the higher level of the pandemic does not necessarily mean we are going to see a more dangerous virus or see many more people falling severely ill or dying , " she said . however , she also said that she and the other health experts had determined that " the virus is spreading to a number of countries and is not stoppable . " the un body said it was neither recommending the closure of borders nor restrictions in movement of people , goods and services in the wake of its declaration . nations such as australia , britain , chile and japan – which are reporting growing numbers of infections – are being watched carefully as they are outside the americas , where swine flu was first detected in april . us already reacting in pandemic mode bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states have been acting at level six for weeks reactions to the pandemic announcement in the united states were muted as health officials confirmed that the us had been acting as if a pandemic was under way for weeks . thomas frieden , director of the center for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- , told a news conference the who declaration did not come as a surprise .
" there are no practical implications for most state and local governments , " he added . " here in the united states , the basic declaration is n't going to change our day-to-day activities , " added the cdc 's anne schuchat . according to the us experience , a global pandemic will have a number of specific features : the new h1n1 virus disproportionately makes younger people sick .
schuchat said 57 percent of us cases were among people aged 5 to 24 , and 41 percent of those hospitalized were in this younger age group . " the highest rates of hospitalization are actually in children under 5 , " schuchat said .
pregnant women , people with asthma or other chronic respiratory disease and diabetics needed to take special care and call a doctor if they had symptoms . the cdc said that all 50 states have had cases of infection by the h1n1 virus to such an extent that patients with specific flu-like symptoms - a fever above 104 degrees f , cough or other respiratory symptoms – are presumed to have the new virus . fears rise as southern hemisphere enters ' flu season bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the who is concerned how the developing world will cope health officials monitoring the spread of the disease are particularly concerned for countries in the southern hemisphere , where flu season is just getting under way .
the who ’ s margaret chan also said they were unsure how the virus would behave under the conditions of developing countries , which have thus far been largely spared from the virus . in other parts of the world , the big worry is that seasonal h1n1 and h3n2 viruses are still circulating .
the seasonal h1n1 has mutated into a form that resists the tamiflu vaccine , although it is still susceptible to the relenza alternative . experts fear if someone got infected with two strains at the same time , the viruses could recombine in the patient 's body and acquire new strengths and new drug resistance . outbreaks close schools in germany , hong kong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as many as 32 pupils were infected at the duesseldorf school meanwhile , city health officials confirmed that 32 students at the japanese international school in duesseldorf were infected with the h1n1 virus in the most concentrated outbreak of the virus so far in germany . most of the cases are not severe , only one of the students had to be treated at the city 's university hospital , said heiko schneitler , head of the duesseldorf health office .
all children have been placed in quarantine at home . most of the children affected were japanese , schneitler said .
duesseldorf is home to a large japanese community kathrin rebbe , a spokeswoman at the north-rhine westphalia health ministry said four additional cases of h1n1 had been detected at a school in nearby cologne . germany now has more than 100 confirmed cases of the swine flu virus .
the head of the robert koch institute , joerg hacker said he expected infections to rise . in hong kong , authorities took the decision to close all primary schools , kindergartens , child care centers and special schools for two weeks in an effort to control the spread of the virus after 12 pupils at a city secondary school were found to have contracted the a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- virus , chief executive donald tsang said . nda / hf / dpa / reuters / afp editor : charles penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the white house welcomed the completion of the deal and said the new alliance was " poised to emerge as a competitive , viable automaker . "
us court paves way for deal the deal 's completion came a day after the us supreme court lifted a stay on a lower court 's approval of the deal .
the court said a group of indiana pension funds opposed to the deal had failed to show " that the circumstances justify " delaying proceedings to accommodate their challenge .
the funds had argued that the white house-backed sale of chrysler to fiat is unconstitutional because it puts the rights of junior creditors ahead of the rights of senior lenders .

the statement said that because chrysler is not manufacturing cars , each day of bankruptcy was costing the company approximately $ 100 million .
chrysler filed for bankruptcy on april 30 and is seeking to re-emerge within the next 30 to 60 days .

" there is no doubt in my mind that we will get the job done , " marchionne said in a letter to employees .
he called the alliance a " bold first step to implement " lessons learned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fiat chief sergio marchionne is upbeat about the merged company 's chances marchionne said earlier that the merged chrysler and fiat ranked as the world 's sixth largest automaker .
marchionne said fiat will begin the process of transferring fiat 's technology , platforms and powertrains to chrysler plants in the next few months .
the white house welcomed the completion of the deal and said the new alliance was " poised to emerge as a competitive , viable automaker . "
us court paves way for deal the deal 's completion came a day after the us supreme court lifted a stay on a lower court 's approval of the deal .
the court said a group of indiana pension funds opposed to the deal had failed to show " that the circumstances justify " delaying proceedings to accommodate their challenge .
the funds had argued that the white house-backed sale of chrysler to fiat is unconstitutional because it puts the rights of junior creditors ahead of the rights of senior lenders .
they also said the us treasury had overstepped its legal authority by using some $ 12 billion in financial bailout funds to reorganize chrysler when congress had intended the money for banks .
chrysler 's sale to fiat , a union-aligned trust and the us and canadian governments is aimed at pulling the company out of bankruptcy and reorganizing it to cope with changing economic conditions and consumer tastes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrysler may get a new life under fiat but it still needs to overcome past problems the court gave the transaction the green light after the government filed a brief warning that fiat could walk away from the chrysler deal if it was not finalized by june 15 .
" if fiat is released from the obligation to consummate the transaction as currently structured , it will be free to demand additional concessions before concluding a new agreement , " the justice dpartment brief said .
the statement said that because chrysler is not manufacturing cars , each day of bankruptcy was costing the company approximately $ 100 million .
chrysler filed for bankruptcy on april 30 and is seeking to re-emerge within the next 30 to 60 days .
its rapid turnaround plan is expected to serve as a precedent for general motors , which has filed for creditor protection as part of a plan that offloads its german subsidiary opel and gives the us government a majority stake in the new gm .
" cash for clunkers " bill approved meanwhile , the " cash for clunkers " bill , one of president obama 's consumer incentives for new car purchases , was approved by the house of representatives this week .
the bill aims to boost new car sales by allowing consumers to turn in their gas-guzzling cars and trucks for vouchers worth up to $ 4,500 toward more fuel-efficient vehicles . the measure is part of the obama 's administration 's efforts to stimulate car sales and increase the fleet of fuel-efficient vehicles on the nation 's highways . the us car industry has been searching for new incentives after months of poor car sale .

no matter who wins , observers agree that it 's time for iran and the us to sit down at the negotiating table .
and the european union could act as a vital mediator . three candidates are running against iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is seeking a second term in friday 's presidential elections .
observers forecast that the reformists under former prime minister mir hossein mousavi have the best chances of beating ahmadinejad .
yet no matter who wins , the time has come for serious negotiations with the west regarding iran 's controversial nuclear program , said christian-peter hanelt , a middle east expert from the bertelsmann foundation .
" it is time for a rapprochement between iran , its neighbors and the west , " hanelt said .
" in order to pre-empt another confrontation in the middle east and further escalation as a result of the iranian nuclear program , american-iranian relations must be put on a sustainable footing after the iranian presidential elections . "
the european union could play a significant mediatory role in this process , said konstantin kosten , an expert on iran at the german council on foreign relations , dgap .
" the eu could certainly act as a bridge and door opener , " kosten said .
" direct contacts exist already with the iranian government and the most significant negotiating circles . "
the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana has been leading talks between iran and the so-called eu3 -lrb- referring to france , britain and germany -rrb- for years .
due to these contacts , eu officials could provide us diplomats with expertise and support .
us has full eu support the us administration has chosen a new path in its dealings with iran .
whereas former president george w. bush opted for confrontation , placing iran as part of its " axis of evil , " president barack obama is going for direct diplomacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uranium conversion facility in isfahan contributes to iran 's nuclear program in march , obama directly addressed the country 's leaders in a message to the iranian people on the occasion of nowruz , the iranian new year .
he offered tehran direct talks without any preconditions .
the us president has full backing from the eu , whose foreign ministers urged iran to take advantage of the change in us policy to seal a deal and end the stand-off over its nuclear ambitions .
" the eu warmly supports the new direction of us policy towards iran , which opens a window of opportunity for negotiations on all aspects of iran 's nuclear program and more broadly for engagement with iran , " the eu foreign ministers said in a statement in april .
washington can count on support by its european partners .
" the eu reaffirms its full and unequivocal support for efforts to find a negotiated long-term solution to the iranian nuclear issue , " the ministers said .
in addition to making it clear to tehran that the eu stands behind us policy , it 's also important to send signals of eu support to washington , said michael bauer , head of the middle east project at the center for applied policy research at the university of munich .
" there are not only proponents of this new policy towards iran in washington so i think a first step would be to essentially support the advocates and make clear to them that the european position clearly welcomes this willingness for talks , " bauer said .
compromise is necessary the main point of contention continues to be iran 's nuclear program and the country 's unwillingness to permit comprehensive and strict controls .
despite the eu 's repeated efforts to find a solution , negotiations have failed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's confrontational tone is popular among the rural poor hanelt said that only the us could provide the desired security guarantees for the territory of iran and recognition of its political system .
" for this reason , europe can now achieve more it if simply provides robust support for the us administration in its forthcoming rapprochement with tehran , " hanelt said .
bauer said iran wanted to be viewed as a " legitimate political actor " with the corresponding security guarantees .
" iran is first and foremost interested in recognition of its regime by the us , " bauer said .
" this is something the europeans ca n't offer . "
but iran was also in a strong position at the moment and its support was needed for positive developments in the region , he said .
" the us and barack obama will need iran to keep iraq stable , " bauer said .
" iran is needed to get a grip on the problems in afghanistan to some extent .
iran is an important player here . "
nuclear program will continue any hopes that iran will abandon its nuclear program are futile , though .
kosten said iran will want to remain at the helm when it comes to uranium enrichment and civilian use of nuclear power .
" the question is more whether a solution can be found which enables enrichment on iranian soil , " kosten said .
" there has to be an idea how iran can exercise its rights and therefore save face . "
even an attack by israel on iran 's nuclear facilities would put the program back by a few years , but would not stop it .
iran 's nuclear program as such is not up for discussion , bauer said .
" that has to be clear and i think it is to barack obama , " bauer said .
he said the west could at most hope to gain from iran a degree of transparency of its nuclear program through cooperation with the international atomic energy agency , which can ensure that it is a civilian nuclear program .
a turning point in iran the iranian people are considered to be among the most pro-western in the middle east .
and many , especially younger people , are fed up with ahmadinejad 's confrontational tone .
mousavi supporters have been taking to tehran 's streets for nightly demonstrations to express their discontent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mousavi supporter shows where he stands ruprecht polenz , chairman of the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee , said ahmadinejad 's defeat would mean a lot for the future of young iranians .
" when you consider what needs to happen so that the economic situation improves , so that all the young people who finish university each year really have an opportunity to find a good job , then economic reform is necessary , " polenz said .
" more intense trade relations are necessary especially with developed nations , such as european countries . "
but this requires iran to change its confrontational foreign policy and focus on cooperation , he said .
ultimately , though , the real power in iran is held by its supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei .
" indeed the ayatollah is the central player in iran 's political system , even when it comes to such matters like the nuclear program , " bauer said .
" in the end , the compromise will have to be made with the revolutionary leader . "

no matter who wins , observers agree that it 's time for iran and the us to sit down at the negotiating table .
and the european union could act as a vital mediator . three candidates are running against iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is seeking a second term in friday 's presidential elections .
observers forecast that the reformists under former prime minister mir hossein mousavi have the best chances of beating ahmadinejad .
yet no matter who wins , the time has come for serious negotiations with the west regarding iran 's controversial nuclear program , said christian-peter hanelt , a middle east expert from the bertelsmann foundation .
" it is time for a rapprochement between iran , its neighbors and the west , " hanelt said .
" in order to pre-empt another confrontation in the middle east and further escalation as a result of the iranian nuclear program , american-iranian relations must be put on a sustainable footing after the iranian presidential elections . "
the european union could play a significant mediatory role in this process , said konstantin kosten , an expert on iran at the german council on foreign relations , dgap .
" the eu could certainly act as a bridge and door opener , " kosten said .
" direct contacts exist already with the iranian government and the most significant negotiating circles . "
the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana has been leading talks between iran and the so-called eu3 -lrb- referring to france , britain and germany -rrb- for years .
due to these contacts , eu officials could provide us diplomats with expertise and support .
us has full eu support the us administration has chosen a new path in its dealings with iran .
whereas former president george w. bush opted for confrontation , placing iran as part of its " axis of evil , " president barack obama is going for direct diplomacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uranium conversion facility in isfahan contributes to iran 's nuclear program in march , obama directly addressed the country 's leaders in a message to the iranian people on the occasion of nowruz , the iranian new year .
he offered tehran direct talks without any preconditions .
the us president has full backing from the eu , whose foreign ministers urged iran to take advantage of the change in us policy to seal a deal and end the stand-off over its nuclear ambitions .
" the eu warmly supports the new direction of us policy towards iran , which opens a window of opportunity for negotiations on all aspects of iran 's nuclear program and more broadly for engagement with iran , " the eu foreign ministers said in a statement in april .
washington can count on support by its european partners .
" the eu reaffirms its full and unequivocal support for efforts to find a negotiated long-term solution to the iranian nuclear issue , " the ministers said .
in addition to making it clear to tehran that the eu stands behind us policy , it 's also important to send signals of eu support to washington , said michael bauer , head of the middle east project at the center for applied policy research at the university of munich .
" there are not only proponents of this new policy towards iran in washington so i think a first step would be to essentially support the advocates and make clear to them that the european position clearly welcomes this willingness for talks , " bauer said .
compromise is necessary the main point of contention continues to be iran 's nuclear program and the country 's unwillingness to permit comprehensive and strict controls .
despite the eu 's repeated efforts to find a solution , negotiations have failed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's confrontational tone is popular among the rural poor hanelt said that only the us could provide the desired security guarantees for the territory of iran and recognition of its political system .
" for this reason , europe can now achieve more it if simply provides robust support for the us administration in its forthcoming rapprochement with tehran , " hanelt said .
bauer said iran wanted to be viewed as a " legitimate political actor " with the corresponding security guarantees .
" iran is first and foremost interested in recognition of its regime by the us , " bauer said .
" this is something the europeans ca n't offer . "
but iran was also in a strong position at the moment and its support was needed for positive developments in the region , he said .
" the us and barack obama will need iran to keep iraq stable , " bauer said .
" iran is needed to get a grip on the problems in afghanistan to some extent .
iran is an important player here . "
nuclear program will continue any hopes that iran will abandon its nuclear program are futile , though .
kosten said iran will want to remain at the helm when it comes to uranium enrichment and civilian use of nuclear power .
" the question is more whether a solution can be found which enables enrichment on iranian soil , " kosten said .
" there has to be an idea how iran can exercise its rights and therefore save face . "
even an attack by israel on iran 's nuclear facilities would put the program back by a few years , but would not stop it .
iran 's nuclear program as such is not up for discussion , bauer said .
" that has to be clear and i think it is to barack obama , " bauer said .
he said the west could at most hope to gain from iran a degree of transparency of its nuclear program through cooperation with the international atomic energy agency , which can ensure that it is a civilian nuclear program .
a turning point in iran the iranian people are considered to be among the most pro-western in the middle east .
and many , especially younger people , are fed up with ahmadinejad 's confrontational tone .
mousavi supporters have been taking to tehran 's streets for nightly demonstrations to express their discontent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mousavi supporter shows where he stands ruprecht polenz , chairman of the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee , said ahmadinejad 's defeat would mean a lot for the future of young iranians .
" when you consider what needs to happen so that the economic situation improves , so that all the young people who finish university each year really have an opportunity to find a good job , then economic reform is necessary , " polenz said .
" more intense trade relations are necessary especially with developed nations , such as european countries . "
but this requires iran to change its confrontational foreign policy and focus on cooperation , he said .
ultimately , though , the real power in iran is held by its supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei .
" indeed the ayatollah is the central player in iran 's political system , even when it comes to such matters like the nuclear program , " bauer said .
" in the end , the compromise will have to be made with the revolutionary leader . "

us president obama is scheduled to travel to moscow early next month for key talks on a follow-up to start , which expires on december 5 .
us and russian negotiators have been holding preliminary meetings ahead of those talks .
moscow has said it wants to link the nuclear talks to washington 's plans to deploy an anti-missile shield in central europe - a plan the kremlin firmly opposes .
russian prime minister vladimir putin said the kremlin would consider getting rid of its nuclear arsenal if all other countries agreed to do so as well .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what do we need nuclear weapons for ? "

putin praised berlin 's active role in negotiating a plan to rescue struggling carmaker opel , which now counts russian state-owned lender sberbank as one of its major stakeholders .
the three leaders agreed to increase cooperation in the energy sector , particularly in renewable fuel sources and efficiency .
steinmeier also addressed the controversial topics of human rights and moscow 's relations with tbilisi in the wake of last year 's military conflict between russia and georgia .
he urged moscow to adopt a " constructive " role in the caucasus and stressed that unresolved territorial disputes did not have a place in the europe of the 21st century .

" with the entry into office of president obama , there is a genuine chance for new cooperation between the united states , the european union and russia , " steinmeier said .
" the ghost of the cold war has been banished ...
so i would like to say that the extended hand of the us president should be boldly accepted , " he said .
earlier , steinmeier told reporters that the security council 's five permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - as well as japan and south korea had agreed to toughen their stance against north korea after pyongyang tested a nuclear device and launched several missiles in recent weeks .
" the efforts made for a resolution were rewarded with success , " steinmeier said at a joint press conference with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov in moscow on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea has tested several missiles this year diplomats say the latest draft resolution " calls upon " countries to inspect north korean ships carrying suspicious cargo that might violate a partial un trade and arms embargo , although it does not demand it .
the document does , however , require governemnts to deny fuel to any suspicious north korea vessles and direct them to dock at " an appropriate and convenient port . "
reaching out disarmament was a key theme throughout steinmeier 's two-day visit to moscow , during which he also met with russian president dmitry medvedev .
in his address to the russian academy of science , steinmeier said that all nations should make constructive efforts to disarm .
" this has to be the year when international disarmament efforts move back to the top of the agenda , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said medvedev seemed ready to reduce its nuclear arsenal steinmeier stressed that the talks between russia and the us on replacing the 1991 strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- were " a vital step on the difficult path towards a world free of nuclear weapons . "
steinmeier called the warming of relations between the kremlin and the us a " unique historic opportunity . "
thawing fronts ?
us president obama is scheduled to travel to moscow early next month for key talks on a follow-up to start , which expires on december 5 .
us and russian negotiators have been holding preliminary meetings ahead of those talks .
moscow has said it wants to link the nuclear talks to washington 's plans to deploy an anti-missile shield in central europe - a plan the kremlin firmly opposes .
russian prime minister vladimir putin said the kremlin would consider getting rid of its nuclear arsenal if all other countries agreed to do so as well .
after meeting the german foreign minister , putin was asked if he could imagine a russia without nuclear weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what do we need nuclear weapons for ? "
putin asked " of course , " he answered .
" what do we need nuclear weapons for ? "
putin 's answer did have one caveat , however .
" if those who invented the atomic bomb , and used it , are prepared to do away with atom bombs , then we would welcome this , " he said , suggesting his country 's involvement is dependent on us disarmament .
the russian news agency interfax , however , has reported that russia wants to keep at least 1,500 nuclear warheads .
other business in addition to disarmament , steinmeier also spoke with russian leaders about combating the effects of the global financial crisis .
putin praised berlin 's active role in negotiating a plan to rescue struggling carmaker opel , which now counts russian state-owned lender sberbank as one of its major stakeholders .
the three leaders agreed to increase cooperation in the energy sector , particularly in renewable fuel sources and efficiency .
steinmeier also addressed the controversial topics of human rights and moscow 's relations with tbilisi in the wake of last year 's military conflict between russia and georgia .
he urged moscow to adopt a " constructive " role in the caucasus and stressed that unresolved territorial disputes did not have a place in the europe of the 21st century .

the gunman remains in a critical condition , mayor adrian fenty said .
the lone gunman 's identity or connections to anti-semitic groups could not be confirmed but media reports said he was believed to be known as white supremacist james w von brunn .
von brunn is thought to be behind numerous anti-semitic articles posted on the internet , including a book called " kill the best gentiles , " which he calls " a new hard-hitting expose of the jewish conspiracy to destroy the white gene pool . "
" it appears to be a lone gunman who entered into the museum and opened fire with what appears to be a rifle at this point , " washington police chief cathy lanier said .
museum officials identified the guard as officer stephen tyrone johns , who had worked at the museum for six years .
" i am shocked and saddened by today 's shooting at the us holocaust memorial museum , " us president barack obama said in a statement .
" this outrageous act reminds us that we must remain vigilant against anti-semitism and prejudice in all its forms .
" no american institution is more important to this effort than the holocaust museum , and no act of violence will diminish our determination to honor those who were lost by building a more peaceful and tolerant world , " he added .
obama last week became the first us president to visit the nazi death camp in buchenwald , germany where he renewed a historic commitment to israel .
the armed man carrying a long rifle entered the museum just blocks from the national mall and washington monument shortly before 1 pm -lrb- 1800 cet -rrb- and immediately fired at armed security guards , police chief lanier told reporters .
two security guards returned fire and johns and the gunman were wounded .
local media reports said a third person was hit by glass but the extent of those injuries are unknown .
museum no stranger to threats and abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum opened in 1993 security director joseph rosboschil said the museum receives occasional threats but there had been " nothing significant of late . "
rosboschil also said the museum had more security measures than other washington museums .
sara j bloomfield , director of the museum , said this apparent act of intolerance and hatred was " even more reason for this museum to exist . "
the council on american-islamic relations , a muslim civil liberties and advocacy group , said in a statement that it condemned " this apparent bias-motivated attack " and stands with the " jewish community and with americans of all faiths in repudiating the kind of hatred and intolerance that can lead to such disturbing incidents . "
more than 30 million people have visited the museum since its opening in 1993 , including 85 heads of state. nda , afp / dpa / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite soaking up billions of euros in subsidies , germany 's eastern states still suffer from higher unemployment and lower productivity and per capita wealth .
migration is also a big problem .
but it appears that germany 's deepest recession since world war ii is having an unexpected side effect .
" so far , the east has not been hit as hard , " tiefensee said .
" twenty years after the peaceful revolution and the fall of the wall , the achievements of the east germans are being recognized in 2009 , " tiefensee told reporters after presenting the report to the cabinet .
smaller enterprises aiding eastern states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee presents the 2009 unity report tiefensee said that the eastern states are home to a larger proportion of smaller firms which are more flexible than big companies and less dependent on exports , which have slumped in the last few months .
he pointed in particular to the technology sector , where growth is higher in eastern states , especially in the solar energy sector which is strong there .
meanwhile the manufacturing industry in the west , which is heavily reliant on exports , has borne the brunt of the global downturn .
tiefensee noted that the western states ' " unprecedented solidarity " with the east , including more than one trillion euros in subsidies since national unification in 1990 , had been crucial to getting the region back on its feet .
gross national product per person in the east rose to 71 percent of that of a westerner last year , compared to 67 percent in 2000 , the report said .
industry in the east has grown by 7.5 percent over the last three years , compared to 4.3 percent in the west .
unemployment still a germany-wide problem tiefensee said that while unemployment had stayed roughly stable in eastern states in the last year , it had risen to 6.9 percent in may in western states from 6.4 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has stabilized in the east but is still high dspite the positive figures , divisions between eastern and western germany are still wide .
jobless figures are still twice as high in the east as in western states and long-term unemployment is a major problem .
unemployment stands at 13.3 percent in eastern states and is likely to rise further still in the coming months .
job migration is also a big problem .
young people , especially women , tend to abandon the east in search of work , leaving some areas as a wasteland .
about 90,000 people ditched the east for the west each year in the recent past , against just 40,000 people moving east .
" we have come a long way , but there is still a lot of work to do , " tiefensee said , adding that so-called " solidarity tax " payments to the east would likely continue for another decade , until 2019 .
by that time , he said , some of the eastern states could even overtake poorer western regions in terms of gross domestic product .
opposition accuses minister of election games opposition parties seized on the report to accuse tiefensee of scoring points for his social democrats , the junior partners in germany 's ruling coalition with chancellor merkel 's conservatives , ahead of the september general election .
" it is a clumsy attempt to win votes in the east when you tell people that the rest of the job will be finished in 10 years , " expert on eastern affairs for the liberal free democrats , joachim guenther , said. nda , afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile the manufacturing industry in the west , which is heavily reliant on exports , has borne the brunt of the global downturn .
tiefensee noted that the western states ' " unprecedented solidarity " with the east , including more than one trillion euros in subsidies since national unification in 1990 , had been crucial to getting the region back on its feet .
gross national product per person in the east rose to 71 percent of that of a westerner last year , compared to 67 percent in 2000 , the report said .
industry in the east has grown by 7.5 percent over the last three years , compared to 4.3 percent in the west .
unemployment still a germany-wide problem tiefensee said that while unemployment had stayed roughly stable in eastern states in the last year , it had risen to 6.9 percent in may in western states from 6.4 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has stabilized in the east but is still high dspite the positive figures , divisions between eastern and western germany are still wide .
jobless figures are still twice as high in the east as in western states and long-term unemployment is a major problem .
unemployment stands at 13.3 percent in eastern states and is likely to rise further still in the coming months .
job migration is also a big problem .
young people , especially women , tend to abandon the east in search of work , leaving some areas as a wasteland .
about 90,000 people ditched the east for the west each year in the recent past , against just 40,000 people moving east .
" we have come a long way , but there is still a lot of work to do , " tiefensee said , adding that so-called " solidarity tax " payments to the east would likely continue for another decade , until 2019 .
by that time , he said , some of the eastern states could even overtake poorer western regions in terms of gross domestic product .
opposition accuses minister of election games opposition parties seized on the report to accuse tiefensee of scoring points for his social democrats , the junior partners in germany 's ruling coalition with chancellor merkel 's conservatives , ahead of the september general election .
" it is a clumsy attempt to win votes in the east when you tell people that the rest of the job will be finished in 10 years , " expert on eastern affairs for the liberal free democrats , joachim guenther , said. nda , afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" with the entry into office of president obama , there is a genuine chance for new cooperation between the united states , the european union and russia , " steinmeier said .
" the ghost of the cold war has been banished ...
so i would like to say that the extended hand of the us president should be boldly accepted , " he said .
earlier , steinmeier told reporters that the security council 's five permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - as well as japan and south korea had agreed to toughen their stance against north korea after pyongyang tested a nuclear device and launched several missiles in recent weeks .
" the efforts made for a resolution were rewarded with success , " steinmeier said at a joint press conference with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov in moscow on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea has tested several missiles this year diplomats say the latest draft resolution " calls upon " countries to inspect north korean ships carrying suspicious cargo that might violate a partial un trade and arms embargo , although it does not demand it .
the document does , however , require governemnts to deny fuel to any suspicious north korea vessles and direct them to dock at " an appropriate and convenient port . "
reaching out disarmament was a key theme throughout steinmeier 's two-day visit to moscow , during which he also met with russian president dmitry medvedev .
in his address to the russian academy of science , steinmeier said that all nations should make constructive efforts to disarm .
" this has to be the year when international disarmament efforts move back to the top of the agenda , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said medvedev seemed ready to reduce its nuclear arsenal steinmeier stressed that the talks between russia and the us on replacing the 1991 strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- were " a vital step on the difficult path towards a world free of nuclear weapons . "
steinmeier called the warming of relations between the kremlin and the us a " unique historic opportunity . "
thawing fronts ?
us president obama is scheduled to travel to moscow early next month for key talks on a follow-up to start , which expires on december 5 .
us and russian negotiators have been holding preliminary meetings ahead of those talks .
moscow has said it wants to link the nuclear talks to washington 's plans to deploy an anti-missile shield in central europe - a plan the kremlin firmly opposes .
russian prime minister vladimir putin said the kremlin would consider getting rid of its nuclear arsenal if all other countries agreed to do so as well .
after meeting the german foreign minister , putin was asked if he could imagine a russia without nuclear weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what do we need nuclear weapons for ? "
putin asked " of course , " he answered .
" what do we need nuclear weapons for ? "
putin 's answer did have one caveat , however .
" if those who invented the atomic bomb , and used it , are prepared to do away with atom bombs , then we would welcome this , " he said , suggesting his country 's involvement is dependent on us disarmament .
the russian news agency interfax , however , has reported that russia wants to keep at least 1,500 nuclear warheads .
other business in addition to disarmament , steinmeier also spoke with russian leaders about combating the effects of the global financial crisis .
putin praised berlin 's active role in negotiating a plan to rescue struggling carmaker opel , which now counts russian state-owned lender sberbank as one of its major stakeholders .
the three leaders agreed to increase cooperation in the energy sector , particularly in renewable fuel sources and efficiency .
steinmeier also addressed the controversial topics of human rights and moscow 's relations with tbilisi in the wake of last year 's military conflict between russia and georgia .
he urged moscow to adopt a " constructive " role in the caucasus and stressed that unresolved territorial disputes did not have a place in the europe of the 21st century .
during a visit to the editorial office of the novaya gazeta , a newspaper known for being critical of the kremlin , steinmeier wrote that democracy and a free press go together like breathing and air. sje / hf / dpa / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is no doubt in my mind that we will get the job done , " marchionne said in a letter to employees .
he called the alliance a " bold first step to implement " lessons learned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fiat chief sergio marchionne is upbeat about the merged company 's chances marchionne said earlier that the merged chrysler and fiat ranked as the world 's sixth largest automaker .
marchionne said fiat will begin the process of transferring fiat 's technology , platforms and powertrains to chrysler plants in the next few months .
the white house welcomed the completion of the deal and said the new alliance was " poised to emerge as a competitive , viable automaker . "
us court paves way for deal the deal 's completion came a day after the us supreme court lifted a stay on a lower court 's approval of the deal .
the court said a group of indiana pension funds opposed to the deal had failed to show " that the circumstances justify " delaying proceedings to accommodate their challenge .
the funds had argued that the white house-backed sale of chrysler to fiat is unconstitutional because it puts the rights of junior creditors ahead of the rights of senior lenders .
they also said the us treasury had overstepped its legal authority by using some $ 12 billion in financial bailout funds to reorganize chrysler when congress had intended the money for banks .
chrysler 's sale to fiat , a union-aligned trust and the us and canadian governments is aimed at pulling the company out of bankruptcy and reorganizing it to cope with changing economic conditions and consumer tastes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrysler may get a new life under fiat but it still needs to overcome past problems the court gave the transaction the green light after the government filed a brief warning that fiat could walk away from the chrysler deal if it was not finalized by june 15 .
" if fiat is released from the obligation to consummate the transaction as currently structured , it will be free to demand additional concessions before concluding a new agreement , " the justice dpartment brief said .
the statement said that because chrysler is not manufacturing cars , each day of bankruptcy was costing the company approximately $ 100 million .
chrysler filed for bankruptcy on april 30 and is seeking to re-emerge within the next 30 to 60 days .
its rapid turnaround plan is expected to serve as a precedent for general motors , which has filed for creditor protection as part of a plan that offloads its german subsidiary opel and gives the us government a majority stake in the new gm .
" cash for clunkers " bill approved meanwhile , the " cash for clunkers " bill , one of president obama 's consumer incentives for new car purchases , was approved by the house of representatives this week .
the bill aims to boost new car sales by allowing consumers to turn in their gas-guzzling cars and trucks for vouchers worth up to $ 4,500 toward more fuel-efficient vehicles . the measure is part of the obama 's administration 's efforts to stimulate car sales and increase the fleet of fuel-efficient vehicles on the nation 's highways . the us car industry has been searching for new incentives after months of poor car sale .
in may , overall auto sales were 34 percent lower than a year ago . sje / reuters / dpa / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the government says it needs more details before it can make a decision . the interior ministry said on thursday that it was unable to accept the us request based on the data provided .
" we 're examining two new cases , " ministry spokesman stefan paris said in berlin .
" the information provided by the united states is not sufficient for now for us to give the green light for taking in the two men . "
the interior ministry would need to check whether the prisoners represented a security risk , he said .
also , berlin needed to know why the men could not be taken in by the us and what ties they had to germany .
paris would not disclose the nationality of the two men .
security sources said one was syrian , the other tunisian .
resistance at home and abroad in april , the us made an initial request , presenting the german government with a list of nine chinese uighur detainees for berlin to " consider . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palau is offering 17 uighers a new temporary home interior minister wolfgang schaeuble had also replied in that case that the information provided was insufficient to warrant a positive reply .
us president barack obama has pledged to close the facility at the us naval base at guantanamo bay , cuba by early next year .
many of the inmates have already been cleared for release .
but us officials are having difficulty finding countries that will take them in , and meeting resistance at home to housing them on us soil .
the tiny pacific nation palau on agreed wednesday to take in up to 17 uighur guantanamo detainees .
four further uighur men who had been held at the prison camp were sent to bermuda on thursday .
sharp political debate german politicians have disagreed on the issue .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat candidate to challenge chancellor angela merkel in september 's federal election , has spoken in favor of accepting inmates .
but interior minister schaeuble has voiced skepticism .
on a visit to germany last week , obama said after talks with merkel that he had neither asked for nor received any hard commitments from berlin on taking guantanamo detainees .
he said merkel had been " very open " to discussions on the issue .
opposition politicians have been very critical of the government 's stance .
claudia roth , co-leader of the green party , said schaeuble was using " stalling tactics . "
" he 's acting on the maxim : we do n't know anything , we have to check things first , we have to deliberate so long until someone else takes this decision of our hands , " roth said in reference to the uighur case .
michael leutert , the human rights spokesman for the left party 's parliamentary group , said accepting the inmates was " a simple humanitarian act . "
" it is not plausible that two people proven innocent pose an uncalculated security risk for germany , " leutert said .
he said the german government needed to promptly " consider favorably " the us request. sac / afp / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no matter who wins , observers agree that it 's time for iran and the us to sit down at the negotiating table .
and the european union could act as a vital mediator . three candidates are running against iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is seeking a second term in friday 's presidential elections .
observers forecast that the reformists under former prime minister mir hossein mousavi have the best chances of beating ahmadinejad .
yet no matter who wins , the time has come for serious negotiations with the west regarding iran 's controversial nuclear program , said christian-peter hanelt , a middle east expert from the bertelsmann foundation .
" it is time for a rapprochement between iran , its neighbors and the west , " hanelt said .
" in order to pre-empt another confrontation in the middle east and further escalation as a result of the iranian nuclear program , american-iranian relations must be put on a sustainable footing after the iranian presidential elections . "
the european union could play a significant mediatory role in this process , said konstantin kosten , an expert on iran at the german council on foreign relations , dgap .
" the eu could certainly act as a bridge and door opener , " kosten said .
" direct contacts exist already with the iranian government and the most significant negotiating circles . "
the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana has been leading talks between iran and the so-called eu3 -lrb- referring to france , britain and germany -rrb- for years .
due to these contacts , eu officials could provide us diplomats with expertise and support .
us has full eu support the us administration has chosen a new path in its dealings with iran .
whereas former president george w. bush opted for confrontation , placing iran as part of its " axis of evil , " president barack obama is going for direct diplomacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uranium conversion facility in isfahan contributes to iran 's nuclear program in march , obama directly addressed the country 's leaders in a message to the iranian people on the occasion of nowruz , the iranian new year .
he offered tehran direct talks without any preconditions .
the us president has full backing from the eu , whose foreign ministers urged iran to take advantage of the change in us policy to seal a deal and end the stand-off over its nuclear ambitions .
" the eu warmly supports the new direction of us policy towards iran , which opens a window of opportunity for negotiations on all aspects of iran 's nuclear program and more broadly for engagement with iran , " the eu foreign ministers said in a statement in april .
washington can count on support by its european partners .
" the eu reaffirms its full and unequivocal support for efforts to find a negotiated long-term solution to the iranian nuclear issue , " the ministers said .
in addition to making it clear to tehran that the eu stands behind us policy , it 's also important to send signals of eu support to washington , said michael bauer , head of the middle east project at the center for applied policy research at the university of munich .
" there are not only proponents of this new policy towards iran in washington so i think a first step would be to essentially support the advocates and make clear to them that the european position clearly welcomes this willingness for talks , " bauer said .
compromise is necessary the main point of contention continues to be iran 's nuclear program and the country 's unwillingness to permit comprehensive and strict controls .
despite the eu 's repeated efforts to find a solution , negotiations have failed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's confrontational tone is popular among the rural poor hanelt said that only the us could provide the desired security guarantees for the territory of iran and recognition of its political system .
" for this reason , europe can now achieve more it if simply provides robust support for the us administration in its forthcoming rapprochement with tehran , " hanelt said .
bauer said iran wanted to be viewed as a " legitimate political actor " with the corresponding security guarantees .
" iran is first and foremost interested in recognition of its regime by the us , " bauer said .
" this is something the europeans ca n't offer . "
but iran was also in a strong position at the moment and its support was needed for positive developments in the region , he said .
" the us and barack obama will need iran to keep iraq stable , " bauer said .
" iran is needed to get a grip on the problems in afghanistan to some extent .
iran is an important player here . "
nuclear program will continue any hopes that iran will abandon its nuclear program are futile , though .
kosten said iran will want to remain at the helm when it comes to uranium enrichment and civilian use of nuclear power .
" the question is more whether a solution can be found which enables enrichment on iranian soil , " kosten said .
" there has to be an idea how iran can exercise its rights and therefore save face . "
even an attack by israel on iran 's nuclear facilities would put the program back by a few years , but would not stop it .
iran 's nuclear program as such is not up for discussion , bauer said .
" that has to be clear and i think it is to barack obama , " bauer said .
he said the west could at most hope to gain from iran a degree of transparency of its nuclear program through cooperation with the international atomic energy agency , which can ensure that it is a civilian nuclear program .
a turning point in iran the iranian people are considered to be among the most pro-western in the middle east .
and many , especially younger people , are fed up with ahmadinejad 's confrontational tone .
mousavi supporters have been taking to tehran 's streets for nightly demonstrations to express their discontent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mousavi supporter shows where he stands ruprecht polenz , chairman of the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee , said ahmadinejad 's defeat would mean a lot for the future of young iranians .
" when you consider what needs to happen so that the economic situation improves , so that all the young people who finish university each year really have an opportunity to find a good job , then economic reform is necessary , " polenz said .
" more intense trade relations are necessary especially with developed nations , such as european countries . "
but this requires iran to change its confrontational foreign policy and focus on cooperation , he said .
ultimately , though , the real power in iran is held by its supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei .
" indeed the ayatollah is the central player in iran 's political system , even when it comes to such matters like the nuclear program , " bauer said .
" in the end , the compromise will have to be made with the revolutionary leader . "

help the aged in wales and age concern cymru said it planned to review the issue and would launch the action if there was enough support .
it comes as 93 % of 1,330 welsh adults said they wanted a new law to protect the elderly from abuse and neglect .
scotland has passed a similar law .
the deputy older people 's commissioner for wales said she would back a law .
a uk government survey in 2007 found that older people in wales were more likely to face abuse than in any other uk nation .
the two-year study revealed thousands of older people are being physically , sexually or psychologically abused , usually by their own relatives .
help the aged in wales and age concern cymru - which recently merged - said it was particularly concerned about the rising problem of financial scamming , which has increased during the recession .
there is a public consensus in wales that assertive action is needed to protect older people from mistreatment robert taylor , help the aged in wales and age concern cymru louise hughes , who works on the charity 's elder abuse project , which aims to promote the support and services available for abused elderly people , said legislation could help the problem .
" it 's important that people have something that has legislative backing so if someone 's being abused , they will have protection , " she said .
" although it has to be a combination of things - legislation wo n't solve the problem by itself .
it has to be part of a system that incorporates robust guidelines and access to adequate support services . "
' demoralises and demeans ' the charity is hosting a two-day national conference in ewloe , flintshire , where abuse issues will be discussed .
chief executive robert taylor said the research showed people in wales " are not prepared to tolerate elder abuse " .

exports fell 26.4 % from the same month earlier , more than february 's previous record drop .
as the downturn has also affected china , and its imports have also declined .
they dropped by 25.2 % in may .
as a result , china 's trade surplus , the difference between what it exports and imports , narrowed by 33 % to $ 13.4bn from the same month last year .
this might mean that the politically sensitive trade gap with the us has narrowed .
china did not report separate figures for its us trade , but the us figures for the previous month showed the trade gap was still growing .
on wednesday , the us said its trade deficit has widened for the second straight month in april .
the deficit with china widened by 7.3 % to $ 16.8bn.
in the past , the us has accused china of boosting exports by keeping its currency , the yuan , artificially low .
separately , a state news agency said that china 's investment in fixed assets - such as factories and real estate - surged 32.9 % in the first five months of the year from the same period last year .
the government has begun spending some of its $ 586bn stimulus package announced last december to boost domestic demand as exports dropped .

when landsbanki and other banks went under they took nearly £ 1bn of investments from over 100 authorities .
the communities and local government select committee says complacency , lack of expertise and inaction all helped put taxpayers ' money at risk .
but a group representing councils said that they had received poor advice .
since 2004 , councils have been able to regulate their own borrowing and investment .
rules state they can only put money in institutions with high credit ratings , they must invest in sterling and it must mature within a year .
councils were warned in late september 2008 of changes in credit ratings for icelandic banks , before the country 's financial sector collapsed the following month , but some still invested after september .
the government welcomed the report and stressed that no council has cut services or raised council tax because of the investments .
" it is right that councils continue to make responsible investments of taxpayers ' money , " a spokesperson for communities and local government said .
" but the report also makes clear councils need further support in making investment decisions . "
advisers criticised some of the warning signs emerged as far back as 2006 , the committee said , and while a number of councils acted on them and withdrew their money , others did not .
some councils , it said , relied too much on credit rating agencies without any interpretation of the data and there was evidence that many staff lacked training or expertise in how to handle investments .
our inquiry has exposed a significant level of misunderstanding , misinformation and complacency dr phyllis starkey , committee chairman but what caused the mps most concern were some of the paid treasury advisers - outside bodies which act as middlemen between credit rating agencies and councils .
the committee says they found a discrepancy between what they said they offered and what they provide in practice .
some said they were offering information only , others that they gave direct advice about investments .
" unsurprisingly , there 's some confusion among councils about what they can and should expect from these advisers , " the report says .
' no excuse ' the committee also said that councils ' position was made worse by poor management of finances .
" while few predicted the events that shook the financial system last year , their exceptional nature provides no excuse for the substantial failures that occurred in local authority financial arrangements , " said dr phyllis starkey , who chaired the committee .
" our inquiry has exposed a significant level of misunderstanding , misinformation and complacency - not just within local authorities , but also among those who provide them with specialist investment advice . "
this report clearly shows that councils were largely let down by the organisations that they were relying on to provide up-to-date and accurate advice richard kemp , local goverment association the mps even criticise the spending watchdog the audit commission , which itself invested £ 10m in icelandic banks , for failing to issue rigorous enough guidelines for the financial climate at the time .
but the commission 's chief executive steve bundred , said : " the commission continues to acknowledge mistakes were made in the management of its own deposits with icelandic banks but rejects the view that it should have issued stronger guidance to auditors before the banks failed . "
however , the commission agreed that safeguards should be re-examined .
meanwhile the local government association says many councils have already overhauled their investment procedures and have moved their money to less risky areas including government bonds .
after lengthy talks with bank administrators , councils expect to get up to 90 % of their money back , although it is a process that could take up to several years .
recommendations local authorities should still be able to decide where they invest their funds , the report found .
however , it came up with a string of recommendations , including : better information and advice needed to be provided to councils ' treasury departments on where to invest more scrutiny of investment decisions , with an emphasis on security ahead of liquidity and profit adequate training for local authority staff and all councils to have an audit committee auditors of councils should focus more on their treasury management the committee also called for a fresh examination of the role played by advisers to treasury departments , including a full investigation by the city watchdog - the financial services authority - into these advisers ' services and potential conflicts of interest .
the local government association -lrb- lga -rrb- also blamed the advice handed out to councils .
iceland was at the centre of a financial meltdown " this report clearly shows that councils were largely let down by the organisations that they were relying on to provide up-to-date and accurate advice , " said councillor richard kemp , vice chairman of the lga .
" failings across the entire system have affected not just councils but also other parts of the public sector as well as charities , businesses and individual savers . "
" many local authorities have already overhauled the way that they invest and accept things need to be done differently in the future , but these investments have generated hundreds of millions of pounds every year that go towards keeping council tax down and frontline services in place . "

when landsbanki and other banks went under they took nearly £ 1bn of investments from over 100 authorities .
the communities and local government select committee says complacency , lack of expertise and inaction all helped put taxpayers ' money at risk .
but a group representing councils said that they had received poor advice .
since 2004 , councils have been able to regulate their own borrowing and investment .
rules state they can only put money in institutions with high credit ratings , they must invest in sterling and it must mature within a year .
councils were warned in late september 2008 of changes in credit ratings for icelandic banks , before the country 's financial sector collapsed the following month , but some still invested after september .
the government welcomed the report and stressed that no council has cut services or raised council tax because of the investments .
" it is right that councils continue to make responsible investments of taxpayers ' money , " a spokesperson for communities and local government said .
" but the report also makes clear councils need further support in making investment decisions . "
advisers criticised some of the warning signs emerged as far back as 2006 , the committee said , and while a number of councils acted on them and withdrew their money , others did not .
some councils , it said , relied too much on credit rating agencies without any interpretation of the data and there was evidence that many staff lacked training or expertise in how to handle investments .
our inquiry has exposed a significant level of misunderstanding , misinformation and complacency dr phyllis starkey , committee chairman but what caused the mps most concern were some of the paid treasury advisers - outside bodies which act as middlemen between credit rating agencies and councils .
the committee says they found a discrepancy between what they said they offered and what they provide in practice .
some said they were offering information only , others that they gave direct advice about investments .
" unsurprisingly , there 's some confusion among councils about what they can and should expect from these advisers , " the report says .
' no excuse ' the committee also said that councils ' position was made worse by poor management of finances .
" while few predicted the events that shook the financial system last year , their exceptional nature provides no excuse for the substantial failures that occurred in local authority financial arrangements , " said dr phyllis starkey , who chaired the committee .
" our inquiry has exposed a significant level of misunderstanding , misinformation and complacency - not just within local authorities , but also among those who provide them with specialist investment advice . "
this report clearly shows that councils were largely let down by the organisations that they were relying on to provide up-to-date and accurate advice richard kemp , local goverment association the mps even criticise the spending watchdog the audit commission , which itself invested £ 10m in icelandic banks , for failing to issue rigorous enough guidelines for the financial climate at the time .
but the commission 's chief executive steve bundred , said : " the commission continues to acknowledge mistakes were made in the management of its own deposits with icelandic banks but rejects the view that it should have issued stronger guidance to auditors before the banks failed . "
however , the commission agreed that safeguards should be re-examined .
meanwhile the local government association says many councils have already overhauled their investment procedures and have moved their money to less risky areas including government bonds .
after lengthy talks with bank administrators , councils expect to get up to 90 % of their money back , although it is a process that could take up to several years .
recommendations local authorities should still be able to decide where they invest their funds , the report found .
however , it came up with a string of recommendations , including : better information and advice needed to be provided to councils ' treasury departments on where to invest more scrutiny of investment decisions , with an emphasis on security ahead of liquidity and profit adequate training for local authority staff and all councils to have an audit committee auditors of councils should focus more on their treasury management the committee also called for a fresh examination of the role played by advisers to treasury departments , including a full investigation by the city watchdog - the financial services authority - into these advisers ' services and potential conflicts of interest .

" failings across the entire system have affected not just councils but also other parts of the public sector as well as charities , businesses and individual savers . "

when landsbanki and other banks went under they took nearly £ 1bn of investments from over 100 authorities .
the communities and local government select committee says complacency , lack of expertise and inaction all helped put taxpayers ' money at risk .
but a group representing councils said that they had received poor advice .
since 2004 , councils have been able to regulate their own borrowing and investment .
rules state they can only put money in institutions with high credit ratings , they must invest in sterling and it must mature within a year .
councils were warned in late september 2008 of changes in credit ratings for icelandic banks , before the country 's financial sector collapsed the following month , but some still invested after september .
the government welcomed the report and stressed that no council has cut services or raised council tax because of the investments .
" it is right that councils continue to make responsible investments of taxpayers ' money , " a spokesperson for communities and local government said .
" but the report also makes clear councils need further support in making investment decisions . "
advisers criticised some of the warning signs emerged as far back as 2006 , the committee said , and while a number of councils acted on them and withdrew their money , others did not .
some councils , it said , relied too much on credit rating agencies without any interpretation of the data and there was evidence that many staff lacked training or expertise in how to handle investments . "
our inquiry has exposed a significant level of misunderstanding , misinformation and complacency " dr phyllis starkey , committee chairman but what caused the mps most concern were some of the paid treasury advisers - outside bodies which act as middlemen between credit rating agencies and councils .
the committee says they found a discrepancy between what they said they offered and what they provide in practice .
some said they were offering information only , others that they gave direct advice about investments .
" unsurprisingly , there 's some confusion among councils about what they can and should expect from these advisers , " the report says .
' no excuse ' the committee also said that councils ' position was made worse by poor management of finances .
" while few predicted the events that shook the financial system last year , their exceptional nature provides no excuse for the substantial failures that occurred in local authority financial arrangements , " said dr phyllis starkey , who chaired the committee .
" our inquiry has exposed a significant level of misunderstanding , misinformation and complacency - not just within local authorities , but also among those who provide them with specialist investment advice . "
" this report clearly shows that councils were largely let down by the organisations that they were relying on to provide up-to-date and accurate advice " richard kemp , local goverment association the mps even criticise the spending watchdog the audit commission , which itself invested £ 10m in icelandic banks , for failing to issue rigorous enough guidelines for the financial climate at the time .
but the commission 's chief executive steve bundred , said : " the commission continues to acknowledge mistakes were made in the management of its own deposits with icelandic banks but rejects the view that it should have issued stronger guidance to auditors before the banks failed . "
however , the commission agreed that safeguards should be re-examined .
meanwhile the local government association says many councils have already overhauled their investment procedures and have moved their money to less risky areas including government bonds .
after lengthy talks with bank administrators , councils expect to get up to 90 % of their money back , although it is a process that could take up to several years .
recommendations local authorities should still be able to decide where they invest their funds , the report found .
however , it came up with a string of recommendations , including : better information and advice needed to be provided to councils ' treasury departments on where to invest more scrutiny of investment decisions , with an emphasis on security ahead of liquidity and profit adequate training for local authority staff and all councils to have an audit committee auditors of councils should focus more on their treasury management the committee also called for a fresh examination of the role played by advisers to treasury departments , including a full investigation by the city watchdog - the financial services authority - into these advisers ' services and potential conflicts of interest .
the local government association -lrb- lga -rrb- also blamed the advice handed out to councils .
" this report clearly shows that councils were largely let down by the organisations that they were relying on to provide up-to-date and accurate advice , " said councillor richard kemp , vice chairman of the lga .
" failings across the entire system have affected not just councils but also other parts of the public sector as well as charities , businesses and individual savers . "
" many local authorities have already overhauled the way that they invest and accept things need to be done differently in the future , but these investments have generated hundreds of millions of pounds every year that go towards keeping council tax down and frontline services in place . "
a recent treasury select committee report said that charities in the uk that lost millions of pounds when the icelandic banking system collapsed should get a bail-out from the government , but local authorities should not be compensated .
