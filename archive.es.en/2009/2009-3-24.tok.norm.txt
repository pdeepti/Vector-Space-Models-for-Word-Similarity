a longstanding conflict has been the result - and reflects the situation in the country at large . belgium has been experiencing an ongoing political crisis for years .
rival parties are unable to reach agreement over the division of power and wealth between the richer , dutch-speaking province of flanders and the poorer , french-speaking region of wallonia . the country 's previous prime minister yves leterme failed in his efforts to decentralize power to the two regions in order to ease tensions between the flemish and the walloons .
it had meant amending the belgian constitution and leterme was unable to accomplish this . the new government under prime minister herman van rompuy , who took office at the end of 2008 , has been more concerned with the worldwide financial crisis . however , this paralysis over devolution is not really impacting most belgians , as stephen castle , a brussels-based journalist points out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's two regions also differ economically " this political crisis has been going on for a very long time , " castle says .
" frankly , people are used to it and possibly , apart from the politicians themselves are bored of it . " according to castle , even a paralyzed central government does n't really impact people 's day-to-day lives . " education continues , schools are open , hospitals are open , the garbage is cleared , " he says .
" from the practical point of view of most people , there really is very little impact . " not too worried namur is the capital of the french-speaking part of belgium , the region of wallonia .
at the central station , 30-year-old jean-francois says he has grown up with constant talk that belgium has no real future . " i 've heard this rumor since i was very little , " jean-francois says .
" belgium might disintegrate , but maybe people are seeing ghosts .
belgium has had an artificial side to it since its very beginnings . " jean-francois says he thinks the country could live like this for many years to come . " i think there are more serious problems than that , " he says . brussels must be resolved belgium is currently in the so-called sixth phase of a far-reaching political reform .
the process was started in the 1970s when the unitary belgian state became a federal state .
but here the division between regional politicians from the two sides goes deeper than they would in other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can van rompuy find a solution ?
" in order to make your name as a politician in belgium , you have to do that in your own community first , " castle says .
" if you 're , for example , a flemish politician like leterme , you really win no votes among your own core supporters by saying nice things about the francophone population in the south . " luc arnould is in charge of international relations at the city hall of namur .
he says that the country is n't likely to split unless the issue of brussels is resolved .
and he does n't see that happening anytime soon .
most people in the capital speak french but belong to the dutch-speaking part of the country . " we have to adapt the constitution and the way of working in belgium , but giving more and more autonomy to the regions , " arnould says .
" regions want to have more independence to organize their economies .
but there 's always the problem of brussels .
we need a lot of imagination to find a solution . " division remains a possibility many flemish people in brussels have no problem with living side by side with walloons .
bilingualism is a reality here in people 's daily lives , says this brussels native . " we speak both languages every day - french and dutch and english , " the man says .
" so there are no problems between the people here .
and in ten years ' time , the next generation will speak both languages all across belgium . " but the government turmoil has proven there is a problem between belgium 's communities on a political level .
journalist castle says partition remains a possibility , although it 's not likely anytime soon . " it would make it more difficult for belgium to be the center of the european union if it divided , " castle says .
" that would send a very poor message to a lot of countries which also have issues over devolution and how to divide up power .
i think there 's a general consensus that belgians are probably better off . " further devolution of power will be a long and arduous process .
but belgium 's politicians are used to treading warily when it comes to negotiating greater rights for their communities .
and that caution might stave off the breakup of belgium . nina haase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" " the air strikes have not solved problems in kosovo , and did not help to bring peace and the rule of law , " cvetkovic said at a special meeting of the cabinet to commemorate the attacks .
" on the contrary , they resulted in ethnic cleansing and gross violations of human rights , international standards and fresh tensions . " the alliance 's action , which was not sanctioned by the united nations security council , undermined milosevic 's power and is largely thought to have played a major role in his being sent to the hague to stand trial for war crimes .
he died in 2006 before the court could issue a verdict in his case . a necessary war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke has no regrets over the nato campaign western leaders saw nato 's air war , dubbed operation allied force , as the only way to end the 1998-1999 violent crackdown by milosevic 's forces on the kosovo liberation army and its supporters . " i look back on that extraordinary last meeting with milosevic , with a feeling that what we did was necessary and the right thing to do , " richard holbrooke , who served as the united states special envoy to the balkans , told reporters on saturday . " the people of kosovo are better off than they were as part of serbia , and serbia is better off facing the future rather than working back to a mythic past , " he added . then us president bill clinton also said at the time that the west had a " moral imperative " to take action against milosevic . the north atlantic treaty organization , in what was its largest military operation , set out to destroy dozens of targets .
in its 78 days of bombing , however , it also hit public infrastructure like bridges and railway tracks as well as homes , refugee convoys , a hospital and the chinese embassy in belgrade . human rights watch has estimated that about 500 civilians lost their lives during the bombing campaign , five times less than the yugoslav government claimed at the time . diverging views of war in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbs and kosovo albanians have very different feelings about nato 's intervention for ethnic albanians in kosovo , where they accounted for 90 percent of the region 's population despite being a minority in serbia overall , the war put a welcome end to their suffering at the hands of the serbian majority . " the appearance of combat airplanes in the sky above kosovo was a message of salvation for the people here , " kosovo justice minister nekibe kelmendi told afp . but for the serb minority , the campaign marked the beginning of their agony . " it was revenge for serbian disobedience , " said radoslav radovic , a 57-year-old from the serb-run half of kosovska mitrovica , a northern town that still simmers with ethnic tensions . radovic told afp he believes the west declared serbia guilty for " defending its integrity and its territory . " fearing ethnic albanian reprisals , tens of thousands of kosovo serbs fled their homes for serbia proper , with only a handful returning in the past decade .

" rasmussen was at the head of the list for the former bush administration , just as he is for the current obama administration , " analyst daniel korski said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish caricatures inflamed passions in the muslim world " the americans want someone who will continue to push for military engagement in afghanistan , " he said , pointing out that denmark has some 750 soldiers stationed in the volatile southern part of the country where the taliban insurgency is most active . us and european support however does not guarantee that rasmussen will become the appointed successor to scheffer . turkish opposition possible the main snag to rasmussen 's nomination , which needs to be approved by all members of the 26-nation alliance , is possible opposition to his candidacy from turkey , a secular nation that is predominantly muslim . denmark had outraged muslims around the world in 2005 when the widely circulated jyllands-posten newspaper published a series of cartoon caricatures depicting the prophet muhammad as a terrorist . rasmussen , who has been prime minister since 2001 , had refused to apologize for the cartoons invoking the right of the press to freedom of expression .
the controversial cartoons , which were later republished by media around the globe , had sparked riots and attacks on danish embassies in the muslim world . cartoon controversy " the cartoon crisis has a larger dimension than just turkey , " a turkish official , who requested anonymity , told reuters .
" at a time when nato is going to assume added responsibility in afghanistan and pakistan , having a secretary general with such an objectionable approach to billions of muslims , is not the right approach to the muslim world . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's foreign minister -lrb- right -rrb- is an unlikely candidate turkey has also attacked denmark for failing to revoke the broadcasting license of a television station that ankara has accused of being a mouthpiece for kurdish rebels opposed to the government .
adding fuel to the fire , rasmussen had publicly stated in 2003 that he opposed full eu membership for turkey . " it may come to the veto , " retuers quoted the anonymous official as saying .
" we will have to see . " the chances for other candidates for nato 's number two position , however , are dwindling . polish candidate viewed as antagonistic to russia polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski was rumored to be a favorite for secretary general post , but the appointment of a pro-american polish national is viewed as antagonizing russia at a time when nato is seeking better relations with the kremlin . russia has been bitterly opposed to the deployment of a us anti-missile defense shield on polish territory . turkey had favored a canadian for the post , since ottawa supports ankara 's bid to join the eu .
however canadian defense minister peter mackay ruled himself out as a candidate on sunday . canadian ruled out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer 's successor should be announced at nato summit mackay 's rumored candidacy had the apparent support of us vice president joe biden as a reward for canada 's role in combat missions in dangerous southern afghanistan .
his spokesman , however , told reporters that the canadian never sought the post even though biden had downplayed an unwritten rule that the secretary general come from a european nation in exchange for nato 's top military post going to an american . the choice for the number two position as secretary general is expected to be named at the april 3-4 nato summit , but getting turkey to agree to the choice of rasmussen would be the key . df / sms / afp / reuters / send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" rasmussen was at the head of the list for the former bush administration , just as he is for the current obama administration , " analyst daniel korski said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish caricatures inflamed passions in the muslim world " the americans want someone who will continue to push for military engagement in afghanistan , " he said , pointing out that denmark has some 750 soldiers stationed in the volatile southern part of the country where the taliban insurgency is most active . us and european support however does not guarantee that rasmussen will become the appointed successor to scheffer . turkish opposition possible the main snag to rasmussen 's nomination , which needs to be approved by all members of the 26-nation alliance , is possible opposition to his candidacy from turkey , a secular nation that is predominantly muslim . denmark had outraged muslims around the world in 2005 when the widely circulated jyllands-posten newspaper published a series of cartoon caricatures depicting the prophet muhammad as a terrorist . rasmussen , who has been prime minister since 2001 , had refused to apologize for the cartoons invoking the right of the press to freedom of expression .
the controversial cartoons , which were later republished by media around the globe , had sparked riots and attacks on danish embassies in the muslim world . cartoon controversy " the cartoon crisis has a larger dimension than just turkey , " a turkish official , who requested anonymity , told reuters .
" at a time when nato is going to assume added responsibility in afghanistan and pakistan , having a secretary general with such an objectionable approach to billions of muslims , is not the right approach to the muslim world . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's foreign minister -lrb- right -rrb- is an unlikely candidate turkey has also attacked denmark for failing to revoke the broadcasting license of a television station that ankara has accused of being a mouthpiece for kurdish rebels opposed to the government .
adding fuel to the fire , rasmussen had publicly stated in 2003 that he opposed full eu membership for turkey . " it may come to the veto , " retuers quoted the anonymous official as saying .
" we will have to see . " the chances for other candidates for nato 's number two position , however , are dwindling . polish candidate viewed as antagonistic to russia polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski was rumored to be a favorite for secretary general post , but the appointment of a pro-american polish national is viewed as antagonizing russia at a time when nato is seeking better relations with the kremlin . russia has been bitterly opposed to the deployment of a us anti-missile defense shield on polish territory . turkey had favored a canadian for the post , since ottawa supports ankara 's bid to join the eu .

" " the air strikes have not solved problems in kosovo , and did not help to bring peace and the rule of law , " cvetkovic said at a special meeting of the cabinet to commemorate the attacks .
" on the contrary , they resulted in ethnic cleansing and gross violations of human rights , international standards and fresh tensions . " the alliance 's action , which was not sanctioned by the united nations security council , undermined milosevic 's power and is largely thought to have played a major role in his being sent to the hague to stand trial for war crimes .
he died in 2006 before the court could issue a verdict in his case . a necessary war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke has no regrets over the nato campaign western leaders saw nato 's air war , dubbed operation allied force , as the only way to end the 1998-1999 violent crackdown by milosevic 's forces on the kosovo liberation army and its supporters . " i look back on that extraordinary last meeting with milosevic , with a feeling that what we did was necessary and the right thing to do , " richard holbrooke , who served as the united states special envoy to the balkans , told reporters on saturday . " the people of kosovo are better off than they were as part of serbia , and serbia is better off facing the future rather than working back to a mythic past , " he added . then us president bill clinton also said at the time that the west had a " moral imperative " to take action against milosevic . the north atlantic treaty organization , in what was its largest military operation , set out to destroy dozens of targets .
in its 78 days of bombing , however , it also hit public infrastructure like bridges and railway tracks as well as homes , refugee convoys , a hospital and the chinese embassy in belgrade . human rights watch has estimated that about 500 civilians lost their lives during the bombing campaign , five times less than the yugoslav government claimed at the time . diverging views of war in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbs and kosovo albanians have very different feelings about nato 's intervention for ethnic albanians in kosovo , where they accounted for 90 percent of the region 's population despite being a minority in serbia overall , the war put a welcome end to their suffering at the hands of the serbian majority . " the appearance of combat airplanes in the sky above kosovo was a message of salvation for the people here , " kosovo justice minister nekibe kelmendi told afp . but for the serb minority , the campaign marked the beginning of their agony . " it was revenge for serbian disobedience , " said radoslav radovic , a 57-year-old from the serb-run half of kosovska mitrovica , a northern town that still simmers with ethnic tensions . radovic told afp he believes the west declared serbia guilty for " defending its integrity and its territory . " fearing ethnic albanian reprisals , tens of thousands of kosovo serbs fled their homes for serbia proper , with only a handful returning in the past decade .
of the 120,000 ethnic serbs estimated in kosovo , most live in the northern region that borders serbia or in small enclaves in southern areas . tensions run high after independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many kosovo serbs are still living in refugee camps in serbia proper tensions have remained high , especially since kosovo 's parliament unilaterally seceded from serbia in february 2008 , a move that has been recognized by 56 nations including the united states and most of the european union . officially , the united nations remains in charge of kosovo .
the 15-nation security council has not been able to alter the un mandate because its members are split over what to do with the un presence there and the legality of pristina 's declaration of independence . russia , a permanent veto-wielding member of the security council and serbia 's ally , has said it would not recognize an independent kosovo and has supported belgrade 's bid to challenge the declaration before the international court of justice in the hague . under a plan agreed to last year , police , customs officers and judges in the serb-run areas of kosovo remain under the un umbrella , known as unmik , while their albanian counterparts work with a european union police and justice mission called eulex . many kosovo albanians have come to view the un presence as an obstacle to independence , un secretary-general ban ki-moon said in a report published thursday . " there is a perception among many kosovo albanians that the mission 's tasks have been accomplished and its continued presence is an unwelcome obstacle to the desire for kosovo to function as a sovereign state , " ban said in his latest report to the security council on un activities in kosovo . ban 's report did not make recommendations on how to move forward as uncertainty in the region appears likely to continue . sms / tt / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a longstanding conflict has been the result - and reflects the situation in the country at large . belgium has been experiencing an ongoing political crisis for years .
rival parties are unable to reach agreement over the division of power and wealth between the richer , dutch-speaking province of flanders and the poorer , french-speaking region of wallonia . the country 's previous prime minister yves leterme failed in his efforts to decentralize power to the two regions in order to ease tensions between the flemish and the walloons .
it had meant amending the belgian constitution and leterme was unable to accomplish this . the new government under prime minister herman van rompuy , who took office at the end of 2008 , has been more concerned with the worldwide financial crisis . however , this paralysis over devolution is not really impacting most belgians , as stephen castle , a brussels-based journalist points out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's two regions also differ economically " this political crisis has been going on for a very long time , " castle says .
" frankly , people are used to it and possibly , apart from the politicians themselves are bored of it . " according to castle , even a paralyzed central government does n't really impact people 's day-to-day lives . " education continues , schools are open , hospitals are open , the garbage is cleared , " he says .
" from the practical point of view of most people , there really is very little impact . " not too worried namur is the capital of the french-speaking part of belgium , the region of wallonia .
at the central station , 30-year-old jean-francois says he has grown up with constant talk that belgium has no real future . " i 've heard this rumor since i was very little , " jean-francois says .
" belgium might disintegrate , but maybe people are seeing ghosts .
belgium has had an artificial side to it since its very beginnings . " jean-francois says he thinks the country could live like this for many years to come . " i think there are more serious problems than that , " he says . brussels must be resolved belgium is currently in the so-called sixth phase of a far-reaching political reform .
the process was started in the 1970s when the unitary belgian state became a federal state .
but here the division between regional politicians from the two sides goes deeper than they would in other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can van rompuy find a solution ?
" in order to make your name as a politician in belgium , you have to do that in your own community first , " castle says .
" if you 're , for example , a flemish politician like leterme , you really win no votes among your own core supporters by saying nice things about the francophone population in the south . " luc arnould is in charge of international relations at the city hall of namur .
he says that the country is n't likely to split unless the issue of brussels is resolved .

" " the air strikes have not solved problems in kosovo , and did not help to bring peace and the rule of law , " cvetkovic said at a special meeting of the cabinet to commemorate the attacks .
" on the contrary , they resulted in ethnic cleansing and gross violations of human rights , international standards and fresh tensions . " the alliance 's action , which was not sanctioned by the united nations security council , undermined milosevic 's power and is largely thought to have played a major role in his being sent to the hague to stand trial for war crimes .

" i look back on that extraordinary last meeting with milosevic , with a feeling that what we did was necessary and the right thing to do , " richard holbrooke , who served as the united states special envoy to the balkans , told reporters on saturday . " the people of kosovo are better off than they were as part of serbia , and serbia is better off facing the future rather than working back to a mythic past , " he added . then us president bill clinton also said at the time that the west had a " moral imperative " to take action against milosevic . the north atlantic treaty organization , in what was its largest military operation , set out to destroy dozens of targets .
in its 78 days of bombing , however , it also hit public infrastructure like bridges and railway tracks as well as homes , refugee convoys , a hospital and the chinese embassy in belgrade . human rights watch has estimated that about 500 civilians lost their lives during the bombing campaign , five times less than the yugoslav government claimed at the time . diverging views of war in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbs and kosovo albanians have very different feelings about nato 's intervention for ethnic albanians in kosovo , where they accounted for 90 percent of the region 's population despite being a minority in serbia overall , the war put a welcome end to their suffering at the hands of the serbian majority . " the appearance of combat airplanes in the sky above kosovo was a message of salvation for the people here , " kosovo justice minister nekibe kelmendi told afp . but for the serb minority , the campaign marked the beginning of their agony . " it was revenge for serbian disobedience , " said radoslav radovic , a 57-year-old from the serb-run half of kosovska mitrovica , a northern town that still simmers with ethnic tensions . radovic told afp he believes the west declared serbia guilty for " defending its integrity and its territory . " fearing ethnic albanian reprisals , tens of thousands of kosovo serbs fled their homes for serbia proper , with only a handful returning in the past decade .

a longstanding conflict has been the result - and reflects the situation in the country at large . belgium has been experiencing an ongoing political crisis for years .
rival parties are unable to reach agreement over the division of power and wealth between the richer , dutch-speaking province of flanders and the poorer , french-speaking region of wallonia . the country 's previous prime minister yves leterme failed in his efforts to decentralize power to the two regions in order to ease tensions between the flemish and the walloons .
it had meant amending the belgian constitution and leterme was unable to accomplish this . the new government under prime minister herman van rompuy , who took office at the end of 2008 , has been more concerned with the worldwide financial crisis . however , this paralysis over devolution is not really impacting most belgians , as stephen castle , a brussels-based journalist points out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's two regions also differ economically " this political crisis has been going on for a very long time , " castle says .
" frankly , people are used to it and possibly , apart from the politicians themselves are bored of it . " according to castle , even a paralyzed central government does n't really impact people 's day-to-day lives . " education continues , schools are open , hospitals are open , the garbage is cleared , " he says .
" from the practical point of view of most people , there really is very little impact . " not too worried namur is the capital of the french-speaking part of belgium , the region of wallonia .
at the central station , 30-year-old jean-francois says he has grown up with constant talk that belgium has no real future . " i 've heard this rumor since i was very little , " jean-francois says .
" belgium might disintegrate , but maybe people are seeing ghosts .
belgium has had an artificial side to it since its very beginnings . " jean-francois says he thinks the country could live like this for many years to come . " i think there are more serious problems than that , " he says . brussels must be resolved belgium is currently in the so-called sixth phase of a far-reaching political reform .
the process was started in the 1970s when the unitary belgian state became a federal state .
but here the division between regional politicians from the two sides goes deeper than they would in other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can van rompuy find a solution ?
" in order to make your name as a politician in belgium , you have to do that in your own community first , " castle says .
" if you 're , for example , a flemish politician like leterme , you really win no votes among your own core supporters by saying nice things about the francophone population in the south . " luc arnould is in charge of international relations at the city hall of namur .
he says that the country is n't likely to split unless the issue of brussels is resolved .
and he does n't see that happening anytime soon .
most people in the capital speak french but belong to the dutch-speaking part of the country . " we have to adapt the constitution and the way of working in belgium , but giving more and more autonomy to the regions , " arnould says .
" regions want to have more independence to organize their economies .
but there 's always the problem of brussels .

he says that the country is n't likely to split unless the issue of brussels is resolved .

most people in the capital speak french but belong to the dutch-speaking part of the country . " we have to adapt the constitution and the way of working in belgium , but giving more and more autonomy to the regions , " arnould says .

we need a lot of imagination to find a solution . " division remains a possibility many flemish people in brussels have no problem with living side by side with walloons .
bilingualism is a reality here in people 's daily lives , says this brussels native . " we speak both languages every day - french and dutch and english , " the man says .
" so there are no problems between the people here .

journalist castle says partition remains a possibility , although it 's not likely anytime soon . " it would make it more difficult for belgium to be the center of the european union if it divided , " castle says .
" that would send a very poor message to a lot of countries which also have issues over devolution and how to divide up power .

a longstanding conflict has been the result - and reflects the situation in the country at large . belgium has been experiencing an ongoing political crisis for years .

experts say the economy will contract by up to 7 percent , and push unemployment up to 4.75 million by the end of 2010 . germany 's commerzbank has warned that the economic downturn will have a harsher effect on the country 's development than predicted at the start of the year . joerg kraemer , chief economist at commerzbank , told the berliner zeitung that in light of plunging order intakes among german companies , germany 's economy would shrink by as much as 7 percent this year . the number of unemployed can be expected to grow by more than 1.5 million within a two-year period , kraemer said , adding that by the end of 2010 , germany will be nearing the 5 million mark .
currently , some 3.5 million germans are registered as unemployed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a million more germans may have to update their resumes by 2010 , one expert said the nation 's gdp could contract by 4 percent to 4.5 percent this year , according to an internal economics ministry report cited by the bild newspaper on tuesday , march 24 .

" the attack on our country was illegal , contrary to international law , without a decision by the united nations " security council , prime minister mirko cvetkovic told a special commemorative sitting of his cabinet .
" the air strikes have not solved problems in kosovo , and did not help to bring peace and the rule of law .
" they resulted in ethnic cleansing and gross violations of human rights , international standards and fresh tensions , " he said , after schools held a minute 's silence before class .
kosovo leaders said however the nato bombing stopped serbian abuses in their breakaway territory and was a decisive step towards saving and freeing its people .
" the 78 days of strikes saved the people of kosovo from planned extermination , a scenario which was prepared coldly by the highest serb political and academic circles , " kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said .
kosovo prime minister hashim thaci described the bombing as " a big historic event for kosovo and the democratic world . "
" the successful completion of the campaign of intervention by nato opened a new chapter in the history of kosovo , a chapter of freedom , " said thaci .
anniversary of campaign to stop milosevic nato launched the strikes on march 24 , 1999 after milosevic refused to sign up to a peace deal to end his forces ' crackdown on the rebel kosovo liberation army -lrb- kla -rrb- and the ethnic albanian majority in the southern territory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic ordered a crackdown on kosovo 's rebels it set out to destroy military targets , and went on to strike infrastructure and the milosevic propaganda machine .
some strikes went astray , hitting scores of civilian sites and even china 's embassy in belgrade .
milosevic eventually conceded 78 days later , paving the way for nato to enter kosovo .
some 15,000 nato-led peacekeepers remain in kosovo , which 56 nations recognize after its ethnic albanian-dominated parliament declared unilateral independence from serbia 13 months ago .
as part of serbian commemorations , the bells of orthodox churches were to be tolled for the victims at 7:45 pm -lrb- 1845 gmt -rrb- - the moment nato 's first attacks were launched 10 years ago .
wounds still open in serbia separately , a hard-line nationalist group planned to stage an anti-nato rally in the main square of belgrade , according to posters that have gone up around serbia 's capital .

" serbs got bombs , the albanians got a state , " the daily blic said in its report .
belgrade contends that nato , by acting without a un mandate and by bombing civilian targets and using controversial ordnance , broke international laws because it was biased in favor of albanians .
human rights watch put the civilian death toll from the bombing campaign at around 500 .
milosevic 's government estimated the nato strikes killed more than 1,000 soldiers and 2,500 civilians , including 89 children , while 12,500 people were wounded and at least $ 30 billion in damage caused .
" a decade of the crime against serbia , " the daily press said , while politika wrote of the " bombing that was never declared a war . "
under the headline " days of death and destruction , " vecernje novosti recounted half a dozen personal stories , including those of families who lost children and of a military pilot who was shot down by nato .
health concerns also remain about the danger to civilians from weapons nato used during the campaign .
thousands risk life and limb from cluster bomblets still scattered across serbia as well as from depleted uranium , according to european non-governmental groups .
a " humanitarian intervention " many analysts contend the " humanitarian intervention " was necessary to prevent any recurrence of events like the 1995 srebrenica massacre by bosnian serbs of some 8,000 muslims - europe 's worst atrocity since world war ii .

experts say the economy will contract by up to 7 percent , and push unemployment up to 4.75 million by the end of 2010 . germany 's commerzbank has warned that the economic downturn will have a harsher effect on the country 's development than predicted at the start of the year . joerg kraemer , chief economist at commerzbank , told the berliner zeitung that in light of plunging order intakes among german companies , germany 's economy would shrink by as much as 7 percent this year . the number of unemployed can be expected to grow by more than 1.5 million within a two-year period , kraemer said , adding that by the end of 2010 , germany will be nearing the 5 million mark .
currently , some 3.5 million germans are registered as unemployed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a million more germans may have to update their resumes by 2010 , one expert said the nation 's gdp could contract by 4 percent to 4.5 percent this year , according to an internal economics ministry report cited by the bild newspaper on tuesday , march 24 .
in january , the ministry predicted a contraction of only 2.25 percent for this year .
a new forecast will be issued next month . wto predicts contraction in trade this gloomy news for germany is in keeping with similarly dismal economic outlooks around the world as the effects of the global economic crisis make themselves felt . " the global economy 's sharp slowdown is affecting german economic production more and more , " said the country 's central bank in its monthly report released on monday . also on monday , the world trade organization said the volume of global trade is expected to contract by 9 percent in 2009 , the largest such contraction since world war ii and significantly worse than previously predicted . the contraction in developed countries would be particularly severe , with exports falling by 10 percent this year , while in developing countries , exports would shrink by some 2 percent to 3 percent , according to a statement released by the wto . such a drastic fall in international trade would be especially detrimental to germany 's already suffering export-driven economy . merkel addresses german bankers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could take a decade to rebuild the economy , merkel said speaking to bankers in berlin on monday , german chancellor angela merkel said she expects it will take the country a decade to rebuild the economic system after the state was forced to intervene and pass a stimulus spending package to sustain the economy through the downturn . merkel said this degree of interference in the free market would have to be reversed as soon as the financial crisis was under control , and taxpayers given back what they paid to save the economic system . dc / sms / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he said , in reference to recent infighting within the coalition government . the president , whose role in germany is largely ceremonial though it has traditionally been a voice of moral authority capable to shaping political debate , lauded the government 's action to stem the economic crisis .

" i believe we can be faster than that , " the president said . koehler , a member of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is himself standing for re-election to a new five-year presidential term in may .
his main challenger to the post is gesine schwan of the government 's social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- coalition partner . schwan welcomed the president 's comments on the global financial crisis .

if you 're itching for a place you can really call your own , ebay has just the thing - a village in saxony that can be yours for the modest price of 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 405,000 -rrb- . " why do n't you buy your own village ? " reads the text accompanying the somewhat unusual property listing on the auction web site .
indeed , why not ?
the asking price is a real bargain , especially if you consider that people routinely shell out 300,000 euros for an average-sized apartment in the city .
for the same amount , you could be the proud owner of liebon , a tiny village nestled in the state of saxony that has a history dating back to 1322 .
admittedly , tiny is the key adjective .
the village consists of three buildings , two road signs , and has a total area of just 15,000 square meters -lrb- 3.7 acres -rrb- - about the size of two football fields .
current population : eight .
one of those residents is karsten schmidt , 45 .
he lives in liebon with his wife and two children .
schmidt 's parents also live in the village , as does schmidt 's brother , who lives with his girlfriend .
rural idyll his describes liebon as a picture-book place - a farm with a big family home , a playground , a pond , a fountain and a tiny shop .
" the village is practically self-sufficient , " he told the bild newspaper .
" we planted an orchard in the big garden and we grow potatoes . "
despite the idyllic setting , schmidt says he 's ready to start packing the moving boxes if the family gets a decent offer .
" my two daughters are so far away from everything , " he said .
" my parents do n't have driving licenses , and you really depend on a car here . "
the nearest neighbors are some 1.5 kilometers away .
but schmidt says prospective new residents should n't worry about feeling too cut off from the world , as liebon has been kitted out with high-speed internet access . dc / nda / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if you 're itching for a place you can really call your own , ebay has just the thing - a village in saxony that can be yours for the modest price of 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 405,000 -rrb- . " why do n't you buy your own village ? " reads the text accompanying the somewhat unusual property listing on the auction web site .
indeed , why not ?
the asking price is a real bargain , especially if you consider that people routinely shell out 300,000 euros for an average-sized apartment in the city .
for the same amount , you could be the proud owner of liebon , a tiny village nestled in the state of saxony that has a history dating back to 1322 .
admittedly , tiny is the key adjective .
the village consists of three buildings , two road signs , and has a total area of just 15,000 square meters -lrb- 3.7 acres -rrb- - about the size of two football fields .
current population : eight .
one of those residents is karsten schmidt , 45 .
he lives in liebon with his wife and two children .
schmidt 's parents also live in the village , as does schmidt 's brother , who lives with his girlfriend .
rural idyll his describes liebon as a picture-book place - a farm with a big family home , a playground , a pond , a fountain and a tiny shop .
" the village is practically self-sufficient , " he told the bild newspaper .
" we planted an orchard in the big garden and we grow potatoes . "
despite the idyllic setting , schmidt says he 's ready to start packing the moving boxes if the family gets a decent offer .
" my two daughters are so far away from everything , " he said .
" my parents do n't have driving licenses , and you really depend on a car here . "
the nearest neighbors are some 1.5 kilometers away .

as the bombs dropped , germany ’ s armed forces joined in their first modern combat mission . then-chancellor gerhard schroeder had only been in office for a few months when he was called to explain germany 's participation in a nato bombing operation .
" overnight on thursday , nato launched air strikes against military targets in yugoslavia .
the alliance was compelled to take this step in order to prevent further heavy and systematic infringement of human rights in kosovo , " schroeder told the parliament .
it was the first time since world war ii that german soldiers had taken part in a combat mission .
for germany , the timing was complicated .
schroeder 's social democrats had just won a parliamentary majority together with the green party , forming a so-called red-green coalition .
one of their first decisions was whether to have the bundeswehr , which is what germany 's federal armed forces are called , participate in nato fighting .
from the beginning , schroeder was confident that he had political and public support for the mission .
" we are united and in agreement with the large majority of the german people and also - thank god - with a large majority of the german parliament , which cuts across all party lines , " schroeder said .
nato pressured milosevic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yugoslavia eventually pulled troops out of kosovo the weeks leading up to schroeder 's speech before parliament was had been turbulent ones .
the kosovo crisis was intensifying at the same time that the 16-year tenure of chancellor helmut kohl was coming to an end .
schroeder 's new coalition had not even had a chance to settle in before being hit with a series of major foreign policy decisions .
nato was turning up the heat on yugoslavian president slobodan milosevic , warning that it would launch air strikes if the expulsions and killings in kosovo continued .
nato general secretary javier solana issued a warning in the fall of 2008 : " just a few moments ago , the north atlantic council decided to issue activation orders - actords - for both a phased air campaign in yugoslavia and limited air operations . "
nato expected germany to make a contribution to the fighting .
the newly-elected parliament held a special meeting in october 1998 in bonn , germany .
a large majority of the delegates decided to allow bundeswehr troops to take part in nato air strikes , even without a united nations mandate .
deployment without a un mandate negotiations continued .
yugoslavian representatives meet with kosovo-albanians and nato in search of a solution .
germany 's new government , inexperienced in foreign policy , took a low-key approach , yet threw its support behind nato .
rudolf scharping , the secretary of defense for the social democrats , said at the time : " we want to do everything in our power to keep corpses from piling up in the balkans and to ensure that there is n't a new stream of refugees into europe . "
after yugoslavia refused to accept the rambouillet agreement , nato began bombing targets in belgrade and other serbian cities .
fourteen german tornado fighter planes were used for air reconnaissance and to attack serbian air defense positions .
this meant not only that german soldiers took an active role in fighting for the first time since the end of world war ii , but that they did so without a un mandate .
the german government justified its participation by saying it could not close its eyes to the suffering of the civilian population in kosovo .
not easy being green bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder , right , and fischer , left , both supported the kosovo war this policy change was particularly difficult for the green party , which historically has had close links to the peace movement .
angry demonstrators called top green politicians " murderers " as they arrived with police escorts for a party meeting in may of 1999 .
many long-time green supporters vehemently reject the use of military force , yet parliamentarian angelika beer defended party leaders from criticisms and insults being hurled at them .
the critics were cowardly , she said , and had no good alternatives to offer .
" those of you who are now yelling ‘ warmongers , ' would you have wanted us to turn a blind eye ? " she asked .
" how would you have wanted to justify it ? "
joschka fisher , the green 's foreign minister , found himself at the center of the criticism for his support of the war .
at one point a paint bomb was lobbed at his head , injuring him slightly .
" at this moment in time , i regard a one-sided , unlimited cessation of the bomb attacks as a wrong signal , " fischer said at one point .
germany still in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kfor still has soldiers in kosovo june of 1999 , milosevic withdrew his troops , allowing nato peacekeeping troops kfor to move in .
bundeswehr general klaus reinhardt was the commander of kfor for several years .
the deployment was important , reinhardt said .
" in kosovo , external stability was important because milosevic had said each day : ‘ i will take my country back by force , " ' reinhardt said .
only when the situation is stable can political and economic conditions improve , the general said .
however , bringing stability to kosovo has taken much longer than anyone expected at the time .
the red-green coalition has been out of office for nearly four years , but there are still more than 2,500 german soldiers stationed in kosovo .

as the bombs dropped , germany ’ s armed forces joined in their first modern combat mission . then-chancellor gerhard schroeder had only been in office for a few months when he was called to explain germany 's participation in a nato bombing operation .
" overnight on thursday , nato launched air strikes against military targets in yugoslavia .
the alliance was compelled to take this step in order to prevent further heavy and systematic infringement of human rights in kosovo , " schroeder told the parliament .
it was the first time since world war ii that german soldiers had taken part in a combat mission .
for germany , the timing was complicated .
schroeder 's social democrats had just won a parliamentary majority together with the green party , forming a so-called red-green coalition .
one of their first decisions was whether to have the bundeswehr , which is what germany 's federal armed forces are called , participate in nato fighting .
from the beginning , schroeder was confident that he had political and public support for the mission .
" we are united and in agreement with the large majority of the german people and also - thank god - with a large majority of the german parliament , which cuts across all party lines , " schroeder said .
nato pressured milosevic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yugoslavia eventually pulled troops out of kosovo the weeks leading up to schroeder 's speech before parliament was had been turbulent ones .
the kosovo crisis was intensifying at the same time that the 16-year tenure of chancellor helmut kohl was coming to an end .
schroeder 's new coalition had not even had a chance to settle in before being hit with a series of major foreign policy decisions .
nato was turning up the heat on yugoslavian president slobodan milosevic , warning that it would launch air strikes if the expulsions and killings in kosovo continued .
nato general secretary javier solana issued a warning in the fall of 2008 : " just a few moments ago , the north atlantic council decided to issue activation orders - actords - for both a phased air campaign in yugoslavia and limited air operations . "
nato expected germany to make a contribution to the fighting .
the newly-elected parliament held a special meeting in october 1998 in bonn , germany .
a large majority of the delegates decided to allow bundeswehr troops to take part in nato air strikes , even without a united nations mandate .
deployment without a un mandate negotiations continued .
yugoslavian representatives meet with kosovo-albanians and nato in search of a solution .
germany 's new government , inexperienced in foreign policy , took a low-key approach , yet threw its support behind nato .
rudolf scharping , the secretary of defense for the social democrats , said at the time : " we want to do everything in our power to keep corpses from piling up in the balkans and to ensure that there is n't a new stream of refugees into europe . "
after yugoslavia refused to accept the rambouillet agreement , nato began bombing targets in belgrade and other serbian cities .
fourteen german tornado fighter planes were used for air reconnaissance and to attack serbian air defense positions .
this meant not only that german soldiers took an active role in fighting for the first time since the end of world war ii , but that they did so without a un mandate .
the german government justified its participation by saying it could not close its eyes to the suffering of the civilian population in kosovo .
not easy being green bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder , right , and fischer , left , both supported the kosovo war this policy change was particularly difficult for the green party , which historically has had close links to the peace movement .
angry demonstrators called top green politicians " murderers " as they arrived with police escorts for a party meeting in may of 1999 .
many long-time green supporters vehemently reject the use of military force , yet parliamentarian angelika beer defended party leaders from criticisms and insults being hurled at them .
the critics were cowardly , she said , and had no good alternatives to offer .
" those of you who are now yelling ‘ warmongers , ' would you have wanted us to turn a blind eye ? " she asked .
" how would you have wanted to justify it ? "
joschka fisher , the green 's foreign minister , found himself at the center of the criticism for his support of the war .
at one point a paint bomb was lobbed at his head , injuring him slightly .
" at this moment in time , i regard a one-sided , unlimited cessation of the bomb attacks as a wrong signal , " fischer said at one point .
germany still in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kfor still has soldiers in kosovo june of 1999 , milosevic withdrew his troops , allowing nato peacekeeping troops kfor to move in .
bundeswehr general klaus reinhardt was the commander of kfor for several years .
the deployment was important , reinhardt said .
" in kosovo , external stability was important because milosevic had said each day : ‘ i will take my country back by force , " ' reinhardt said .
only when the situation is stable can political and economic conditions improve , the general said .
however , bringing stability to kosovo has taken much longer than anyone expected at the time .
the red-green coalition has been out of office for nearly four years , but there are still more than 2,500 german soldiers stationed in kosovo .

fourteen german tornado fighter planes were used for air reconnaissance and to attack serbian air defense positions .
this meant not only that german soldiers took an active role in fighting for the first time since the end of world war ii , but that they did so without a un mandate .
the german government justified its participation by saying it could not close its eyes to the suffering of the civilian population in kosovo .
not easy being green bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder , right , and fischer , left , both supported the kosovo war this policy change was particularly difficult for the green party , which historically has had close links to the peace movement .
angry demonstrators called top green politicians " murderers " as they arrived with police escorts for a party meeting in may of 1999 .
many long-time green supporters vehemently reject the use of military force , yet parliamentarian angelika beer defended party leaders from criticisms and insults being hurled at them .
the critics were cowardly , she said , and had no good alternatives to offer .
" those of you who are now yelling ‘ warmongers , ' would you have wanted us to turn a blind eye ? " she asked .
" how would you have wanted to justify it ? "
joschka fisher , the green 's foreign minister , found himself at the center of the criticism for his support of the war .
at one point a paint bomb was lobbed at his head , injuring him slightly .
" at this moment in time , i regard a one-sided , unlimited cessation of the bomb attacks as a wrong signal , " fischer said at one point .
germany still in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kfor still has soldiers in kosovo june of 1999 , milosevic withdrew his troops , allowing nato peacekeeping troops kfor to move in .
bundeswehr general klaus reinhardt was the commander of kfor for several years .
the deployment was important , reinhardt said .
" in kosovo , external stability was important because milosevic had said each day : ‘ i will take my country back by force , " ' reinhardt said .
only when the situation is stable can political and economic conditions improve , the general said .
however , bringing stability to kosovo has taken much longer than anyone expected at the time .
the red-green coalition has been out of office for nearly four years , but there are still more than 2,500 german soldiers stationed in kosovo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 24.03.2009 ten years on , germany looks back at return to war in kosovo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany used fighter jets to bomb serbian targets ten years ago , german fighter planes participated in nato air strikes against serbian targets .
as the bombs dropped , germany ’ s armed forces joined in their first modern combat mission . then-chancellor gerhard schroeder had only been in office for a few months when he was called to explain germany 's participation in a nato bombing operation .
" overnight on thursday , nato launched air strikes against military targets in yugoslavia .
the alliance was compelled to take this step in order to prevent further heavy and systematic infringement of human rights in kosovo , " schroeder told the parliament .
it was the first time since world war ii that german soldiers had taken part in a combat mission .
for germany , the timing was complicated .
schroeder 's social democrats had just won a parliamentary majority together with the green party , forming a so-called red-green coalition .
one of their first decisions was whether to have the bundeswehr , which is what germany 's federal armed forces are called , participate in nato fighting .
from the beginning , schroeder was confident that he had political and public support for the mission .
" we are united and in agreement with the large majority of the german people and also - thank god - with a large majority of the german parliament , which cuts across all party lines , " schroeder said .
nato pressured milosevic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yugoslavia eventually pulled troops out of kosovo the weeks leading up to schroeder 's speech before parliament was had been turbulent ones .
the kosovo crisis was intensifying at the same time that the 16-year tenure of chancellor helmut kohl was coming to an end .
schroeder 's new coalition had not even had a chance to settle in before being hit with a series of major foreign policy decisions .
nato was turning up the heat on yugoslavian president slobodan milosevic , warning that it would launch air strikes if the expulsions and killings in kosovo continued .
nato general secretary javier solana issued a warning in the fall of 2008 : " just a few moments ago , the north atlantic council decided to issue activation orders - actords - for both a phased air campaign in yugoslavia and limited air operations . "
nato expected germany to make a contribution to the fighting .
the newly-elected parliament held a special meeting in october 1998 in bonn , germany .
a large majority of the delegates decided to allow bundeswehr troops to take part in nato air strikes , even without a united nations mandate .
deployment without a un mandate negotiations continued .
yugoslavian representatives meet with kosovo-albanians and nato in search of a solution .
germany 's new government , inexperienced in foreign policy , took a low-key approach , yet threw its support behind nato .
rudolf scharping , the secretary of defense for the social democrats , said at the time : " we want to do everything in our power to keep corpses from piling up in the balkans and to ensure that there is n't a new stream of refugees into europe . "
after yugoslavia refused to accept the rambouillet agreement , nato began bombing targets in belgrade and other serbian cities .
fourteen german tornado fighter planes were used for air reconnaissance and to attack serbian air defense positions .
this meant not only that german soldiers took an active role in fighting for the first time since the end of world war ii , but that they did so without a un mandate .
the german government justified its participation by saying it could not close its eyes to the suffering of the civilian population in kosovo .
not easy being green bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder , right , and fischer , left , both supported the kosovo war this policy change was particularly difficult for the green party , which historically has had close links to the peace movement .
angry demonstrators called top green politicians " murderers " as they arrived with police escorts for a party meeting in may of 1999 .
many long-time green supporters vehemently reject the use of military force , yet parliamentarian angelika beer defended party leaders from criticisms and insults being hurled at them .
the critics were cowardly , she said , and had no good alternatives to offer .
" those of you who are now yelling ‘ warmongers , ' would you have wanted us to turn a blind eye ? " she asked .
" how would you have wanted to justify it ? "
joschka fisher , the green 's foreign minister , found himself at the center of the criticism for his support of the war .
at one point a paint bomb was lobbed at his head , injuring him slightly .
" at this moment in time , i regard a one-sided , unlimited cessation of the bomb attacks as a wrong signal , " fischer said at one point .
germany still in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kfor still has soldiers in kosovo june of 1999 , milosevic withdrew his troops , allowing nato peacekeeping troops kfor to move in .
bundeswehr general klaus reinhardt was the commander of kfor for several years .
the deployment was important , reinhardt said .
" in kosovo , external stability was important because milosevic had said each day : ‘ i will take my country back by force , " ' reinhardt said .
only when the situation is stable can political and economic conditions improve , the general said .
however , bringing stability to kosovo has taken much longer than anyone expected at the time .
the red-green coalition has been out of office for nearly four years , but there are still more than 2,500 german soldiers stationed in kosovo .

as the bombs dropped , germany ’ s armed forces joined in their first modern combat mission . then-chancellor gerhard schroeder had only been in office for a few months when he was called to explain germany 's participation in a nato bombing operation .
" overnight on thursday , nato launched air strikes against military targets in yugoslavia .
the alliance was compelled to take this step in order to prevent further heavy and systematic infringement of human rights in kosovo , " schroeder told the parliament .
it was the first time since world war ii that german soldiers had taken part in a combat mission .
for germany , the timing was complicated .
schroeder 's social democrats had just won a parliamentary majority together with the green party , forming a so-called red-green coalition .
one of their first decisions was whether to have the bundeswehr , which is what germany 's federal armed forces are called , participate in nato fighting .
from the beginning , schroeder was confident that he had political and public support for the mission .
" we are united and in agreement with the large majority of the german people and also - thank god - with a large majority of the german parliament , which cuts across all party lines , " schroeder said .
nato pressured milosevic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yugoslavia eventually pulled troops out of kosovo the weeks leading up to schroeder 's speech before parliament was had been turbulent ones .
the kosovo crisis was intensifying at the same time that the 16-year tenure of chancellor helmut kohl was coming to an end .
schroeder 's new coalition had not even had a chance to settle in before being hit with a series of major foreign policy decisions .
nato was turning up the heat on yugoslavian president slobodan milosevic , warning that it would launch air strikes if the expulsions and killings in kosovo continued .
nato general secretary javier solana issued a warning in the fall of 2008 : " just a few moments ago , the north atlantic council decided to issue activation orders - actords - for both a phased air campaign in yugoslavia and limited air operations . "
nato expected germany to make a contribution to the fighting .
the newly-elected parliament held a special meeting in october 1998 in bonn , germany .
a large majority of the delegates decided to allow bundeswehr troops to take part in nato air strikes , even without a united nations mandate .
deployment without a un mandate negotiations continued .
yugoslavian representatives meet with kosovo-albanians and nato in search of a solution .
germany 's new government , inexperienced in foreign policy , took a low-key approach , yet threw its support behind nato .
rudolf scharping , the secretary of defense for the social democrats , said at the time : " we want to do everything in our power to keep corpses from piling up in the balkans and to ensure that there is n't a new stream of refugees into europe . "
after yugoslavia refused to accept the rambouillet agreement , nato began bombing targets in belgrade and other serbian cities .
fourteen german tornado fighter planes were used for air reconnaissance and to attack serbian air defense positions .
this meant not only that german soldiers took an active role in fighting for the first time since the end of world war ii , but that they did so without a un mandate .
the german government justified its participation by saying it could not close its eyes to the suffering of the civilian population in kosovo .
not easy being green bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder , right , and fischer , left , both supported the kosovo war this policy change was particularly difficult for the green party , which historically has had close links to the peace movement .
angry demonstrators called top green politicians " murderers " as they arrived with police escorts for a party meeting in may of 1999 .
many long-time green supporters vehemently reject the use of military force , yet parliamentarian angelika beer defended party leaders from criticisms and insults being hurled at them .
the critics were cowardly , she said , and had no good alternatives to offer .
" those of you who are now yelling ‘ warmongers , ' would you have wanted us to turn a blind eye ? " she asked .
" how would you have wanted to justify it ? "
joschka fisher , the green 's foreign minister , found himself at the center of the criticism for his support of the war .
at one point a paint bomb was lobbed at his head , injuring him slightly .
" at this moment in time , i regard a one-sided , unlimited cessation of the bomb attacks as a wrong signal , " fischer said at one point .
germany still in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kfor still has soldiers in kosovo june of 1999 , milosevic withdrew his troops , allowing nato peacekeeping troops kfor to move in .
bundeswehr general klaus reinhardt was the commander of kfor for several years .
the deployment was important , reinhardt said .
" in kosovo , external stability was important because milosevic had said each day : ‘ i will take my country back by force , " ' reinhardt said .
only when the situation is stable can political and economic conditions improve , the general said .
however , bringing stability to kosovo has taken much longer than anyone expected at the time .
the red-green coalition has been out of office for nearly four years , but there are still more than 2,500 german soldiers stationed in kosovo .

if you 're itching for a place you can really call your own , ebay has just the thing - a village in saxony that can be yours for the modest price of 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 405,000 -rrb- . " why do n't you buy your own village ? " reads the text accompanying the somewhat unusual property listing on the auction web site .
indeed , why not ?
the asking price is a real bargain , especially if you consider that people routinely shell out 300,000 euros for an average-sized apartment in the city .
for the same amount , you could be the proud owner of liebon , a tiny village nestled in the state of saxony that has a history dating back to 1322 .
admittedly , tiny is the key adjective .
the village consists of three buildings , two road signs , and has a total area of just 15,000 square meters -lrb- 3.7 acres -rrb- - about the size of two football fields .
current population : eight .
one of those residents is karsten schmidt , 45 .
he lives in liebon with his wife and two children .
schmidt 's parents also live in the village , as does schmidt 's brother , who lives with his girlfriend .
rural idyll his describes liebon as a picture-book place - a farm with a big family home , a playground , a pond , a fountain and a tiny shop .
" the village is practically self-sufficient , " he told the bild newspaper .
" we planted an orchard in the big garden and we grow potatoes . "
despite the idyllic setting , schmidt says he 's ready to start packing the moving boxes if the family gets a decent offer .
" my two daughters are so far away from everything , " he said .
" my parents do n't have driving licenses , and you really depend on a car here . "
the nearest neighbors are some 1.5 kilometers away .
but schmidt says prospective new residents should n't worry about feeling too cut off from the world , as liebon has been kitted out with high-speed internet access . dc / nda / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's unknown what topolanek 's planned resignation will mean for the czech european union presidency . it was a close vote .
but four renegade czech lawmakers abandoned topolanek on tuesday , march 24 , toppling the ruling coalition .
it was the fourth time topolanek had faced a vote of confidence in his two years in office .
topolanek was able to secure only 96 votes in the 200-seat lower house after failing to win over the renegade lawmakers in last-minute talks .
topolanek confirmed that he plans to resign .
" i will behave exactly in line with the constitution , " reuters news agency quoted him as saying .
the constitution says the government must resign after losing a vote of confidence .
topolanek ’ s right-wing civic democrats -lrb- ods -rrb- ruled together with the christian democrats and the green party .
yet topolanek relied on the support of several independent members of parliament , who had defected from the ruling coalition , to give him a majority .
eu presidency uncertain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus will be tasked with finding a successor czech president vaclav klaus will now look for a parliamentarian with enough support to form a new government .
if three attempts to form a government fail , early elections will be called .
before the vote , social democrats had said they wanted to see topolanek 's government stay on to complete the six-month rotating eu presidency , which the czech republic holds until the end of june .
social democrat chief jiri paroubek reiterated that stance after the vote , saying it was " natural that the government would stay until the end of the eu presidency " on june 30 , afp reported .
topolanek has said his party would like to have early elections this summer .
the opposition social democrats want elections to be held in autumn .
unusual , but not unprecedented a change in government would complicate the czech eu presidency , topolanek said after the no confidence vote . " i believe it can complicate our negotiating power ... partners in europe have grown used to us negotiating hard .
in this sense it can happen that our position will be weakened , " he told reporters . us president barack obama is scheduled to visit prague next week for talks with czech and european leaders .
while the situation of a government changing during its six-month european union presidency is unusual , it isn ’ t unprecedented . in 1996 , italy ’ s center-left coalition under romano prodi took over from lamberto dini 's centre-right government following a legislative election .
and in 1993 , denmark began its eu presidency with a change in leadership when poul schlueter 's conservatives were replaced by social democrats under poul nyrup rasmussen . hungary , lativa in crisis the czech republic has been less affected than some eastern european countries by the global financial crisis .

" overnight on thursday , nato launched air strikes against military targets in yugoslavia .
the alliance was compelled to take this step in order to prevent further heavy and systematic infringement of human rights in kosovo , " schroeder told the parliament .
it was the first time since world war ii that german soldiers had taken part in a combat mission .
for germany , the timing was complicated .
schroeder 's social democrats had just won a parliamentary majority together with the green party , forming a so-called red-green coalition .
one of their first decisions was whether to have the bundeswehr , which is what germany 's federal armed forces are called , participate in nato fighting .
from the beginning , schroeder was confident that he had political and public support for the mission .
" we are united and in agreement with the large majority of the german people and also - thank god - with a large majority of the german parliament , which cuts across all party lines , " schroeder said .
nato pressured milosevic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yugoslavia eventually pulled troops out of kosovo the weeks leading up to schroeder 's speech before parliament was had been turbulent ones .
the kosovo crisis was intensifying at the same time that the 16-year tenure of chancellor helmut kohl was coming to an end .
schroeder 's new coalition had not even had a chance to settle in before being hit with a series of major foreign policy decisions .
nato was turning up the heat on yugoslavian president slobodan milosevic , warning that it would launch air strikes if the expulsions and killings in kosovo continued .
nato general secretary javier solana issued a warning in the fall of 2008 : " just a few moments ago , the north atlantic council decided to issue activation orders - actords - for both a phased air campaign in yugoslavia and limited air operations . "
nato expected germany to make a contribution to the fighting .
the newly-elected parliament held a special meeting in october 1998 in bonn , germany .
a large majority of the delegates decided to allow bundeswehr troops to take part in nato air strikes , even without a united nations mandate .
deployment without a un mandate negotiations continued .
yugoslavian representatives meet with kosovo-albanians and nato in search of a solution .
germany 's new government , inexperienced in foreign policy , took a low-key approach , yet threw its support behind nato .
rudolf scharping , the secretary of defense for the social democrats , said at the time : " we want to do everything in our power to keep corpses from piling up in the balkans and to ensure that there is n't a new stream of refugees into europe . "
after yugoslavia refused to accept the rambouillet agreement , nato began bombing targets in belgrade and other serbian cities .
fourteen german tornado fighter planes were used for air reconnaissance and to attack serbian air defense positions .
this meant not only that german soldiers took an active role in fighting for the first time since the end of world war ii , but that they did so without a un mandate .
the german government justified its participation by saying it could not close its eyes to the suffering of the civilian population in kosovo .
not easy being green bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder , right , and fischer , left , both supported the kosovo war this policy change was particularly difficult for the green party , which historically has had close links to the peace movement .
angry demonstrators called top green politicians " murderers " as they arrived with police escorts for a party meeting in may of 1999 .
many long-time green supporters vehemently reject the use of military force , yet parliamentarian angelika beer defended party leaders from criticisms and insults being hurled at them .
the critics were cowardly , she said , and had no good alternatives to offer .
" those of you who are now yelling ‘ warmongers , ' would you have wanted us to turn a blind eye ? " she asked .
" how would you have wanted to justify it ? "
joschka fisher , the green 's foreign minister , found himself at the center of the criticism for his support of the war .
at one point a paint bomb was lobbed at his head , injuring him slightly .
" at this moment in time , i regard a one-sided , unlimited cessation of the bomb attacks as a wrong signal , " fischer said at one point .
germany still in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kfor still has soldiers in kosovo june of 1999 , milosevic withdrew his troops , allowing nato peacekeeping troops kfor to move in .
bundeswehr general klaus reinhardt was the commander of kfor for several years .
the deployment was important , reinhardt said .
" in kosovo , external stability was important because milosevic had said each day : ‘ i will take my country back by force , " ' reinhardt said .
only when the situation is stable can political and economic conditions improve , the general said .
however , bringing stability to kosovo has taken much longer than anyone expected at the time .
the red-green coalition has been out of office for nearly four years , but there are still more than 2,500 german soldiers stationed in kosovo .

" " the air strikes have not solved problems in kosovo , and did not help to bring peace and the rule of law , " cvetkovic said at a special meeting of the cabinet to commemorate the attacks .
" on the contrary , they resulted in ethnic cleansing and gross violations of human rights , international standards and fresh tensions . " the alliance 's action , which was not sanctioned by the united nations security council , undermined milosevic 's power and is largely thought to have played a major role in his being sent to the hague to stand trial for war crimes .
he died in 2006 before the court could issue a verdict in his case . a necessary war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke has no regrets over the nato campaign western leaders saw nato 's air war , dubbed operation allied force , as the only way to end the 1998-1999 violent crackdown by milosevic 's forces on the kosovo liberation army and its supporters . " i look back on that extraordinary last meeting with milosevic , with a feeling that what we did was necessary and the right thing to do , " richard holbrooke , who served as the united states special envoy to the balkans , told reporters on saturday . " the people of kosovo are better off than they were as part of serbia , and serbia is better off facing the future rather than working back to a mythic past , " he added . then us president bill clinton also said at the time that the west had a " moral imperative " to take action against milosevic . the north atlantic treaty organization , in what was its largest military operation , set out to destroy dozens of targets .
in its 78 days of bombing , however , it also hit public infrastructure like bridges and railway tracks as well as homes , refugee convoys , a hospital and the chinese embassy in belgrade . human rights watch has estimated that about 500 civilians lost their lives during the bombing campaign , five times less than the yugoslav government claimed at the time . diverging views of war in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbs and kosovo albanians have very different feelings about nato 's intervention for ethnic albanians in kosovo , where they accounted for 90 percent of the region 's population despite being a minority in serbia overall , the war put a welcome end to their suffering at the hands of the serbian majority . " the appearance of combat airplanes in the sky above kosovo was a message of salvation for the people here , " kosovo justice minister nekibe kelmendi told afp . but for the serb minority , the campaign marked the beginning of their agony . " it was revenge for serbian disobedience , " said radoslav radovic , a 57-year-old from the serb-run half of kosovska mitrovica , a northern town that still simmers with ethnic tensions . radovic told afp he believes the west declared serbia guilty for " defending its integrity and its territory . " fearing ethnic albanian reprisals , tens of thousands of kosovo serbs fled their homes for serbia proper , with only a handful returning in the past decade .
of the 120,000 ethnic serbs estimated in kosovo , most live in the northern region that borders serbia or in small enclaves in southern areas . tensions run high after independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many kosovo serbs are still living in refugee camps in serbia proper tensions have remained high , especially since kosovo 's parliament unilaterally seceded from serbia in february 2008 , a move that has been recognized by 56 nations including the united states and most of the european union . officially , the united nations remains in charge of kosovo .
the 15-nation security council has not been able to alter the un mandate because its members are split over what to do with the un presence there and the legality of pristina 's declaration of independence . russia , a permanent veto-wielding member of the security council and serbia 's ally , has said it would not recognize an independent kosovo and has supported belgrade 's bid to challenge the declaration before the international court of justice in the hague . under a plan agreed to last year , police , customs officers and judges in the serb-run areas of kosovo remain under the un umbrella , known as unmik , while their albanian counterparts work with a european union police and justice mission called eulex . many kosovo albanians have come to view the un presence as an obstacle to independence , un secretary-general ban ki-moon said in a report published thursday . " there is a perception among many kosovo albanians that the mission 's tasks have been accomplished and its continued presence is an unwelcome obstacle to the desire for kosovo to function as a sovereign state , " ban said in his latest report to the security council on un activities in kosovo . ban 's report did not make recommendations on how to move forward as uncertainty in the region appears likely to continue . sms / tt / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 24.03.2009 nato strikes over kosovo continue to divide , 10 years on großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo is now a state recongized by most eu members instability and discontent remain in kosovo a decade after nato air strikes against yugoslavia ended a war between serb forces and ethnic albanian guerrillas , and one year after pristina declared independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian cities are still scarred by the consequences of the nato strikes launched on march 24 , 1999 - after the collapse of peace talks between then yugoslav president slobodan milosevic and kosovo albanian separatists - the bombing campaign drove serbian troops out of kosovo , set the foundation the deployment of nato peacekeepers and a un civilian mission to run the then serbian province . nato plans no special occasions to mark the 10th anniversary of the war on yugoslavia , which meanwhile disintegrated further when montenegro split from serbia in 2006 . serbia will commemorate the anniversary on tuesday by sounding the air-raid sirens used to signal the end of bombing sorties . serbia 's prime minister mirko cvetkovic called the nato bombing campaign illegal and " contrary to international law . " " the air strikes have not solved problems in kosovo , and did not help to bring peace and the rule of law , " cvetkovic said at a special meeting of the cabinet to commemorate the attacks .
" on the contrary , they resulted in ethnic cleansing and gross violations of human rights , international standards and fresh tensions . " the alliance 's action , which was not sanctioned by the united nations security council , undermined milosevic 's power and is largely thought to have played a major role in his being sent to the hague to stand trial for war crimes .
he died in 2006 before the court could issue a verdict in his case . a necessary war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke has no regrets over the nato campaign western leaders saw nato 's air war , dubbed operation allied force , as the only way to end the 1998-1999 violent crackdown by milosevic 's forces on the kosovo liberation army and its supporters . " i look back on that extraordinary last meeting with milosevic , with a feeling that what we did was necessary and the right thing to do , " richard holbrooke , who served as the united states special envoy to the balkans , told reporters on saturday . " the people of kosovo are better off than they were as part of serbia , and serbia is better off facing the future rather than working back to a mythic past , " he added . then us president bill clinton also said at the time that the west had a " moral imperative " to take action against milosevic . the north atlantic treaty organization , in what was its largest military operation , set out to destroy dozens of targets .
in its 78 days of bombing , however , it also hit public infrastructure like bridges and railway tracks as well as homes , refugee convoys , a hospital and the chinese embassy in belgrade . human rights watch has estimated that about 500 civilians lost their lives during the bombing campaign , five times less than the yugoslav government claimed at the time . diverging views of war in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbs and kosovo albanians have very different feelings about nato 's intervention for ethnic albanians in kosovo , where they accounted for 90 percent of the region 's population despite being a minority in serbia overall , the war put a welcome end to their suffering at the hands of the serbian majority . " the appearance of combat airplanes in the sky above kosovo was a message of salvation for the people here , " kosovo justice minister nekibe kelmendi told afp . but for the serb minority , the campaign marked the beginning of their agony . " it was revenge for serbian disobedience , " said radoslav radovic , a 57-year-old from the serb-run half of kosovska mitrovica , a northern town that still simmers with ethnic tensions . radovic told afp he believes the west declared serbia guilty for " defending its integrity and its territory . " fearing ethnic albanian reprisals , tens of thousands of kosovo serbs fled their homes for serbia proper , with only a handful returning in the past decade .
of the 120,000 ethnic serbs estimated in kosovo , most live in the northern region that borders serbia or in small enclaves in southern areas . tensions run high after independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many kosovo serbs are still living in refugee camps in serbia proper tensions have remained high , especially since kosovo 's parliament unilaterally seceded from serbia in february 2008 , a move that has been recognized by 56 nations including the united states and most of the european union . officially , the united nations remains in charge of kosovo .
the 15-nation security council has not been able to alter the un mandate because its members are split over what to do with the un presence there and the legality of pristina 's declaration of independence . russia , a permanent veto-wielding member of the security council and serbia 's ally , has said it would not recognize an independent kosovo and has supported belgrade 's bid to challenge the declaration before the international court of justice in the hague . under a plan agreed to last year , police , customs officers and judges in the serb-run areas of kosovo remain under the un umbrella , known as unmik , while their albanian counterparts work with a european union police and justice mission called eulex . many kosovo albanians have come to view the un presence as an obstacle to independence , un secretary-general ban ki-moon said in a report published thursday . " there is a perception among many kosovo albanians that the mission 's tasks have been accomplished and its continued presence is an unwelcome obstacle to the desire for kosovo to function as a sovereign state , " ban said in his latest report to the security council on un activities in kosovo . ban 's report did not make recommendations on how to move forward as uncertainty in the region appears likely to continue . sms / tt / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" " the air strikes have not solved problems in kosovo , and did not help to bring peace and the rule of law , " cvetkovic said at a special meeting of the cabinet to commemorate the attacks .
" on the contrary , they resulted in ethnic cleansing and gross violations of human rights , international standards and fresh tensions . " the alliance 's action , which was not sanctioned by the united nations security council , undermined milosevic 's power and is largely thought to have played a major role in his being sent to the hague to stand trial for war crimes .
he died in 2006 before the court could issue a verdict in his case . a necessary war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke has no regrets over the nato campaign western leaders saw nato 's air war , dubbed operation allied force , as the only way to end the 1998-1999 violent crackdown by milosevic 's forces on the kosovo liberation army and its supporters . " i look back on that extraordinary last meeting with milosevic , with a feeling that what we did was necessary and the right thing to do , " richard holbrooke , who served as the united states special envoy to the balkans , told reporters on saturday . " the people of kosovo are better off than they were as part of serbia , and serbia is better off facing the future rather than working back to a mythic past , " he added . then us president bill clinton also said at the time that the west had a " moral imperative " to take action against milosevic . the north atlantic treaty organization , in what was its largest military operation , set out to destroy dozens of targets .
in its 78 days of bombing , however , it also hit public infrastructure like bridges and railway tracks as well as homes , refugee convoys , a hospital and the chinese embassy in belgrade . human rights watch has estimated that about 500 civilians lost their lives during the bombing campaign , five times less than the yugoslav government claimed at the time . diverging views of war in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbs and kosovo albanians have very different feelings about nato 's intervention for ethnic albanians in kosovo , where they accounted for 90 percent of the region 's population despite being a minority in serbia overall , the war put a welcome end to their suffering at the hands of the serbian majority . " the appearance of combat airplanes in the sky above kosovo was a message of salvation for the people here , " kosovo justice minister nekibe kelmendi told afp . but for the serb minority , the campaign marked the beginning of their agony . " it was revenge for serbian disobedience , " said radoslav radovic , a 57-year-old from the serb-run half of kosovska mitrovica , a northern town that still simmers with ethnic tensions . radovic told afp he believes the west declared serbia guilty for " defending its integrity and its territory . " fearing ethnic albanian reprisals , tens of thousands of kosovo serbs fled their homes for serbia proper , with only a handful returning in the past decade .
of the 120,000 ethnic serbs estimated in kosovo , most live in the northern region that borders serbia or in small enclaves in southern areas . tensions run high after independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many kosovo serbs are still living in refugee camps in serbia proper tensions have remained high , especially since kosovo 's parliament unilaterally seceded from serbia in february 2008 , a move that has been recognized by 56 nations including the united states and most of the european union . officially , the united nations remains in charge of kosovo .
the 15-nation security council has not been able to alter the un mandate because its members are split over what to do with the un presence there and the legality of pristina 's declaration of independence . russia , a permanent veto-wielding member of the security council and serbia 's ally , has said it would not recognize an independent kosovo and has supported belgrade 's bid to challenge the declaration before the international court of justice in the hague . under a plan agreed to last year , police , customs officers and judges in the serb-run areas of kosovo remain under the un umbrella , known as unmik , while their albanian counterparts work with a european union police and justice mission called eulex . many kosovo albanians have come to view the un presence as an obstacle to independence , un secretary-general ban ki-moon said in a report published thursday . " there is a perception among many kosovo albanians that the mission 's tasks have been accomplished and its continued presence is an unwelcome obstacle to the desire for kosovo to function as a sovereign state , " ban said in his latest report to the security council on un activities in kosovo . ban 's report did not make recommendations on how to move forward as uncertainty in the region appears likely to continue . sms / tt / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if you 're itching for a place you can really call your own , ebay has just the thing - a village in saxony that can be yours for the modest price of 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 405,000 -rrb- . " why do n't you buy your own village ? " reads the text accompanying the somewhat unusual property listing on the auction web site .
indeed , why not ?
the asking price is a real bargain , especially if you consider that people routinely shell out 300,000 euros for an average-sized apartment in the city .
for the same amount , you could be the proud owner of liebon , a tiny village nestled in the state of saxony that has a history dating back to 1322 .
admittedly , tiny is the key adjective .
the village consists of three buildings , two road signs , and has a total area of just 15,000 square meters -lrb- 3.7 acres -rrb- - about the size of two football fields .
current population : eight .
one of those residents is karsten schmidt , 45 .
he lives in liebon with his wife and two children .
schmidt 's parents also live in the village , as does schmidt 's brother , who lives with his girlfriend .
rural idyll his describes liebon as a picture-book place - a farm with a big family home , a playground , a pond , a fountain and a tiny shop .
" the village is practically self-sufficient , " he told the bild newspaper .
" we planted an orchard in the big garden and we grow potatoes . "
despite the idyllic setting , schmidt says he 's ready to start packing the moving boxes if the family gets a decent offer .
" my two daughters are so far away from everything , " he said .
" my parents do n't have driving licenses , and you really depend on a car here . "
the nearest neighbors are some 1.5 kilometers away .
but schmidt says prospective new residents should n't worry about feeling too cut off from the world , as liebon has been kitted out with high-speed internet access . dc / nda / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ministers gathered at the same time to lay wreaths at spots where people were killed during the air war - at the time the biggest military operation in nato history .
" the attack on our country was illegal , contrary to international law , without a decision by the united nations " security council , prime minister mirko cvetkovic told a special commemorative sitting of his cabinet .
" the air strikes have not solved problems in kosovo , and did not help to bring peace and the rule of law .
" they resulted in ethnic cleansing and gross violations of human rights , international standards and fresh tensions , " he said , after schools held a minute 's silence before class .
kosovo leaders said however the nato bombing stopped serbian abuses in their breakaway territory and was a decisive step towards saving and freeing its people .
" the 78 days of strikes saved the people of kosovo from planned extermination , a scenario which was prepared coldly by the highest serb political and academic circles , " kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said .
kosovo prime minister hashim thaci described the bombing as " a big historic event for kosovo and the democratic world . "
" the successful completion of the campaign of intervention by nato opened a new chapter in the history of kosovo , a chapter of freedom , " said thaci .
anniversary of campaign to stop milosevic nato launched the strikes on march 24 , 1999 after milosevic refused to sign up to a peace deal to end his forces ' crackdown on the rebel kosovo liberation army -lrb- kla -rrb- and the ethnic albanian majority in the southern territory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic ordered a crackdown on kosovo 's rebels it set out to destroy military targets , and went on to strike infrastructure and the milosevic propaganda machine .
some strikes went astray , hitting scores of civilian sites and even china 's embassy in belgrade .
milosevic eventually conceded 78 days later , paving the way for nato to enter kosovo .
some 15,000 nato-led peacekeepers remain in kosovo , which 56 nations recognize after its ethnic albanian-dominated parliament declared unilateral independence from serbia 13 months ago .
as part of serbian commemorations , the bells of orthodox churches were to be tolled for the victims at 7:45 pm -lrb- 1845 gmt -rrb- - the moment nato 's first attacks were launched 10 years ago .
wounds still open in serbia separately , a hard-line nationalist group planned to stage an anti-nato rally in the main square of belgrade , according to posters that have gone up around serbia 's capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian protests have been violent in the past serbian media seized on the opportunity of the anniversary to rake over the coals of a conflict that may have ended a decade ago but one which remains very much in the national consciousness .
" serbs got bombs , the albanians got a state , " the daily blic said in its report .
belgrade contends that nato , by acting without a un mandate and by bombing civilian targets and using controversial ordnance , broke international laws because it was biased in favor of albanians .
human rights watch put the civilian death toll from the bombing campaign at around 500 .
milosevic 's government estimated the nato strikes killed more than 1,000 soldiers and 2,500 civilians , including 89 children , while 12,500 people were wounded and at least $ 30 billion in damage caused .
" a decade of the crime against serbia , " the daily press said , while politika wrote of the " bombing that was never declared a war . "
under the headline " days of death and destruction , " vecernje novosti recounted half a dozen personal stories , including those of families who lost children and of a military pilot who was shot down by nato .
health concerns also remain about the danger to civilians from weapons nato used during the campaign .
thousands risk life and limb from cluster bomblets still scattered across serbia as well as from depleted uranium , according to european non-governmental groups .
a " humanitarian intervention " many analysts contend the " humanitarian intervention " was necessary to prevent any recurrence of events like the 1995 srebrenica massacre by bosnian serbs of some 8,000 muslims - europe 's worst atrocity since world war ii .
up to 9,000 people were killed in kosovo 's 1998-1999 conflict , mostly ethnic albanians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some blame inaction for the events which led to srebrenica " what is often forgotten about the bombing is the context and the context was the failure to act in bosnia , culminating in the srebrenica massacre , " tim judah , a prominent british author on the balkan wars of the 1990s .
" the kla were no angels but srebrenica changed everything .
after that there was no guarantee that serbian forces might not do such a thing again , " judah told reporters .
" as to whether it was worth it - a classic ' what if ' of history .
it was short -lrb- ish -rrb- and brutal but if it had not been for the bombing we might still be living with a rumbling and brutal insurgency and low level conflict . " nda / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de ten years on , germany looks back at return to war in kosovo ten years ago , german fighter planes participated in nato air strikes against serbian targets .

ministers gathered at the same time to lay wreaths at spots where people were killed during the air war - at the time the biggest military operation in nato history .
" the attack on our country was illegal , contrary to international law , without a decision by the united nations " security council , prime minister mirko cvetkovic told a special commemorative sitting of his cabinet .
" the air strikes have not solved problems in kosovo , and did not help to bring peace and the rule of law .
" they resulted in ethnic cleansing and gross violations of human rights , international standards and fresh tensions , " he said , after schools held a minute 's silence before class .
kosovo leaders said however the nato bombing stopped serbian abuses in their breakaway territory and was a decisive step towards saving and freeing its people .

some 15,000 nato-led peacekeepers remain in kosovo , which 56 nations recognize after its ethnic albanian-dominated parliament declared unilateral independence from serbia 13 months ago .
as part of serbian commemorations , the bells of orthodox churches were to be tolled for the victims at 7:45 pm -lrb- 1845 gmt -rrb- - the moment nato 's first attacks were launched 10 years ago .

" rasmussen was at the head of the list for the former bush administration , just as he is for the current obama administration , " analyst daniel korski said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish caricatures inflamed passions in the muslim world " the americans want someone who will continue to push for military engagement in afghanistan , " he said , pointing out that denmark has some 750 soldiers stationed in the volatile southern part of the country where the taliban insurgency is most active . us and european support however does not guarantee that rasmussen will become the appointed successor to scheffer . turkish opposition possible the main snag to rasmussen 's nomination , which needs to be approved by all members of the 26-nation alliance , is possible opposition to his candidacy from turkey , a secular nation that is predominantly muslim . denmark had outraged muslims around the world in 2005 when the widely circulated jyllands-posten newspaper published a series of cartoon caricatures depicting the prophet muhammad as a terrorist . rasmussen , who has been prime minister since 2001 , had refused to apologize for the cartoons invoking the right of the press to freedom of expression .
the controversial cartoons , which were later republished by media around the globe , had sparked riots and attacks on danish embassies in the muslim world . cartoon controversy " the cartoon crisis has a larger dimension than just turkey , " a turkish official , who requested anonymity , told reuters .
" at a time when nato is going to assume added responsibility in afghanistan and pakistan , having a secretary general with such an objectionable approach to billions of muslims , is not the right approach to the muslim world . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's foreign minister -lrb- right -rrb- is an unlikely candidate turkey has also attacked denmark for failing to revoke the broadcasting license of a television station that ankara has accused of being a mouthpiece for kurdish rebels opposed to the government .
adding fuel to the fire , rasmussen had publicly stated in 2003 that he opposed full eu membership for turkey . " it may come to the veto , " retuers quoted the anonymous official as saying .
" we will have to see . " the chances for other candidates for nato 's number two position , however , are dwindling . polish candidate viewed as antagonistic to russia polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski was rumored to be a favorite for secretary general post , but the appointment of a pro-american polish national is viewed as antagonizing russia at a time when nato is seeking better relations with the kremlin . russia has been bitterly opposed to the deployment of a us anti-missile defense shield on polish territory . turkey had favored a canadian for the post , since ottawa supports ankara 's bid to join the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 24.03.2009 west favors dane for top nato post , but turkish hurdles remain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's secretary-general post traditionally goes to a european danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen looks like the top contender for nato 's civilian head , but turkey might exercise its veto against the dane because of a cartoon controversy that had inflamed the muslim world . the united states gave its blessing to the appointment of danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen as the next nato secretary general in brussels over the weekend , paving the way for him to take over the trans-atlantic alliance 's top civilian job in august . washington also enjoys strong support for the choice of rasmussen from its three biggest european allies in the alliance - germany , france and the uk . although rasmussen , 56 , declined to publicly comment on the possibility of succeeding dutch diplomat jaap de hoop scheffer , he never officially ruled himself out as a candidate for a post that has traditionally gone to a european . dane favored by us and europeans rasmussen is regarded as a loyal us ally and also appeals to europeans for supporting closer ties between nato and the european union . an analyst at the london-based european council for foreign relations told the afp news agency that the danish prime minister has long enjoyed us support from politicians of all stripes . " rasmussen was at the head of the list for the former bush administration , just as he is for the current obama administration , " analyst daniel korski said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish caricatures inflamed passions in the muslim world " the americans want someone who will continue to push for military engagement in afghanistan , " he said , pointing out that denmark has some 750 soldiers stationed in the volatile southern part of the country where the taliban insurgency is most active . us and european support however does not guarantee that rasmussen will become the appointed successor to scheffer . turkish opposition possible the main snag to rasmussen 's nomination , which needs to be approved by all members of the 26-nation alliance , is possible opposition to his candidacy from turkey , a secular nation that is predominantly muslim . denmark had outraged muslims around the world in 2005 when the widely circulated jyllands-posten newspaper published a series of cartoon caricatures depicting the prophet muhammad as a terrorist . rasmussen , who has been prime minister since 2001 , had refused to apologize for the cartoons invoking the right of the press to freedom of expression .
the controversial cartoons , which were later republished by media around the globe , had sparked riots and attacks on danish embassies in the muslim world . cartoon controversy " the cartoon crisis has a larger dimension than just turkey , " a turkish official , who requested anonymity , told reuters .
" at a time when nato is going to assume added responsibility in afghanistan and pakistan , having a secretary general with such an objectionable approach to billions of muslims , is not the right approach to the muslim world . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's foreign minister -lrb- right -rrb- is an unlikely candidate turkey has also attacked denmark for failing to revoke the broadcasting license of a television station that ankara has accused of being a mouthpiece for kurdish rebels opposed to the government .
adding fuel to the fire , rasmussen had publicly stated in 2003 that he opposed full eu membership for turkey . " it may come to the veto , " retuers quoted the anonymous official as saying .
" we will have to see . " the chances for other candidates for nato 's number two position , however , are dwindling . polish candidate viewed as antagonistic to russia polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski was rumored to be a favorite for secretary general post , but the appointment of a pro-american polish national is viewed as antagonizing russia at a time when nato is seeking better relations with the kremlin . russia has been bitterly opposed to the deployment of a us anti-missile defense shield on polish territory . turkey had favored a canadian for the post , since ottawa supports ankara 's bid to join the eu .
however canadian defense minister peter mackay ruled himself out as a candidate on sunday . canadian ruled out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer 's successor should be announced at nato summit mackay 's rumored candidacy had the apparent support of us vice president joe biden as a reward for canada 's role in combat missions in dangerous southern afghanistan .

if you 're itching for a place you can really call your own , ebay has just the thing - a village in saxony that can be yours for the modest price of 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 405,000 -rrb- . " why do n't you buy your own village ? " reads the text accompanying the somewhat unusual property listing on the auction web site .
indeed , why not ?
the asking price is a real bargain , especially if you consider that people routinely shell out 300,000 euros for an average-sized apartment in the city .
for the same amount , you could be the proud owner of liebon , a tiny village nestled in the state of saxony that has a history dating back to 1322 .
admittedly , tiny is the key adjective .
the village consists of three buildings , two road signs , and has a total area of just 15,000 square meters -lrb- 3.7 acres -rrb- - about the size of two football fields .
current population : eight .
one of those residents is karsten schmidt , 45 .
he lives in liebon with his wife and two children .
schmidt 's parents also live in the village , as does schmidt 's brother , who lives with his girlfriend .
rural idyll his describes liebon as a picture-book place - a farm with a big family home , a playground , a pond , a fountain and a tiny shop .
" the village is practically self-sufficient , " he told the bild newspaper .
" we planted an orchard in the big garden and we grow potatoes . "
despite the idyllic setting , schmidt says he 's ready to start packing the moving boxes if the family gets a decent offer .
" my two daughters are so far away from everything , " he said .
" my parents do n't have driving licenses , and you really depend on a car here . "
the nearest neighbors are some 1.5 kilometers away .
but schmidt says prospective new residents should n't worry about feeling too cut off from the world , as liebon has been kitted out with high-speed internet access . dc / nda / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" rasmussen was at the head of the list for the former bush administration , just as he is for the current obama administration , " analyst daniel korski said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish caricatures inflamed passions in the muslim world " the americans want someone who will continue to push for military engagement in afghanistan , " he said , pointing out that denmark has some 750 soldiers stationed in the volatile southern part of the country where the taliban insurgency is most active . us and european support however does not guarantee that rasmussen will become the appointed successor to scheffer . turkish opposition possible the main snag to rasmussen 's nomination , which needs to be approved by all members of the 26-nation alliance , is possible opposition to his candidacy from turkey , a secular nation that is predominantly muslim . denmark had outraged muslims around the world in 2005 when the widely circulated jyllands-posten newspaper published a series of cartoon caricatures depicting the prophet muhammad as a terrorist . rasmussen , who has been prime minister since 2001 , had refused to apologize for the cartoons invoking the right of the press to freedom of expression .
the controversial cartoons , which were later republished by media around the globe , had sparked riots and attacks on danish embassies in the muslim world . cartoon controversy " the cartoon crisis has a larger dimension than just turkey , " a turkish official , who requested anonymity , told reuters .
" at a time when nato is going to assume added responsibility in afghanistan and pakistan , having a secretary general with such an objectionable approach to billions of muslims , is not the right approach to the muslim world . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's foreign minister -lrb- right -rrb- is an unlikely candidate turkey has also attacked denmark for failing to revoke the broadcasting license of a television station that ankara has accused of being a mouthpiece for kurdish rebels opposed to the government .
adding fuel to the fire , rasmussen had publicly stated in 2003 that he opposed full eu membership for turkey . " it may come to the veto , " retuers quoted the anonymous official as saying .
" we will have to see . " the chances for other candidates for nato 's number two position , however , are dwindling . polish candidate viewed as antagonistic to russia polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski was rumored to be a favorite for secretary general post , but the appointment of a pro-american polish national is viewed as antagonizing russia at a time when nato is seeking better relations with the kremlin . russia has been bitterly opposed to the deployment of a us anti-missile defense shield on polish territory . turkey had favored a canadian for the post , since ottawa supports ankara 's bid to join the eu .
however canadian defense minister peter mackay ruled himself out as a candidate on sunday . canadian ruled out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer 's successor should be announced at nato summit mackay 's rumored candidacy had the apparent support of us vice president joe biden as a reward for canada 's role in combat missions in dangerous southern afghanistan .
his spokesman , however , told reporters that the canadian never sought the post even though biden had downplayed an unwritten rule that the secretary general come from a european nation in exchange for nato 's top military post going to an american . the choice for the number two position as secretary general is expected to be named at the april 3-4 nato summit , but getting turkey to agree to the choice of rasmussen would be the key . df / sms / afp / reuters / send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if you 're itching for a place you can really call your own , ebay has just the thing - a village in saxony that can be yours for the modest price of 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 405,000 -rrb- . " why do n't you buy your own village ? " reads the text accompanying the somewhat unusual property listing on the auction web site .
indeed , why not ?
the asking price is a real bargain , especially if you consider that people routinely shell out 300,000 euros for an average-sized apartment in the city .
for the same amount , you could be the proud owner of liebon , a tiny village nestled in the state of saxony that has a history dating back to 1322 .
admittedly , tiny is the key adjective .
the village consists of three buildings , two road signs , and has a total area of just 15,000 square meters -lrb- 3.7 acres -rrb- - about the size of two football fields .
current population : eight .
one of those residents is karsten schmidt , 45 .
he lives in liebon with his wife and two children .
schmidt 's parents also live in the village , as does schmidt 's brother , who lives with his girlfriend .
rural idyll his describes liebon as a picture-book place - a farm with a big family home , a playground , a pond , a fountain and a tiny shop .
" the village is practically self-sufficient , " he told the bild newspaper .
" we planted an orchard in the big garden and we grow potatoes . "
despite the idyllic setting , schmidt says he 's ready to start packing the moving boxes if the family gets a decent offer .
" my two daughters are so far away from everything , " he said .
" my parents do n't have driving licenses , and you really depend on a car here . "
the nearest neighbors are some 1.5 kilometers away .
but schmidt says prospective new residents should n't worry about feeling too cut off from the world , as liebon has been kitted out with high-speed internet access . dc / nda / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the bombs dropped , germany ’ s armed forces joined in their first modern combat mission . then-chancellor gerhard schroeder had only been in office for a few months when he was called to explain germany 's participation in a nato bombing operation .
" overnight on thursday , nato launched air strikes against military targets in yugoslavia .
the alliance was compelled to take this step in order to prevent further heavy and systematic infringement of human rights in kosovo , " schroeder told the parliament .
it was the first time since world war ii that german soldiers had taken part in a combat mission .
for germany , the timing was complicated .
schroeder 's social democrats had just won a parliamentary majority together with the green party , forming a so-called red-green coalition .
one of their first decisions was whether to have the bundeswehr , which is what germany 's federal armed forces are called , participate in nato fighting .
from the beginning , schroeder was confident that he had political and public support for the mission .
" we are united and in agreement with the large majority of the german people and also - thank god - with a large majority of the german parliament , which cuts across all party lines , " schroeder said .
nato pressured milosevic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yugoslavia eventually pulled troops out of kosovo the weeks leading up to schroeder 's speech before parliament was had been turbulent ones .
the kosovo crisis was intensifying at the same time that the 16-year tenure of chancellor helmut kohl was coming to an end .
schroeder 's new coalition had not even had a chance to settle in before being hit with a series of major foreign policy decisions .
nato was turning up the heat on yugoslavian president slobodan milosevic , warning that it would launch air strikes if the expulsions and killings in kosovo continued .
nato general secretary javier solana issued a warning in the fall of 2008 : " just a few moments ago , the north atlantic council decided to issue activation orders - actords - for both a phased air campaign in yugoslavia and limited air operations . "
nato expected germany to make a contribution to the fighting .
the newly-elected parliament held a special meeting in october 1998 in bonn , germany .
a large majority of the delegates decided to allow bundeswehr troops to take part in nato air strikes , even without a united nations mandate .
deployment without a un mandate negotiations continued .
yugoslavian representatives meet with kosovo-albanians and nato in search of a solution .
germany 's new government , inexperienced in foreign policy , took a low-key approach , yet threw its support behind nato .
rudolf scharping , the secretary of defense for the social democrats , said at the time : " we want to do everything in our power to keep corpses from piling up in the balkans and to ensure that there is n't a new stream of refugees into europe . "
after yugoslavia refused to accept the rambouillet agreement , nato began bombing targets in belgrade and other serbian cities .
fourteen german tornado fighter planes were used for air reconnaissance and to attack serbian air defense positions .
this meant not only that german soldiers took an active role in fighting for the first time since the end of world war ii , but that they did so without a un mandate .
the german government justified its participation by saying it could not close its eyes to the suffering of the civilian population in kosovo .

the deployment was important , reinhardt said .
" in kosovo , external stability was important because milosevic had said each day : ‘ i will take my country back by force , " ' reinhardt said .
only when the situation is stable can political and economic conditions improve , the general said .
however , bringing stability to kosovo has taken much longer than anyone expected at the time .
the red-green coalition has been out of office for nearly four years , but there are still more than 2,500 german soldiers stationed in kosovo .

as the bombs dropped , germany ’ s armed forces joined in their first modern combat mission . then-chancellor gerhard schroeder had only been in office for a few months when he was called to explain germany 's participation in a nato bombing operation .
" overnight on thursday , nato launched air strikes against military targets in yugoslavia .
the alliance was compelled to take this step in order to prevent further heavy and systematic infringement of human rights in kosovo , " schroeder told the parliament .
it was the first time since world war ii that german soldiers had taken part in a combat mission .
for germany , the timing was complicated .
schroeder 's social democrats had just won a parliamentary majority together with the green party , forming a so-called red-green coalition .
one of their first decisions was whether to have the bundeswehr , which is what germany 's federal armed forces are called , participate in nato fighting .
from the beginning , schroeder was confident that he had political and public support for the mission .
" we are united and in agreement with the large majority of the german people and also - thank god - with a large majority of the german parliament , which cuts across all party lines , " schroeder said .
nato pressured milosevic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yugoslavia eventually pulled troops out of kosovo the weeks leading up to schroeder 's speech before parliament was had been turbulent ones .
the kosovo crisis was intensifying at the same time that the 16-year tenure of chancellor helmut kohl was coming to an end .
schroeder 's new coalition had not even had a chance to settle in before being hit with a series of major foreign policy decisions .
nato was turning up the heat on yugoslavian president slobodan milosevic , warning that it would launch air strikes if the expulsions and killings in kosovo continued .
nato general secretary javier solana issued a warning in the fall of 2008 : " just a few moments ago , the north atlantic council decided to issue activation orders - actords - for both a phased air campaign in yugoslavia and limited air operations . "
nato expected germany to make a contribution to the fighting .
the newly-elected parliament held a special meeting in october 1998 in bonn , germany .
a large majority of the delegates decided to allow bundeswehr troops to take part in nato air strikes , even without a united nations mandate .
deployment without a un mandate negotiations continued .
yugoslavian representatives meet with kosovo-albanians and nato in search of a solution .
germany 's new government , inexperienced in foreign policy , took a low-key approach , yet threw its support behind nato .
rudolf scharping , the secretary of defense for the social democrats , said at the time : " we want to do everything in our power to keep corpses from piling up in the balkans and to ensure that there is n't a new stream of refugees into europe . "
after yugoslavia refused to accept the rambouillet agreement , nato began bombing targets in belgrade and other serbian cities .
fourteen german tornado fighter planes were used for air reconnaissance and to attack serbian air defense positions .
this meant not only that german soldiers took an active role in fighting for the first time since the end of world war ii , but that they did so without a un mandate .
the german government justified its participation by saying it could not close its eyes to the suffering of the civilian population in kosovo .
not easy being green bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder , right , and fischer , left , both supported the kosovo war this policy change was particularly difficult for the green party , which historically has had close links to the peace movement .
angry demonstrators called top green politicians " murderers " as they arrived with police escorts for a party meeting in may of 1999 .
many long-time green supporters vehemently reject the use of military force , yet parliamentarian angelika beer defended party leaders from criticisms and insults being hurled at them .
the critics were cowardly , she said , and had no good alternatives to offer .
" those of you who are now yelling ‘ warmongers , ' would you have wanted us to turn a blind eye ? " she asked .
" how would you have wanted to justify it ? "
joschka fisher , the green 's foreign minister , found himself at the center of the criticism for his support of the war .
at one point a paint bomb was lobbed at his head , injuring him slightly .
" at this moment in time , i regard a one-sided , unlimited cessation of the bomb attacks as a wrong signal , " fischer said at one point .
germany still in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kfor still has soldiers in kosovo june of 1999 , milosevic withdrew his troops , allowing nato peacekeeping troops kfor to move in .
bundeswehr general klaus reinhardt was the commander of kfor for several years .
the deployment was important , reinhardt said .
" in kosovo , external stability was important because milosevic had said each day : ‘ i will take my country back by force , " ' reinhardt said .

if you 're itching for a place you can really call your own , ebay has just the thing - a village in saxony that can be yours for the modest price of 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 405,000 -rrb- . " why do n't you buy your own village ? " reads the text accompanying the somewhat unusual property listing on the auction web site .
indeed , why not ?
the asking price is a real bargain , especially if you consider that people routinely shell out 300,000 euros for an average-sized apartment in the city .
for the same amount , you could be the proud owner of liebon , a tiny village nestled in the state of saxony that has a history dating back to 1322 .
admittedly , tiny is the key adjective .
the village consists of three buildings , two road signs , and has a total area of just 15,000 square meters -lrb- 3.7 acres -rrb- - about the size of two football fields .
current population : eight .
one of those residents is karsten schmidt , 45 .
he lives in liebon with his wife and two children .
schmidt 's parents also live in the village , as does schmidt 's brother , who lives with his girlfriend .
rural idyll his describes liebon as a picture-book place - a farm with a big family home , a playground , a pond , a fountain and a tiny shop .
" the village is practically self-sufficient , " he told the bild newspaper .
" we planted an orchard in the big garden and we grow potatoes . "
despite the idyllic setting , schmidt says he 's ready to start packing the moving boxes if the family gets a decent offer .
" my two daughters are so far away from everything , " he said .
" my parents do n't have driving licenses , and you really depend on a car here . "
the nearest neighbors are some 1.5 kilometers away .
but schmidt says prospective new residents should n't worry about feeling too cut off from the world , as liebon has been kitted out with high-speed internet access . dc / nda / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the controversial cartoons , which were later republished by media around the globe , had sparked riots and attacks on danish embassies in the muslim world . cartoon controversy " the cartoon crisis has a larger dimension than just turkey , " a turkish official , who requested anonymity , told reuters .

a longstanding conflict has been the result - and reflects the situation in the country at large . belgium has been experiencing an ongoing political crisis for years .
rival parties are unable to reach agreement over the division of power and wealth between the richer , dutch-speaking province of flanders and the poorer , french-speaking region of wallonia . the country 's previous prime minister yves leterme failed in his efforts to decentralize power to the two regions in order to ease tensions between the flemish and the walloons .
it had meant amending the belgian constitution and leterme was unable to accomplish this . the new government under prime minister herman van rompuy , who took office at the end of 2008 , has been more concerned with the worldwide financial crisis . however , this paralysis over devolution is not really impacting most belgians , as stephen castle , a brussels-based journalist points out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's two regions also differ economically " this political crisis has been going on for a very long time , " castle says .
" frankly , people are used to it and possibly , apart from the politicians themselves are bored of it . " according to castle , even a paralyzed central government does n't really impact people 's day-to-day lives . " education continues , schools are open , hospitals are open , the garbage is cleared , " he says .
" from the practical point of view of most people , there really is very little impact . " not too worried namur is the capital of the french-speaking part of belgium , the region of wallonia .
at the central station , 30-year-old jean-francois says he has grown up with constant talk that belgium has no real future . " i 've heard this rumor since i was very little , " jean-francois says .
" belgium might disintegrate , but maybe people are seeing ghosts .
belgium has had an artificial side to it since its very beginnings . " jean-francois says he thinks the country could live like this for many years to come . " i think there are more serious problems than that , " he says . brussels must be resolved belgium is currently in the so-called sixth phase of a far-reaching political reform .
the process was started in the 1970s when the unitary belgian state became a federal state .
but here the division between regional politicians from the two sides goes deeper than they would in other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can van rompuy find a solution ?
" in order to make your name as a politician in belgium , you have to do that in your own community first , " castle says .
" if you 're , for example , a flemish politician like leterme , you really win no votes among your own core supporters by saying nice things about the francophone population in the south . " luc arnould is in charge of international relations at the city hall of namur .
he says that the country is n't likely to split unless the issue of brussels is resolved .
and he does n't see that happening anytime soon .
most people in the capital speak french but belong to the dutch-speaking part of the country . " we have to adapt the constitution and the way of working in belgium , but giving more and more autonomy to the regions , " arnould says .
" regions want to have more independence to organize their economies .
but there 's always the problem of brussels .
we need a lot of imagination to find a solution . " division remains a possibility many flemish people in brussels have no problem with living side by side with walloons .
bilingualism is a reality here in people 's daily lives , says this brussels native . " we speak both languages every day - french and dutch and english , " the man says .
" so there are no problems between the people here .
and in ten years ' time , the next generation will speak both languages all across belgium . " but the government turmoil has proven there is a problem between belgium 's communities on a political level .
journalist castle says partition remains a possibility , although it 's not likely anytime soon . " it would make it more difficult for belgium to be the center of the european union if it divided , " castle says .
" that would send a very poor message to a lot of countries which also have issues over devolution and how to divide up power .
i think there 's a general consensus that belgians are probably better off . " further devolution of power will be a long and arduous process .
but belgium 's politicians are used to treading warily when it comes to negotiating greater rights for their communities .

a longstanding conflict has been the result - and reflects the situation in the country at large . belgium has been experiencing an ongoing political crisis for years .
rival parties are unable to reach agreement over the division of power and wealth between the richer , dutch-speaking province of flanders and the poorer , french-speaking region of wallonia . the country 's previous prime minister yves leterme failed in his efforts to decentralize power to the two regions in order to ease tensions between the flemish and the walloons .
it had meant amending the belgian constitution and leterme was unable to accomplish this . the new government under prime minister herman van rompuy , who took office at the end of 2008 , has been more concerned with the worldwide financial crisis . however , this paralysis over devolution is not really impacting most belgians , as stephen castle , a brussels-based journalist points out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's two regions also differ economically " this political crisis has been going on for a very long time , " castle says .
" frankly , people are used to it and possibly , apart from the politicians themselves are bored of it . " according to castle , even a paralyzed central government does n't really impact people 's day-to-day lives . " education continues , schools are open , hospitals are open , the garbage is cleared , " he says .
" from the practical point of view of most people , there really is very little impact . " not too worried namur is the capital of the french-speaking part of belgium , the region of wallonia .
at the central station , 30-year-old jean-francois says he has grown up with constant talk that belgium has no real future . " i 've heard this rumor since i was very little , " jean-francois says .
" belgium might disintegrate , but maybe people are seeing ghosts .
belgium has had an artificial side to it since its very beginnings . " jean-francois says he thinks the country could live like this for many years to come . " i think there are more serious problems than that , " he says . brussels must be resolved belgium is currently in the so-called sixth phase of a far-reaching political reform .
the process was started in the 1970s when the unitary belgian state became a federal state .
but here the division between regional politicians from the two sides goes deeper than they would in other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can van rompuy find a solution ?
" in order to make your name as a politician in belgium , you have to do that in your own community first , " castle says .
" if you 're , for example , a flemish politician like leterme , you really win no votes among your own core supporters by saying nice things about the francophone population in the south . " luc arnould is in charge of international relations at the city hall of namur .
he says that the country is n't likely to split unless the issue of brussels is resolved .
and he does n't see that happening anytime soon .
most people in the capital speak french but belong to the dutch-speaking part of the country . " we have to adapt the constitution and the way of working in belgium , but giving more and more autonomy to the regions , " arnould says .
" regions want to have more independence to organize their economies .
but there 's always the problem of brussels .
we need a lot of imagination to find a solution . " division remains a possibility many flemish people in brussels have no problem with living side by side with walloons .
bilingualism is a reality here in people 's daily lives , says this brussels native . " we speak both languages every day - french and dutch and english , " the man says .
" so there are no problems between the people here .

ministers gathered at the same time to lay wreaths at spots where people were killed during the air war - at the time the biggest military operation in nato history .
" the attack on our country was illegal , contrary to international law , without a decision by the united nations " security council , prime minister mirko cvetkovic told a special commemorative sitting of his cabinet .
" the air strikes have not solved problems in kosovo , and did not help to bring peace and the rule of law .
" they resulted in ethnic cleansing and gross violations of human rights , international standards and fresh tensions , " he said , after schools held a minute 's silence before class .
kosovo leaders said however the nato bombing stopped serbian abuses in their breakaway territory and was a decisive step towards saving and freeing its people .
" the 78 days of strikes saved the people of kosovo from planned extermination , a scenario which was prepared coldly by the highest serb political and academic circles , " kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said .
kosovo prime minister hashim thaci described the bombing as " a big historic event for kosovo and the democratic world . "
" the successful completion of the campaign of intervention by nato opened a new chapter in the history of kosovo , a chapter of freedom , " said thaci .
anniversary of campaign to stop milosevic nato launched the strikes on march 24 , 1999 after milosevic refused to sign up to a peace deal to end his forces ' crackdown on the rebel kosovo liberation army -lrb- kla -rrb- and the ethnic albanian majority in the southern territory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic ordered a crackdown on kosovo 's rebels it set out to destroy military targets , and went on to strike infrastructure and the milosevic propaganda machine .
some strikes went astray , hitting scores of civilian sites and even china 's embassy in belgrade .
milosevic eventually conceded 78 days later , paving the way for nato to enter kosovo .
some 15,000 nato-led peacekeepers remain in kosovo , which 56 nations recognize after its ethnic albanian-dominated parliament declared unilateral independence from serbia 13 months ago .
as part of serbian commemorations , the bells of orthodox churches were to be tolled for the victims at 7:45 pm -lrb- 1845 gmt -rrb- - the moment nato 's first attacks were launched 10 years ago .
wounds still open in serbia separately , a hard-line nationalist group planned to stage an anti-nato rally in the main square of belgrade , according to posters that have gone up around serbia 's capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian protests have been violent in the past serbian media seized on the opportunity of the anniversary to rake over the coals of a conflict that may have ended a decade ago but one which remains very much in the national consciousness .
" serbs got bombs , the albanians got a state , " the daily blic said in its report .
belgrade contends that nato , by acting without a un mandate and by bombing civilian targets and using controversial ordnance , broke international laws because it was biased in favor of albanians .
human rights watch put the civilian death toll from the bombing campaign at around 500 .
milosevic 's government estimated the nato strikes killed more than 1,000 soldiers and 2,500 civilians , including 89 children , while 12,500 people were wounded and at least $ 30 billion in damage caused .
" a decade of the crime against serbia , " the daily press said , while politika wrote of the " bombing that was never declared a war . "
under the headline " days of death and destruction , " vecernje novosti recounted half a dozen personal stories , including those of families who lost children and of a military pilot who was shot down by nato .
health concerns also remain about the danger to civilians from weapons nato used during the campaign .
thousands risk life and limb from cluster bomblets still scattered across serbia as well as from depleted uranium , according to european non-governmental groups .
a " humanitarian intervention " many analysts contend the " humanitarian intervention " was necessary to prevent any recurrence of events like the 1995 srebrenica massacre by bosnian serbs of some 8,000 muslims - europe 's worst atrocity since world war ii .
up to 9,000 people were killed in kosovo 's 1998-1999 conflict , mostly ethnic albanians .

" i look back on that extraordinary last meeting with milosevic , with a feeling that what we did was necessary and the right thing to do , " richard holbrooke , who served as the united states special envoy to the balkans , told reporters on saturday .

in its 78 days of bombing , however , it also hit public infrastructure like bridges and railway tracks as well as homes , refugee convoys , a hospital and the chinese embassy in belgrade . human rights watch has estimated that about 500 civilians lost their lives during the bombing campaign , five times less than the yugoslav government claimed at the time . diverging views of war in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbs and kosovo albanians have very different feelings about nato 's intervention for ethnic albanians in kosovo , where they accounted for 90 percent of the region 's population despite being a minority in serbia overall , the war put a welcome end to their suffering at the hands of the serbian majority .

" " the air strikes have not solved problems in kosovo , and did not help to bring peace and the rule of law , " cvetkovic said at a special meeting of the cabinet to commemorate the attacks .
" on the contrary , they resulted in ethnic cleansing and gross violations of human rights , international standards and fresh tensions . " the alliance 's action , which was not sanctioned by the united nations security council , undermined milosevic 's power and is largely thought to have played a major role in his being sent to the hague to stand trial for war crimes .

" i look back on that extraordinary last meeting with milosevic , with a feeling that what we did was necessary and the right thing to do , " richard holbrooke , who served as the united states special envoy to the balkans , told reporters on saturday . " the people of kosovo are better off than they were as part of serbia , and serbia is better off facing the future rather than working back to a mythic past , " he added . then us president bill clinton also said at the time that the west had a " moral imperative " to take action against milosevic . the north atlantic treaty organization , in what was its largest military operation , set out to destroy dozens of targets .
in its 78 days of bombing , however , it also hit public infrastructure like bridges and railway tracks as well as homes , refugee convoys , a hospital and the chinese embassy in belgrade . human rights watch has estimated that about 500 civilians lost their lives during the bombing campaign , five times less than the yugoslav government claimed at the time . diverging views of war in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbs and kosovo albanians have very different feelings about nato 's intervention for ethnic albanians in kosovo , where they accounted for 90 percent of the region 's population despite being a minority in serbia overall , the war put a welcome end to their suffering at the hands of the serbian majority . " the appearance of combat airplanes in the sky above kosovo was a message of salvation for the people here , " kosovo justice minister nekibe kelmendi told afp . but for the serb minority , the campaign marked the beginning of their agony . " it was revenge for serbian disobedience , " said radoslav radovic , a 57-year-old from the serb-run half of kosovska mitrovica , a northern town that still simmers with ethnic tensions . radovic told afp he believes the west declared serbia guilty for " defending its integrity and its territory . " fearing ethnic albanian reprisals , tens of thousands of kosovo serbs fled their homes for serbia proper , with only a handful returning in the past decade .

the 15-nation security council has not been able to alter the un mandate because its members are split over what to do with the un presence there and the legality of pristina 's declaration of independence . russia , a permanent veto-wielding member of the security council and serbia 's ally , has said it would not recognize an independent kosovo and has supported belgrade 's bid to challenge the declaration before the international court of justice in the hague . under a plan agreed to last year , police , customs officers and judges in the serb-run areas of kosovo remain under the un umbrella , known as unmik , while their albanian counterparts work with a european union police and justice mission called eulex . many kosovo albanians have come to view the un presence as an obstacle to independence , un secretary-general ban ki-moon said in a report published thursday . " there is a perception among many kosovo albanians that the mission 's tasks have been accomplished and its continued presence is an unwelcome obstacle to the desire for kosovo to function as a sovereign state , " ban said in his latest report to the security council on un activities in kosovo . ban 's report did not make recommendations on how to move forward as uncertainty in the region appears likely to continue . sms / tt / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

currently , some 3.5 million germans are registered as unemployed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a million more germans may have to update their resumes by 2010 , one expert said the nation 's gdp could contract by 4 percent to 4.5 percent this year , according to an internal economics ministry report cited by the bild newspaper on tuesday , march 24 .
in january , the ministry predicted a contraction of only 2.25 percent for this year .
a new forecast will be issued next month . wto predicts contraction in trade this gloomy news for germany is in keeping with similarly dismal economic outlooks around the world as the effects of the global economic crisis make themselves felt . " the global economy 's sharp slowdown is affecting german economic production more and more , " said the country 's central bank in its monthly report released on monday . also on monday , the world trade organization said the volume of global trade is expected to contract by 9 percent in 2009 , the largest such contraction since world war ii and significantly worse than previously predicted . the contraction in developed countries would be particularly severe , with exports falling by 10 percent this year , while in developing countries , exports would shrink by some 2 percent to 3 percent , according to a statement released by the wto . such a drastic fall in international trade would be especially detrimental to germany 's already suffering export-driven economy . merkel addresses german bankers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could take a decade to rebuild the economy , merkel said speaking to bankers in berlin on monday , german chancellor angela merkel said she expects it will take the country a decade to rebuild the economic system after the state was forced to intervene and pass a stimulus spending package to sustain the economy through the downturn . merkel said this degree of interference in the free market would have to be reversed as soon as the financial crisis was under control , and taxpayers given back what they paid to save the economic system . dc / sms / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" " the air strikes have not solved problems in kosovo , and did not help to bring peace and the rule of law , " cvetkovic said at a special meeting of the cabinet to commemorate the attacks .
" on the contrary , they resulted in ethnic cleansing and gross violations of human rights , international standards and fresh tensions .

in its 78 days of bombing , however , it also hit public infrastructure like bridges and railway tracks as well as homes , refugee convoys , a hospital and the chinese embassy in belgrade . human rights watch has estimated that about 500 civilians lost their lives during the bombing campaign , five times less than the yugoslav government claimed at the time . diverging views of war in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbs and kosovo albanians have very different feelings about nato 's intervention for ethnic albanians in kosovo , where they accounted for 90 percent of the region 's population despite being a minority in serbia overall , the war put a welcome end to their suffering at the hands of the serbian majority .

experts say the economy will contract by up to 7 percent , and push unemployment up to 4.75 million by the end of 2010 . germany 's commerzbank has warned that the economic downturn will have a harsher effect on the country 's development than predicted at the start of the year . joerg kraemer , chief economist at commerzbank , told the berliner zeitung that in light of plunging order intakes among german companies , germany 's economy would shrink by as much as 7 percent this year . the number of unemployed can be expected to grow by more than 1.5 million within a two-year period , kraemer said , adding that by the end of 2010 , germany will be nearing the 5 million mark .
currently , some 3.5 million germans are registered as unemployed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a million more germans may have to update their resumes by 2010 , one expert said the nation 's gdp could contract by 4 percent to 4.5 percent this year , according to an internal economics ministry report cited by the bild newspaper on tuesday , march 24 .
in january , the ministry predicted a contraction of only 2.25 percent for this year .
a new forecast will be issued next month . wto predicts contraction in trade this gloomy news for germany is in keeping with similarly dismal economic outlooks around the world as the effects of the global economic crisis make themselves felt . " the global economy 's sharp slowdown is affecting german economic production more and more , " said the country 's central bank in its monthly report released on monday . also on monday , the world trade organization said the volume of global trade is expected to contract by 9 percent in 2009 , the largest such contraction since world war ii and significantly worse than previously predicted . the contraction in developed countries would be particularly severe , with exports falling by 10 percent this year , while in developing countries , exports would shrink by some 2 percent to 3 percent , according to a statement released by the wto . such a drastic fall in international trade would be especially detrimental to germany 's already suffering export-driven economy . merkel addresses german bankers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could take a decade to rebuild the economy , merkel said speaking to bankers in berlin on monday , german chancellor angela merkel said she expects it will take the country a decade to rebuild the economic system after the state was forced to intervene and pass a stimulus spending package to sustain the economy through the downturn . merkel said this degree of interference in the free market would have to be reversed as soon as the financial crisis was under control , and taxpayers given back what they paid to save the economic system . dc / sms / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" rasmussen was at the head of the list for the former bush administration , just as he is for the current obama administration , " analyst daniel korski said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish caricatures inflamed passions in the muslim world " the americans want someone who will continue to push for military engagement in afghanistan , " he said , pointing out that denmark has some 750 soldiers stationed in the volatile southern part of the country where the taliban insurgency is most active . us and european support however does not guarantee that rasmussen will become the appointed successor to scheffer . turkish opposition possible the main snag to rasmussen 's nomination , which needs to be approved by all members of the 26-nation alliance , is possible opposition to his candidacy from turkey , a secular nation that is predominantly muslim . denmark had outraged muslims around the world in 2005 when the widely circulated jyllands-posten newspaper published a series of cartoon caricatures depicting the prophet muhammad as a terrorist . rasmussen , who has been prime minister since 2001 , had refused to apologize for the cartoons invoking the right of the press to freedom of expression .
the controversial cartoons , which were later republished by media around the globe , had sparked riots and attacks on danish embassies in the muslim world . cartoon controversy " the cartoon crisis has a larger dimension than just turkey , " a turkish official , who requested anonymity , told reuters .
" at a time when nato is going to assume added responsibility in afghanistan and pakistan , having a secretary general with such an objectionable approach to billions of muslims , is not the right approach to the muslim world . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's foreign minister -lrb- right -rrb- is an unlikely candidate turkey has also attacked denmark for failing to revoke the broadcasting license of a television station that ankara has accused of being a mouthpiece for kurdish rebels opposed to the government .
adding fuel to the fire , rasmussen had publicly stated in 2003 that he opposed full eu membership for turkey . " it may come to the veto , " retuers quoted the anonymous official as saying .
" we will have to see . " the chances for other candidates for nato 's number two position , however , are dwindling . polish candidate viewed as antagonistic to russia polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski was rumored to be a favorite for secretary general post , but the appointment of a pro-american polish national is viewed as antagonizing russia at a time when nato is seeking better relations with the kremlin . russia has been bitterly opposed to the deployment of a us anti-missile defense shield on polish territory . turkey had favored a canadian for the post , since ottawa supports ankara 's bid to join the eu .
however canadian defense minister peter mackay ruled himself out as a candidate on sunday . canadian ruled out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer 's successor should be announced at nato summit mackay 's rumored candidacy had the apparent support of us vice president joe biden as a reward for canada 's role in combat missions in dangerous southern afghanistan .
his spokesman , however , told reporters that the canadian never sought the post even though biden had downplayed an unwritten rule that the secretary general come from a european nation in exchange for nato 's top military post going to an american . the choice for the number two position as secretary general is expected to be named at the april 3-4 nato summit , but getting turkey to agree to the choice of rasmussen would be the key . df / sms / afp / reuters / send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ministers gathered at the same time to lay wreaths at spots where people were killed during the air war - at the time the biggest military operation in nato history .
" the attack on our country was illegal , contrary to international law , without a decision by the united nations " security council , prime minister mirko cvetkovic told a special commemorative sitting of his cabinet .
" the air strikes have not solved problems in kosovo , and did not help to bring peace and the rule of law .
" they resulted in ethnic cleansing and gross violations of human rights , international standards and fresh tensions , " he said , after schools held a minute 's silence before class .
kosovo leaders said however the nato bombing stopped serbian abuses in their breakaway territory and was a decisive step towards saving and freeing its people .
" the 78 days of strikes saved the people of kosovo from planned extermination , a scenario which was prepared coldly by the highest serb political and academic circles , " kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said .
kosovo prime minister hashim thaci described the bombing as " a big historic event for kosovo and the democratic world . "
" the successful completion of the campaign of intervention by nato opened a new chapter in the history of kosovo , a chapter of freedom , " said thaci .
anniversary of campaign to stop milosevic nato launched the strikes on march 24 , 1999 after milosevic refused to sign up to a peace deal to end his forces ' crackdown on the rebel kosovo liberation army -lrb- kla -rrb- and the ethnic albanian majority in the southern territory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic ordered a crackdown on kosovo 's rebels it set out to destroy military targets , and went on to strike infrastructure and the milosevic propaganda machine .
some strikes went astray , hitting scores of civilian sites and even china 's embassy in belgrade .
milosevic eventually conceded 78 days later , paving the way for nato to enter kosovo .
some 15,000 nato-led peacekeepers remain in kosovo , which 56 nations recognize after its ethnic albanian-dominated parliament declared unilateral independence from serbia 13 months ago .
as part of serbian commemorations , the bells of orthodox churches were to be tolled for the victims at 7:45 pm -lrb- 1845 gmt -rrb- - the moment nato 's first attacks were launched 10 years ago .
wounds still open in serbia separately , a hard-line nationalist group planned to stage an anti-nato rally in the main square of belgrade , according to posters that have gone up around serbia 's capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian protests have been violent in the past serbian media seized on the opportunity of the anniversary to rake over the coals of a conflict that may have ended a decade ago but one which remains very much in the national consciousness .
" serbs got bombs , the albanians got a state , " the daily blic said in its report .
belgrade contends that nato , by acting without a un mandate and by bombing civilian targets and using controversial ordnance , broke international laws because it was biased in favor of albanians .
human rights watch put the civilian death toll from the bombing campaign at around 500 .
milosevic 's government estimated the nato strikes killed more than 1,000 soldiers and 2,500 civilians , including 89 children , while 12,500 people were wounded and at least $ 30 billion in damage caused .
" a decade of the crime against serbia , " the daily press said , while politika wrote of the " bombing that was never declared a war . "
under the headline " days of death and destruction , " vecernje novosti recounted half a dozen personal stories , including those of families who lost children and of a military pilot who was shot down by nato .
health concerns also remain about the danger to civilians from weapons nato used during the campaign .
thousands risk life and limb from cluster bomblets still scattered across serbia as well as from depleted uranium , according to european non-governmental groups .
a " humanitarian intervention " many analysts contend the " humanitarian intervention " was necessary to prevent any recurrence of events like the 1995 srebrenica massacre by bosnian serbs of some 8,000 muslims - europe 's worst atrocity since world war ii .
up to 9,000 people were killed in kosovo 's 1998-1999 conflict , mostly ethnic albanians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some blame inaction for the events which led to srebrenica " what is often forgotten about the bombing is the context and the context was the failure to act in bosnia , culminating in the srebrenica massacre , " tim judah , a prominent british author on the balkan wars of the 1990s .
" the kla were no angels but srebrenica changed everything .
after that there was no guarantee that serbian forces might not do such a thing again , " judah told reporters .
" as to whether it was worth it - a classic ' what if ' of history .
it was short -lrb- ish -rrb- and brutal but if it had not been for the bombing we might still be living with a rumbling and brutal insurgency and low level conflict . " nda / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the asking price is a real bargain , especially if you consider that people routinely shell out 300,000 euros for an average-sized apartment in the city .
for the same amount , you could be the proud owner of liebon , a tiny village nestled in the state of saxony that has a history dating back to 1322 .
admittedly , tiny is the key adjective .
the village consists of three buildings , two road signs , and has a total area of just 15,000 square meters -lrb- 3.7 acres -rrb- - about the size of two football fields .
current population : eight .
one of those residents is karsten schmidt , 45 .
he lives in liebon with his wife and two children .
schmidt 's parents also live in the village , as does schmidt 's brother , who lives with his girlfriend .
rural idyll his describes liebon as a picture-book place - a farm with a big family home , a playground , a pond , a fountain and a tiny shop .
" the village is practically self-sufficient , " he told the bild newspaper .
" we planted an orchard in the big garden and we grow potatoes . "
despite the idyllic setting , schmidt says he 's ready to start packing the moving boxes if the family gets a decent offer .
" my two daughters are so far away from everything , " he said .
" my parents do n't have driving licenses , and you really depend on a car here . "

as the bombs dropped , germany ’ s armed forces joined in their first modern combat mission . then-chancellor gerhard schroeder had only been in office for a few months when he was called to explain germany 's participation in a nato bombing operation .
" overnight on thursday , nato launched air strikes against military targets in yugoslavia .
the alliance was compelled to take this step in order to prevent further heavy and systematic infringement of human rights in kosovo , " schroeder told the parliament .
it was the first time since world war ii that german soldiers had taken part in a combat mission .
for germany , the timing was complicated .
schroeder 's social democrats had just won a parliamentary majority together with the green party , forming a so-called red-green coalition .
one of their first decisions was whether to have the bundeswehr , which is what germany 's federal armed forces are called , participate in nato fighting .
from the beginning , schroeder was confident that he had political and public support for the mission .
" we are united and in agreement with the large majority of the german people and also - thank god - with a large majority of the german parliament , which cuts across all party lines , " schroeder said .
nato pressured milosevic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yugoslavia eventually pulled troops out of kosovo the weeks leading up to schroeder 's speech before parliament was had been turbulent ones .
the kosovo crisis was intensifying at the same time that the 16-year tenure of chancellor helmut kohl was coming to an end .
schroeder 's new coalition had not even had a chance to settle in before being hit with a series of major foreign policy decisions .
nato was turning up the heat on yugoslavian president slobodan milosevic , warning that it would launch air strikes if the expulsions and killings in kosovo continued .
nato general secretary javier solana issued a warning in the fall of 2008 : " just a few moments ago , the north atlantic council decided to issue activation orders - actords - for both a phased air campaign in yugoslavia and limited air operations . "
nato expected germany to make a contribution to the fighting .
the newly-elected parliament held a special meeting in october 1998 in bonn , germany .
a large majority of the delegates decided to allow bundeswehr troops to take part in nato air strikes , even without a united nations mandate .
deployment without a un mandate negotiations continued .
yugoslavian representatives meet with kosovo-albanians and nato in search of a solution .
germany 's new government , inexperienced in foreign policy , took a low-key approach , yet threw its support behind nato .
rudolf scharping , the secretary of defense for the social democrats , said at the time : " we want to do everything in our power to keep corpses from piling up in the balkans and to ensure that there is n't a new stream of refugees into europe . "
after yugoslavia refused to accept the rambouillet agreement , nato began bombing targets in belgrade and other serbian cities .
fourteen german tornado fighter planes were used for air reconnaissance and to attack serbian air defense positions .
this meant not only that german soldiers took an active role in fighting for the first time since the end of world war ii , but that they did so without a un mandate .
the german government justified its participation by saying it could not close its eyes to the suffering of the civilian population in kosovo .
not easy being green bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder , right , and fischer , left , both supported the kosovo war this policy change was particularly difficult for the green party , which historically has had close links to the peace movement .
angry demonstrators called top green politicians " murderers " as they arrived with police escorts for a party meeting in may of 1999 .
many long-time green supporters vehemently reject the use of military force , yet parliamentarian angelika beer defended party leaders from criticisms and insults being hurled at them .
the critics were cowardly , she said , and had no good alternatives to offer .
" those of you who are now yelling ‘ warmongers , ' would you have wanted us to turn a blind eye ? " she asked .
" how would you have wanted to justify it ? "
joschka fisher , the green 's foreign minister , found himself at the center of the criticism for his support of the war .
at one point a paint bomb was lobbed at his head , injuring him slightly .
" at this moment in time , i regard a one-sided , unlimited cessation of the bomb attacks as a wrong signal , " fischer said at one point .
germany still in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kfor still has soldiers in kosovo june of 1999 , milosevic withdrew his troops , allowing nato peacekeeping troops kfor to move in .
bundeswehr general klaus reinhardt was the commander of kfor for several years .
the deployment was important , reinhardt said .
" in kosovo , external stability was important because milosevic had said each day : ‘ i will take my country back by force , " ' reinhardt said .
only when the situation is stable can political and economic conditions improve , the general said .
however , bringing stability to kosovo has taken much longer than anyone expected at the time .
the red-green coalition has been out of office for nearly four years , but there are still more than 2,500 german soldiers stationed in kosovo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 24.03.2009 air-raid sirens mark nato bombing of serbia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the short 1999 war led to nato taking control of kosovo air-raid sirens wailed tuesday as serbia marked the 10th anniversary of nato 's bombing campaign against the regime of late president slobodan milosevic to halt its violent kosovo crackdown . solemn ceremonies were held at belgrade monuments to children and journalists killed in the nato sorties as the sirens were sounded across the ex-yugoslav republic for 60 seconds from midday -lrb- 1200 cet -rrb- .
ministers gathered at the same time to lay wreaths at spots where people were killed during the air war - at the time the biggest military operation in nato history .
" the attack on our country was illegal , contrary to international law , without a decision by the united nations " security council , prime minister mirko cvetkovic told a special commemorative sitting of his cabinet .
" the air strikes have not solved problems in kosovo , and did not help to bring peace and the rule of law .
" they resulted in ethnic cleansing and gross violations of human rights , international standards and fresh tensions , " he said , after schools held a minute 's silence before class .
kosovo leaders said however the nato bombing stopped serbian abuses in their breakaway territory and was a decisive step towards saving and freeing its people .
" the 78 days of strikes saved the people of kosovo from planned extermination , a scenario which was prepared coldly by the highest serb political and academic circles , " kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said .
kosovo prime minister hashim thaci described the bombing as " a big historic event for kosovo and the democratic world . "
" the successful completion of the campaign of intervention by nato opened a new chapter in the history of kosovo , a chapter of freedom , " said thaci .
anniversary of campaign to stop milosevic nato launched the strikes on march 24 , 1999 after milosevic refused to sign up to a peace deal to end his forces ' crackdown on the rebel kosovo liberation army -lrb- kla -rrb- and the ethnic albanian majority in the southern territory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic ordered a crackdown on kosovo 's rebels it set out to destroy military targets , and went on to strike infrastructure and the milosevic propaganda machine .
some strikes went astray , hitting scores of civilian sites and even china 's embassy in belgrade .
milosevic eventually conceded 78 days later , paving the way for nato to enter kosovo .
some 15,000 nato-led peacekeepers remain in kosovo , which 56 nations recognize after its ethnic albanian-dominated parliament declared unilateral independence from serbia 13 months ago .
as part of serbian commemorations , the bells of orthodox churches were to be tolled for the victims at 7:45 pm -lrb- 1845 gmt -rrb- - the moment nato 's first attacks were launched 10 years ago .
wounds still open in serbia separately , a hard-line nationalist group planned to stage an anti-nato rally in the main square of belgrade , according to posters that have gone up around serbia 's capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian protests have been violent in the past serbian media seized on the opportunity of the anniversary to rake over the coals of a conflict that may have ended a decade ago but one which remains very much in the national consciousness .
" serbs got bombs , the albanians got a state , " the daily blic said in its report .
belgrade contends that nato , by acting without a un mandate and by bombing civilian targets and using controversial ordnance , broke international laws because it was biased in favor of albanians .
human rights watch put the civilian death toll from the bombing campaign at around 500 .
milosevic 's government estimated the nato strikes killed more than 1,000 soldiers and 2,500 civilians , including 89 children , while 12,500 people were wounded and at least $ 30 billion in damage caused .
" a decade of the crime against serbia , " the daily press said , while politika wrote of the " bombing that was never declared a war . "
under the headline " days of death and destruction , " vecernje novosti recounted half a dozen personal stories , including those of families who lost children and of a military pilot who was shot down by nato .
health concerns also remain about the danger to civilians from weapons nato used during the campaign .
thousands risk life and limb from cluster bomblets still scattered across serbia as well as from depleted uranium , according to european non-governmental groups .
a " humanitarian intervention " many analysts contend the " humanitarian intervention " was necessary to prevent any recurrence of events like the 1995 srebrenica massacre by bosnian serbs of some 8,000 muslims - europe 's worst atrocity since world war ii .
up to 9,000 people were killed in kosovo 's 1998-1999 conflict , mostly ethnic albanians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some blame inaction for the events which led to srebrenica " what is often forgotten about the bombing is the context and the context was the failure to act in bosnia , culminating in the srebrenica massacre , " tim judah , a prominent british author on the balkan wars of the 1990s .
" the kla were no angels but srebrenica changed everything .
after that there was no guarantee that serbian forces might not do such a thing again , " judah told reporters .
" as to whether it was worth it - a classic ' what if ' of history .
it was short -lrb- ish -rrb- and brutal but if it had not been for the bombing we might still be living with a rumbling and brutal insurgency and low level conflict . " nda / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ministers gathered at the same time to lay wreaths at spots where people were killed during the air war - at the time the biggest military operation in nato history .
" the attack on our country was illegal , contrary to international law , without a decision by the united nations " security council , prime minister mirko cvetkovic told a special commemorative sitting of his cabinet .
" the air strikes have not solved problems in kosovo , and did not help to bring peace and the rule of law .
" they resulted in ethnic cleansing and gross violations of human rights , international standards and fresh tensions , " he said , after schools held a minute 's silence before class .
kosovo leaders said however the nato bombing stopped serbian abuses in their breakaway territory and was a decisive step towards saving and freeing its people .
" the 78 days of strikes saved the people of kosovo from planned extermination , a scenario which was prepared coldly by the highest serb political and academic circles , " kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said .
kosovo prime minister hashim thaci described the bombing as " a big historic event for kosovo and the democratic world . "
" the successful completion of the campaign of intervention by nato opened a new chapter in the history of kosovo , a chapter of freedom , " said thaci .
anniversary of campaign to stop milosevic nato launched the strikes on march 24 , 1999 after milosevic refused to sign up to a peace deal to end his forces ' crackdown on the rebel kosovo liberation army -lrb- kla -rrb- and the ethnic albanian majority in the southern territory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic ordered a crackdown on kosovo 's rebels it set out to destroy military targets , and went on to strike infrastructure and the milosevic propaganda machine .
some strikes went astray , hitting scores of civilian sites and even china 's embassy in belgrade .
milosevic eventually conceded 78 days later , paving the way for nato to enter kosovo .
some 15,000 nato-led peacekeepers remain in kosovo , which 56 nations recognize after its ethnic albanian-dominated parliament declared unilateral independence from serbia 13 months ago .
as part of serbian commemorations , the bells of orthodox churches were to be tolled for the victims at 7:45 pm -lrb- 1845 gmt -rrb- - the moment nato 's first attacks were launched 10 years ago .
wounds still open in serbia separately , a hard-line nationalist group planned to stage an anti-nato rally in the main square of belgrade , according to posters that have gone up around serbia 's capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian protests have been violent in the past serbian media seized on the opportunity of the anniversary to rake over the coals of a conflict that may have ended a decade ago but one which remains very much in the national consciousness .
" serbs got bombs , the albanians got a state , " the daily blic said in its report .
belgrade contends that nato , by acting without a un mandate and by bombing civilian targets and using controversial ordnance , broke international laws because it was biased in favor of albanians .
human rights watch put the civilian death toll from the bombing campaign at around 500 .
milosevic 's government estimated the nato strikes killed more than 1,000 soldiers and 2,500 civilians , including 89 children , while 12,500 people were wounded and at least $ 30 billion in damage caused .
" a decade of the crime against serbia , " the daily press said , while politika wrote of the " bombing that was never declared a war . "
under the headline " days of death and destruction , " vecernje novosti recounted half a dozen personal stories , including those of families who lost children and of a military pilot who was shot down by nato .
health concerns also remain about the danger to civilians from weapons nato used during the campaign .
thousands risk life and limb from cluster bomblets still scattered across serbia as well as from depleted uranium , according to european non-governmental groups .
a " humanitarian intervention " many analysts contend the " humanitarian intervention " was necessary to prevent any recurrence of events like the 1995 srebrenica massacre by bosnian serbs of some 8,000 muslims - europe 's worst atrocity since world war ii .
up to 9,000 people were killed in kosovo 's 1998-1999 conflict , mostly ethnic albanians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some blame inaction for the events which led to srebrenica " what is often forgotten about the bombing is the context and the context was the failure to act in bosnia , culminating in the srebrenica massacre , " tim judah , a prominent british author on the balkan wars of the 1990s .
" the kla were no angels but srebrenica changed everything .
after that there was no guarantee that serbian forces might not do such a thing again , " judah told reporters .
" as to whether it was worth it - a classic ' what if ' of history .
it was short -lrb- ish -rrb- and brutal but if it had not been for the bombing we might still be living with a rumbling and brutal insurgency and low level conflict . " nda / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a longstanding conflict has been the result - and reflects the situation in the country at large . belgium has been experiencing an ongoing political crisis for years .
rival parties are unable to reach agreement over the division of power and wealth between the richer , dutch-speaking province of flanders and the poorer , french-speaking region of wallonia . the country 's previous prime minister yves leterme failed in his efforts to decentralize power to the two regions in order to ease tensions between the flemish and the walloons .
it had meant amending the belgian constitution and leterme was unable to accomplish this . the new government under prime minister herman van rompuy , who took office at the end of 2008 , has been more concerned with the worldwide financial crisis . however , this paralysis over devolution is not really impacting most belgians , as stephen castle , a brussels-based journalist points out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's two regions also differ economically " this political crisis has been going on for a very long time , " castle says .
" frankly , people are used to it and possibly , apart from the politicians themselves are bored of it . " according to castle , even a paralyzed central government does n't really impact people 's day-to-day lives . " education continues , schools are open , hospitals are open , the garbage is cleared , " he says .
" from the practical point of view of most people , there really is very little impact . " not too worried namur is the capital of the french-speaking part of belgium , the region of wallonia .
at the central station , 30-year-old jean-francois says he has grown up with constant talk that belgium has no real future . " i 've heard this rumor since i was very little , " jean-francois says .
" belgium might disintegrate , but maybe people are seeing ghosts .
belgium has had an artificial side to it since its very beginnings . " jean-francois says he thinks the country could live like this for many years to come . " i think there are more serious problems than that , " he says . brussels must be resolved belgium is currently in the so-called sixth phase of a far-reaching political reform .
the process was started in the 1970s when the unitary belgian state became a federal state .
but here the division between regional politicians from the two sides goes deeper than they would in other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can van rompuy find a solution ?
" in order to make your name as a politician in belgium , you have to do that in your own community first , " castle says .
" if you 're , for example , a flemish politician like leterme , you really win no votes among your own core supporters by saying nice things about the francophone population in the south . " luc arnould is in charge of international relations at the city hall of namur .
he says that the country is n't likely to split unless the issue of brussels is resolved .
and he does n't see that happening anytime soon .
most people in the capital speak french but belong to the dutch-speaking part of the country . " we have to adapt the constitution and the way of working in belgium , but giving more and more autonomy to the regions , " arnould says .
" regions want to have more independence to organize their economies .
but there 's always the problem of brussels .
we need a lot of imagination to find a solution . " division remains a possibility many flemish people in brussels have no problem with living side by side with walloons .
bilingualism is a reality here in people 's daily lives , says this brussels native . " we speak both languages every day - french and dutch and english , " the man says .
" so there are no problems between the people here .
and in ten years ' time , the next generation will speak both languages all across belgium . " but the government turmoil has proven there is a problem between belgium 's communities on a political level .
journalist castle says partition remains a possibility , although it 's not likely anytime soon . " it would make it more difficult for belgium to be the center of the european union if it divided , " castle says .
" that would send a very poor message to a lot of countries which also have issues over devolution and how to divide up power .
i think there 's a general consensus that belgians are probably better off . " further devolution of power will be a long and arduous process .
but belgium 's politicians are used to treading warily when it comes to negotiating greater rights for their communities .

a longstanding conflict has been the result - and reflects the situation in the country at large . belgium has been experiencing an ongoing political crisis for years .
rival parties are unable to reach agreement over the division of power and wealth between the richer , dutch-speaking province of flanders and the poorer , french-speaking region of wallonia . the country 's previous prime minister yves leterme failed in his efforts to decentralize power to the two regions in order to ease tensions between the flemish and the walloons .
it had meant amending the belgian constitution and leterme was unable to accomplish this . the new government under prime minister herman van rompuy , who took office at the end of 2008 , has been more concerned with the worldwide financial crisis . however , this paralysis over devolution is not really impacting most belgians , as stephen castle , a brussels-based journalist points out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's two regions also differ economically " this political crisis has been going on for a very long time , " castle says .
" frankly , people are used to it and possibly , apart from the politicians themselves are bored of it . " according to castle , even a paralyzed central government does n't really impact people 's day-to-day lives . " education continues , schools are open , hospitals are open , the garbage is cleared , " he says .
" from the practical point of view of most people , there really is very little impact . " not too worried namur is the capital of the french-speaking part of belgium , the region of wallonia .
at the central station , 30-year-old jean-francois says he has grown up with constant talk that belgium has no real future . " i 've heard this rumor since i was very little , " jean-francois says .
" belgium might disintegrate , but maybe people are seeing ghosts .
belgium has had an artificial side to it since its very beginnings . " jean-francois says he thinks the country could live like this for many years to come . " i think there are more serious problems than that , " he says . brussels must be resolved belgium is currently in the so-called sixth phase of a far-reaching political reform .
the process was started in the 1970s when the unitary belgian state became a federal state .
but here the division between regional politicians from the two sides goes deeper than they would in other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can van rompuy find a solution ?
" in order to make your name as a politician in belgium , you have to do that in your own community first , " castle says .
" if you 're , for example , a flemish politician like leterme , you really win no votes among your own core supporters by saying nice things about the francophone population in the south . " luc arnould is in charge of international relations at the city hall of namur .
he says that the country is n't likely to split unless the issue of brussels is resolved .
and he does n't see that happening anytime soon .
most people in the capital speak french but belong to the dutch-speaking part of the country . " we have to adapt the constitution and the way of working in belgium , but giving more and more autonomy to the regions , " arnould says .
" regions want to have more independence to organize their economies .
but there 's always the problem of brussels .
we need a lot of imagination to find a solution . " division remains a possibility many flemish people in brussels have no problem with living side by side with walloons .

ministers gathered at the same time to lay wreaths at spots where people were killed during the air war - at the time the biggest military operation in nato history .
" the attack on our country was illegal , contrary to international law , without a decision by the united nations " security council , prime minister mirko cvetkovic told a special commemorative sitting of his cabinet .
" the air strikes have not solved problems in kosovo , and did not help to bring peace and the rule of law .
" they resulted in ethnic cleansing and gross violations of human rights , international standards and fresh tensions , " he said , after schools held a minute 's silence before class .
kosovo leaders said however the nato bombing stopped serbian abuses in their breakaway territory and was a decisive step towards saving and freeing its people .
" the 78 days of strikes saved the people of kosovo from planned extermination , a scenario which was prepared coldly by the highest serb political and academic circles , " kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said .
kosovo prime minister hashim thaci described the bombing as " a big historic event for kosovo and the democratic world . "
" the successful completion of the campaign of intervention by nato opened a new chapter in the history of kosovo , a chapter of freedom , " said thaci .
anniversary of campaign to stop milosevic nato launched the strikes on march 24 , 1999 after milosevic refused to sign up to a peace deal to end his forces ' crackdown on the rebel kosovo liberation army -lrb- kla -rrb- and the ethnic albanian majority in the southern territory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic ordered a crackdown on kosovo 's rebels it set out to destroy military targets , and went on to strike infrastructure and the milosevic propaganda machine .
some strikes went astray , hitting scores of civilian sites and even china 's embassy in belgrade .
milosevic eventually conceded 78 days later , paving the way for nato to enter kosovo .
some 15,000 nato-led peacekeepers remain in kosovo , which 56 nations recognize after its ethnic albanian-dominated parliament declared unilateral independence from serbia 13 months ago .
as part of serbian commemorations , the bells of orthodox churches were to be tolled for the victims at 7:45 pm -lrb- 1845 gmt -rrb- - the moment nato 's first attacks were launched 10 years ago .
wounds still open in serbia separately , a hard-line nationalist group planned to stage an anti-nato rally in the main square of belgrade , according to posters that have gone up around serbia 's capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian protests have been violent in the past serbian media seized on the opportunity of the anniversary to rake over the coals of a conflict that may have ended a decade ago but one which remains very much in the national consciousness .
" serbs got bombs , the albanians got a state , " the daily blic said in its report .
belgrade contends that nato , by acting without a un mandate and by bombing civilian targets and using controversial ordnance , broke international laws because it was biased in favor of albanians .
human rights watch put the civilian death toll from the bombing campaign at around 500 .
milosevic 's government estimated the nato strikes killed more than 1,000 soldiers and 2,500 civilians , including 89 children , while 12,500 people were wounded and at least $ 30 billion in damage caused .
" a decade of the crime against serbia , " the daily press said , while politika wrote of the " bombing that was never declared a war . "
under the headline " days of death and destruction , " vecernje novosti recounted half a dozen personal stories , including those of families who lost children and of a military pilot who was shot down by nato .
health concerns also remain about the danger to civilians from weapons nato used during the campaign .
thousands risk life and limb from cluster bomblets still scattered across serbia as well as from depleted uranium , according to european non-governmental groups .
a " humanitarian intervention " many analysts contend the " humanitarian intervention " was necessary to prevent any recurrence of events like the 1995 srebrenica massacre by bosnian serbs of some 8,000 muslims - europe 's worst atrocity since world war ii .
up to 9,000 people were killed in kosovo 's 1998-1999 conflict , mostly ethnic albanians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some blame inaction for the events which led to srebrenica " what is often forgotten about the bombing is the context and the context was the failure to act in bosnia , culminating in the srebrenica massacre , " tim judah , a prominent british author on the balkan wars of the 1990s .
" the kla were no angels but srebrenica changed everything .
after that there was no guarantee that serbian forces might not do such a thing again , " judah told reporters .
" as to whether it was worth it - a classic ' what if ' of history .

" rasmussen was at the head of the list for the former bush administration , just as he is for the current obama administration , " analyst daniel korski said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish caricatures inflamed passions in the muslim world " the americans want someone who will continue to push for military engagement in afghanistan , " he said , pointing out that denmark has some 750 soldiers stationed in the volatile southern part of the country where the taliban insurgency is most active . us and european support however does not guarantee that rasmussen will become the appointed successor to scheffer . turkish opposition possible the main snag to rasmussen 's nomination , which needs to be approved by all members of the 26-nation alliance , is possible opposition to his candidacy from turkey , a secular nation that is predominantly muslim . denmark had outraged muslims around the world in 2005 when the widely circulated jyllands-posten newspaper published a series of cartoon caricatures depicting the prophet muhammad as a terrorist . rasmussen , who has been prime minister since 2001 , had refused to apologize for the cartoons invoking the right of the press to freedom of expression .
the controversial cartoons , which were later republished by media around the globe , had sparked riots and attacks on danish embassies in the muslim world . cartoon controversy " the cartoon crisis has a larger dimension than just turkey , " a turkish official , who requested anonymity , told reuters .
" at a time when nato is going to assume added responsibility in afghanistan and pakistan , having a secretary general with such an objectionable approach to billions of muslims , is not the right approach to the muslim world . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's foreign minister -lrb- right -rrb- is an unlikely candidate turkey has also attacked denmark for failing to revoke the broadcasting license of a television station that ankara has accused of being a mouthpiece for kurdish rebels opposed to the government .
adding fuel to the fire , rasmussen had publicly stated in 2003 that he opposed full eu membership for turkey . " it may come to the veto , " retuers quoted the anonymous official as saying .

" " the air strikes have not solved problems in kosovo , and did not help to bring peace and the rule of law , " cvetkovic said at a special meeting of the cabinet to commemorate the attacks .
" on the contrary , they resulted in ethnic cleansing and gross violations of human rights , international standards and fresh tensions . " the alliance 's action , which was not sanctioned by the united nations security council , undermined milosevic 's power and is largely thought to have played a major role in his being sent to the hague to stand trial for war crimes .
he died in 2006 before the court could issue a verdict in his case . a necessary war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke has no regrets over the nato campaign western leaders saw nato 's air war , dubbed operation allied force , as the only way to end the 1998-1999 violent crackdown by milosevic 's forces on the kosovo liberation army and its supporters . " i look back on that extraordinary last meeting with milosevic , with a feeling that what we did was necessary and the right thing to do , " richard holbrooke , who served as the united states special envoy to the balkans , told reporters on saturday . " the people of kosovo are better off than they were as part of serbia , and serbia is better off facing the future rather than working back to a mythic past , " he added . then us president bill clinton also said at the time that the west had a " moral imperative " to take action against milosevic . the north atlantic treaty organization , in what was its largest military operation , set out to destroy dozens of targets .
in its 78 days of bombing , however , it also hit public infrastructure like bridges and railway tracks as well as homes , refugee convoys , a hospital and the chinese embassy in belgrade . human rights watch has estimated that about 500 civilians lost their lives during the bombing campaign , five times less than the yugoslav government claimed at the time . diverging views of war in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbs and kosovo albanians have very different feelings about nato 's intervention for ethnic albanians in kosovo , where they accounted for 90 percent of the region 's population despite being a minority in serbia overall , the war put a welcome end to their suffering at the hands of the serbian majority . " the appearance of combat airplanes in the sky above kosovo was a message of salvation for the people here , " kosovo justice minister nekibe kelmendi told afp . but for the serb minority , the campaign marked the beginning of their agony . " it was revenge for serbian disobedience , " said radoslav radovic , a 57-year-old from the serb-run half of kosovska mitrovica , a northern town that still simmers with ethnic tensions . radovic told afp he believes the west declared serbia guilty for " defending its integrity and its territory . " fearing ethnic albanian reprisals , tens of thousands of kosovo serbs fled their homes for serbia proper , with only a handful returning in the past decade .
of the 120,000 ethnic serbs estimated in kosovo , most live in the northern region that borders serbia or in small enclaves in southern areas . tensions run high after independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many kosovo serbs are still living in refugee camps in serbia proper tensions have remained high , especially since kosovo 's parliament unilaterally seceded from serbia in february 2008 , a move that has been recognized by 56 nations including the united states and most of the european union . officially , the united nations remains in charge of kosovo .
the 15-nation security council has not been able to alter the un mandate because its members are split over what to do with the un presence there and the legality of pristina 's declaration of independence . russia , a permanent veto-wielding member of the security council and serbia 's ally , has said it would not recognize an independent kosovo and has supported belgrade 's bid to challenge the declaration before the international court of justice in the hague . under a plan agreed to last year , police , customs officers and judges in the serb-run areas of kosovo remain under the un umbrella , known as unmik , while their albanian counterparts work with a european union police and justice mission called eulex . many kosovo albanians have come to view the un presence as an obstacle to independence , un secretary-general ban ki-moon said in a report published thursday . " there is a perception among many kosovo albanians that the mission 's tasks have been accomplished and its continued presence is an unwelcome obstacle to the desire for kosovo to function as a sovereign state , " ban said in his latest report to the security council on un activities in kosovo . ban 's report did not make recommendations on how to move forward as uncertainty in the region appears likely to continue . sms / tt / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's unknown what topolanek 's planned resignation will mean for the czech european union presidency . it was a close vote .
but four renegade czech lawmakers abandoned topolanek on tuesday , march 24 , toppling the ruling coalition .
it was the fourth time topolanek had faced a vote of confidence in his two years in office .
topolanek was able to secure only 96 votes in the 200-seat lower house after failing to win over the renegade lawmakers in last-minute talks .
topolanek confirmed that he plans to resign .

if three attempts to form a government fail , early elections will be called .
before the vote , social democrats had said they wanted to see topolanek 's government stay on to complete the six-month rotating eu presidency , which the czech republic holds until the end of june .
social democrat chief jiri paroubek reiterated that stance after the vote , saying it was " natural that the government would stay until the end of the eu presidency " on june 30 , afp reported .
topolanek has said his party would like to have early elections this summer .
the opposition social democrats want elections to be held in autumn .
unusual , but not unprecedented a change in government would complicate the czech eu presidency , topolanek said after the no confidence vote . " i believe it can complicate our negotiating power ... partners in europe have grown used to us negotiating hard .
in this sense it can happen that our position will be weakened , " he told reporters . us president barack obama is scheduled to visit prague next week for talks with czech and european leaders .
while the situation of a government changing during its six-month european union presidency is unusual , it isn ’ t unprecedented . in 1996 , italy ’ s center-left coalition under romano prodi took over from lamberto dini 's centre-right government following a legislative election .
and in 1993 , denmark began its eu presidency with a change in leadership when poul schlueter 's conservatives were replaced by social democrats under poul nyrup rasmussen . hungary , lativa in crisis the czech republic has been less affected than some eastern european countries by the global financial crisis .

eu presidency uncertain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus will be tasked with finding a successor czech president vaclav klaus will now look for a parliamentarian with enough support to form a new government .
if three attempts to form a government fail , early elections will be called .
before the vote , social democrats had said they wanted to see topolanek 's government stay on to complete the six-month rotating eu presidency , which the czech republic holds until the end of june .
social democrat chief jiri paroubek reiterated that stance after the vote , saying it was " natural that the government would stay until the end of the eu presidency " on june 30 , afp reported .
topolanek has said his party would like to have early elections this summer .
the opposition social democrats want elections to be held in autumn .
unusual , but not unprecedented a change in government would complicate the czech eu presidency , topolanek said after the no confidence vote . " i believe it can complicate our negotiating power ... partners in europe have grown used to us negotiating hard .
in this sense it can happen that our position will be weakened , " he told reporters . us president barack obama is scheduled to visit prague next week for talks with czech and european leaders .
while the situation of a government changing during its six-month european union presidency is unusual , it isn ’ t unprecedented . in 1996 , italy ’ s center-left coalition under romano prodi took over from lamberto dini 's centre-right government following a legislative election .
and in 1993 , denmark began its eu presidency with a change in leadership when poul schlueter 's conservatives were replaced by social democrats under poul nyrup rasmussen . hungary , lativa in crisis the czech republic has been less affected than some eastern european countries by the global financial crisis .

" " the air strikes have not solved problems in kosovo , and did not help to bring peace and the rule of law , " cvetkovic said at a special meeting of the cabinet to commemorate the attacks .
" on the contrary , they resulted in ethnic cleansing and gross violations of human rights , international standards and fresh tensions . " the alliance 's action , which was not sanctioned by the united nations security council , undermined milosevic 's power and is largely thought to have played a major role in his being sent to the hague to stand trial for war crimes .
he died in 2006 before the court could issue a verdict in his case . a necessary war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke has no regrets over the nato campaign western leaders saw nato 's air war , dubbed operation allied force , as the only way to end the 1998-1999 violent crackdown by milosevic 's forces on the kosovo liberation army and its supporters . " i look back on that extraordinary last meeting with milosevic , with a feeling that what we did was necessary and the right thing to do , " richard holbrooke , who served as the united states special envoy to the balkans , told reporters on saturday . " the people of kosovo are better off than they were as part of serbia , and serbia is better off facing the future rather than working back to a mythic past , " he added . then us president bill clinton also said at the time that the west had a " moral imperative " to take action against milosevic . the north atlantic treaty organization , in what was its largest military operation , set out to destroy dozens of targets .
in its 78 days of bombing , however , it also hit public infrastructure like bridges and railway tracks as well as homes , refugee convoys , a hospital and the chinese embassy in belgrade . human rights watch has estimated that about 500 civilians lost their lives during the bombing campaign , five times less than the yugoslav government claimed at the time . diverging views of war in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbs and kosovo albanians have very different feelings about nato 's intervention for ethnic albanians in kosovo , where they accounted for 90 percent of the region 's population despite being a minority in serbia overall , the war put a welcome end to their suffering at the hands of the serbian majority . " the appearance of combat airplanes in the sky above kosovo was a message of salvation for the people here , " kosovo justice minister nekibe kelmendi told afp . but for the serb minority , the campaign marked the beginning of their agony . " it was revenge for serbian disobedience , " said radoslav radovic , a 57-year-old from the serb-run half of kosovska mitrovica , a northern town that still simmers with ethnic tensions . radovic told afp he believes the west declared serbia guilty for " defending its integrity and its territory . " fearing ethnic albanian reprisals , tens of thousands of kosovo serbs fled their homes for serbia proper , with only a handful returning in the past decade .
of the 120,000 ethnic serbs estimated in kosovo , most live in the northern region that borders serbia or in small enclaves in southern areas . tensions run high after independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many kosovo serbs are still living in refugee camps in serbia proper tensions have remained high , especially since kosovo 's parliament unilaterally seceded from serbia in february 2008 , a move that has been recognized by 56 nations including the united states and most of the european union . officially , the united nations remains in charge of kosovo .
the 15-nation security council has not been able to alter the un mandate because its members are split over what to do with the un presence there and the legality of pristina 's declaration of independence . russia , a permanent veto-wielding member of the security council and serbia 's ally , has said it would not recognize an independent kosovo and has supported belgrade 's bid to challenge the declaration before the international court of justice in the hague . under a plan agreed to last year , police , customs officers and judges in the serb-run areas of kosovo remain under the un umbrella , known as unmik , while their albanian counterparts work with a european union police and justice mission called eulex . many kosovo albanians have come to view the un presence as an obstacle to independence , un secretary-general ban ki-moon said in a report published thursday . " there is a perception among many kosovo albanians that the mission 's tasks have been accomplished and its continued presence is an unwelcome obstacle to the desire for kosovo to function as a sovereign state , " ban said in his latest report to the security council on un activities in kosovo . ban 's report did not make recommendations on how to move forward as uncertainty in the region appears likely to continue . sms / tt / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a longstanding conflict has been the result - and reflects the situation in the country at large . belgium has been experiencing an ongoing political crisis for years .
rival parties are unable to reach agreement over the division of power and wealth between the richer , dutch-speaking province of flanders and the poorer , french-speaking region of wallonia . the country 's previous prime minister yves leterme failed in his efforts to decentralize power to the two regions in order to ease tensions between the flemish and the walloons .
it had meant amending the belgian constitution and leterme was unable to accomplish this . the new government under prime minister herman van rompuy , who took office at the end of 2008 , has been more concerned with the worldwide financial crisis . however , this paralysis over devolution is not really impacting most belgians , as stephen castle , a brussels-based journalist points out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's two regions also differ economically " this political crisis has been going on for a very long time , " castle says .
" frankly , people are used to it and possibly , apart from the politicians themselves are bored of it . " according to castle , even a paralyzed central government does n't really impact people 's day-to-day lives . " education continues , schools are open , hospitals are open , the garbage is cleared , " he says .
" from the practical point of view of most people , there really is very little impact . " not too worried namur is the capital of the french-speaking part of belgium , the region of wallonia .
at the central station , 30-year-old jean-francois says he has grown up with constant talk that belgium has no real future . " i 've heard this rumor since i was very little , " jean-francois says .
" belgium might disintegrate , but maybe people are seeing ghosts .
belgium has had an artificial side to it since its very beginnings . " jean-francois says he thinks the country could live like this for many years to come . " i think there are more serious problems than that , " he says . brussels must be resolved belgium is currently in the so-called sixth phase of a far-reaching political reform .
the process was started in the 1970s when the unitary belgian state became a federal state .
but here the division between regional politicians from the two sides goes deeper than they would in other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can van rompuy find a solution ?
" in order to make your name as a politician in belgium , you have to do that in your own community first , " castle says .
" if you 're , for example , a flemish politician like leterme , you really win no votes among your own core supporters by saying nice things about the francophone population in the south . " luc arnould is in charge of international relations at the city hall of namur .
he says that the country is n't likely to split unless the issue of brussels is resolved .
and he does n't see that happening anytime soon .
most people in the capital speak french but belong to the dutch-speaking part of the country . " we have to adapt the constitution and the way of working in belgium , but giving more and more autonomy to the regions , " arnould says .
" regions want to have more independence to organize their economies .
but there 's always the problem of brussels .
we need a lot of imagination to find a solution . " division remains a possibility many flemish people in brussels have no problem with living side by side with walloons .
bilingualism is a reality here in people 's daily lives , says this brussels native . " we speak both languages every day - french and dutch and english , " the man says .
" so there are no problems between the people here .
and in ten years ' time , the next generation will speak both languages all across belgium . " but the government turmoil has proven there is a problem between belgium 's communities on a political level .
journalist castle says partition remains a possibility , although it 's not likely anytime soon . " it would make it more difficult for belgium to be the center of the european union if it divided , " castle says .
" that would send a very poor message to a lot of countries which also have issues over devolution and how to divide up power .
i think there 's a general consensus that belgians are probably better off . " further devolution of power will be a long and arduous process .
but belgium 's politicians are used to treading warily when it comes to negotiating greater rights for their communities .
and that caution might stave off the breakup of belgium . nina haase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 24.03.2009 ten years on , germany looks back at return to war in kosovo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany used fighter jets to bomb serbian targets ten years ago , german fighter planes participated in nato air strikes against serbian targets .
as the bombs dropped , germany ’ s armed forces joined in their first modern combat mission . then-chancellor gerhard schroeder had only been in office for a few months when he was called to explain germany 's participation in a nato bombing operation .
" overnight on thursday , nato launched air strikes against military targets in yugoslavia .
the alliance was compelled to take this step in order to prevent further heavy and systematic infringement of human rights in kosovo , " schroeder told the parliament .
it was the first time since world war ii that german soldiers had taken part in a combat mission .
for germany , the timing was complicated .
schroeder 's social democrats had just won a parliamentary majority together with the green party , forming a so-called red-green coalition .
one of their first decisions was whether to have the bundeswehr , which is what germany 's federal armed forces are called , participate in nato fighting .
from the beginning , schroeder was confident that he had political and public support for the mission .
" we are united and in agreement with the large majority of the german people and also - thank god - with a large majority of the german parliament , which cuts across all party lines , " schroeder said .
nato pressured milosevic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yugoslavia eventually pulled troops out of kosovo the weeks leading up to schroeder 's speech before parliament was had been turbulent ones .
the kosovo crisis was intensifying at the same time that the 16-year tenure of chancellor helmut kohl was coming to an end .
schroeder 's new coalition had not even had a chance to settle in before being hit with a series of major foreign policy decisions .
nato was turning up the heat on yugoslavian president slobodan milosevic , warning that it would launch air strikes if the expulsions and killings in kosovo continued .
nato general secretary javier solana issued a warning in the fall of 2008 : " just a few moments ago , the north atlantic council decided to issue activation orders - actords - for both a phased air campaign in yugoslavia and limited air operations . "
nato expected germany to make a contribution to the fighting .
the newly-elected parliament held a special meeting in october 1998 in bonn , germany .
a large majority of the delegates decided to allow bundeswehr troops to take part in nato air strikes , even without a united nations mandate .
deployment without a un mandate negotiations continued .
yugoslavian representatives meet with kosovo-albanians and nato in search of a solution .
germany 's new government , inexperienced in foreign policy , took a low-key approach , yet threw its support behind nato .
rudolf scharping , the secretary of defense for the social democrats , said at the time : " we want to do everything in our power to keep corpses from piling up in the balkans and to ensure that there is n't a new stream of refugees into europe . "
after yugoslavia refused to accept the rambouillet agreement , nato began bombing targets in belgrade and other serbian cities .
fourteen german tornado fighter planes were used for air reconnaissance and to attack serbian air defense positions .
this meant not only that german soldiers took an active role in fighting for the first time since the end of world war ii , but that they did so without a un mandate .
the german government justified its participation by saying it could not close its eyes to the suffering of the civilian population in kosovo .
not easy being green bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder , right , and fischer , left , both supported the kosovo war this policy change was particularly difficult for the green party , which historically has had close links to the peace movement .
angry demonstrators called top green politicians " murderers " as they arrived with police escorts for a party meeting in may of 1999 .
many long-time green supporters vehemently reject the use of military force , yet parliamentarian angelika beer defended party leaders from criticisms and insults being hurled at them .
the critics were cowardly , she said , and had no good alternatives to offer .
" those of you who are now yelling ‘ warmongers , ' would you have wanted us to turn a blind eye ? " she asked .
" how would you have wanted to justify it ? "
joschka fisher , the green 's foreign minister , found himself at the center of the criticism for his support of the war .
at one point a paint bomb was lobbed at his head , injuring him slightly .
" at this moment in time , i regard a one-sided , unlimited cessation of the bomb attacks as a wrong signal , " fischer said at one point .
germany still in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kfor still has soldiers in kosovo june of 1999 , milosevic withdrew his troops , allowing nato peacekeeping troops kfor to move in .
bundeswehr general klaus reinhardt was the commander of kfor for several years .
the deployment was important , reinhardt said .
" in kosovo , external stability was important because milosevic had said each day : ‘ i will take my country back by force , " ' reinhardt said .
only when the situation is stable can political and economic conditions improve , the general said .
however , bringing stability to kosovo has taken much longer than anyone expected at the time .
the red-green coalition has been out of office for nearly four years , but there are still more than 2,500 german soldiers stationed in kosovo .

as the bombs dropped , germany ’ s armed forces joined in their first modern combat mission . then-chancellor gerhard schroeder had only been in office for a few months when he was called to explain germany 's participation in a nato bombing operation .
" overnight on thursday , nato launched air strikes against military targets in yugoslavia .
the alliance was compelled to take this step in order to prevent further heavy and systematic infringement of human rights in kosovo , " schroeder told the parliament .
it was the first time since world war ii that german soldiers had taken part in a combat mission .
for germany , the timing was complicated .
schroeder 's social democrats had just won a parliamentary majority together with the green party , forming a so-called red-green coalition .
one of their first decisions was whether to have the bundeswehr , which is what germany 's federal armed forces are called , participate in nato fighting .
from the beginning , schroeder was confident that he had political and public support for the mission .
" we are united and in agreement with the large majority of the german people and also - thank god - with a large majority of the german parliament , which cuts across all party lines , " schroeder said .

the kosovo crisis was intensifying at the same time that the 16-year tenure of chancellor helmut kohl was coming to an end .
schroeder 's new coalition had not even had a chance to settle in before being hit with a series of major foreign policy decisions .
nato was turning up the heat on yugoslavian president slobodan milosevic , warning that it would launch air strikes if the expulsions and killings in kosovo continued .
nato general secretary javier solana issued a warning in the fall of 2008 : " just a few moments ago , the north atlantic council decided to issue activation orders - actords - for both a phased air campaign in yugoslavia and limited air operations . "
nato expected germany to make a contribution to the fighting .
the newly-elected parliament held a special meeting in october 1998 in bonn , germany .
a large majority of the delegates decided to allow bundeswehr troops to take part in nato air strikes , even without a united nations mandate .
deployment without a un mandate negotiations continued .
yugoslavian representatives meet with kosovo-albanians and nato in search of a solution .
germany 's new government , inexperienced in foreign policy , took a low-key approach , yet threw its support behind nato .
rudolf scharping , the secretary of defense for the social democrats , said at the time : " we want to do everything in our power to keep corpses from piling up in the balkans and to ensure that there is n't a new stream of refugees into europe . "
after yugoslavia refused to accept the rambouillet agreement , nato began bombing targets in belgrade and other serbian cities .
fourteen german tornado fighter planes were used for air reconnaissance and to attack serbian air defense positions .

the alliance was compelled to take this step in order to prevent further heavy and systematic infringement of human rights in kosovo , " schroeder told the parliament .
it was the first time since world war ii that german soldiers had taken part in a combat mission .
for germany , the timing was complicated .
schroeder 's social democrats had just won a parliamentary majority together with the green party , forming a so-called red-green coalition .
one of their first decisions was whether to have the bundeswehr , which is what germany 's federal armed forces are called , participate in nato fighting .
from the beginning , schroeder was confident that he had political and public support for the mission .
" we are united and in agreement with the large majority of the german people and also - thank god - with a large majority of the german parliament , which cuts across all party lines , " schroeder said .
nato pressured milosevic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yugoslavia eventually pulled troops out of kosovo the weeks leading up to schroeder 's speech before parliament was had been turbulent ones .
the kosovo crisis was intensifying at the same time that the 16-year tenure of chancellor helmut kohl was coming to an end .
schroeder 's new coalition had not even had a chance to settle in before being hit with a series of major foreign policy decisions .
nato was turning up the heat on yugoslavian president slobodan milosevic , warning that it would launch air strikes if the expulsions and killings in kosovo continued .
nato general secretary javier solana issued a warning in the fall of 2008 : " just a few moments ago , the north atlantic council decided to issue activation orders - actords - for both a phased air campaign in yugoslavia and limited air operations . "
nato expected germany to make a contribution to the fighting .
the newly-elected parliament held a special meeting in october 1998 in bonn , germany .
a large majority of the delegates decided to allow bundeswehr troops to take part in nato air strikes , even without a united nations mandate .
deployment without a un mandate negotiations continued .
yugoslavian representatives meet with kosovo-albanians and nato in search of a solution .
germany 's new government , inexperienced in foreign policy , took a low-key approach , yet threw its support behind nato .
rudolf scharping , the secretary of defense for the social democrats , said at the time : " we want to do everything in our power to keep corpses from piling up in the balkans and to ensure that there is n't a new stream of refugees into europe . "
after yugoslavia refused to accept the rambouillet agreement , nato began bombing targets in belgrade and other serbian cities .
fourteen german tornado fighter planes were used for air reconnaissance and to attack serbian air defense positions .
this meant not only that german soldiers took an active role in fighting for the first time since the end of world war ii , but that they did so without a un mandate .
the german government justified its participation by saying it could not close its eyes to the suffering of the civilian population in kosovo .
not easy being green bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder , right , and fischer , left , both supported the kosovo war this policy change was particularly difficult for the green party , which historically has had close links to the peace movement .
angry demonstrators called top green politicians " murderers " as they arrived with police escorts for a party meeting in may of 1999 .
many long-time green supporters vehemently reject the use of military force , yet parliamentarian angelika beer defended party leaders from criticisms and insults being hurled at them .
the critics were cowardly , she said , and had no good alternatives to offer .
" those of you who are now yelling ‘ warmongers , ' would you have wanted us to turn a blind eye ? " she asked .
" how would you have wanted to justify it ? "
joschka fisher , the green 's foreign minister , found himself at the center of the criticism for his support of the war .
at one point a paint bomb was lobbed at his head , injuring him slightly .
" at this moment in time , i regard a one-sided , unlimited cessation of the bomb attacks as a wrong signal , " fischer said at one point .
germany still in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kfor still has soldiers in kosovo june of 1999 , milosevic withdrew his troops , allowing nato peacekeeping troops kfor to move in .
bundeswehr general klaus reinhardt was the commander of kfor for several years .
the deployment was important , reinhardt said .
" in kosovo , external stability was important because milosevic had said each day : ‘ i will take my country back by force , " ' reinhardt said .
only when the situation is stable can political and economic conditions improve , the general said .
however , bringing stability to kosovo has taken much longer than anyone expected at the time .
the red-green coalition has been out of office for nearly four years , but there are still more than 2,500 german soldiers stationed in kosovo .

if you 're itching for a place you can really call your own , ebay has just the thing - a village in saxony that can be yours for the modest price of 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 405,000 -rrb- . " why do n't you buy your own village ? " reads the text accompanying the somewhat unusual property listing on the auction web site .
indeed , why not ?
the asking price is a real bargain , especially if you consider that people routinely shell out 300,000 euros for an average-sized apartment in the city .
for the same amount , you could be the proud owner of liebon , a tiny village nestled in the state of saxony that has a history dating back to 1322 .
admittedly , tiny is the key adjective .
the village consists of three buildings , two road signs , and has a total area of just 15,000 square meters -lrb- 3.7 acres -rrb- - about the size of two football fields .
current population : eight .
one of those residents is karsten schmidt , 45 .
he lives in liebon with his wife and two children .
schmidt 's parents also live in the village , as does schmidt 's brother , who lives with his girlfriend .
rural idyll his describes liebon as a picture-book place - a farm with a big family home , a playground , a pond , a fountain and a tiny shop .
" the village is practically self-sufficient , " he told the bild newspaper .
" we planted an orchard in the big garden and we grow potatoes . "
despite the idyllic setting , schmidt says he 's ready to start packing the moving boxes if the family gets a decent offer .
" my two daughters are so far away from everything , " he said .
" my parents do n't have driving licenses , and you really depend on a car here . "
the nearest neighbors are some 1.5 kilometers away .
but schmidt says prospective new residents should n't worry about feeling too cut off from the world , as liebon has been kitted out with high-speed internet access . dc / nda / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a longstanding conflict has been the result - and reflects the situation in the country at large . belgium has been experiencing an ongoing political crisis for years .
rival parties are unable to reach agreement over the division of power and wealth between the richer , dutch-speaking province of flanders and the poorer , french-speaking region of wallonia . the country 's previous prime minister yves leterme failed in his efforts to decentralize power to the two regions in order to ease tensions between the flemish and the walloons .
it had meant amending the belgian constitution and leterme was unable to accomplish this . the new government under prime minister herman van rompuy , who took office at the end of 2008 , has been more concerned with the worldwide financial crisis . however , this paralysis over devolution is not really impacting most belgians , as stephen castle , a brussels-based journalist points out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's two regions also differ economically " this political crisis has been going on for a very long time , " castle says .
" frankly , people are used to it and possibly , apart from the politicians themselves are bored of it . " according to castle , even a paralyzed central government does n't really impact people 's day-to-day lives . " education continues , schools are open , hospitals are open , the garbage is cleared , " he says .
" from the practical point of view of most people , there really is very little impact . " not too worried namur is the capital of the french-speaking part of belgium , the region of wallonia .
at the central station , 30-year-old jean-francois says he has grown up with constant talk that belgium has no real future . " i 've heard this rumor since i was very little , " jean-francois says .
" belgium might disintegrate , but maybe people are seeing ghosts .
belgium has had an artificial side to it since its very beginnings . " jean-francois says he thinks the country could live like this for many years to come . " i think there are more serious problems than that , " he says . brussels must be resolved belgium is currently in the so-called sixth phase of a far-reaching political reform .
the process was started in the 1970s when the unitary belgian state became a federal state .
but here the division between regional politicians from the two sides goes deeper than they would in other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can van rompuy find a solution ?
" in order to make your name as a politician in belgium , you have to do that in your own community first , " castle says .
" if you 're , for example , a flemish politician like leterme , you really win no votes among your own core supporters by saying nice things about the francophone population in the south . " luc arnould is in charge of international relations at the city hall of namur .
he says that the country is n't likely to split unless the issue of brussels is resolved .
and he does n't see that happening anytime soon .
most people in the capital speak french but belong to the dutch-speaking part of the country . " we have to adapt the constitution and the way of working in belgium , but giving more and more autonomy to the regions , " arnould says .
" regions want to have more independence to organize their economies .
but there 's always the problem of brussels .
we need a lot of imagination to find a solution . " division remains a possibility many flemish people in brussels have no problem with living side by side with walloons .
bilingualism is a reality here in people 's daily lives , says this brussels native . " we speak both languages every day - french and dutch and english , " the man says .
" so there are no problems between the people here .
and in ten years ' time , the next generation will speak both languages all across belgium . " but the government turmoil has proven there is a problem between belgium 's communities on a political level .
journalist castle says partition remains a possibility , although it 's not likely anytime soon . " it would make it more difficult for belgium to be the center of the european union if it divided , " castle says .
" that would send a very poor message to a lot of countries which also have issues over devolution and how to divide up power .
i think there 's a general consensus that belgians are probably better off . " further devolution of power will be a long and arduous process .

ministers gathered at the same time to lay wreaths at spots where people were killed during the air war - at the time the biggest military operation in nato history .
" the attack on our country was illegal , contrary to international law , without a decision by the united nations " security council , prime minister mirko cvetkovic told a special commemorative sitting of his cabinet .
" the air strikes have not solved problems in kosovo , and did not help to bring peace and the rule of law .
" they resulted in ethnic cleansing and gross violations of human rights , international standards and fresh tensions , " he said , after schools held a minute 's silence before class .
kosovo leaders said however the nato bombing stopped serbian abuses in their breakaway territory and was a decisive step towards saving and freeing its people .
" the 78 days of strikes saved the people of kosovo from planned extermination , a scenario which was prepared coldly by the highest serb political and academic circles , " kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said .
kosovo prime minister hashim thaci described the bombing as " a big historic event for kosovo and the democratic world . "
" the successful completion of the campaign of intervention by nato opened a new chapter in the history of kosovo , a chapter of freedom , " said thaci .
anniversary of campaign to stop milosevic nato launched the strikes on march 24 , 1999 after milosevic refused to sign up to a peace deal to end his forces ' crackdown on the rebel kosovo liberation army -lrb- kla -rrb- and the ethnic albanian majority in the southern territory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic ordered a crackdown on kosovo 's rebels it set out to destroy military targets , and went on to strike infrastructure and the milosevic propaganda machine .
some strikes went astray , hitting scores of civilian sites and even china 's embassy in belgrade .
milosevic eventually conceded 78 days later , paving the way for nato to enter kosovo .
some 15,000 nato-led peacekeepers remain in kosovo , which 56 nations recognize after its ethnic albanian-dominated parliament declared unilateral independence from serbia 13 months ago .
as part of serbian commemorations , the bells of orthodox churches were to be tolled for the victims at 7:45 pm -lrb- 1845 gmt -rrb- - the moment nato 's first attacks were launched 10 years ago .
wounds still open in serbia separately , a hard-line nationalist group planned to stage an anti-nato rally in the main square of belgrade , according to posters that have gone up around serbia 's capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian protests have been violent in the past serbian media seized on the opportunity of the anniversary to rake over the coals of a conflict that may have ended a decade ago but one which remains very much in the national consciousness .
" serbs got bombs , the albanians got a state , " the daily blic said in its report .
belgrade contends that nato , by acting without a un mandate and by bombing civilian targets and using controversial ordnance , broke international laws because it was biased in favor of albanians .
human rights watch put the civilian death toll from the bombing campaign at around 500 .
milosevic 's government estimated the nato strikes killed more than 1,000 soldiers and 2,500 civilians , including 89 children , while 12,500 people were wounded and at least $ 30 billion in damage caused .
" a decade of the crime against serbia , " the daily press said , while politika wrote of the " bombing that was never declared a war . "
under the headline " days of death and destruction , " vecernje novosti recounted half a dozen personal stories , including those of families who lost children and of a military pilot who was shot down by nato .
health concerns also remain about the danger to civilians from weapons nato used during the campaign .
thousands risk life and limb from cluster bomblets still scattered across serbia as well as from depleted uranium , according to european non-governmental groups .
a " humanitarian intervention " many analysts contend the " humanitarian intervention " was necessary to prevent any recurrence of events like the 1995 srebrenica massacre by bosnian serbs of some 8,000 muslims - europe 's worst atrocity since world war ii .
up to 9,000 people were killed in kosovo 's 1998-1999 conflict , mostly ethnic albanians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some blame inaction for the events which led to srebrenica " what is often forgotten about the bombing is the context and the context was the failure to act in bosnia , culminating in the srebrenica massacre , " tim judah , a prominent british author on the balkan wars of the 1990s .
" the kla were no angels but srebrenica changed everything .
after that there was no guarantee that serbian forces might not do such a thing again , " judah told reporters .
" as to whether it was worth it - a classic ' what if ' of history .
it was short -lrb- ish -rrb- and brutal but if it had not been for the bombing we might still be living with a rumbling and brutal insurgency and low level conflict . " nda / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 24.03.2009 west favors dane for top nato post , but turkish hurdles remain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's secretary-general post traditionally goes to a european danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen looks like the top contender for nato 's civilian head , but turkey might exercise its veto against the dane because of a cartoon controversy that had inflamed the muslim world . the united states gave its blessing to the appointment of danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen as the next nato secretary general in brussels over the weekend , paving the way for him to take over the trans-atlantic alliance 's top civilian job in august . washington also enjoys strong support for the choice of rasmussen from its three biggest european allies in the alliance - germany , france and the uk . although rasmussen , 56 , declined to publicly comment on the possibility of succeeding dutch diplomat jaap de hoop scheffer , he never officially ruled himself out as a candidate for a post that has traditionally gone to a european . dane favored by us and europeans rasmussen is regarded as a loyal us ally and also appeals to europeans for supporting closer ties between nato and the european union . an analyst at the london-based european council for foreign relations told the afp news agency that the danish prime minister has long enjoyed us support from politicians of all stripes . " rasmussen was at the head of the list for the former bush administration , just as he is for the current obama administration , " analyst daniel korski said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish caricatures inflamed passions in the muslim world " the americans want someone who will continue to push for military engagement in afghanistan , " he said , pointing out that denmark has some 750 soldiers stationed in the volatile southern part of the country where the taliban insurgency is most active . us and european support however does not guarantee that rasmussen will become the appointed successor to scheffer . turkish opposition possible the main snag to rasmussen 's nomination , which needs to be approved by all members of the 26-nation alliance , is possible opposition to his candidacy from turkey , a secular nation that is predominantly muslim . denmark had outraged muslims around the world in 2005 when the widely circulated jyllands-posten newspaper published a series of cartoon caricatures depicting the prophet muhammad as a terrorist . rasmussen , who has been prime minister since 2001 , had refused to apologize for the cartoons invoking the right of the press to freedom of expression .
the controversial cartoons , which were later republished by media around the globe , had sparked riots and attacks on danish embassies in the muslim world . cartoon controversy " the cartoon crisis has a larger dimension than just turkey , " a turkish official , who requested anonymity , told reuters .
" at a time when nato is going to assume added responsibility in afghanistan and pakistan , having a secretary general with such an objectionable approach to billions of muslims , is not the right approach to the muslim world . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's foreign minister -lrb- right -rrb- is an unlikely candidate turkey has also attacked denmark for failing to revoke the broadcasting license of a television station that ankara has accused of being a mouthpiece for kurdish rebels opposed to the government .
adding fuel to the fire , rasmussen had publicly stated in 2003 that he opposed full eu membership for turkey . " it may come to the veto , " retuers quoted the anonymous official as saying .
" we will have to see . " the chances for other candidates for nato 's number two position , however , are dwindling . polish candidate viewed as antagonistic to russia polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski was rumored to be a favorite for secretary general post , but the appointment of a pro-american polish national is viewed as antagonizing russia at a time when nato is seeking better relations with the kremlin . russia has been bitterly opposed to the deployment of a us anti-missile defense shield on polish territory . turkey had favored a canadian for the post , since ottawa supports ankara 's bid to join the eu .
however canadian defense minister peter mackay ruled himself out as a candidate on sunday . canadian ruled out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer 's successor should be announced at nato summit mackay 's rumored candidacy had the apparent support of us vice president joe biden as a reward for canada 's role in combat missions in dangerous southern afghanistan .
his spokesman , however , told reporters that the canadian never sought the post even though biden had downplayed an unwritten rule that the secretary general come from a european nation in exchange for nato 's top military post going to an american . the choice for the number two position as secretary general is expected to be named at the april 3-4 nato summit , but getting turkey to agree to the choice of rasmussen would be the key . df / sms / afp / reuters / send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 07 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

it 's unknown what topolanek 's planned resignation will mean for the czech european union presidency . it was a close vote .
but four renegade czech lawmakers abandoned topolanek on tuesday , march 24 , toppling the ruling coalition .
it was the fourth time topolanek had faced a vote of confidence in his two years in office .
topolanek was able to secure only 96 votes in the 200-seat lower house after failing to win over the renegade lawmakers in last-minute talks .
topolanek confirmed that he plans to resign .
" i will behave exactly in line with the constitution , " reuters news agency quoted him as saying .
the constitution says the government must resign after losing a vote of confidence .
topolanek ’ s right-wing civic democrats -lrb- ods -rrb- ruled together with the christian democrats and the green party .
yet topolanek relied on the support of several independent members of parliament , who had defected from the ruling coalition , to give him a majority .
eu presidency uncertain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus will be tasked with finding a successor czech president vaclav klaus will now look for a parliamentarian with enough support to form a new government .
if three attempts to form a government fail , early elections will be called .
before the vote , social democrats had said they wanted to see topolanek 's government stay on to complete the six-month rotating eu presidency , which the czech republic holds until the end of june .
social democrat chief jiri paroubek reiterated that stance after the vote , saying it was " natural that the government would stay until the end of the eu presidency " on june 30 , afp reported .
topolanek has said his party would like to have early elections this summer .
the opposition social democrats want elections to be held in autumn .
unusual , but not unprecedented a change in government would complicate the czech eu presidency , topolanek said after the no confidence vote . " i believe it can complicate our negotiating power ... partners in europe have grown used to us negotiating hard .
in this sense it can happen that our position will be weakened , " he told reporters . us president barack obama is scheduled to visit prague next week for talks with czech and european leaders .
while the situation of a government changing during its six-month european union presidency is unusual , it isn ’ t unprecedented . in 1996 , italy ’ s center-left coalition under romano prodi took over from lamberto dini 's centre-right government following a legislative election .
and in 1993 , denmark began its eu presidency with a change in leadership when poul schlueter 's conservatives were replaced by social democrats under poul nyrup rasmussen . hungary , lativa in crisis the czech republic has been less affected than some eastern european countries by the global financial crisis .
financial turmoil has brought down leaders in both hungary and latvia already this year . latvia 's new prime minister , valdis dombrovskis , who was sworn in just a few weeks ago , said on monday that he might have to ask for a fresh loan from international lenders to see his country through the crisis . hungary 's prime minister ferenc gyurcsany has offered to step aside to allow someone new to tackle the country 's financial problems .

a longstanding conflict has been the result - and reflects the situation in the country at large . belgium has been experiencing an ongoing political crisis for years .
rival parties are unable to reach agreement over the division of power and wealth between the richer , dutch-speaking province of flanders and the poorer , french-speaking region of wallonia . the country 's previous prime minister yves leterme failed in his efforts to decentralize power to the two regions in order to ease tensions between the flemish and the walloons .
it had meant amending the belgian constitution and leterme was unable to accomplish this . the new government under prime minister herman van rompuy , who took office at the end of 2008 , has been more concerned with the worldwide financial crisis . however , this paralysis over devolution is not really impacting most belgians , as stephen castle , a brussels-based journalist points out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's two regions also differ economically " this political crisis has been going on for a very long time , " castle says .
" frankly , people are used to it and possibly , apart from the politicians themselves are bored of it . " according to castle , even a paralyzed central government does n't really impact people 's day-to-day lives . " education continues , schools are open , hospitals are open , the garbage is cleared , " he says .
" from the practical point of view of most people , there really is very little impact . " not too worried namur is the capital of the french-speaking part of belgium , the region of wallonia .
at the central station , 30-year-old jean-francois says he has grown up with constant talk that belgium has no real future . " i 've heard this rumor since i was very little , " jean-francois says .
" belgium might disintegrate , but maybe people are seeing ghosts .
belgium has had an artificial side to it since its very beginnings . " jean-francois says he thinks the country could live like this for many years to come . " i think there are more serious problems than that , " he says . brussels must be resolved belgium is currently in the so-called sixth phase of a far-reaching political reform .
the process was started in the 1970s when the unitary belgian state became a federal state .
but here the division between regional politicians from the two sides goes deeper than they would in other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can van rompuy find a solution ?
" in order to make your name as a politician in belgium , you have to do that in your own community first , " castle says .
" if you 're , for example , a flemish politician like leterme , you really win no votes among your own core supporters by saying nice things about the francophone population in the south . " luc arnould is in charge of international relations at the city hall of namur .
he says that the country is n't likely to split unless the issue of brussels is resolved .
and he does n't see that happening anytime soon .
most people in the capital speak french but belong to the dutch-speaking part of the country . " we have to adapt the constitution and the way of working in belgium , but giving more and more autonomy to the regions , " arnould says .
" regions want to have more independence to organize their economies .
but there 's always the problem of brussels .
we need a lot of imagination to find a solution . " division remains a possibility many flemish people in brussels have no problem with living side by side with walloons .
bilingualism is a reality here in people 's daily lives , says this brussels native . " we speak both languages every day - french and dutch and english , " the man says .
" so there are no problems between the people here .
and in ten years ' time , the next generation will speak both languages all across belgium . " but the government turmoil has proven there is a problem between belgium 's communities on a political level .
journalist castle says partition remains a possibility , although it 's not likely anytime soon . " it would make it more difficult for belgium to be the center of the european union if it divided , " castle says .
" that would send a very poor message to a lot of countries which also have issues over devolution and how to divide up power .
i think there 's a general consensus that belgians are probably better off . " further devolution of power will be a long and arduous process .
but belgium 's politicians are used to treading warily when it comes to negotiating greater rights for their communities .
and that caution might stave off the breakup of belgium . nina haase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts say the economy will contract by up to 7 percent , and push unemployment up to 4.75 million by the end of 2010 . germany 's commerzbank has warned that the economic downturn will have a harsher effect on the country 's development than predicted at the start of the year . joerg kraemer , chief economist at commerzbank , told the berliner zeitung that in light of plunging order intakes among german companies , germany 's economy would shrink by as much as 7 percent this year . the number of unemployed can be expected to grow by more than 1.5 million within a two-year period , kraemer said , adding that by the end of 2010 , germany will be nearing the 5 million mark .
currently , some 3.5 million germans are registered as unemployed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a million more germans may have to update their resumes by 2010 , one expert said the nation 's gdp could contract by 4 percent to 4.5 percent this year , according to an internal economics ministry report cited by the bild newspaper on tuesday , march 24 .
in january , the ministry predicted a contraction of only 2.25 percent for this year .
a new forecast will be issued next month . wto predicts contraction in trade this gloomy news for germany is in keeping with similarly dismal economic outlooks around the world as the effects of the global economic crisis make themselves felt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 24.03.2009 ten years on , germany looks back at return to war in kosovo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany used fighter jets to bomb serbian targets ten years ago , german fighter planes participated in nato air strikes against serbian targets .
as the bombs dropped , germany ’ s armed forces joined in their first modern combat mission . then-chancellor gerhard schroeder had only been in office for a few months when he was called to explain germany 's participation in a nato bombing operation .
" overnight on thursday , nato launched air strikes against military targets in yugoslavia .
the alliance was compelled to take this step in order to prevent further heavy and systematic infringement of human rights in kosovo , " schroeder told the parliament .
it was the first time since world war ii that german soldiers had taken part in a combat mission .
for germany , the timing was complicated .
schroeder 's social democrats had just won a parliamentary majority together with the green party , forming a so-called red-green coalition .
one of their first decisions was whether to have the bundeswehr , which is what germany 's federal armed forces are called , participate in nato fighting .
from the beginning , schroeder was confident that he had political and public support for the mission .
" we are united and in agreement with the large majority of the german people and also - thank god - with a large majority of the german parliament , which cuts across all party lines , " schroeder said .
nato pressured milosevic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yugoslavia eventually pulled troops out of kosovo the weeks leading up to schroeder 's speech before parliament was had been turbulent ones .
the kosovo crisis was intensifying at the same time that the 16-year tenure of chancellor helmut kohl was coming to an end .
schroeder 's new coalition had not even had a chance to settle in before being hit with a series of major foreign policy decisions .
nato was turning up the heat on yugoslavian president slobodan milosevic , warning that it would launch air strikes if the expulsions and killings in kosovo continued .
nato general secretary javier solana issued a warning in the fall of 2008 : " just a few moments ago , the north atlantic council decided to issue activation orders - actords - for both a phased air campaign in yugoslavia and limited air operations . "
nato expected germany to make a contribution to the fighting .
the newly-elected parliament held a special meeting in october 1998 in bonn , germany .
a large majority of the delegates decided to allow bundeswehr troops to take part in nato air strikes , even without a united nations mandate .
deployment without a un mandate negotiations continued .
yugoslavian representatives meet with kosovo-albanians and nato in search of a solution .
germany 's new government , inexperienced in foreign policy , took a low-key approach , yet threw its support behind nato .
rudolf scharping , the secretary of defense for the social democrats , said at the time : " we want to do everything in our power to keep corpses from piling up in the balkans and to ensure that there is n't a new stream of refugees into europe . "
after yugoslavia refused to accept the rambouillet agreement , nato began bombing targets in belgrade and other serbian cities .
fourteen german tornado fighter planes were used for air reconnaissance and to attack serbian air defense positions .
this meant not only that german soldiers took an active role in fighting for the first time since the end of world war ii , but that they did so without a un mandate .
the german government justified its participation by saying it could not close its eyes to the suffering of the civilian population in kosovo .
not easy being green bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder , right , and fischer , left , both supported the kosovo war this policy change was particularly difficult for the green party , which historically has had close links to the peace movement .
angry demonstrators called top green politicians " murderers " as they arrived with police escorts for a party meeting in may of 1999 .
many long-time green supporters vehemently reject the use of military force , yet parliamentarian angelika beer defended party leaders from criticisms and insults being hurled at them .
the critics were cowardly , she said , and had no good alternatives to offer .
" those of you who are now yelling ‘ warmongers , ' would you have wanted us to turn a blind eye ? " she asked .
" how would you have wanted to justify it ? "
joschka fisher , the green 's foreign minister , found himself at the center of the criticism for his support of the war .
at one point a paint bomb was lobbed at his head , injuring him slightly .
" at this moment in time , i regard a one-sided , unlimited cessation of the bomb attacks as a wrong signal , " fischer said at one point .
germany still in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kfor still has soldiers in kosovo june of 1999 , milosevic withdrew his troops , allowing nato peacekeeping troops kfor to move in .
bundeswehr general klaus reinhardt was the commander of kfor for several years .
the deployment was important , reinhardt said .
" in kosovo , external stability was important because milosevic had said each day : ‘ i will take my country back by force , " ' reinhardt said .
only when the situation is stable can political and economic conditions improve , the general said .
however , bringing stability to kosovo has taken much longer than anyone expected at the time .
the red-green coalition has been out of office for nearly four years , but there are still more than 2,500 german soldiers stationed in kosovo .

a longstanding conflict has been the result - and reflects the situation in the country at large . belgium has been experiencing an ongoing political crisis for years .
rival parties are unable to reach agreement over the division of power and wealth between the richer , dutch-speaking province of flanders and the poorer , french-speaking region of wallonia . the country 's previous prime minister yves leterme failed in his efforts to decentralize power to the two regions in order to ease tensions between the flemish and the walloons .
it had meant amending the belgian constitution and leterme was unable to accomplish this . the new government under prime minister herman van rompuy , who took office at the end of 2008 , has been more concerned with the worldwide financial crisis . however , this paralysis over devolution is not really impacting most belgians , as stephen castle , a brussels-based journalist points out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's two regions also differ economically " this political crisis has been going on for a very long time , " castle says .
" frankly , people are used to it and possibly , apart from the politicians themselves are bored of it . " according to castle , even a paralyzed central government does n't really impact people 's day-to-day lives . " education continues , schools are open , hospitals are open , the garbage is cleared , " he says .
" from the practical point of view of most people , there really is very little impact . " not too worried namur is the capital of the french-speaking part of belgium , the region of wallonia .
at the central station , 30-year-old jean-francois says he has grown up with constant talk that belgium has no real future . " i 've heard this rumor since i was very little , " jean-francois says .
" belgium might disintegrate , but maybe people are seeing ghosts .
belgium has had an artificial side to it since its very beginnings . " jean-francois says he thinks the country could live like this for many years to come . " i think there are more serious problems than that , " he says . brussels must be resolved belgium is currently in the so-called sixth phase of a far-reaching political reform .
the process was started in the 1970s when the unitary belgian state became a federal state .
but here the division between regional politicians from the two sides goes deeper than they would in other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can van rompuy find a solution ?
" in order to make your name as a politician in belgium , you have to do that in your own community first , " castle says .
" if you 're , for example , a flemish politician like leterme , you really win no votes among your own core supporters by saying nice things about the francophone population in the south . " luc arnould is in charge of international relations at the city hall of namur .
he says that the country is n't likely to split unless the issue of brussels is resolved .
and he does n't see that happening anytime soon .
most people in the capital speak french but belong to the dutch-speaking part of the country . " we have to adapt the constitution and the way of working in belgium , but giving more and more autonomy to the regions , " arnould says .
" regions want to have more independence to organize their economies .
but there 's always the problem of brussels .
we need a lot of imagination to find a solution . " division remains a possibility many flemish people in brussels have no problem with living side by side with walloons .
bilingualism is a reality here in people 's daily lives , says this brussels native . " we speak both languages every day - french and dutch and english , " the man says .
" so there are no problems between the people here .
and in ten years ' time , the next generation will speak both languages all across belgium . " but the government turmoil has proven there is a problem between belgium 's communities on a political level .
journalist castle says partition remains a possibility , although it 's not likely anytime soon . " it would make it more difficult for belgium to be the center of the european union if it divided , " castle says .
" that would send a very poor message to a lot of countries which also have issues over devolution and how to divide up power .
i think there 's a general consensus that belgians are probably better off . " further devolution of power will be a long and arduous process .
but belgium 's politicians are used to treading warily when it comes to negotiating greater rights for their communities .
and that caution might stave off the breakup of belgium . nina haase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" " the air strikes have not solved problems in kosovo , and did not help to bring peace and the rule of law , " cvetkovic said at a special meeting of the cabinet to commemorate the attacks .
" on the contrary , they resulted in ethnic cleansing and gross violations of human rights , international standards and fresh tensions . " the alliance 's action , which was not sanctioned by the united nations security council , undermined milosevic 's power and is largely thought to have played a major role in his being sent to the hague to stand trial for war crimes .
he died in 2006 before the court could issue a verdict in his case . a necessary war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke has no regrets over the nato campaign western leaders saw nato 's air war , dubbed operation allied force , as the only way to end the 1998-1999 violent crackdown by milosevic 's forces on the kosovo liberation army and its supporters . " i look back on that extraordinary last meeting with milosevic , with a feeling that what we did was necessary and the right thing to do , " richard holbrooke , who served as the united states special envoy to the balkans , told reporters on saturday . " the people of kosovo are better off than they were as part of serbia , and serbia is better off facing the future rather than working back to a mythic past , " he added . then us president bill clinton also said at the time that the west had a " moral imperative " to take action against milosevic . the north atlantic treaty organization , in what was its largest military operation , set out to destroy dozens of targets .
in its 78 days of bombing , however , it also hit public infrastructure like bridges and railway tracks as well as homes , refugee convoys , a hospital and the chinese embassy in belgrade . human rights watch has estimated that about 500 civilians lost their lives during the bombing campaign , five times less than the yugoslav government claimed at the time . diverging views of war in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbs and kosovo albanians have very different feelings about nato 's intervention for ethnic albanians in kosovo , where they accounted for 90 percent of the region 's population despite being a minority in serbia overall , the war put a welcome end to their suffering at the hands of the serbian majority . " the appearance of combat airplanes in the sky above kosovo was a message of salvation for the people here , " kosovo justice minister nekibe kelmendi told afp . but for the serb minority , the campaign marked the beginning of their agony . " it was revenge for serbian disobedience , " said radoslav radovic , a 57-year-old from the serb-run half of kosovska mitrovica , a northern town that still simmers with ethnic tensions . radovic told afp he believes the west declared serbia guilty for " defending its integrity and its territory . " fearing ethnic albanian reprisals , tens of thousands of kosovo serbs fled their homes for serbia proper , with only a handful returning in the past decade .
of the 120,000 ethnic serbs estimated in kosovo , most live in the northern region that borders serbia or in small enclaves in southern areas . tensions run high after independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many kosovo serbs are still living in refugee camps in serbia proper tensions have remained high , especially since kosovo 's parliament unilaterally seceded from serbia in february 2008 , a move that has been recognized by 56 nations including the united states and most of the european union . officially , the united nations remains in charge of kosovo .
the 15-nation security council has not been able to alter the un mandate because its members are split over what to do with the un presence there and the legality of pristina 's declaration of independence . russia , a permanent veto-wielding member of the security council and serbia 's ally , has said it would not recognize an independent kosovo and has supported belgrade 's bid to challenge the declaration before the international court of justice in the hague . under a plan agreed to last year , police , customs officers and judges in the serb-run areas of kosovo remain under the un umbrella , known as unmik , while their albanian counterparts work with a european union police and justice mission called eulex . many kosovo albanians have come to view the un presence as an obstacle to independence , un secretary-general ban ki-moon said in a report published thursday . " there is a perception among many kosovo albanians that the mission 's tasks have been accomplished and its continued presence is an unwelcome obstacle to the desire for kosovo to function as a sovereign state , " ban said in his latest report to the security council on un activities in kosovo . ban 's report did not make recommendations on how to move forward as uncertainty in the region appears likely to continue . sms / tt / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the bombs dropped , germany ’ s armed forces joined in their first modern combat mission . then-chancellor gerhard schroeder had only been in office for a few months when he was called to explain germany 's participation in a nato bombing operation .
" overnight on thursday , nato launched air strikes against military targets in yugoslavia .
the alliance was compelled to take this step in order to prevent further heavy and systematic infringement of human rights in kosovo , " schroeder told the parliament .
it was the first time since world war ii that german soldiers had taken part in a combat mission .
for germany , the timing was complicated .
schroeder 's social democrats had just won a parliamentary majority together with the green party , forming a so-called red-green coalition .
one of their first decisions was whether to have the bundeswehr , which is what germany 's federal armed forces are called , participate in nato fighting .
from the beginning , schroeder was confident that he had political and public support for the mission .
" we are united and in agreement with the large majority of the german people and also - thank god - with a large majority of the german parliament , which cuts across all party lines , " schroeder said .
nato pressured milosevic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yugoslavia eventually pulled troops out of kosovo the weeks leading up to schroeder 's speech before parliament was had been turbulent ones .
the kosovo crisis was intensifying at the same time that the 16-year tenure of chancellor helmut kohl was coming to an end .
schroeder 's new coalition had not even had a chance to settle in before being hit with a series of major foreign policy decisions .
nato was turning up the heat on yugoslavian president slobodan milosevic , warning that it would launch air strikes if the expulsions and killings in kosovo continued .
nato general secretary javier solana issued a warning in the fall of 2008 : " just a few moments ago , the north atlantic council decided to issue activation orders - actords - for both a phased air campaign in yugoslavia and limited air operations . "
nato expected germany to make a contribution to the fighting .
the newly-elected parliament held a special meeting in october 1998 in bonn , germany .
a large majority of the delegates decided to allow bundeswehr troops to take part in nato air strikes , even without a united nations mandate .
deployment without a un mandate negotiations continued .
yugoslavian representatives meet with kosovo-albanians and nato in search of a solution .
germany 's new government , inexperienced in foreign policy , took a low-key approach , yet threw its support behind nato .
rudolf scharping , the secretary of defense for the social democrats , said at the time : " we want to do everything in our power to keep corpses from piling up in the balkans and to ensure that there is n't a new stream of refugees into europe . "
after yugoslavia refused to accept the rambouillet agreement , nato began bombing targets in belgrade and other serbian cities .
fourteen german tornado fighter planes were used for air reconnaissance and to attack serbian air defense positions .
this meant not only that german soldiers took an active role in fighting for the first time since the end of world war ii , but that they did so without a un mandate .
the german government justified its participation by saying it could not close its eyes to the suffering of the civilian population in kosovo .
not easy being green bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder , right , and fischer , left , both supported the kosovo war this policy change was particularly difficult for the green party , which historically has had close links to the peace movement .

many long-time green supporters vehemently reject the use of military force , yet parliamentarian angelika beer defended party leaders from criticisms and insults being hurled at them .
the critics were cowardly , she said , and had no good alternatives to offer .
" those of you who are now yelling ‘ warmongers , ' would you have wanted us to turn a blind eye ? " she asked .
" how would you have wanted to justify it ? "
joschka fisher , the green 's foreign minister , found himself at the center of the criticism for his support of the war .

" at this moment in time , i regard a one-sided , unlimited cessation of the bomb attacks as a wrong signal , " fischer said at one point .

the deployment was important , reinhardt said .
" in kosovo , external stability was important because milosevic had said each day : ‘ i will take my country back by force , " ' reinhardt said .
only when the situation is stable can political and economic conditions improve , the general said .
however , bringing stability to kosovo has taken much longer than anyone expected at the time .

as the bombs dropped , germany ’ s armed forces joined in their first modern combat mission . then-chancellor gerhard schroeder had only been in office for a few months when he was called to explain germany 's participation in a nato bombing operation .
" overnight on thursday , nato launched air strikes against military targets in yugoslavia .
the alliance was compelled to take this step in order to prevent further heavy and systematic infringement of human rights in kosovo , " schroeder told the parliament .
it was the first time since world war ii that german soldiers had taken part in a combat mission .
for germany , the timing was complicated .
schroeder 's social democrats had just won a parliamentary majority together with the green party , forming a so-called red-green coalition .
one of their first decisions was whether to have the bundeswehr , which is what germany 's federal armed forces are called , participate in nato fighting .
from the beginning , schroeder was confident that he had political and public support for the mission .
" we are united and in agreement with the large majority of the german people and also - thank god - with a large majority of the german parliament , which cuts across all party lines , " schroeder said .
nato pressured milosevic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yugoslavia eventually pulled troops out of kosovo the weeks leading up to schroeder 's speech before parliament was had been turbulent ones .
the kosovo crisis was intensifying at the same time that the 16-year tenure of chancellor helmut kohl was coming to an end .
schroeder 's new coalition had not even had a chance to settle in before being hit with a series of major foreign policy decisions .
nato was turning up the heat on yugoslavian president slobodan milosevic , warning that it would launch air strikes if the expulsions and killings in kosovo continued .
nato general secretary javier solana issued a warning in the fall of 2008 : " just a few moments ago , the north atlantic council decided to issue activation orders - actords - for both a phased air campaign in yugoslavia and limited air operations . "
nato expected germany to make a contribution to the fighting .
the newly-elected parliament held a special meeting in october 1998 in bonn , germany .
a large majority of the delegates decided to allow bundeswehr troops to take part in nato air strikes , even without a united nations mandate .
deployment without a un mandate negotiations continued .
yugoslavian representatives meet with kosovo-albanians and nato in search of a solution .
germany 's new government , inexperienced in foreign policy , took a low-key approach , yet threw its support behind nato .
rudolf scharping , the secretary of defense for the social democrats , said at the time : " we want to do everything in our power to keep corpses from piling up in the balkans and to ensure that there is n't a new stream of refugees into europe . "
after yugoslavia refused to accept the rambouillet agreement , nato began bombing targets in belgrade and other serbian cities .
fourteen german tornado fighter planes were used for air reconnaissance and to attack serbian air defense positions .
this meant not only that german soldiers took an active role in fighting for the first time since the end of world war ii , but that they did so without a un mandate .
the german government justified its participation by saying it could not close its eyes to the suffering of the civilian population in kosovo .
not easy being green bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder , right , and fischer , left , both supported the kosovo war this policy change was particularly difficult for the green party , which historically has had close links to the peace movement .
angry demonstrators called top green politicians " murderers " as they arrived with police escorts for a party meeting in may of 1999 .
many long-time green supporters vehemently reject the use of military force , yet parliamentarian angelika beer defended party leaders from criticisms and insults being hurled at them .
the critics were cowardly , she said , and had no good alternatives to offer .
" those of you who are now yelling ‘ warmongers , ' would you have wanted us to turn a blind eye ? " she asked .
" how would you have wanted to justify it ? "
joschka fisher , the green 's foreign minister , found himself at the center of the criticism for his support of the war .
at one point a paint bomb was lobbed at his head , injuring him slightly .
" at this moment in time , i regard a one-sided , unlimited cessation of the bomb attacks as a wrong signal , " fischer said at one point .
germany still in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kfor still has soldiers in kosovo june of 1999 , milosevic withdrew his troops , allowing nato peacekeeping troops kfor to move in .
bundeswehr general klaus reinhardt was the commander of kfor for several years .
the deployment was important , reinhardt said .
" in kosovo , external stability was important because milosevic had said each day : ‘ i will take my country back by force , " ' reinhardt said .
only when the situation is stable can political and economic conditions improve , the general said .
however , bringing stability to kosovo has taken much longer than anyone expected at the time .
the red-green coalition has been out of office for nearly four years , but there are still more than 2,500 german soldiers stationed in kosovo .

if you 're itching for a place you can really call your own , ebay has just the thing - a village in saxony that can be yours for the modest price of 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 405,000 -rrb- .

the asking price is a real bargain , especially if you consider that people routinely shell out 300,000 euros for an average-sized apartment in the city .
for the same amount , you could be the proud owner of liebon , a tiny village nestled in the state of saxony that has a history dating back to 1322 .
admittedly , tiny is the key adjective .
the village consists of three buildings , two road signs , and has a total area of just 15,000 square meters -lrb- 3.7 acres -rrb- - about the size of two football fields .
current population : eight .
one of those residents is karsten schmidt , 45 .
he lives in liebon with his wife and two children .
schmidt 's parents also live in the village , as does schmidt 's brother , who lives with his girlfriend .
rural idyll his describes liebon as a picture-book place - a farm with a big family home , a playground , a pond , a fountain and a tiny shop .
" the village is practically self-sufficient , " he told the bild newspaper .
" we planted an orchard in the big garden and we grow potatoes . "
despite the idyllic setting , schmidt says he 's ready to start packing the moving boxes if the family gets a decent offer .
" my two daughters are so far away from everything , " he said .
" my parents do n't have driving licenses , and you really depend on a car here . "
the nearest neighbors are some 1.5 kilometers away .

if you 're itching for a place you can really call your own , ebay has just the thing - a village in saxony that can be yours for the modest price of 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 405,000 -rrb- . " why do n't you buy your own village ? " reads the text accompanying the somewhat unusual property listing on the auction web site .
indeed , why not ?
the asking price is a real bargain , especially if you consider that people routinely shell out 300,000 euros for an average-sized apartment in the city .
for the same amount , you could be the proud owner of liebon , a tiny village nestled in the state of saxony that has a history dating back to 1322 .
admittedly , tiny is the key adjective .
the village consists of three buildings , two road signs , and has a total area of just 15,000 square meters -lrb- 3.7 acres -rrb- - about the size of two football fields .
current population : eight .
one of those residents is karsten schmidt , 45 .
he lives in liebon with his wife and two children .
schmidt 's parents also live in the village , as does schmidt 's brother , who lives with his girlfriend .
rural idyll his describes liebon as a picture-book place - a farm with a big family home , a playground , a pond , a fountain and a tiny shop .
" the village is practically self-sufficient , " he told the bild newspaper .
" we planted an orchard in the big garden and we grow potatoes . "
despite the idyllic setting , schmidt says he 's ready to start packing the moving boxes if the family gets a decent offer .
" my two daughters are so far away from everything , " he said .
" my parents do n't have driving licenses , and you really depend on a car here . "

ministers gathered at the same time to lay wreaths at spots where people were killed during the air war - at the time the biggest military operation in nato history .
" the attack on our country was illegal , contrary to international law , without a decision by the united nations " security council , prime minister mirko cvetkovic told a special commemorative sitting of his cabinet .
" the air strikes have not solved problems in kosovo , and did not help to bring peace and the rule of law .
" they resulted in ethnic cleansing and gross violations of human rights , international standards and fresh tensions , " he said , after schools held a minute 's silence before class .
kosovo leaders said however the nato bombing stopped serbian abuses in their breakaway territory and was a decisive step towards saving and freeing its people .
" the 78 days of strikes saved the people of kosovo from planned extermination , a scenario which was prepared coldly by the highest serb political and academic circles , " kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said .
kosovo prime minister hashim thaci described the bombing as " a big historic event for kosovo and the democratic world . "
" the successful completion of the campaign of intervention by nato opened a new chapter in the history of kosovo , a chapter of freedom , " said thaci .
anniversary of campaign to stop milosevic nato launched the strikes on march 24 , 1999 after milosevic refused to sign up to a peace deal to end his forces ' crackdown on the rebel kosovo liberation army -lrb- kla -rrb- and the ethnic albanian majority in the southern territory .

milosevic eventually conceded 78 days later , paving the way for nato to enter kosovo .
some 15,000 nato-led peacekeepers remain in kosovo , which 56 nations recognize after its ethnic albanian-dominated parliament declared unilateral independence from serbia 13 months ago .
as part of serbian commemorations , the bells of orthodox churches were to be tolled for the victims at 7:45 pm -lrb- 1845 gmt -rrb- - the moment nato 's first attacks were launched 10 years ago .
wounds still open in serbia separately , a hard-line nationalist group planned to stage an anti-nato rally in the main square of belgrade , according to posters that have gone up around serbia 's capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian protests have been violent in the past serbian media seized on the opportunity of the anniversary to rake over the coals of a conflict that may have ended a decade ago but one which remains very much in the national consciousness .
" serbs got bombs , the albanians got a state , " the daily blic said in its report .
belgrade contends that nato , by acting without a un mandate and by bombing civilian targets and using controversial ordnance , broke international laws because it was biased in favor of albanians .
human rights watch put the civilian death toll from the bombing campaign at around 500 .
milosevic 's government estimated the nato strikes killed more than 1,000 soldiers and 2,500 civilians , including 89 children , while 12,500 people were wounded and at least $ 30 billion in damage caused .
" a decade of the crime against serbia , " the daily press said , while politika wrote of the " bombing that was never declared a war . "
under the headline " days of death and destruction , " vecernje novosti recounted half a dozen personal stories , including those of families who lost children and of a military pilot who was shot down by nato .
health concerns also remain about the danger to civilians from weapons nato used during the campaign .
thousands risk life and limb from cluster bomblets still scattered across serbia as well as from depleted uranium , according to european non-governmental groups .
a " humanitarian intervention " many analysts contend the " humanitarian intervention " was necessary to prevent any recurrence of events like the 1995 srebrenica massacre by bosnian serbs of some 8,000 muslims - europe 's worst atrocity since world war ii .
up to 9,000 people were killed in kosovo 's 1998-1999 conflict , mostly ethnic albanians .

" the kla were no angels but srebrenica changed everything .
after that there was no guarantee that serbian forces might not do such a thing again , " judah told reporters .
" as to whether it was worth it - a classic ' what if ' of history .
it was short -lrb- ish -rrb- and brutal but if it had not been for the bombing we might still be living with a rumbling and brutal insurgency and low level conflict . " nda / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" " the air strikes have not solved problems in kosovo , and did not help to bring peace and the rule of law , " cvetkovic said at a special meeting of the cabinet to commemorate the attacks .
" on the contrary , they resulted in ethnic cleansing and gross violations of human rights , international standards and fresh tensions . " the alliance 's action , which was not sanctioned by the united nations security council , undermined milosevic 's power and is largely thought to have played a major role in his being sent to the hague to stand trial for war crimes .
he died in 2006 before the court could issue a verdict in his case . a necessary war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke has no regrets over the nato campaign western leaders saw nato 's air war , dubbed operation allied force , as the only way to end the 1998-1999 violent crackdown by milosevic 's forces on the kosovo liberation army and its supporters . " i look back on that extraordinary last meeting with milosevic , with a feeling that what we did was necessary and the right thing to do , " richard holbrooke , who served as the united states special envoy to the balkans , told reporters on saturday . " the people of kosovo are better off than they were as part of serbia , and serbia is better off facing the future rather than working back to a mythic past , " he added . then us president bill clinton also said at the time that the west had a " moral imperative " to take action against milosevic . the north atlantic treaty organization , in what was its largest military operation , set out to destroy dozens of targets .
in its 78 days of bombing , however , it also hit public infrastructure like bridges and railway tracks as well as homes , refugee convoys , a hospital and the chinese embassy in belgrade . human rights watch has estimated that about 500 civilians lost their lives during the bombing campaign , five times less than the yugoslav government claimed at the time . diverging views of war in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbs and kosovo albanians have very different feelings about nato 's intervention for ethnic albanians in kosovo , where they accounted for 90 percent of the region 's population despite being a minority in serbia overall , the war put a welcome end to their suffering at the hands of the serbian majority . " the appearance of combat airplanes in the sky above kosovo was a message of salvation for the people here , " kosovo justice minister nekibe kelmendi told afp . but for the serb minority , the campaign marked the beginning of their agony . " it was revenge for serbian disobedience , " said radoslav radovic , a 57-year-old from the serb-run half of kosovska mitrovica , a northern town that still simmers with ethnic tensions . radovic told afp he believes the west declared serbia guilty for " defending its integrity and its territory . " fearing ethnic albanian reprisals , tens of thousands of kosovo serbs fled their homes for serbia proper , with only a handful returning in the past decade .
of the 120,000 ethnic serbs estimated in kosovo , most live in the northern region that borders serbia or in small enclaves in southern areas . tensions run high after independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many kosovo serbs are still living in refugee camps in serbia proper tensions have remained high , especially since kosovo 's parliament unilaterally seceded from serbia in february 2008 , a move that has been recognized by 56 nations including the united states and most of the european union . officially , the united nations remains in charge of kosovo .
the 15-nation security council has not been able to alter the un mandate because its members are split over what to do with the un presence there and the legality of pristina 's declaration of independence . russia , a permanent veto-wielding member of the security council and serbia 's ally , has said it would not recognize an independent kosovo and has supported belgrade 's bid to challenge the declaration before the international court of justice in the hague . under a plan agreed to last year , police , customs officers and judges in the serb-run areas of kosovo remain under the un umbrella , known as unmik , while their albanian counterparts work with a european union police and justice mission called eulex . many kosovo albanians have come to view the un presence as an obstacle to independence , un secretary-general ban ki-moon said in a report published thursday . " there is a perception among many kosovo albanians that the mission 's tasks have been accomplished and its continued presence is an unwelcome obstacle to the desire for kosovo to function as a sovereign state , " ban said in his latest report to the security council on un activities in kosovo . ban 's report did not make recommendations on how to move forward as uncertainty in the region appears likely to continue . sms / tt / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" " the air strikes have not solved problems in kosovo , and did not help to bring peace and the rule of law , " cvetkovic said at a special meeting of the cabinet to commemorate the attacks .
" on the contrary , they resulted in ethnic cleansing and gross violations of human rights , international standards and fresh tensions . " the alliance 's action , which was not sanctioned by the united nations security council , undermined milosevic 's power and is largely thought to have played a major role in his being sent to the hague to stand trial for war crimes .

" i look back on that extraordinary last meeting with milosevic , with a feeling that what we did was necessary and the right thing to do , " richard holbrooke , who served as the united states special envoy to the balkans , told reporters on saturday . " the people of kosovo are better off than they were as part of serbia , and serbia is better off facing the future rather than working back to a mythic past , " he added . then us president bill clinton also said at the time that the west had a " moral imperative " to take action against milosevic . the north atlantic treaty organization , in what was its largest military operation , set out to destroy dozens of targets .
in its 78 days of bombing , however , it also hit public infrastructure like bridges and railway tracks as well as homes , refugee convoys , a hospital and the chinese embassy in belgrade . human rights watch has estimated that about 500 civilians lost their lives during the bombing campaign , five times less than the yugoslav government claimed at the time . diverging views of war in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbs and kosovo albanians have very different feelings about nato 's intervention for ethnic albanians in kosovo , where they accounted for 90 percent of the region 's population despite being a minority in serbia overall , the war put a welcome end to their suffering at the hands of the serbian majority . " the appearance of combat airplanes in the sky above kosovo was a message of salvation for the people here , " kosovo justice minister nekibe kelmendi told afp . but for the serb minority , the campaign marked the beginning of their agony . " it was revenge for serbian disobedience , " said radoslav radovic , a 57-year-old from the serb-run half of kosovska mitrovica , a northern town that still simmers with ethnic tensions . radovic told afp he believes the west declared serbia guilty for " defending its integrity and its territory . " fearing ethnic albanian reprisals , tens of thousands of kosovo serbs fled their homes for serbia proper , with only a handful returning in the past decade .

the 15-nation security council has not been able to alter the un mandate because its members are split over what to do with the un presence there and the legality of pristina 's declaration of independence . russia , a permanent veto-wielding member of the security council and serbia 's ally , has said it would not recognize an independent kosovo and has supported belgrade 's bid to challenge the declaration before the international court of justice in the hague . under a plan agreed to last year , police , customs officers and judges in the serb-run areas of kosovo remain under the un umbrella , known as unmik , while their albanian counterparts work with a european union police and justice mission called eulex . many kosovo albanians have come to view the un presence as an obstacle to independence , un secretary-general ban ki-moon said in a report published thursday . " there is a perception among many kosovo albanians that the mission 's tasks have been accomplished and its continued presence is an unwelcome obstacle to the desire for kosovo to function as a sovereign state , " ban said in his latest report to the security council on un activities in kosovo . ban 's report did not make recommendations on how to move forward as uncertainty in the region appears likely to continue . sms / tt / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it was revenge for serbian disobedience , " said radoslav radovic , a 57-year-old from the serb-run half of kosovska mitrovica , a northern town that still simmers with ethnic tensions . radovic told afp he believes the west declared serbia guilty for " defending its integrity and its territory . " fearing ethnic albanian reprisals , tens of thousands of kosovo serbs fled their homes for serbia proper , with only a handful returning in the past decade .
of the 120,000 ethnic serbs estimated in kosovo , most live in the northern region that borders serbia or in small enclaves in southern areas . tensions run high after independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many kosovo serbs are still living in refugee camps in serbia proper tensions have remained high , especially since kosovo 's parliament unilaterally seceded from serbia in february 2008 , a move that has been recognized by 56 nations including the united states and most of the european union . officially , the united nations remains in charge of kosovo .
the 15-nation security council has not been able to alter the un mandate because its members are split over what to do with the un presence there and the legality of pristina 's declaration of independence . russia , a permanent veto-wielding member of the security council and serbia 's ally , has said it would not recognize an independent kosovo and has supported belgrade 's bid to challenge the declaration before the international court of justice in the hague . under a plan agreed to last year , police , customs officers and judges in the serb-run areas of kosovo remain under the un umbrella , known as unmik , while their albanian counterparts work with a european union police and justice mission called eulex . many kosovo albanians have come to view the un presence as an obstacle to independence , un secretary-general ban ki-moon said in a report published thursday . " there is a perception among many kosovo albanians that the mission 's tasks have been accomplished and its continued presence is an unwelcome obstacle to the desire for kosovo to function as a sovereign state , " ban said in his latest report to the security council on un activities in kosovo . ban 's report did not make recommendations on how to move forward as uncertainty in the region appears likely to continue . sms / tt / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rival parties are unable to reach agreement over the division of power and wealth between the richer , dutch-speaking province of flanders and the poorer , french-speaking region of wallonia . the country 's previous prime minister yves leterme failed in his efforts to decentralize power to the two regions in order to ease tensions between the flemish and the walloons .
it had meant amending the belgian constitution and leterme was unable to accomplish this . the new government under prime minister herman van rompuy , who took office at the end of 2008 , has been more concerned with the worldwide financial crisis . however , this paralysis over devolution is not really impacting most belgians , as stephen castle , a brussels-based journalist points out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's two regions also differ economically " this political crisis has been going on for a very long time , " castle says .
" frankly , people are used to it and possibly , apart from the politicians themselves are bored of it . " according to castle , even a paralyzed central government does n't really impact people 's day-to-day lives . " education continues , schools are open , hospitals are open , the garbage is cleared , " he says .
" from the practical point of view of most people , there really is very little impact . " not too worried namur is the capital of the french-speaking part of belgium , the region of wallonia .
at the central station , 30-year-old jean-francois says he has grown up with constant talk that belgium has no real future . " i 've heard this rumor since i was very little , " jean-francois says .
" belgium might disintegrate , but maybe people are seeing ghosts .
belgium has had an artificial side to it since its very beginnings . " jean-francois says he thinks the country could live like this for many years to come . " i think there are more serious problems than that , " he says . brussels must be resolved belgium is currently in the so-called sixth phase of a far-reaching political reform .
the process was started in the 1970s when the unitary belgian state became a federal state .
but here the division between regional politicians from the two sides goes deeper than they would in other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can van rompuy find a solution ?
" in order to make your name as a politician in belgium , you have to do that in your own community first , " castle says .
" if you 're , for example , a flemish politician like leterme , you really win no votes among your own core supporters by saying nice things about the francophone population in the south . " luc arnould is in charge of international relations at the city hall of namur .
he says that the country is n't likely to split unless the issue of brussels is resolved .
and he does n't see that happening anytime soon .
most people in the capital speak french but belong to the dutch-speaking part of the country . " we have to adapt the constitution and the way of working in belgium , but giving more and more autonomy to the regions , " arnould says .
" regions want to have more independence to organize their economies .
but there 's always the problem of brussels .
we need a lot of imagination to find a solution . " division remains a possibility many flemish people in brussels have no problem with living side by side with walloons .
bilingualism is a reality here in people 's daily lives , says this brussels native . " we speak both languages every day - french and dutch and english , " the man says .
" so there are no problems between the people here .
and in ten years ' time , the next generation will speak both languages all across belgium . " but the government turmoil has proven there is a problem between belgium 's communities on a political level .
journalist castle says partition remains a possibility , although it 's not likely anytime soon . " it would make it more difficult for belgium to be the center of the european union if it divided , " castle says .
" that would send a very poor message to a lot of countries which also have issues over devolution and how to divide up power .
i think there 's a general consensus that belgians are probably better off . " further devolution of power will be a long and arduous process .
but belgium 's politicians are used to treading warily when it comes to negotiating greater rights for their communities .
and that caution might stave off the breakup of belgium . nina haase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a longstanding conflict has been the result - and reflects the situation in the country at large . belgium has been experiencing an ongoing political crisis for years .
rival parties are unable to reach agreement over the division of power and wealth between the richer , dutch-speaking province of flanders and the poorer , french-speaking region of wallonia . the country 's previous prime minister yves leterme failed in his efforts to decentralize power to the two regions in order to ease tensions between the flemish and the walloons .
it had meant amending the belgian constitution and leterme was unable to accomplish this . the new government under prime minister herman van rompuy , who took office at the end of 2008 , has been more concerned with the worldwide financial crisis . however , this paralysis over devolution is not really impacting most belgians , as stephen castle , a brussels-based journalist points out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's two regions also differ economically " this political crisis has been going on for a very long time , " castle says .
" frankly , people are used to it and possibly , apart from the politicians themselves are bored of it . " according to castle , even a paralyzed central government does n't really impact people 's day-to-day lives . " education continues , schools are open , hospitals are open , the garbage is cleared , " he says .
" from the practical point of view of most people , there really is very little impact . " not too worried namur is the capital of the french-speaking part of belgium , the region of wallonia .
at the central station , 30-year-old jean-francois says he has grown up with constant talk that belgium has no real future . " i 've heard this rumor since i was very little , " jean-francois says .
" belgium might disintegrate , but maybe people are seeing ghosts .
belgium has had an artificial side to it since its very beginnings . " jean-francois says he thinks the country could live like this for many years to come . " i think there are more serious problems than that , " he says . brussels must be resolved belgium is currently in the so-called sixth phase of a far-reaching political reform .
the process was started in the 1970s when the unitary belgian state became a federal state .
but here the division between regional politicians from the two sides goes deeper than they would in other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can van rompuy find a solution ?
" in order to make your name as a politician in belgium , you have to do that in your own community first , " castle says .
" if you 're , for example , a flemish politician like leterme , you really win no votes among your own core supporters by saying nice things about the francophone population in the south . " luc arnould is in charge of international relations at the city hall of namur .
he says that the country is n't likely to split unless the issue of brussels is resolved .
and he does n't see that happening anytime soon .
most people in the capital speak french but belong to the dutch-speaking part of the country . " we have to adapt the constitution and the way of working in belgium , but giving more and more autonomy to the regions , " arnould says .
" regions want to have more independence to organize their economies .
but there 's always the problem of brussels .
we need a lot of imagination to find a solution . " division remains a possibility many flemish people in brussels have no problem with living side by side with walloons .
bilingualism is a reality here in people 's daily lives , says this brussels native . " we speak both languages every day - french and dutch and english , " the man says .
" so there are no problems between the people here .
and in ten years ' time , the next generation will speak both languages all across belgium . " but the government turmoil has proven there is a problem between belgium 's communities on a political level .
journalist castle says partition remains a possibility , although it 's not likely anytime soon . " it would make it more difficult for belgium to be the center of the european union if it divided , " castle says .
" that would send a very poor message to a lot of countries which also have issues over devolution and how to divide up power .
i think there 's a general consensus that belgians are probably better off . " further devolution of power will be a long and arduous process .
but belgium 's politicians are used to treading warily when it comes to negotiating greater rights for their communities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 24.03.2009 ten years on , germany looks back at return to war in kosovo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany used fighter jets to bomb serbian targets ten years ago , german fighter planes participated in nato air strikes against serbian targets .
as the bombs dropped , germany ’ s armed forces joined in their first modern combat mission . then-chancellor gerhard schroeder had only been in office for a few months when he was called to explain germany 's participation in a nato bombing operation .
" overnight on thursday , nato launched air strikes against military targets in yugoslavia .
the alliance was compelled to take this step in order to prevent further heavy and systematic infringement of human rights in kosovo , " schroeder told the parliament .
it was the first time since world war ii that german soldiers had taken part in a combat mission .
for germany , the timing was complicated .
schroeder 's social democrats had just won a parliamentary majority together with the green party , forming a so-called red-green coalition .
one of their first decisions was whether to have the bundeswehr , which is what germany 's federal armed forces are called , participate in nato fighting .
from the beginning , schroeder was confident that he had political and public support for the mission .
" we are united and in agreement with the large majority of the german people and also - thank god - with a large majority of the german parliament , which cuts across all party lines , " schroeder said .
nato pressured milosevic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yugoslavia eventually pulled troops out of kosovo the weeks leading up to schroeder 's speech before parliament was had been turbulent ones .
the kosovo crisis was intensifying at the same time that the 16-year tenure of chancellor helmut kohl was coming to an end .
schroeder 's new coalition had not even had a chance to settle in before being hit with a series of major foreign policy decisions .
nato was turning up the heat on yugoslavian president slobodan milosevic , warning that it would launch air strikes if the expulsions and killings in kosovo continued .
nato general secretary javier solana issued a warning in the fall of 2008 : " just a few moments ago , the north atlantic council decided to issue activation orders - actords - for both a phased air campaign in yugoslavia and limited air operations . "
nato expected germany to make a contribution to the fighting .
the newly-elected parliament held a special meeting in october 1998 in bonn , germany .
a large majority of the delegates decided to allow bundeswehr troops to take part in nato air strikes , even without a united nations mandate .
deployment without a un mandate negotiations continued .
yugoslavian representatives meet with kosovo-albanians and nato in search of a solution .
germany 's new government , inexperienced in foreign policy , took a low-key approach , yet threw its support behind nato .
rudolf scharping , the secretary of defense for the social democrats , said at the time : " we want to do everything in our power to keep corpses from piling up in the balkans and to ensure that there is n't a new stream of refugees into europe . "
after yugoslavia refused to accept the rambouillet agreement , nato began bombing targets in belgrade and other serbian cities .
fourteen german tornado fighter planes were used for air reconnaissance and to attack serbian air defense positions .
this meant not only that german soldiers took an active role in fighting for the first time since the end of world war ii , but that they did so without a un mandate .
the german government justified its participation by saying it could not close its eyes to the suffering of the civilian population in kosovo .
not easy being green bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder , right , and fischer , left , both supported the kosovo war this policy change was particularly difficult for the green party , which historically has had close links to the peace movement .
angry demonstrators called top green politicians " murderers " as they arrived with police escorts for a party meeting in may of 1999 .
many long-time green supporters vehemently reject the use of military force , yet parliamentarian angelika beer defended party leaders from criticisms and insults being hurled at them .
the critics were cowardly , she said , and had no good alternatives to offer .
" those of you who are now yelling ‘ warmongers , ' would you have wanted us to turn a blind eye ? " she asked .
" how would you have wanted to justify it ? "

as the bombs dropped , germany ’ s armed forces joined in their first modern combat mission . then-chancellor gerhard schroeder had only been in office for a few months when he was called to explain germany 's participation in a nato bombing operation .
" overnight on thursday , nato launched air strikes against military targets in yugoslavia .
the alliance was compelled to take this step in order to prevent further heavy and systematic infringement of human rights in kosovo , " schroeder told the parliament .
it was the first time since world war ii that german soldiers had taken part in a combat mission .
for germany , the timing was complicated .
schroeder 's social democrats had just won a parliamentary majority together with the green party , forming a so-called red-green coalition .
one of their first decisions was whether to have the bundeswehr , which is what germany 's federal armed forces are called , participate in nato fighting .
from the beginning , schroeder was confident that he had political and public support for the mission .
" we are united and in agreement with the large majority of the german people and also - thank god - with a large majority of the german parliament , which cuts across all party lines , " schroeder said .
nato pressured milosevic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yugoslavia eventually pulled troops out of kosovo the weeks leading up to schroeder 's speech before parliament was had been turbulent ones .
the kosovo crisis was intensifying at the same time that the 16-year tenure of chancellor helmut kohl was coming to an end .
schroeder 's new coalition had not even had a chance to settle in before being hit with a series of major foreign policy decisions .
nato was turning up the heat on yugoslavian president slobodan milosevic , warning that it would launch air strikes if the expulsions and killings in kosovo continued .
nato general secretary javier solana issued a warning in the fall of 2008 : " just a few moments ago , the north atlantic council decided to issue activation orders - actords - for both a phased air campaign in yugoslavia and limited air operations . "
nato expected germany to make a contribution to the fighting .
the newly-elected parliament held a special meeting in october 1998 in bonn , germany .
a large majority of the delegates decided to allow bundeswehr troops to take part in nato air strikes , even without a united nations mandate .
deployment without a un mandate negotiations continued .
yugoslavian representatives meet with kosovo-albanians and nato in search of a solution .
germany 's new government , inexperienced in foreign policy , took a low-key approach , yet threw its support behind nato .
rudolf scharping , the secretary of defense for the social democrats , said at the time : " we want to do everything in our power to keep corpses from piling up in the balkans and to ensure that there is n't a new stream of refugees into europe . "
after yugoslavia refused to accept the rambouillet agreement , nato began bombing targets in belgrade and other serbian cities .
fourteen german tornado fighter planes were used for air reconnaissance and to attack serbian air defense positions .
this meant not only that german soldiers took an active role in fighting for the first time since the end of world war ii , but that they did so without a un mandate .
the german government justified its participation by saying it could not close its eyes to the suffering of the civilian population in kosovo .
not easy being green bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder , right , and fischer , left , both supported the kosovo war this policy change was particularly difficult for the green party , which historically has had close links to the peace movement .
angry demonstrators called top green politicians " murderers " as they arrived with police escorts for a party meeting in may of 1999 .
many long-time green supporters vehemently reject the use of military force , yet parliamentarian angelika beer defended party leaders from criticisms and insults being hurled at them .
the critics were cowardly , she said , and had no good alternatives to offer .

schroeder 's new coalition had not even had a chance to settle in before being hit with a series of major foreign policy decisions .
nato was turning up the heat on yugoslavian president slobodan milosevic , warning that it would launch air strikes if the expulsions and killings in kosovo continued .
nato general secretary javier solana issued a warning in the fall of 2008 : " just a few moments ago , the north atlantic council decided to issue activation orders - actords - for both a phased air campaign in yugoslavia and limited air operations . "
nato expected germany to make a contribution to the fighting .
the newly-elected parliament held a special meeting in october 1998 in bonn , germany .
a large majority of the delegates decided to allow bundeswehr troops to take part in nato air strikes , even without a united nations mandate .
deployment without a un mandate negotiations continued .
yugoslavian representatives meet with kosovo-albanians and nato in search of a solution .
germany 's new government , inexperienced in foreign policy , took a low-key approach , yet threw its support behind nato .
rudolf scharping , the secretary of defense for the social democrats , said at the time : " we want to do everything in our power to keep corpses from piling up in the balkans and to ensure that there is n't a new stream of refugees into europe . "
after yugoslavia refused to accept the rambouillet agreement , nato began bombing targets in belgrade and other serbian cities .
fourteen german tornado fighter planes were used for air reconnaissance and to attack serbian air defense positions .
this meant not only that german soldiers took an active role in fighting for the first time since the end of world war ii , but that they did so without a un mandate .
the german government justified its participation by saying it could not close its eyes to the suffering of the civilian population in kosovo .
not easy being green bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder , right , and fischer , left , both supported the kosovo war this policy change was particularly difficult for the green party , which historically has had close links to the peace movement .
angry demonstrators called top green politicians " murderers " as they arrived with police escorts for a party meeting in may of 1999 .
many long-time green supporters vehemently reject the use of military force , yet parliamentarian angelika beer defended party leaders from criticisms and insults being hurled at them .
the critics were cowardly , she said , and had no good alternatives to offer .
" those of you who are now yelling ‘ warmongers , ' would you have wanted us to turn a blind eye ? " she asked .
" how would you have wanted to justify it ? "
joschka fisher , the green 's foreign minister , found himself at the center of the criticism for his support of the war .
at one point a paint bomb was lobbed at his head , injuring him slightly .
" at this moment in time , i regard a one-sided , unlimited cessation of the bomb attacks as a wrong signal , " fischer said at one point .
germany still in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kfor still has soldiers in kosovo june of 1999 , milosevic withdrew his troops , allowing nato peacekeeping troops kfor to move in .
bundeswehr general klaus reinhardt was the commander of kfor for several years .
the deployment was important , reinhardt said .
" in kosovo , external stability was important because milosevic had said each day : ‘ i will take my country back by force , " ' reinhardt said .
only when the situation is stable can political and economic conditions improve , the general said .
however , bringing stability to kosovo has taken much longer than anyone expected at the time .
the red-green coalition has been out of office for nearly four years , but there are still more than 2,500 german soldiers stationed in kosovo .

as the bombs dropped , germany ’ s armed forces joined in their first modern combat mission . then-chancellor gerhard schroeder had only been in office for a few months when he was called to explain germany 's participation in a nato bombing operation .
" overnight on thursday , nato launched air strikes against military targets in yugoslavia .
the alliance was compelled to take this step in order to prevent further heavy and systematic infringement of human rights in kosovo , " schroeder told the parliament .
it was the first time since world war ii that german soldiers had taken part in a combat mission .
for germany , the timing was complicated .
schroeder 's social democrats had just won a parliamentary majority together with the green party , forming a so-called red-green coalition .
one of their first decisions was whether to have the bundeswehr , which is what germany 's federal armed forces are called , participate in nato fighting .
from the beginning , schroeder was confident that he had political and public support for the mission .
" we are united and in agreement with the large majority of the german people and also - thank god - with a large majority of the german parliament , which cuts across all party lines , " schroeder said .
nato pressured milosevic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yugoslavia eventually pulled troops out of kosovo the weeks leading up to schroeder 's speech before parliament was had been turbulent ones .

" the attack on our country was illegal , contrary to international law , without a decision by the united nations " security council , prime minister mirko cvetkovic told a special commemorative sitting of his cabinet .
" the air strikes have not solved problems in kosovo , and did not help to bring peace and the rule of law .

" the kla were no angels but srebrenica changed everything .
after that there was no guarantee that serbian forces might not do such a thing again , " judah told reporters .
" as to whether it was worth it - a classic ' what if ' of history .
it was short -lrb- ish -rrb- and brutal but if it had not been for the bombing we might still be living with a rumbling and brutal insurgency and low level conflict . " nda / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a longstanding conflict has been the result - and reflects the situation in the country at large . belgium has been experiencing an ongoing political crisis for years .
rival parties are unable to reach agreement over the division of power and wealth between the richer , dutch-speaking province of flanders and the poorer , french-speaking region of wallonia . the country 's previous prime minister yves leterme failed in his efforts to decentralize power to the two regions in order to ease tensions between the flemish and the walloons .
it had meant amending the belgian constitution and leterme was unable to accomplish this . the new government under prime minister herman van rompuy , who took office at the end of 2008 , has been more concerned with the worldwide financial crisis . however , this paralysis over devolution is not really impacting most belgians , as stephen castle , a brussels-based journalist points out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's two regions also differ economically " this political crisis has been going on for a very long time , " castle says .

it had meant amending the belgian constitution and leterme was unable to accomplish this . the new government under prime minister herman van rompuy , who took office at the end of 2008 , has been more concerned with the worldwide financial crisis . however , this paralysis over devolution is not really impacting most belgians , as stephen castle , a brussels-based journalist points out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's two regions also differ economically " this political crisis has been going on for a very long time , " castle says .
" frankly , people are used to it and possibly , apart from the politicians themselves are bored of it . " according to castle , even a paralyzed central government does n't really impact people 's day-to-day lives . " education continues , schools are open , hospitals are open , the garbage is cleared , " he says .
" from the practical point of view of most people , there really is very little impact . " not too worried namur is the capital of the french-speaking part of belgium , the region of wallonia .
at the central station , 30-year-old jean-francois says he has grown up with constant talk that belgium has no real future . " i 've heard this rumor since i was very little , " jean-francois says .
" belgium might disintegrate , but maybe people are seeing ghosts .
belgium has had an artificial side to it since its very beginnings . " jean-francois says he thinks the country could live like this for many years to come . " i think there are more serious problems than that , " he says . brussels must be resolved belgium is currently in the so-called sixth phase of a far-reaching political reform .
the process was started in the 1970s when the unitary belgian state became a federal state .
but here the division between regional politicians from the two sides goes deeper than they would in other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can van rompuy find a solution ?
" in order to make your name as a politician in belgium , you have to do that in your own community first , " castle says .
" if you 're , for example , a flemish politician like leterme , you really win no votes among your own core supporters by saying nice things about the francophone population in the south . " luc arnould is in charge of international relations at the city hall of namur .
he says that the country is n't likely to split unless the issue of brussels is resolved .
and he does n't see that happening anytime soon .
most people in the capital speak french but belong to the dutch-speaking part of the country . " we have to adapt the constitution and the way of working in belgium , but giving more and more autonomy to the regions , " arnould says .
" regions want to have more independence to organize their economies .
but there 's always the problem of brussels .
we need a lot of imagination to find a solution . " division remains a possibility many flemish people in brussels have no problem with living side by side with walloons .
bilingualism is a reality here in people 's daily lives , says this brussels native . " we speak both languages every day - french and dutch and english , " the man says .
" so there are no problems between the people here .
and in ten years ' time , the next generation will speak both languages all across belgium . " but the government turmoil has proven there is a problem between belgium 's communities on a political level .
journalist castle says partition remains a possibility , although it 's not likely anytime soon . " it would make it more difficult for belgium to be the center of the european union if it divided , " castle says .
" that would send a very poor message to a lot of countries which also have issues over devolution and how to divide up power .
i think there 's a general consensus that belgians are probably better off . " further devolution of power will be a long and arduous process .

" " the air strikes have not solved problems in kosovo , and did not help to bring peace and the rule of law , " cvetkovic said at a special meeting of the cabinet to commemorate the attacks .
" on the contrary , they resulted in ethnic cleansing and gross violations of human rights , international standards and fresh tensions . " the alliance 's action , which was not sanctioned by the united nations security council , undermined milosevic 's power and is largely thought to have played a major role in his being sent to the hague to stand trial for war crimes .
he died in 2006 before the court could issue a verdict in his case . a necessary war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke has no regrets over the nato campaign western leaders saw nato 's air war , dubbed operation allied force , as the only way to end the 1998-1999 violent crackdown by milosevic 's forces on the kosovo liberation army and its supporters . " i look back on that extraordinary last meeting with milosevic , with a feeling that what we did was necessary and the right thing to do , " richard holbrooke , who served as the united states special envoy to the balkans , told reporters on saturday . " the people of kosovo are better off than they were as part of serbia , and serbia is better off facing the future rather than working back to a mythic past , " he added . then us president bill clinton also said at the time that the west had a " moral imperative " to take action against milosevic . the north atlantic treaty organization , in what was its largest military operation , set out to destroy dozens of targets .
in its 78 days of bombing , however , it also hit public infrastructure like bridges and railway tracks as well as homes , refugee convoys , a hospital and the chinese embassy in belgrade . human rights watch has estimated that about 500 civilians lost their lives during the bombing campaign , five times less than the yugoslav government claimed at the time . diverging views of war in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbs and kosovo albanians have very different feelings about nato 's intervention for ethnic albanians in kosovo , where they accounted for 90 percent of the region 's population despite being a minority in serbia overall , the war put a welcome end to their suffering at the hands of the serbian majority . " the appearance of combat airplanes in the sky above kosovo was a message of salvation for the people here , " kosovo justice minister nekibe kelmendi told afp . but for the serb minority , the campaign marked the beginning of their agony . " it was revenge for serbian disobedience , " said radoslav radovic , a 57-year-old from the serb-run half of kosovska mitrovica , a northern town that still simmers with ethnic tensions . radovic told afp he believes the west declared serbia guilty for " defending its integrity and its territory . " fearing ethnic albanian reprisals , tens of thousands of kosovo serbs fled their homes for serbia proper , with only a handful returning in the past decade .
of the 120,000 ethnic serbs estimated in kosovo , most live in the northern region that borders serbia or in small enclaves in southern areas . tensions run high after independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many kosovo serbs are still living in refugee camps in serbia proper tensions have remained high , especially since kosovo 's parliament unilaterally seceded from serbia in february 2008 , a move that has been recognized by 56 nations including the united states and most of the european union . officially , the united nations remains in charge of kosovo .
the 15-nation security council has not been able to alter the un mandate because its members are split over what to do with the un presence there and the legality of pristina 's declaration of independence . russia , a permanent veto-wielding member of the security council and serbia 's ally , has said it would not recognize an independent kosovo and has supported belgrade 's bid to challenge the declaration before the international court of justice in the hague . under a plan agreed to last year , police , customs officers and judges in the serb-run areas of kosovo remain under the un umbrella , known as unmik , while their albanian counterparts work with a european union police and justice mission called eulex . many kosovo albanians have come to view the un presence as an obstacle to independence , un secretary-general ban ki-moon said in a report published thursday . " there is a perception among many kosovo albanians that the mission 's tasks have been accomplished and its continued presence is an unwelcome obstacle to the desire for kosovo to function as a sovereign state , " ban said in his latest report to the security council on un activities in kosovo . ban 's report did not make recommendations on how to move forward as uncertainty in the region appears likely to continue . sms / tt / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in its 78 days of bombing , however , it also hit public infrastructure like bridges and railway tracks as well as homes , refugee convoys , a hospital and the chinese embassy in belgrade . human rights watch has estimated that about 500 civilians lost their lives during the bombing campaign , five times less than the yugoslav government claimed at the time . diverging views of war in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbs and kosovo albanians have very different feelings about nato 's intervention for ethnic albanians in kosovo , where they accounted for 90 percent of the region 's population despite being a minority in serbia overall , the war put a welcome end to their suffering at the hands of the serbian majority . " the appearance of combat airplanes in the sky above kosovo was a message of salvation for the people here , " kosovo justice minister nekibe kelmendi told afp . but for the serb minority , the campaign marked the beginning of their agony . " it was revenge for serbian disobedience , " said radoslav radovic , a 57-year-old from the serb-run half of kosovska mitrovica , a northern town that still simmers with ethnic tensions . radovic told afp he believes the west declared serbia guilty for " defending its integrity and its territory . " fearing ethnic albanian reprisals , tens of thousands of kosovo serbs fled their homes for serbia proper , with only a handful returning in the past decade .
of the 120,000 ethnic serbs estimated in kosovo , most live in the northern region that borders serbia or in small enclaves in southern areas . tensions run high after independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many kosovo serbs are still living in refugee camps in serbia proper tensions have remained high , especially since kosovo 's parliament unilaterally seceded from serbia in february 2008 , a move that has been recognized by 56 nations including the united states and most of the european union . officially , the united nations remains in charge of kosovo .
the 15-nation security council has not been able to alter the un mandate because its members are split over what to do with the un presence there and the legality of pristina 's declaration of independence . russia , a permanent veto-wielding member of the security council and serbia 's ally , has said it would not recognize an independent kosovo and has supported belgrade 's bid to challenge the declaration before the international court of justice in the hague . under a plan agreed to last year , police , customs officers and judges in the serb-run areas of kosovo remain under the un umbrella , known as unmik , while their albanian counterparts work with a european union police and justice mission called eulex . many kosovo albanians have come to view the un presence as an obstacle to independence , un secretary-general ban ki-moon said in a report published thursday . " there is a perception among many kosovo albanians that the mission 's tasks have been accomplished and its continued presence is an unwelcome obstacle to the desire for kosovo to function as a sovereign state , " ban said in his latest report to the security council on un activities in kosovo . ban 's report did not make recommendations on how to move forward as uncertainty in the region appears likely to continue . sms / tt / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a longstanding conflict has been the result - and reflects the situation in the country at large . belgium has been experiencing an ongoing political crisis for years .
rival parties are unable to reach agreement over the division of power and wealth between the richer , dutch-speaking province of flanders and the poorer , french-speaking region of wallonia . the country 's previous prime minister yves leterme failed in his efforts to decentralize power to the two regions in order to ease tensions between the flemish and the walloons .
it had meant amending the belgian constitution and leterme was unable to accomplish this . the new government under prime minister herman van rompuy , who took office at the end of 2008 , has been more concerned with the worldwide financial crisis . however , this paralysis over devolution is not really impacting most belgians , as stephen castle , a brussels-based journalist points out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's two regions also differ economically " this political crisis has been going on for a very long time , " castle says .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 24.03.2009 west favors dane for top nato post , but turkish hurdles remain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's secretary-general post traditionally goes to a european danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen looks like the top contender for nato 's civilian head , but turkey might exercise its veto against the dane because of a cartoon controversy that had inflamed the muslim world . the united states gave its blessing to the appointment of danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen as the next nato secretary general in brussels over the weekend , paving the way for him to take over the trans-atlantic alliance 's top civilian job in august . washington also enjoys strong support for the choice of rasmussen from its three biggest european allies in the alliance - germany , france and the uk . although rasmussen , 56 , declined to publicly comment on the possibility of succeeding dutch diplomat jaap de hoop scheffer , he never officially ruled himself out as a candidate for a post that has traditionally gone to a european . dane favored by us and europeans rasmussen is regarded as a loyal us ally and also appeals to europeans for supporting closer ties between nato and the european union . an analyst at the london-based european council for foreign relations told the afp news agency that the danish prime minister has long enjoyed us support from politicians of all stripes . " rasmussen was at the head of the list for the former bush administration , just as he is for the current obama administration , " analyst daniel korski said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish caricatures inflamed passions in the muslim world " the americans want someone who will continue to push for military engagement in afghanistan , " he said , pointing out that denmark has some 750 soldiers stationed in the volatile southern part of the country where the taliban insurgency is most active . us and european support however does not guarantee that rasmussen will become the appointed successor to scheffer . turkish opposition possible the main snag to rasmussen 's nomination , which needs to be approved by all members of the 26-nation alliance , is possible opposition to his candidacy from turkey , a secular nation that is predominantly muslim . denmark had outraged muslims around the world in 2005 when the widely circulated jyllands-posten newspaper published a series of cartoon caricatures depicting the prophet muhammad as a terrorist . rasmussen , who has been prime minister since 2001 , had refused to apologize for the cartoons invoking the right of the press to freedom of expression .
the controversial cartoons , which were later republished by media around the globe , had sparked riots and attacks on danish embassies in the muslim world . cartoon controversy " the cartoon crisis has a larger dimension than just turkey , " a turkish official , who requested anonymity , told reuters .
" at a time when nato is going to assume added responsibility in afghanistan and pakistan , having a secretary general with such an objectionable approach to billions of muslims , is not the right approach to the muslim world . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's foreign minister -lrb- right -rrb- is an unlikely candidate turkey has also attacked denmark for failing to revoke the broadcasting license of a television station that ankara has accused of being a mouthpiece for kurdish rebels opposed to the government .
adding fuel to the fire , rasmussen had publicly stated in 2003 that he opposed full eu membership for turkey . " it may come to the veto , " retuers quoted the anonymous official as saying .
" we will have to see . " the chances for other candidates for nato 's number two position , however , are dwindling . polish candidate viewed as antagonistic to russia polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski was rumored to be a favorite for secretary general post , but the appointment of a pro-american polish national is viewed as antagonizing russia at a time when nato is seeking better relations with the kremlin . russia has been bitterly opposed to the deployment of a us anti-missile defense shield on polish territory . turkey had favored a canadian for the post , since ottawa supports ankara 's bid to join the eu .
however canadian defense minister peter mackay ruled himself out as a candidate on sunday . canadian ruled out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer 's successor should be announced at nato summit mackay 's rumored candidacy had the apparent support of us vice president joe biden as a reward for canada 's role in combat missions in dangerous southern afghanistan .
his spokesman , however , told reporters that the canadian never sought the post even though biden had downplayed an unwritten rule that the secretary general come from a european nation in exchange for nato 's top military post going to an american . the choice for the number two position as secretary general is expected to be named at the april 3-4 nato summit , but getting turkey to agree to the choice of rasmussen would be the key . df / sms / afp / reuters / send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 24.03.2009 west favors dane for top nato post , but turkish hurdles remain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's secretary-general post traditionally goes to a european danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen looks like the top contender for nato 's civilian head , but turkey might exercise its veto against the dane because of a cartoon controversy that had inflamed the muslim world . the united states gave its blessing to the appointment of danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen as the next nato secretary general in brussels over the weekend , paving the way for him to take over the trans-atlantic alliance 's top civilian job in august . washington also enjoys strong support for the choice of rasmussen from its three biggest european allies in the alliance - germany , france and the uk . although rasmussen , 56 , declined to publicly comment on the possibility of succeeding dutch diplomat jaap de hoop scheffer , he never officially ruled himself out as a candidate for a post that has traditionally gone to a european . dane favored by us and europeans rasmussen is regarded as a loyal us ally and also appeals to europeans for supporting closer ties between nato and the european union . an analyst at the london-based european council for foreign relations told the afp news agency that the danish prime minister has long enjoyed us support from politicians of all stripes . " rasmussen was at the head of the list for the former bush administration , just as he is for the current obama administration , " analyst daniel korski said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish caricatures inflamed passions in the muslim world " the americans want someone who will continue to push for military engagement in afghanistan , " he said , pointing out that denmark has some 750 soldiers stationed in the volatile southern part of the country where the taliban insurgency is most active . us and european support however does not guarantee that rasmussen will become the appointed successor to scheffer . turkish opposition possible the main snag to rasmussen 's nomination , which needs to be approved by all members of the 26-nation alliance , is possible opposition to his candidacy from turkey , a secular nation that is predominantly muslim . denmark had outraged muslims around the world in 2005 when the widely circulated jyllands-posten newspaper published a series of cartoon caricatures depicting the prophet muhammad as a terrorist . rasmussen , who has been prime minister since 2001 , had refused to apologize for the cartoons invoking the right of the press to freedom of expression .
the controversial cartoons , which were later republished by media around the globe , had sparked riots and attacks on danish embassies in the muslim world . cartoon controversy " the cartoon crisis has a larger dimension than just turkey , " a turkish official , who requested anonymity , told reuters .
" at a time when nato is going to assume added responsibility in afghanistan and pakistan , having a secretary general with such an objectionable approach to billions of muslims , is not the right approach to the muslim world . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's foreign minister -lrb- right -rrb- is an unlikely candidate turkey has also attacked denmark for failing to revoke the broadcasting license of a television station that ankara has accused of being a mouthpiece for kurdish rebels opposed to the government .

if you 're itching for a place you can really call your own , ebay has just the thing - a village in saxony that can be yours for the modest price of 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 405,000 -rrb- . " why do n't you buy your own village ? " reads the text accompanying the somewhat unusual property listing on the auction web site .
indeed , why not ?
the asking price is a real bargain , especially if you consider that people routinely shell out 300,000 euros for an average-sized apartment in the city .
for the same amount , you could be the proud owner of liebon , a tiny village nestled in the state of saxony that has a history dating back to 1322 .
admittedly , tiny is the key adjective .
the village consists of three buildings , two road signs , and has a total area of just 15,000 square meters -lrb- 3.7 acres -rrb- - about the size of two football fields .
current population : eight .
one of those residents is karsten schmidt , 45 .
he lives in liebon with his wife and two children .
schmidt 's parents also live in the village , as does schmidt 's brother , who lives with his girlfriend .
rural idyll his describes liebon as a picture-book place - a farm with a big family home , a playground , a pond , a fountain and a tiny shop .
" the village is practically self-sufficient , " he told the bild newspaper .
" we planted an orchard in the big garden and we grow potatoes . "
despite the idyllic setting , schmidt says he 's ready to start packing the moving boxes if the family gets a decent offer .
" my two daughters are so far away from everything , " he said .
" my parents do n't have driving licenses , and you really depend on a car here . "
the nearest neighbors are some 1.5 kilometers away .
but schmidt says prospective new residents should n't worry about feeling too cut off from the world , as liebon has been kitted out with high-speed internet access . dc / nda / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if you 're itching for a place you can really call your own , ebay has just the thing - a village in saxony that can be yours for the modest price of 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 405,000 -rrb- . " why do n't you buy your own village ? " reads the text accompanying the somewhat unusual property listing on the auction web site .
indeed , why not ?
the asking price is a real bargain , especially if you consider that people routinely shell out 300,000 euros for an average-sized apartment in the city .
for the same amount , you could be the proud owner of liebon , a tiny village nestled in the state of saxony that has a history dating back to 1322 .
admittedly , tiny is the key adjective .
the village consists of three buildings , two road signs , and has a total area of just 15,000 square meters -lrb- 3.7 acres -rrb- - about the size of two football fields .
current population : eight .
one of those residents is karsten schmidt , 45 .
he lives in liebon with his wife and two children .
schmidt 's parents also live in the village , as does schmidt 's brother , who lives with his girlfriend .
rural idyll his describes liebon as a picture-book place - a farm with a big family home , a playground , a pond , a fountain and a tiny shop .

a longstanding conflict has been the result - and reflects the situation in the country at large . belgium has been experiencing an ongoing political crisis for years .
rival parties are unable to reach agreement over the division of power and wealth between the richer , dutch-speaking province of flanders and the poorer , french-speaking region of wallonia . the country 's previous prime minister yves leterme failed in his efforts to decentralize power to the two regions in order to ease tensions between the flemish and the walloons .
it had meant amending the belgian constitution and leterme was unable to accomplish this . the new government under prime minister herman van rompuy , who took office at the end of 2008 , has been more concerned with the worldwide financial crisis . however , this paralysis over devolution is not really impacting most belgians , as stephen castle , a brussels-based journalist points out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's two regions also differ economically " this political crisis has been going on for a very long time , " castle says .
" frankly , people are used to it and possibly , apart from the politicians themselves are bored of it . " according to castle , even a paralyzed central government does n't really impact people 's day-to-day lives . " education continues , schools are open , hospitals are open , the garbage is cleared , " he says .
" from the practical point of view of most people , there really is very little impact . " not too worried namur is the capital of the french-speaking part of belgium , the region of wallonia .
at the central station , 30-year-old jean-francois says he has grown up with constant talk that belgium has no real future . " i 've heard this rumor since i was very little , " jean-francois says .
" belgium might disintegrate , but maybe people are seeing ghosts .
belgium has had an artificial side to it since its very beginnings . " jean-francois says he thinks the country could live like this for many years to come . " i think there are more serious problems than that , " he says . brussels must be resolved belgium is currently in the so-called sixth phase of a far-reaching political reform .
the process was started in the 1970s when the unitary belgian state became a federal state .
but here the division between regional politicians from the two sides goes deeper than they would in other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can van rompuy find a solution ?
" in order to make your name as a politician in belgium , you have to do that in your own community first , " castle says .
" if you 're , for example , a flemish politician like leterme , you really win no votes among your own core supporters by saying nice things about the francophone population in the south . " luc arnould is in charge of international relations at the city hall of namur .
he says that the country is n't likely to split unless the issue of brussels is resolved .
and he does n't see that happening anytime soon .
most people in the capital speak french but belong to the dutch-speaking part of the country . " we have to adapt the constitution and the way of working in belgium , but giving more and more autonomy to the regions , " arnould says .
" regions want to have more independence to organize their economies .
but there 's always the problem of brussels .
we need a lot of imagination to find a solution . " division remains a possibility many flemish people in brussels have no problem with living side by side with walloons .
bilingualism is a reality here in people 's daily lives , says this brussels native . " we speak both languages every day - french and dutch and english , " the man says .
" so there are no problems between the people here .
and in ten years ' time , the next generation will speak both languages all across belgium . " but the government turmoil has proven there is a problem between belgium 's communities on a political level .
journalist castle says partition remains a possibility , although it 's not likely anytime soon . " it would make it more difficult for belgium to be the center of the european union if it divided , " castle says .
" that would send a very poor message to a lot of countries which also have issues over devolution and how to divide up power .
i think there 's a general consensus that belgians are probably better off . " further devolution of power will be a long and arduous process .
but belgium 's politicians are used to treading warily when it comes to negotiating greater rights for their communities .
and that caution might stave off the breakup of belgium . nina haase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 24.03.2009 ten years on , germany looks back at return to war in kosovo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany used fighter jets to bomb serbian targets ten years ago , german fighter planes participated in nato air strikes against serbian targets .
as the bombs dropped , germany ’ s armed forces joined in their first modern combat mission . then-chancellor gerhard schroeder had only been in office for a few months when he was called to explain germany 's participation in a nato bombing operation .
" overnight on thursday , nato launched air strikes against military targets in yugoslavia .
the alliance was compelled to take this step in order to prevent further heavy and systematic infringement of human rights in kosovo , " schroeder told the parliament .
it was the first time since world war ii that german soldiers had taken part in a combat mission .
for germany , the timing was complicated .
schroeder 's social democrats had just won a parliamentary majority together with the green party , forming a so-called red-green coalition .
one of their first decisions was whether to have the bundeswehr , which is what germany 's federal armed forces are called , participate in nato fighting .
from the beginning , schroeder was confident that he had political and public support for the mission .
" we are united and in agreement with the large majority of the german people and also - thank god - with a large majority of the german parliament , which cuts across all party lines , " schroeder said .
nato pressured milosevic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yugoslavia eventually pulled troops out of kosovo the weeks leading up to schroeder 's speech before parliament was had been turbulent ones .
the kosovo crisis was intensifying at the same time that the 16-year tenure of chancellor helmut kohl was coming to an end .
schroeder 's new coalition had not even had a chance to settle in before being hit with a series of major foreign policy decisions .
nato was turning up the heat on yugoslavian president slobodan milosevic , warning that it would launch air strikes if the expulsions and killings in kosovo continued .
nato general secretary javier solana issued a warning in the fall of 2008 : " just a few moments ago , the north atlantic council decided to issue activation orders - actords - for both a phased air campaign in yugoslavia and limited air operations . "
nato expected germany to make a contribution to the fighting .
the newly-elected parliament held a special meeting in october 1998 in bonn , germany .
a large majority of the delegates decided to allow bundeswehr troops to take part in nato air strikes , even without a united nations mandate .
deployment without a un mandate negotiations continued .
yugoslavian representatives meet with kosovo-albanians and nato in search of a solution .
germany 's new government , inexperienced in foreign policy , took a low-key approach , yet threw its support behind nato .
rudolf scharping , the secretary of defense for the social democrats , said at the time : " we want to do everything in our power to keep corpses from piling up in the balkans and to ensure that there is n't a new stream of refugees into europe . "
after yugoslavia refused to accept the rambouillet agreement , nato began bombing targets in belgrade and other serbian cities .
fourteen german tornado fighter planes were used for air reconnaissance and to attack serbian air defense positions .
this meant not only that german soldiers took an active role in fighting for the first time since the end of world war ii , but that they did so without a un mandate .
the german government justified its participation by saying it could not close its eyes to the suffering of the civilian population in kosovo .
not easy being green bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder , right , and fischer , left , both supported the kosovo war this policy change was particularly difficult for the green party , which historically has had close links to the peace movement .
angry demonstrators called top green politicians " murderers " as they arrived with police escorts for a party meeting in may of 1999 .
many long-time green supporters vehemently reject the use of military force , yet parliamentarian angelika beer defended party leaders from criticisms and insults being hurled at them .
the critics were cowardly , she said , and had no good alternatives to offer .
" those of you who are now yelling ‘ warmongers , ' would you have wanted us to turn a blind eye ? " she asked .
" how would you have wanted to justify it ? "
joschka fisher , the green 's foreign minister , found himself at the center of the criticism for his support of the war .
at one point a paint bomb was lobbed at his head , injuring him slightly .
" at this moment in time , i regard a one-sided , unlimited cessation of the bomb attacks as a wrong signal , " fischer said at one point .
germany still in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kfor still has soldiers in kosovo june of 1999 , milosevic withdrew his troops , allowing nato peacekeeping troops kfor to move in .
bundeswehr general klaus reinhardt was the commander of kfor for several years .
the deployment was important , reinhardt said .
" in kosovo , external stability was important because milosevic had said each day : ‘ i will take my country back by force , " ' reinhardt said .
only when the situation is stable can political and economic conditions improve , the general said .
however , bringing stability to kosovo has taken much longer than anyone expected at the time .
the red-green coalition has been out of office for nearly four years , but there are still more than 2,500 german soldiers stationed in kosovo .

if you 're itching for a place you can really call your own , ebay has just the thing - a village in saxony that can be yours for the modest price of 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 405,000 -rrb- . " why do n't you buy your own village ? " reads the text accompanying the somewhat unusual property listing on the auction web site .
indeed , why not ?
the asking price is a real bargain , especially if you consider that people routinely shell out 300,000 euros for an average-sized apartment in the city .
for the same amount , you could be the proud owner of liebon , a tiny village nestled in the state of saxony that has a history dating back to 1322 .
admittedly , tiny is the key adjective .
the village consists of three buildings , two road signs , and has a total area of just 15,000 square meters -lrb- 3.7 acres -rrb- - about the size of two football fields .
current population : eight .
one of those residents is karsten schmidt , 45 .
he lives in liebon with his wife and two children .
schmidt 's parents also live in the village , as does schmidt 's brother , who lives with his girlfriend .
rural idyll his describes liebon as a picture-book place - a farm with a big family home , a playground , a pond , a fountain and a tiny shop .
" the village is practically self-sufficient , " he told the bild newspaper .
" we planted an orchard in the big garden and we grow potatoes . "
despite the idyllic setting , schmidt says he 's ready to start packing the moving boxes if the family gets a decent offer .
" my two daughters are so far away from everything , " he said .
" my parents do n't have driving licenses , and you really depend on a car here . "
the nearest neighbors are some 1.5 kilometers away .
but schmidt says prospective new residents should n't worry about feeling too cut off from the world , as liebon has been kitted out with high-speed internet access . dc / nda / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" " the air strikes have not solved problems in kosovo , and did not help to bring peace and the rule of law , " cvetkovic said at a special meeting of the cabinet to commemorate the attacks .
" on the contrary , they resulted in ethnic cleansing and gross violations of human rights , international standards and fresh tensions . " the alliance 's action , which was not sanctioned by the united nations security council , undermined milosevic 's power and is largely thought to have played a major role in his being sent to the hague to stand trial for war crimes .
he died in 2006 before the court could issue a verdict in his case . a necessary war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke has no regrets over the nato campaign western leaders saw nato 's air war , dubbed operation allied force , as the only way to end the 1998-1999 violent crackdown by milosevic 's forces on the kosovo liberation army and its supporters . " i look back on that extraordinary last meeting with milosevic , with a feeling that what we did was necessary and the right thing to do , " richard holbrooke , who served as the united states special envoy to the balkans , told reporters on saturday . " the people of kosovo are better off than they were as part of serbia , and serbia is better off facing the future rather than working back to a mythic past , " he added . then us president bill clinton also said at the time that the west had a " moral imperative " to take action against milosevic . the north atlantic treaty organization , in what was its largest military operation , set out to destroy dozens of targets .
in its 78 days of bombing , however , it also hit public infrastructure like bridges and railway tracks as well as homes , refugee convoys , a hospital and the chinese embassy in belgrade . human rights watch has estimated that about 500 civilians lost their lives during the bombing campaign , five times less than the yugoslav government claimed at the time . diverging views of war in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbs and kosovo albanians have very different feelings about nato 's intervention for ethnic albanians in kosovo , where they accounted for 90 percent of the region 's population despite being a minority in serbia overall , the war put a welcome end to their suffering at the hands of the serbian majority . " the appearance of combat airplanes in the sky above kosovo was a message of salvation for the people here , " kosovo justice minister nekibe kelmendi told afp . but for the serb minority , the campaign marked the beginning of their agony . " it was revenge for serbian disobedience , " said radoslav radovic , a 57-year-old from the serb-run half of kosovska mitrovica , a northern town that still simmers with ethnic tensions . radovic told afp he believes the west declared serbia guilty for " defending its integrity and its territory . " fearing ethnic albanian reprisals , tens of thousands of kosovo serbs fled their homes for serbia proper , with only a handful returning in the past decade .
of the 120,000 ethnic serbs estimated in kosovo , most live in the northern region that borders serbia or in small enclaves in southern areas . tensions run high after independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many kosovo serbs are still living in refugee camps in serbia proper tensions have remained high , especially since kosovo 's parliament unilaterally seceded from serbia in february 2008 , a move that has been recognized by 56 nations including the united states and most of the european union . officially , the united nations remains in charge of kosovo .
the 15-nation security council has not been able to alter the un mandate because its members are split over what to do with the un presence there and the legality of pristina 's declaration of independence . russia , a permanent veto-wielding member of the security council and serbia 's ally , has said it would not recognize an independent kosovo and has supported belgrade 's bid to challenge the declaration before the international court of justice in the hague . under a plan agreed to last year , police , customs officers and judges in the serb-run areas of kosovo remain under the un umbrella , known as unmik , while their albanian counterparts work with a european union police and justice mission called eulex . many kosovo albanians have come to view the un presence as an obstacle to independence , un secretary-general ban ki-moon said in a report published thursday . " there is a perception among many kosovo albanians that the mission 's tasks have been accomplished and its continued presence is an unwelcome obstacle to the desire for kosovo to function as a sovereign state , " ban said in his latest report to the security council on un activities in kosovo . ban 's report did not make recommendations on how to move forward as uncertainty in the region appears likely to continue . sms / tt / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ministers gathered at the same time to lay wreaths at spots where people were killed during the air war - at the time the biggest military operation in nato history .
" the attack on our country was illegal , contrary to international law , without a decision by the united nations " security council , prime minister mirko cvetkovic told a special commemorative sitting of his cabinet .
" the air strikes have not solved problems in kosovo , and did not help to bring peace and the rule of law .
" they resulted in ethnic cleansing and gross violations of human rights , international standards and fresh tensions , " he said , after schools held a minute 's silence before class .
kosovo leaders said however the nato bombing stopped serbian abuses in their breakaway territory and was a decisive step towards saving and freeing its people .
" the 78 days of strikes saved the people of kosovo from planned extermination , a scenario which was prepared coldly by the highest serb political and academic circles , " kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said .
kosovo prime minister hashim thaci described the bombing as " a big historic event for kosovo and the democratic world . "
" the successful completion of the campaign of intervention by nato opened a new chapter in the history of kosovo , a chapter of freedom , " said thaci .
anniversary of campaign to stop milosevic nato launched the strikes on march 24 , 1999 after milosevic refused to sign up to a peace deal to end his forces ' crackdown on the rebel kosovo liberation army -lrb- kla -rrb- and the ethnic albanian majority in the southern territory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic ordered a crackdown on kosovo 's rebels it set out to destroy military targets , and went on to strike infrastructure and the milosevic propaganda machine .
some strikes went astray , hitting scores of civilian sites and even china 's embassy in belgrade .
milosevic eventually conceded 78 days later , paving the way for nato to enter kosovo .
some 15,000 nato-led peacekeepers remain in kosovo , which 56 nations recognize after its ethnic albanian-dominated parliament declared unilateral independence from serbia 13 months ago .
as part of serbian commemorations , the bells of orthodox churches were to be tolled for the victims at 7:45 pm -lrb- 1845 gmt -rrb- - the moment nato 's first attacks were launched 10 years ago .
wounds still open in serbia separately , a hard-line nationalist group planned to stage an anti-nato rally in the main square of belgrade , according to posters that have gone up around serbia 's capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian protests have been violent in the past serbian media seized on the opportunity of the anniversary to rake over the coals of a conflict that may have ended a decade ago but one which remains very much in the national consciousness .
" serbs got bombs , the albanians got a state , " the daily blic said in its report .
belgrade contends that nato , by acting without a un mandate and by bombing civilian targets and using controversial ordnance , broke international laws because it was biased in favor of albanians .
human rights watch put the civilian death toll from the bombing campaign at around 500 .
milosevic 's government estimated the nato strikes killed more than 1,000 soldiers and 2,500 civilians , including 89 children , while 12,500 people were wounded and at least $ 30 billion in damage caused .
" a decade of the crime against serbia , " the daily press said , while politika wrote of the " bombing that was never declared a war . "
under the headline " days of death and destruction , " vecernje novosti recounted half a dozen personal stories , including those of families who lost children and of a military pilot who was shot down by nato .
health concerns also remain about the danger to civilians from weapons nato used during the campaign .
thousands risk life and limb from cluster bomblets still scattered across serbia as well as from depleted uranium , according to european non-governmental groups .
a " humanitarian intervention " many analysts contend the " humanitarian intervention " was necessary to prevent any recurrence of events like the 1995 srebrenica massacre by bosnian serbs of some 8,000 muslims - europe 's worst atrocity since world war ii .
up to 9,000 people were killed in kosovo 's 1998-1999 conflict , mostly ethnic albanians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some blame inaction for the events which led to srebrenica " what is often forgotten about the bombing is the context and the context was the failure to act in bosnia , culminating in the srebrenica massacre , " tim judah , a prominent british author on the balkan wars of the 1990s .
" the kla were no angels but srebrenica changed everything .
after that there was no guarantee that serbian forces might not do such a thing again , " judah told reporters .
" as to whether it was worth it - a classic ' what if ' of history .
it was short -lrb- ish -rrb- and brutal but if it had not been for the bombing we might still be living with a rumbling and brutal insurgency and low level conflict . " nda / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" rasmussen was at the head of the list for the former bush administration , just as he is for the current obama administration , " analyst daniel korski said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish caricatures inflamed passions in the muslim world " the americans want someone who will continue to push for military engagement in afghanistan , " he said , pointing out that denmark has some 750 soldiers stationed in the volatile southern part of the country where the taliban insurgency is most active . us and european support however does not guarantee that rasmussen will become the appointed successor to scheffer . turkish opposition possible the main snag to rasmussen 's nomination , which needs to be approved by all members of the 26-nation alliance , is possible opposition to his candidacy from turkey , a secular nation that is predominantly muslim . denmark had outraged muslims around the world in 2005 when the widely circulated jyllands-posten newspaper published a series of cartoon caricatures depicting the prophet mohammed as a terrorist . rasmussen , who has been prime minister since 2001 , had refused to apologize for the cartoons invoking the right of the press to freedom of expression .
the controversial cartoons , which were later republished by media around the globe , had sparked riots and attacks on danish embassies in the muslim world . cartoon controversy " the cartoon crisis has a larger dimension than just turkey , " a turkish official , who requested anonymity , told reuters .
" at a time when nato is going to assume added responsibility in afghanistan and pakistan , having a secretary general with such an objectionable approach to billions of muslims , is not the right approach to the muslim world . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's foreign minister -lrb- right -rrb- is an unlikely candidate turkey has also attacked denmark for failing to revoke the broadcasting license of a television station that ankara has accused of being a mouthpiece for kurdish rebels opposed to the government .
adding fuel to the fire , rasmussen had publicly stated in 2003 that he opposed full eu membership for turkey . " it may come to the veto , " retuers quoted the anonymous official as saying .
" we will have to see . " the chances for other candidates for nato 's number two position , however , are dwindling . polish candidate viewed as antagonistic to russia polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski was rumored to be a favorite for secretary general post , but the appointment of a pro-american polish national is viewed as antagonizing russia at a time when nato is seeking better relations with the kremlin . russia has been bitterly opposed to the deployment of a us anti-missile defense shield on polish territory . turkey had favored a canadian for the post , since ottawa supports ankara 's bid to join the eu .
however canadian defense minister peter mackay ruled himself out as a candidate on sunday . canadian ruled out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer 's successor should be announced at nato summit mackay 's rumored candidacy had the apparent support of us vice president joe biden as a reward for canada 's role in combat missions in dangerous southern afghanistan .
his spokesman , however , told reporters that the canadian never sought the post even though biden had downplayed an unwritten rule that the secretary general come from a european nation in exchange for nato 's top military post going to an american . the choice for the number two position as secretary general is expected to be named at the april 3-4 nato summit , but getting turkey to agree to the choice of rasmussen would be the key . df / sms / afp / reuters / send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a longstanding conflict has been the result - and reflects the situation in the country at large . belgium has been experiencing an ongoing political crisis for years .
rival parties are unable to reach agreement over the division of power and wealth between the richer , dutch-speaking province of flanders and the poorer , french-speaking region of wallonia . the country 's previous prime minister yves leterme failed in his efforts to decentralize power to the two regions in order to ease tensions between the flemish and the walloons .
it had meant amending the belgian constitution and leterme was unable to accomplish this . the new government under prime minister herman van rompuy , who took office at the end of 2008 , has been more concerned with the worldwide financial crisis . however , this paralysis over devolution is not really impacting most belgians , as stephen castle , a brussels-based journalist points out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's two regions also differ economically " this political crisis has been going on for a very long time , " castle says .
" frankly , people are used to it and possibly , apart from the politicians themselves are bored of it . " according to castle , even a paralyzed central government does n't really impact people 's day-to-day lives . " education continues , schools are open , hospitals are open , the garbage is cleared , " he says .
" from the practical point of view of most people , there really is very little impact . " not too worried namur is the capital of the french-speaking part of belgium , the region of wallonia .
at the central station , 30-year-old jean-francois says he has grown up with constant talk that belgium has no real future . " i 've heard this rumor since i was very little , " jean-francois says .
" belgium might disintegrate , but maybe people are seeing ghosts .
belgium has had an artificial side to it since its very beginnings . " jean-francois says he thinks the country could live like this for many years to come . " i think there are more serious problems than that , " he says . brussels must be resolved belgium is currently in the so-called sixth phase of a far-reaching political reform .
the process was started in the 1970s when the unitary belgian state became a federal state .
but here the division between regional politicians from the two sides goes deeper than they would in other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can van rompuy find a solution ?
" in order to make your name as a politician in belgium , you have to do that in your own community first , " castle says .
" if you 're , for example , a flemish politician like leterme , you really win no votes among your own core supporters by saying nice things about the francophone population in the south . " luc arnould is in charge of international relations at the city hall of namur .
he says that the country is n't likely to split unless the issue of brussels is resolved .
and he does n't see that happening anytime soon .
most people in the capital speak french but belong to the dutch-speaking part of the country . " we have to adapt the constitution and the way of working in belgium , but giving more and more autonomy to the regions , " arnould says .
" regions want to have more independence to organize their economies .
but there 's always the problem of brussels .
we need a lot of imagination to find a solution . " division remains a possibility many flemish people in brussels have no problem with living side by side with walloons .
bilingualism is a reality here in people 's daily lives , says this brussels native . " we speak both languages every day - french and dutch and english , " the man says .
" so there are no problems between the people here .
and in ten years ' time , the next generation will speak both languages all across belgium . " but the government turmoil has proven there is a problem between belgium 's communities on a political level .
journalist castle says partition remains a possibility , although it 's not likely anytime soon . " it would make it more difficult for belgium to be the center of the european union if it divided , " castle says .
" that would send a very poor message to a lot of countries which also have issues over devolution and how to divide up power .
i think there 's a general consensus that belgians are probably better off . " further devolution of power will be a long and arduous process .
but belgium 's politicians are used to treading warily when it comes to negotiating greater rights for their communities .
and that caution might stave off the breakup of belgium . nina haase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

maulana rahman is a qazi , or judge , in one of the newly appointed islamic sharia courts in pakistan 's troubled district of swat .
he is addressing about a dozen people standing in front of the bench in the circuit courthouse of mingora , swat 's main town .
they are led by a tall , fierce-looking man who adamantly demands an explanation for the court 's decision .
he is a commander in the swat taleban who fought pakistan 's army to a recent standstill .
the taleban had demanded the implementation of islamic sharia law here .
the government acceded and these courts are the first step in that direction . "
the members of the taleban present refused to accept the verdict and said they would take up the matter with senior taleban commanders " court eyewitness the move led to an outcry across pakistan and in the international community .
human rights activists are horrified at the possibility of punishments such as the amputation of limbs , whipping and stoning to death being implemented .
moreover , legal experts are worried over the challenges posed by setting up a parallel legal system .
but the common people in swat have welcomed the establishment of the courts and have thronged to them .
" we believe we will get quick and impartial justice from the sharia courts , " says umar hayat , a local man waiting to file his petition .
" in the past , cases used to drag on for years , but now they are settled in days .
more importantly , everybody is equal in front of the law . "
farmer 's win the " taleban case " before the court vividly illustrates this .
it pertains to the creation of a dirt track through the fields of a local farmer at the behest of the taleban .
the farmer filed a case in the sharia courts and the matter was adjudicated by maulana rahman .
the ruling was in the farmer 's favour .
" but the members of the taleban present refused to accept the verdict and said they would take up the matter with senior taleban commanders , " an eyewitness says .
" they also twisted the judge 's words and brought in the commander after telling him that maulana rahman had said that he did not care if maulana fazlullah himself had demanded a repeal . "
maulana fazlullah is head of the taleban in the swat region .
his power is said to be absolute .
the clearly incensed taleban commander demanded an explanation from maulana rahman .
the qazi made it clear he had not made any such comments .
but he also reiterated the fact that the ruling was final .
sharia in swat the nizam-e-adl -lrb- order of justice -rrb- ordinance implements sharia in swat retrospectively from 15 march cases are decided according to the sect of the person -lrb- s -rrb- filing there are two major sects : sunni -lrb- 80 % -rrb- and shia -lrb- 20 % -rrb- but they divide into many subsects the taleban follow the wahhabist / deoband sunni subsects and want their own form of sharia most pakistanis follow the barelvi sunni subsect for several minutes , the taleban commander and his henchmen continued to argue .
but maulana rahman refused to budge , and fellow qazis waded into the argument in his support .
finally , they managed to convince the taleban after quoting examples supporting the decision from the koran .
they also said they would personally come and investigate the matter if the ruling was not followed .
at this , the taleban agreed to the decision and beat a hasty retreat .
" this a system that works for us , " says qari fazal maula , a petitioner at the court .
he had just received a ruling in his favour over a dispute involving the ownership of his rickshaw taxi .
" i could n't get a decision despite having filed two years ago in a local court , " he says .
" it was a waste of money with all the lawyers ' fees and other costs .
here i had to spend 20 rupees -lrb- 25 us cents -rrb- on a piece of official stamp paper . "
most of the other petitioners at the crowded court voiced similar sentiments .
but there are dissenting voices .
" the courts are not admitting our cases , " says farooq ahmed .
he is waiting to file a petition regarding a property dispute dating back 40 years .
" cases that were filed before the implementation of the original sharia draft in 1999 will not be accepted , " a judge explains .
" this had to be done otherwise there would be a huge backlog of cases and this would again start the delay in justice . "
according to maulana rahman , he has so far heard 100 cases since the courts were started on 18 february .
" i have given a decision in 20 of the cases , " he says .
" the decisions are on the basis of sharia and consensus . "
there is already a minor backlog because of the available number of judges - just seven for the entire district .
ordinance the newly implemented sharia system for the malakand division is three-tiered .
there is the ilaqa -lrb- local area -rrb- court , which comes under the zila -lrb- district -rrb- court , all of which are presided over by the darul darul qaza court for the entire division .
this acts as the supreme court .
the region needs at least 20 judges to make the system workable and efficient .
but that is just a problem of resources which can be addressed quite quickly if need be .
the real issue remains the validity of the implementation of sharia law itself .
a declaration was made for it to take effect from 15 march but the actual ordinance has still to be signed .
" when the ordinance is signed by the president , the relevant code will have retrospective effect , " insists a local tnsm leader .
the tnsm organisation , led by former militant leader sufi mohammad , brokered the peace agreement between the taleban and the government .
but that peace may not hold .
under previous sharia regulations , courts came to their decisions by taking both the law and consensus into account .
most analysts believe this is unlikely to change and that it may lead to trouble from the taleban .
" the taleban have always said they want the implementation of their version of sharia law here , " explains a local legal expert .
but the nizam-e-adl , or order of justice , for swat talks of interpreting sharia according to the demands of the relevant sects involved .
" this is a sure recipe for disaster , " the legal expert says .

it pertains to the creation of a dirt track through the fields of a local farmer at the behest of the taleban .
maulana rahman says he has heard 100 cases since 18 february the farmer filed a case in the sharia courts and the matter was adjudicated by maulana rahman .
the ruling was in the farmer 's favour .
" but the members of the taleban present refused to accept the verdict and said they would take up the matter with senior taleban commanders , " an eyewitness says .
" they also twisted the judge 's words and brought in the commander after telling him that maulana rahman had said that he did not care if maulana fazlullah himself had demanded a repeal . "
maulana fazlullah is head of the taleban in the swat region .
his power is said to be absolute .
the clearly incensed taleban commander demanded an explanation from maulana rahman .
the qazi made it clear he had not made any such comments .
but he also reiterated the fact that the ruling was final .
sharia in swat the nizam-e-adl -lrb- order of justice -rrb- ordinance implements sharia in swat retrospectively from 15 march cases are decided according to the sect of the person -lrb- s -rrb- filing there are two major sects : sunni -lrb- 80 % -rrb- and shia -lrb- 20 % -rrb- but they divide into many subsects the taleban follow the wahhabist / deoband sunni subsects and want their own form of sharia most pakistanis follow the barelvi sunni subsect for several minutes , the taleban commander and his henchmen continued to argue .
but maulana rahman refused to budge , and fellow qazis waded into the argument in his support .
finally , they managed to convince the taleban after quoting examples supporting the decision from the koran .
they also said they would personally come and investigate the matter if the ruling was not followed .
at this , the taleban agreed to the decision and beat a hasty retreat .
" this a system that works for us , " says qari fazal maula , a petitioner at the court .
he had just received a ruling in his favour over a dispute involving the ownership of his rickshaw taxi .
" i could n't get a decision despite having filed two years ago in a local court , " he says .
" it was a waste of money with all the lawyers ' fees and other costs .
here i had to spend 20 rupees -lrb- 25 us cents -rrb- on a piece of official stamp paper . "
most of the other petitioners at the crowded court voiced similar sentiments .
but there are dissenting voices .
" the courts are not admitting our cases , " says farooq ahmed .
he is waiting to file a petition regarding a property dispute dating back 40 years .
" cases that were filed before the implementation of the original sharia draft in 1999 will not be accepted , " a judge explains .
" this had to be done otherwise there would be a huge backlog of cases and this would again start the delay in justice . "
according to maulana rahman , he has so far heard 100 cases since the courts were started on 18 february .
" i have given a decision in 20 of the cases , " he says .
" the decisions are on the basis of sharia and consensus . "
there is already a minor backlog because of the available number of judges - just seven for the entire district .
ordinance the newly implemented sharia system for the malakand division is three-tiered .
there is the ilaqa -lrb- local area -rrb- court , which comes under the zila -lrb- district -rrb- court , all of which are presided over by the darul darul qaza court for the entire division .
this acts as the supreme court .
the region needs at least 20 judges to make the system workable and efficient .
not everyone is happy .
farooq ahmed 's case is too old but that is just a problem of resources which can be addressed quite quickly if need be .
the real issue remains the validity of the implementation of sharia law itself .
a declaration was made for it to take effect from 15 march but the actual ordinance has still to be signed .
" when the ordinance is signed by the president , the relevant code will have retrospective effect , " insists a local tnsm leader .
the tnsm organisation , led by former militant leader sufi mohammad , brokered the peace agreement between the taleban and the government .
but that peace may not hold .
under previous sharia regulations , courts came to their decisions by taking both the law and consensus into account .
most analysts believe this is unlikely to change and that it may lead to trouble from the taleban .
" the taleban have always said they want the implementation of their version of sharia law here , " explains a local legal expert .
but the nizam-e-adl , or order of justice , for swat talks of interpreting sharia according to the demands of the relevant sects involved .
" this is a sure recipe for disaster , " the legal expert says .

maulana rahman is a qazi , or judge , in one of the newly appointed islamic sharia courts in pakistan 's troubled district of swat .
he is addressing about a dozen people standing in front of the bench in the circuit courthouse of mingora , swat 's main town .
they are led by a tall , fierce-looking man who adamantly demands an explanation for the court 's decision .
he is a commander in the swat taleban who fought pakistan 's army to a recent standstill .
the taleban had demanded the implementation of islamic sharia law here .
the government acceded and these courts are the first step in that direction .
the members of the taleban present refused to accept the verdict and said they would take up the matter with senior taleban commanders court eyewitness the move led to an outcry across pakistan and in the international community .
human rights activists are horrified at the possibility of punishments such as the amputation of limbs , whipping and stoning to death being implemented .
moreover , legal experts are worried over the challenges posed by setting up a parallel legal system .
but the common people in swat have welcomed the establishment of the courts and have thronged to them .
" we believe we will get quick and impartial justice from the sharia courts , " says umar hayat , a local man waiting to file his petition .
" in the past , cases used to drag on for years , but now they are settled in days .
more importantly , everybody is equal in front of the law . "
farmer 's win the " taleban case " before the court vividly illustrates this .
it pertains to the creation of a dirt track through the fields of a local farmer at the behest of the taleban .
maulana rahman says he has heard 100 cases since 18 february the farmer filed a case in the sharia courts and the matter was adjudicated by maulana rahman .
the ruling was in the farmer 's favour .
" but the members of the taleban present refused to accept the verdict and said they would take up the matter with senior taleban commanders , " an eyewitness says .
" they also twisted the judge 's words and brought in the commander after telling him that maulana rahman had said that he did not care if maulana fazlullah himself had demanded a repeal . "
maulana fazlullah is head of the taleban in the swat region .
his power is said to be absolute .
the clearly incensed taleban commander demanded an explanation from maulana rahman .
the qazi made it clear he had not made any such comments .
but he also reiterated the fact that the ruling was final .
sharia in swat the nizam-e-adl -lrb- order of justice -rrb- ordinance implements sharia in swat retrospectively from 15 march cases are decided according to the sect of the person -lrb- s -rrb- filing there are two major sects : sunni -lrb- 80 % -rrb- and shia -lrb- 20 % -rrb- but they divide into many subsects the taleban follow the wahhabist / deoband sunni subsects and want their own form of sharia most pakistanis follow the barelvi sunni subsect for several minutes , the taleban commander and his henchmen continued to argue .
but maulana rahman refused to budge , and fellow qazis waded into the argument in his support .
finally , they managed to convince the taleban after quoting examples supporting the decision from the koran .
they also said they would personally come and investigate the matter if the ruling was not followed .
at this , the taleban agreed to the decision and beat a hasty retreat .
" this a system that works for us , " says qari fazal maula , a petitioner at the court .
he had just received a ruling in his favour over a dispute involving the ownership of his rickshaw taxi .
" i could n't get a decision despite having filed two years ago in a local court , " he says .
" it was a waste of money with all the lawyers ' fees and other costs .
here i had to spend 20 rupees -lrb- 25 us cents -rrb- on a piece of official stamp paper . "
most of the other petitioners at the crowded court voiced similar sentiments .
but there are dissenting voices .

maulana rahman is a qazi , or judge , in one of the newly appointed islamic sharia courts in pakistan 's troubled district of swat .
he is addressing about a dozen people standing in front of the bench in the circuit courthouse of mingora , swat 's main town .
they are led by a tall , fierce-looking man who adamantly demands an explanation for the court 's decision .
he is a commander in the swat taleban who fought pakistan 's army to a recent standstill .
the taleban had demanded the implementation of islamic sharia law here .
the government acceded and these courts are the first step in that direction .
the members of the taleban present refused to accept the verdict and said they would take up the matter with senior taleban commanders court eyewitness the move led to an outcry across pakistan and in the international community .
human rights activists are horrified at the possibility of punishments such as the amputation of limbs , whipping and stoning to death being implemented .
moreover , legal experts are worried over the challenges posed by setting up a parallel legal system .
but the common people in swat have welcomed the establishment of the courts and have thronged to them .
" we believe we will get quick and impartial justice from the sharia courts , " says umar hayat , a local man waiting to file his petition .
" in the past , cases used to drag on for years , but now they are settled in days .
more importantly , everybody is equal in front of the law . "
farmer 's win the " taleban case " before the court vividly illustrates this .
it pertains to the creation of a dirt track through the fields of a local farmer at the behest of the taleban .
maulana rahman says he has heard 100 cases since 18 february the farmer filed a case in the sharia courts and the matter was adjudicated by maulana rahman .
the ruling was in the farmer 's favour .
" but the members of the taleban present refused to accept the verdict and said they would take up the matter with senior taleban commanders , " an eyewitness says .
" they also twisted the judge 's words and brought in the commander after telling him that maulana rahman had said that he did not care if maulana fazlullah himself had demanded a repeal . "
maulana fazlullah is head of the taleban in the swat region .
his power is said to be absolute .
the clearly incensed taleban commander demanded an explanation from maulana rahman .
the qazi made it clear he had not made any such comments .
but he also reiterated the fact that the ruling was final .
sharia in swat the nizam-e-adl -lrb- order of justice -rrb- ordinance implements sharia in swat retrospectively from 15 march cases are decided according to the sect of the person -lrb- s -rrb- filing there are two major sects : sunni -lrb- 80 % -rrb- and shia -lrb- 20 % -rrb- but they divide into many subsects the taleban follow the wahhabist / deoband sunni subsects and want their own form of sharia most pakistanis follow the barelvi sunni subsect for several minutes , the taleban commander and his henchmen continued to argue .
but maulana rahman refused to budge , and fellow qazis waded into the argument in his support .
finally , they managed to convince the taleban after quoting examples supporting the decision from the koran .
they also said they would personally come and investigate the matter if the ruling was not followed .
at this , the taleban agreed to the decision and beat a hasty retreat .
" this a system that works for us , " says qari fazal maula , a petitioner at the court .
he had just received a ruling in his favour over a dispute involving the ownership of his rickshaw taxi .
" i could n't get a decision despite having filed two years ago in a local court , " he says .
" it was a waste of money with all the lawyers ' fees and other costs .
here i had to spend 20 rupees -lrb- 25 us cents -rrb- on a piece of official stamp paper . "
most of the other petitioners at the crowded court voiced similar sentiments .
but there are dissenting voices .
" the courts are not admitting our cases , " says farooq ahmed .
he is waiting to file a petition regarding a property dispute dating back 40 years .
" cases that were filed before the implementation of the original sharia draft in 1999 will not be accepted , " a judge explains .
" this had to be done otherwise there would be a huge backlog of cases and this would again start the delay in justice . "
according to maulana rahman , he has so far heard 100 cases since the courts were started on 18 february .
" i have given a decision in 20 of the cases , " he says .
" the decisions are on the basis of sharia and consensus . "
there is already a minor backlog because of the available number of judges - just seven for the entire district .
ordinance the newly implemented sharia system for the malakand division is three-tiered .
there is the ilaqa -lrb- local area -rrb- court , which comes under the zila -lrb- district -rrb- court , all of which are presided over by the darul darul qaza court for the entire division .
this acts as the supreme court .
the region needs at least 20 judges to make the system workable and efficient .
not everyone is happy .
farooq ahmed 's case is too old but that is just a problem of resources which can be addressed quite quickly if need be .
the real issue remains the validity of the implementation of sharia law itself .
a declaration was made for it to take effect from 15 march but the actual ordinance has still to be signed .
" when the ordinance is signed by the president , the relevant code will have retrospective effect , " insists a local tnsm leader .
the tnsm organisation , led by former militant leader sufi mohammad , brokered the peace agreement between the taleban and the government .
but that peace may not hold .
under previous sharia regulations , courts came to their decisions by taking both the law and consensus into account .
most analysts believe this is unlikely to change and that it may lead to trouble from the taleban .
" the taleban have always said they want the implementation of their version of sharia law here , " explains a local legal expert .
but the nizam-e-adl , or order of justice , for swat talks of interpreting sharia according to the demands of the relevant sects involved .
" this is a sure recipe for disaster , " the legal expert says .

carl sargeant am said the company was committed to keeping its apprenticeship scheme at the broughton site , and the cuts were a " blow we 've got to manage . "
unions said they had been told the cuts were a result of a downturn in orders for the hawker business jet .
but bbc wales ' business correspondent nick servini said he understood orders for other planes were holding up .
" these are the kind of jets that highly-paid american bankers fly around the world with - so it will come as no surprise that the order book is drying up , " he said .
" that 's been reflected in the figures - they 're selling less than half the number of these jets that they have done in the past .
" the bulk of the work here is for the wings for the larger commercial aircraft and the order book , we understand , is holding up reasonably well . "
the company said on monday it was asking blue arrow managed services to reduce by approximately 250 the number of agency workers it provides to the broughton plant , which employs around 6,000 .
it said avoiding compulsory redundancies was the " shared objective . "
mr sargeant , the am for alyn and deeside , said he hoped some workers may be able to transfer to other parts of the factory .
" this is very disappointing news for 250 people and 250 families .
it 's something we need to keep a very close eye on , " he said .
" we are very concerned that one of our largest companies in wales and in the uk is making these redundancies , but we have to maintain a base for the future and we 've got to look beyond this in terms of when we come out of the difficult times .
" they 're very committed to maintaining their apprenticeship scheme - remember this is the largest apprentice scheme in the whole of the uk - in a single factory , in wales , in flintshire .
" it is a large factory , there is a future for airbus in wales , this is a blow currently that we 've got to manage and i 'm hoping that with support from the assembly government , the company and trade unions , we can work through this . "
' depths of the crisis ' conservative economic spokesman , david melding , said the job losses were a " particularly grim indication " of the state of the welsh economy .
" airbus is the premier manufacturer in wales and has set standards of excellence on training and skills development .
" that such a company is reported to be considering this move shows the depth of the crisis the welsh economy is now facing . "
a spokesman for the welsh assembly government said : " we are monitoring the situation at broughton , and will remain in close contact with airbus and blue arrow managed services throughout the consultation process to jointly explore any opportunity of preserving these jobs .
" whilst disappointing , it is encouraging to note that both parties will seek to avoid any compulsory redundancies . "

" it is a large factory , there is a future for airbus in wales , this is a blow currently that we 've got to manage and i 'm hoping that with support from the assembly government , the company and trade unions , we can work through this . "
' depths of the crisis ' conservative economic spokesman , david melding , said the job losses were a " particularly grim indication " of the state of the welsh economy .
" airbus is the premier manufacturer in wales and has set standards of excellence on training and skills development .
" that such a company is reported to be considering this move shows the depth of the crisis the welsh economy is now facing . "
a spokesman for the welsh assembly government said : " we are monitoring the situation at broughton , and will remain in close contact with airbus and blue arrow managed services throughout the consultation process to jointly explore any opportunity of preserving these jobs .
" whilst disappointing , it is encouraging to note that both parties will seek to avoid any compulsory redundancies . "

by bridget kendall bbc diplomatic correspondent spring is a time for renewal and optimism .
in london , as the days lengthen and the sun peeps out , british officials are trying to manage high hopes that april 's g20 summit will somehow find a global financial cure .
president obama addressed a video message to the iranian people but anticipation also hovers over another policy realm - nuclear security and the chance of a thaw in us-iranian relations .
the focus is on president barack obama and the policy review he has ordered .
although tehran insists its nuclear aims are peaceful , the us and its partners suspect a secret plan to develop nuclear weapons - with the potential to shake the middle east and reawaken a global nuclear arms race .
so the west still calls on iran to suspend its enrichment programme .
and us sanctions against iran have just been extended .
but , at the same time , president obama is making overtures .
there 's the offer of direct talks if iran " unclenches its fist " ; there 's the attempt to reach out to iran on regional issues - inviting it to a big afghanistan conference due shortly , and planning to send a us official to the next shanghai co-operation council meeting of asian countries in moscow , which iran will also be attending .
and now a new video message - with farsi subtitles - from barack obama has assured iranians that the us wants " engagement that is honest and grounded in mutual respect " , prompting a swift response from iran 's supreme leader .
new mood as usual ayatollah khamenei is scathing about the us and lays down iranian conditions , demanding an end to america 's sanctions and its unquestioning support of israel .
ayatollah khamenei responded to the us overture by demanding policy changes but note that he also said that if the us really did change , then iran would change its behaviour too .
there is a new mood in the air , a sense that something is moving .
one related american shift has been towards russia .
mr obama 's administration does not hide the fact that it sees continued us-russian tensions as counterproductive .
better to sort out quarrels with moscow than risk having disgruntled russians hampering efforts to deal with the bigger challenge of tehran 's ayatollahs .
so there is now talk of a possible " grand bargain " .
a private letter from president obama to president dmitry medvedev seems to have thrown down the gauntlet .
the buzz is that washington might offer to hold off its controversial missile defence programme in europe , in return for new russian leverage on tehran .
it 's unclear what might be asked of moscow : perhaps support for a broader economic embargo against iran if negotiations fail , perhaps to lay off further arms sales - half promised already - which would strengthen iran 's air defences .
who knows what will emerge ?
after all , the russians are likely to try to push for a tough bargain .
they have their red lines when it comes to european security , and their public posture at least is that it should be washington that makes the main concessions .
clock ticking but whatever is being planned , there is no time to waste .
for several reasons the iran problem is urgent .
a test run has been carried out at iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant first , if it is true iran wants to show the world it can make a bomb , the clock is ticking .
despite an infamous us intelligence report two years ago , which claimed any iranian threat was still distant , the latest report from the un 's nuclear watchdog , the iaea , suggests iran already has or may soon acquire a stock of enriched uranium large enough - in theory - to grade up into a small weapon .
secondly , there is a mounting consensus that the damage done by casting iran as a member of the " axis of evil " needs to be undone if there is to be any chance of restoring trust on either side .
even some us diplomats who helped spearhead bush 's policy on iran admit to failure .
" we had advocated regime change .
we had a very threatening posture towards iran for a number of years .
it did n't produce any movement whatsoever , " said nicholas burns , former senior diplomat in the us state department , in a documentary broadcast on the bbc recently .
thirdly , if the bush administration began by forging policy unilaterally and ended by swinging tactically on iran , then president obama needs to think broadly and act strategically .
given the burdens - military and financial - that the us still shoulders in iraq and increasingly afghanistan , any new approach which spreads the load or which turns iran from a headache into a help when it comes to stabilising its neighbours , must be an advantage .
rethink and with four - or possibly eight - years of his presidency ahead of him , barack obama has to face the fact that it 'll probably be on his watch that any iran crisis reaches a climax .
any iran crisis is likely to reach a climax on mr obama 's watch will he be the american president who opts for military attacks on iran as a last resort , to keep his word that an iranian bomb would be " unacceptable " ?
or will he be the president who finally ends 30 years of us / iranian animosity and pulls the world back from the brink of a new atomic escalation ?
two stark choices .
but multi-lateral engagement and radical rethinks are back in fashion .
the current financial crisis requires it .
so do the looming dangers of climate change .
how to tackle the threat of a nuclear arms spreading is woven into this web of global challenges .
britain 's gordon brown last week made the link succinctly .
as the world tries to wean itself off carbon-spewing fossil fuels , demand for nuclear energy will grow , he argued .
thirty-two new nuclear reactors a year will be needed for the next four decades to reach the goal of halving carbon emissions , according to un estimates .
inequality but with that comes the risk of ever more nations using their civilian nuclear plants to conceal secret military programmes , and of ever larger stockpiles of fissile material and nuclear waste falling into the hands of rogue states or terrorists .
france , along with britain , has cut its nuclear arsenal britain 's vision is for a new tough global regime , where nuclear energy is shared internationally , but where controls are tightened and sanctions for rule breakers made harsher and swifter .
iran , said gordon brown , would be a " test case " for this " new philosophy " : either agree to collaborate and reap the benefits , or refuse to play ball and face greater penalties .
a " refreshed grand nuclear bargain for our age " , gordon brown calls it .
but as britain , america and others contemplate how to harness the genie of nuclear proliferation , now it is out of the bottle , they must surely admit that at the heart of any arrangement lies an uncomfortable inequality .
this is the increasingly out-of-date imbalance between the " haves " and the " have-nots " in the nuclear weapons club .
why is it that the five signatories to the non proliferation treaty who already have nuclear weapons - the us , russia , china , britain and france - are allowed to keep them , but any other countries that sign up to the treaty must renounce the prospect ?
good for world peace , but not exactly fair .
especially when the npt stipulates that these five are obliged to work towards reducing their stockpiles eventually to zero .
that has not been the message of the past few years .
both britain and france have cut their arsenals .
britain says it has cut the number of its warheads by half since 1997 , but that did not stop the government deciding two years ago to upgrade its trident nuclear submarine fleet .
nuclear review russia 's focus too has been on upgrading its nuclear missiles .
just last week president medvedev announced that the economic crisis would not stop russia re-equipping the entire armed forces , with priority given to nuclear arms .
then there is israel , long suspected of holding nuclear weapons , under little or no pressure from western allies to declare its hand or disarm china is thought to be developing new missiles and warheads .
and under george w bush , the united states gave no leadership on this .
his pentagon tried to get funding for a new generation of bunker-busting nuclear missiles .
no wonder the last two reviews of the npt treaty in 2000 and 2005 ended in dismal failure .
add to this the fact that those non npt nations that have tested nuclear weapons -lrb- india , pakistan and north korea -rrb- , far from being punished , have found themselves rewarded and their negotiating position immediately strengthened .
then there is israel , long suspected of holding nuclear weapons , under little or no pressure from western allies to declare its hand or disarm .
from tehran 's point of view , it is easy to claim a double standard .
given all that , how do you persuade a country like iran , eager to be seen as the dominant power in the region , not to succumb to the temptation of acquiring nukes , or at least reach the tipping point where it can use them as a bargaining chip ?
the us needs the co-operation of russia 's medvedev the answer , surely , must lie not only in carrot and stick bargaining , or step by step strengthening of bilateral ties , but to set an example .
look first to the big five .
in this era of budget cuts , perhaps cutting arms spending is even appealing .
already president obama is on record as saying he supports the idea of one day eliminating nuclear weapons .
between them , the us and russia hold some 95 % of the world 's nuclear weapons .
and they have just agreed to start discussing a new arms deal to replace the start 1 treaty which expires in december .
there is hopeful talk of a ceiling of 1,000 war heads .
though there 'll no doubt be plenty of hard wrangling .
and britain has chipped in - indicating it would be willing to look at further cuts if indeed the world moves towards multilateral disarmament .
perhaps the next npt review in 2010 might come up with real progress .
but i would argue there is a further rethink needed .
nuclear weapons are not just about capabilities , they are about prestige - a seat at the top table .
who are the five veto-wielding members of the un security council ?
the five original nuclear powers .
un security council reform might also help send a message that global clout does not just rest with those who have armed themselves with atomic warheads .
of course , none of this addresses the biggest question of all : if iran 's intentions are indeed peaceful , why has it not already agreed to discuss the deal being offered by the west , which includes help in establishing a civilian nuclear industry as well as the lifting of economic sanctions ?
what if those in charge in tehran are only playing for time , and do not view improved relations with the outside world as an enticement ?
iran 's people may welcome greater engagement , but do its clerical leaders really want to open iran 's doors to the us and run risk of their own power being diluted , both economically and politically ?
even if they insist it would be un-islamic and illegal , what if their private calculation is that nuclear blackmail is the best way of staying in power and extending iran 's influence regionally and globally ?
which brings us back to the nightmare scenario .
" what happens if iran wo n't negotiate ? "
i asked one senior british diplomat recently .
" what 's plan b ? "
" do n't go there , " he replied wearily , " it 's too difficult , and too frightening . "

there 's the offer of direct talks if iran " unclenches its fist " ; there 's the attempt to reach out to iran on regional issues - inviting it to a big afghanistan conference due shortly , and planning to send a us official to the next shanghai co-operation council meeting of asian countries in moscow , which iran will also be attending .
and now a new video message - with farsi subtitles - from barack obama has assured iranians that the us wants " engagement that is honest and grounded in mutual respect " , prompting a swift response from iran 's supreme leader .
new mood as usual ayatollah khamenei is scathing about the us and lays down iranian conditions , demanding an end to america 's sanctions and its unquestioning support of israel .
ayatollah khamenei responded to the us overture by demanding policy changes but note that he also said that if the us really did change , then iran would change its behaviour too .
there is a new mood in the air , a sense that something is moving .
one related american shift has been towards russia .
mr obama 's administration does not hide the fact that it sees continued us-russian tensions as counterproductive .
better to sort out quarrels with moscow than risk having disgruntled russians hampering efforts to deal with the bigger challenge of tehran 's ayatollahs .
so there is now talk of a possible " grand bargain " .
a private letter from president obama to president dmitry medvedev seems to have thrown down the gauntlet .
the buzz is that washington might offer to hold off its controversial missile defence programme in europe , in return for new russian leverage on tehran .
it 's unclear what might be asked of moscow : perhaps support for a broader economic embargo against iran if negotiations fail , perhaps to lay off further arms sales - half promised already - which would strengthen iran 's air defences .
who knows what will emerge ?
after all , the russians are likely to try to push for a tough bargain .
they have their red lines when it comes to european security , and their public posture at least is that it should be washington that makes the main concessions .
clock ticking but whatever is being planned , there is no time to waste .
for several reasons the iran problem is urgent .
a test run has been carried out at iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant first , if it is true iran wants to show the world it can make a bomb , the clock is ticking .
despite an infamous us intelligence report two years ago , which claimed any iranian threat was still distant , the latest report from the un 's nuclear watchdog , the iaea , suggests iran already has or may soon acquire a stock of enriched uranium large enough - in theory - to grade up into a small weapon .
secondly , there is a mounting consensus that the damage done by casting iran as a member of the " axis of evil " needs to be undone if there is to be any chance of restoring trust on either side .
even some us diplomats who helped spearhead bush 's policy on iran admit to failure .
" we had advocated regime change .
we had a very threatening posture towards iran for a number of years .
it did n't produce any movement whatsoever , " said nicholas burns , former senior diplomat in the us state department , in a documentary broadcast on the bbc recently .
thirdly , if the bush administration began by forging policy unilaterally and ended by swinging tactically on iran , then president obama needs to think broadly and act strategically .
given the burdens - military and financial - that the us still shoulders in iraq and increasingly afghanistan , any new approach which spreads the load or which turns iran from a headache into a help when it comes to stabilising its neighbours , must be an advantage .
rethink and with four - or possibly eight - years of his presidency ahead of him , barack obama has to face the fact that it 'll probably be on his watch that any iran crisis reaches a climax .
any iran crisis is likely to reach a climax on mr obama 's watch will he be the american president who opts for military attacks on iran as a last resort , to keep his word that an iranian bomb would be " unacceptable " ?
or will he be the president who finally ends 30 years of us / iranian animosity and pulls the world back from the brink of a new atomic escalation ?
two stark choices .
but multi-lateral engagement and radical rethinks are back in fashion .
the current financial crisis requires it .
so do the looming dangers of climate change .
how to tackle the threat of a nuclear arms spreading is woven into this web of global challenges .
britain 's gordon brown last week made the link succinctly .
as the world tries to wean itself off carbon-spewing fossil fuels , demand for nuclear energy will grow , he argued .
thirty-two new nuclear reactors a year will be needed for the next four decades to reach the goal of halving carbon emissions , according to un estimates .
inequality but with that comes the risk of ever more nations using their civilian nuclear plants to conceal secret military programmes , and of ever larger stockpiles of fissile material and nuclear waste falling into the hands of rogue states or terrorists .
france , along with britain , has cut its nuclear arsenal britain 's vision is for a new tough global regime , where nuclear energy is shared internationally , but where controls are tightened and sanctions for rule breakers made harsher and swifter .
iran , said gordon brown , would be a " test case " for this " new philosophy " : either agree to collaborate and reap the benefits , or refuse to play ball and face greater penalties .
a " refreshed grand nuclear bargain for our age " , gordon brown calls it .
but as britain , america and others contemplate how to harness the genie of nuclear proliferation , now it is out of the bottle , they must surely admit that at the heart of any arrangement lies an uncomfortable inequality .
this is the increasingly out-of-date imbalance between the " haves " and the " have-nots " in the nuclear weapons club .
why is it that the five signatories to the non proliferation treaty who already have nuclear weapons - the us , russia , china , britain and france - are allowed to keep them , but any other countries that sign up to the treaty must renounce the prospect ?
good for world peace , but not exactly fair .
especially when the npt stipulates that these five are obliged to work towards reducing their stockpiles eventually to zero .
that has not been the message of the past few years .
both britain and france have cut their arsenals .
britain says it has cut the number of its warheads by half since 1997 , but that did not stop the government deciding two years ago to upgrade its trident nuclear submarine fleet .
nuclear review russia 's focus too has been on upgrading its nuclear missiles .
just last week president medvedev announced that the economic crisis would not stop russia re-equipping the entire armed forces , with priority given to nuclear arms .
then there is israel , long suspected of holding nuclear weapons , under little or no pressure from western allies to declare its hand or disarm china is thought to be developing new missiles and warheads .
and under george w bush , the united states gave no leadership on this .
his pentagon tried to get funding for a new generation of bunker-busting nuclear missiles .
no wonder the last two reviews of the npt treaty in 2000 and 2005 ended in dismal failure .
add to this the fact that those non npt nations that have tested nuclear weapons -lrb- india , pakistan and north korea -rrb- , far from being punished , have found themselves rewarded and their negotiating position immediately strengthened .
then there is israel , long suspected of holding nuclear weapons , under little or no pressure from western allies to declare its hand or disarm .
from tehran 's point of view , it is easy to claim a double standard .
given all that , how do you persuade a country like iran , eager to be seen as the dominant power in the region , not to succumb to the temptation of acquiring nukes , or at least reach the tipping point where it can use them as a bargaining chip ?
the us needs the co-operation of russia 's medvedev the answer , surely , must lie not only in carrot and stick bargaining , or step by step strengthening of bilateral ties , but to set an example .
look first to the big five .
in this era of budget cuts , perhaps cutting arms spending is even appealing .
already president obama is on record as saying he supports the idea of one day eliminating nuclear weapons .
between them , the us and russia hold some 95 % of the world 's nuclear weapons .
and they have just agreed to start discussing a new arms deal to replace the start 1 treaty which expires in december .
there is hopeful talk of a ceiling of 1,000 war heads .
though there 'll no doubt be plenty of hard wrangling .
and britain has chipped in - indicating it would be willing to look at further cuts if indeed the world moves towards multilateral disarmament .
perhaps the next npt review in 2010 might come up with real progress .
but i would argue there is a further rethink needed .
nuclear weapons are not just about capabilities , they are about prestige - a seat at the top table .
who are the five veto-wielding members of the un security council ?
the five original nuclear powers .
un security council reform might also help send a message that global clout does not just rest with those who have armed themselves with atomic warheads .
of course , none of this addresses the biggest question of all : if iran 's intentions are indeed peaceful , why has it not already agreed to discuss the deal being offered by the west , which includes help in establishing a civilian nuclear industry as well as the lifting of economic sanctions ?
what if those in charge in tehran are only playing for time , and do not view improved relations with the outside world as an enticement ?
iran 's people may welcome greater engagement , but do its clerical leaders really want to open iran 's doors to the us and run risk of their own power being diluted , both economically and politically ?
even if they insist it would be un-islamic and illegal , what if their private calculation is that nuclear blackmail is the best way of staying in power and extending iran 's influence regionally and globally ?
which brings us back to the nightmare scenario .
" what happens if iran wo n't negotiate ? "
i asked one senior british diplomat recently .
" what 's plan b ? "
" do n't go there , " he replied wearily , " it 's too difficult , and too frightening . "
