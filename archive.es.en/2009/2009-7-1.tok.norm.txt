program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 01.07.2009 current tensions between iran , west cloud mutually beneficial relationship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear ambitions remain undimmed behind the unrest some experts claim iran is using the turmoil over its disputed presidential election to stall on a return to nuclear negotiations with the west .
others say the two sides need each other and will eventually reopen talks . the violent repercussions of iran 's disputed presidential election have somewhat eclipsed the on-going stalemate over tehran 's nuclear program recently .
but instead of being two separate issues in the islamic republic , some analysts believe that iran 's increasingly antagonizing approach to the west over the pro-opposition demonstrations has more to do with the atomic stand-off than first appears .
some observers say that the heightened tensions between iran and the west are allowing tehran to deflect demands to re-start talks on its nuclear program .
ratcheting up the animosity by arresting local staff at the british embassy and challenging the us over apparent broken promises over a new dialogue , iranian authorities have created an atmosphere in which nuclear talks are highly unlikely to resume .
it was assumed that a peaceful , undisputed election would have led to a return to western pressure on iran to restart nuclear negotiations .
but the subsequent eruption of violent protests and the hard-line , authoritarian crackdown has presented the west with a new dilemma .
it has been suggested that some of iran 's political elite have fomented the idea that countries like britain and the us are behind the uprising , driving another wedge into the divide over tehran 's nuclear ambitions .
this in turn has led some analysts to suggest that some factions in the iranian government were happy to stir up a crisis specifically for this purpose .
if the west could not be trusted to stay out of iranian domestic politics , then it could not be trusted in negotiations over uranium enrichment .
iran buying time through unrest ?
but not all experts believe that this is an official policy promoted by the upper echelons of iran 's political hierarchy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayatollah khamenei is unlikely to have approved any plan " it might be the case that some radical fractions within the iranian establishment have such a plan , " michael bauer , a middle east expert at the center for applied policy research in munich , told deutsche welle .
" unpredictability is an important characteristic and even strategic tool of iranian foreign policy .
this makes its behavior hard to predict .
however , i do n't think this position is held by the supreme leader ali khamenei and other important players in iran 's political system . "
" i would not say that iran is ' using ' the situation , " konstantin kosten , an iran expert at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , said .
" however there 's no doubt that any loss of time in discussing the nuclear issue will bring more advantage to iran than to the western negotiators if they are planning to develop an atomic bomb . "
despite the increased rhetoric , experts agree that iran has no intention of sliding into international isolation like north korea over its nuclear ambitions .
the unrest over the election results may buy iran some breathing space but most believe that the current stance against the west is not the beginning of a new downward spiral in relations .
mutual benefits too important to ignore the two-sides are intrinsically linked by a number of geo-political situations in which a certain degree of co-operation and diplomacy is needed .
in these situations it remains the case that iran needs the west and the west needs iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the distrust , the us needs iran and vice versa " iran knows that washington needs its support in afghanistan and iraq , " bauer said .
" with its role in lebanon through hezbollah and gaza through hamas , iran also shows that it can play a very destructive but influential role in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
iran also has an interest in improved political relations and negotiations with the west , in particular with the us .
tehran wants the us to accept the iranian regime - and obama has indicated that he is willing to do so - and accept iran as a regional power .
moreover , iran needs access to western technology . "
kosten agrees that good relations with iran are important to the west and could be mutually beneficial in a number of areas .
" good relations with iran could be useful in any discussions regarding regional stability in the middle east and the gulf region where iran could be a major player , " kosten said .
" also , in the middle east peace process , a more cooperative role for iran may lead to new possibilities for the integration of groups like hamas and hezbollah in a political solution . "
kosten also believes the benefits of good relations with iran could lead to more energy security and economic opportunities .
" there is a major interest in economic incentives and partnerships with the west , at least at the moment , " he said .
" however , this goes against the aim of some groups in iran which prefer cooperation with countries like russia and china . "
iran unlikely to suffer north korea 's fate of isolation bauer believes that the west , while pursuing a policy of sanctions , will never go as far as isolating iran in the manner of north korea and that the us has already made steps to reverse the previous administration 's attempts to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran does n't want to end up a pariah like north korea " the policy of isolating iran pursued under president bush failed completely , " bauer said .
" the strategy of the west needs a complete overhaul and president obama knows this .
as -lrb- national security advisor zbigniew -rrb- brzezinski said , ' sticks and carrots are appropriate tools to deal with a donkey , not with a country . '
" besides , iran is not north korea , " he added .
" iran is a regional power with strong influence and a strong administrative system .
it also has huge natural resources .
russia , china and many other countries have economic interests and do business with iran .
it is hardly possible to effectively isolate such an oil and gas-exporting country . "
konstantin kosten agrees .
" i do n't think iran would become a pariah-state like north korea because iran is much more developed .
if relations with the west become even more strained , then iran would orientate its cooperation towards the east which would be a loss of opportunities . "
so what does the future hold for relations between the west and iran , once the dust of the recent unrest settles ?
what needs to happen before both sides are willing to return to the table to discuss the nuclear stand-off ?
compromise and integration needed " iran has to learn to trust the western negotiators and at the very least open talks with on offer to maybe slightly alter its way of enriching uranium , " kosten said .
" the west has to find regulations and certain approaches to the discussion which allow the iranians to save face while also encouraging them to foster transparency in their civilian enriching program . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran needs assurances and the west needs to see action " regarding the nuclear program , a compromise could be western acceptance of the full -lrb- uranium enrichment -rrb- cycle in exchange for iranian ratification of the additional protocol to the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and iranian cooperation with the iaea , ensuring full transparency of the iranian nuclear program and ensuring verification of its civilian nature , " michael bauer said .
" this will be difficult to achieve and it would require a lot of confidence-building measures .
" to ensure the sustainability of any compromise with iran , it is crucial to include all regional actors , in particular the arab gulf states , most importantly saudi arabia , " he concluded .
" at the end , the rules of the game in the middle east need to be changed from a zero-sum game to a cooperative understanding of security .
a format like a sub-regional system for cooperation and security is needed . "

" the job of these leaders is to find the best options possible for the people , " he said .
" if their citizens do n't understand or believe this then more work should be done to convince them . " governments in europe need to take a greater share of responsibility , " he added .
" the fact is that of all the 28 nato member states there will always be some that will find excuses for idleness . " craddock also said the restricted mandate of germany 's armed forces serving in afghanistan had " extremely limited the flexibility of the commanders " there . " this concerns not only the explained concessions .
in addition there are also some restrictions -lrb- on troops -rrb- that we only learn about when we ask somebody for help , " he told the paper .
" they call home and then come back and say , ' we are not allowed to do this . " ' war or no war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : craddock said restrictions on german troops limits the mission 's effectiveness the role of the german armed forces in afghanistan has been the subject of tensions here for over two years , with the german government so far insisting their troops are not involved in war , but that they are there for peacekeeping and development purposes . but craddock said the debate over the bundeswehr 's status in afghanistan was superfluous . " the politicians can call it whatever they like - i am a military man and for me it is a war , " he said .
" i think if you ask german soldiers they would call it the same thing . " germany has the third-largest contingent in the nato-led force in afghanistan , with about 3,380 troops . despite us pressure to contribute troops to the more violent southern provinces where members of nato and us soldiers have been fighting the taliban since the 2001 invasion that ousted the group from power , the german army has focused on the regional command north . handover ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stavridis said quelling the afghan insurgency would take more than bullets craddock made the comments tuesday , the day he formally handed over his post to admiral james stavridis , who assumes the role as the head of the us european command -lrb- eucom -rrb- .
the ceremony was held at eucom headquarters in the southwestern german city of stuttgart . stavridis said counter-insurgency elements in afghanistan such as the taliban could be pacified with renewed commitment from nato states . " i am very much interested in finding additional and alternative ways the allies can contribute -lrb- to the war effort -rrb- , " stavridis said . " we must pursue a policy in afghanistan that moves the defense and security of the afghan people to the center of our efforts , " he added . dfm / afp / ap editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the recognition that this country is today a country of immigration and will continue to be in the foreseeable future has made it possible for all involved to rededicate themselves to addressing the underlying problems that come with a multi-racial , multi-cultural , multi-ethnic , multi-religious society , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muigai was in germany for 10 days on a fact- finding trip germany has come a long way since former chancellor helmut kohl 's dogged insistence that it was not a country of immigration , muigai added .
seven years ago the conservative christian democratic union rephrased its former leader 's stance , saying that germany was not a country of immigration in the sense that it had not been historically formed by immigrants . with germany home to around 19 percent first and second generation immigrants , the country has acknowledged that it has attracted large numbers of immigrants and will continue to do so . minorities missing from public life muigai , who was the first un racism special rapporteur to visit germany in the last 12 years , said germany needed to do more to integrate more ethnic minorities into its political system , the police and its courts .
people with a migrant background were , according to muigai underrepresented in public life . " i think that this great country needs to turn its attention to the problems of daily racism and discrimination ; that is the racism and discrimination to be found in daily life in schools , public places , in housing , in employment etcetera , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem-özdemir is one of only a few turkish-german public figures .
last november , the greens became the first major party to elect a turkish-german as leader , cem ozdemir , but ethnic minorities are generally a rarity in german politics , making up fewer than 15 national representatives . muigai , who was in germany under an open invitation as special rapporteur , also said that due to the historical experience of germany with nazism , there was a " tendency to equate racism with extremist politics . "
while it was essential for the state and society to remain vigilant at all times , he said a greater problem remained discrimination within society . " much remains to be done " " i received representations that suggested that the education system in germany is not responding to the special needs of migrant communities with the sensitivity that the circumstances require , " muigai said . " the problems in the education system are translating into problems in the employment system and the two together are enforcing each other to create an inequality that may probably not be intended but that is the outcome , " he added . muigai 's comments were offset by praise for the country in its efforts to tackle the issues of discrimination , singling out the cities stuttgart and nuremberg for their good practices in the fight against racism .
muigai also made a plea to the media , calling on them to help stop the spread of racial stereotypes . in response to a question over the continued success of germany 's far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , muigai said that poverty and lack of opportunity led people to turn to right-wing politics , adding that while constitutional legal mechanisms should be used to keep the party in check , its weak political showing was a testament to the lack of real public support . there are regular calls for a ban on germany 's biggest far-right party , the npd , which has no seats in the bundestag national parliament , although it does have representatives in two of germany 's powerful regional assemblies . muigai 's full report will be presented to the council of human rights in 2010 and will also focus on the situation of muslims in germany following the increase in security measures since sept .

the price will have dropped by around twenty percent . the french government has slashed value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- for restaurant and cafe owners from over 19 percent to just 5.5 percent .
industry bodies say the move will be good for both the consumer and the employment market .
both the big restaurant chains and many smaller restaurants have said they will pass on the tax cut to their customers .
that means an average espresso will now cost just 1 euro -lrb- $ 1.40 -rrb- , a drop of 20 euro cents .
lowering prices is not obligatory under the new measure , but industry associations are tipping that more than 80 percent of businesses will adjust their menus in the customer 's favor .
france has campaigned for seven years to get the go-ahead from european union partners to lower the value-added tax which restaurateurs and cafe owners have to pay .
former french president jacques chirac had pushed hard for the cut but was blocked by eu partners including germany .
germany was afraid of losing out in cross-border trade to french restaurants and was reluctant to match the proposed cuts because of budget ramifications .
the french state will reportedly lose 2.38 billion euros a year in tax revenue , but the scheme is meant to stimulate the economy from the bottom up .
as part of the deal , restaurant proprietors agreed to step up hiring and create 40,000 new jobs over the next two years , including 20,000 apprentice positions. ch / reuters / afp editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the recognition that this country is today a country of immigration and will continue to be in the foreseeable future has made it possible for all involved to rededicate themselves to addressing the underlying problems that come with a multi-racial , multi-cultural , multi-ethnic , multi-religious society , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muigai was in germany for 10 days on a fact- finding trip germany has come a long way since former chancellor helmut kohl 's dogged insistence that it was not a country of immigration , muigai added .
seven years ago the conservative christian democratic union rephrased its former leader 's stance , saying that germany was not a country of immigration in the sense that it had not been historically formed by immigrants . with germany home to around 19 percent first and second generation immigrants , the country has acknowledged that it has attracted large numbers of immigrants and will continue to do so . minorities missing from public life muigai , who was the first un racism special rapporteur to visit germany in the last 12 years , said germany needed to do more to integrate more ethnic minorities into its political system , the police and its courts .
people with a migrant background were , according to muigai underrepresented in public life . " i think that this great country needs to turn its attention to the problems of daily racism and discrimination ; that is the racism and discrimination to be found in daily life in schools , public places , in housing , in employment etcetera , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem-özdemir is one of only a few turkish-german public figures .
last november , the greens became the first major party to elect a turkish-german as leader , cem ozdemir , but ethnic minorities are generally a rarity in german politics , making up fewer than 15 national representatives . muigai , who was in germany under an open invitation as special rapporteur , also said that due to the historical experience of germany with nazism , there was a " tendency to equate racism with extremist politics . "
while it was essential for the state and society to remain vigilant at all times , he said a greater problem remained discrimination within society . " much remains to be done " " i received representations that suggested that the education system in germany is not responding to the special needs of migrant communities with the sensitivity that the circumstances require , " muigai said . " the problems in the education system are translating into problems in the employment system and the two together are enforcing each other to create an inequality that may probably not be intended but that is the outcome , " he added . muigai 's comments were offset by praise for the country in its efforts to tackle the issues of discrimination , singling out the cities stuttgart and nuremberg for their good practices in the fight against racism .
muigai also made a plea to the media , calling on them to help stop the spread of racial stereotypes . in response to a question over the continued success of germany 's far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , muigai said that poverty and lack of opportunity led people to turn to right-wing politics , adding that while constitutional legal mechanisms should be used to keep the party in check , its weak political showing was a testament to the lack of real public support . there are regular calls for a ban on germany 's biggest far-right party , the npd , which has no seats in the bundestag national parliament , although it does have representatives in two of germany 's powerful regional assemblies . muigai 's full report will be presented to the council of human rights in 2010 and will also focus on the situation of muslims in germany following the increase in security measures since sept .

" the recognition that this country is today a country of immigration and will continue to be in the foreseeable future has made it possible for all involved to rededicate themselves to addressing the underlying problems that come with a multi-racial , multi-cultural , multi-ethnic , multi-religious society , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muigai was in germany for 10 days on a fact- finding trip germany has come a long way since former chancellor helmut kohl 's dogged insistence that it was not a country of immigration , muigai added .
seven years ago the conservative christian democratic union rephrased its former leader 's stance , saying that germany was not a country of immigration in the sense that it had not been historically formed by immigrants . with germany home to around 19 percent first and second generation immigrants , the country has acknowledged that it has attracted large numbers of immigrants and will continue to do so . minorities missing from public life muigai , who was the first un racism special rapporteur to visit germany in the last 12 years , said germany needed to do more to integrate more ethnic minorities into its political system , the police and its courts .
people with a migrant background were , according to muigai underrepresented in public life . " i think that this great country needs to turn its attention to the problems of daily racism and discrimination ; that is the racism and discrimination to be found in daily life in schools , public places , in housing , in employment etcetera , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem-özdemir is one of only a few turkish-german public figures .
last november , the greens became the first major party to elect a turkish-german as leader , cem ozdemir , but ethnic minorities are generally a rarity in german politics , making up fewer than 15 national representatives . muigai , who was in germany under an open invitation as special rapporteur , also said that due to the historical experience of germany with nazism , there was a " tendency to equate racism with extremist politics . "
while it was essential for the state and society to remain vigilant at all times , he said a greater problem remained discrimination within society . " much remains to be done " " i received representations that suggested that the education system in germany is not responding to the special needs of migrant communities with the sensitivity that the circumstances require , " muigai said . " the problems in the education system are translating into problems in the employment system and the two together are enforcing each other to create an inequality that may probably not be intended but that is the outcome , " he added . muigai 's comments were offset by praise for the country in its efforts to tackle the issues of discrimination , singling out the cities stuttgart and nuremberg for their good practices in the fight against racism .
muigai also made a plea to the media , calling on them to help stop the spread of racial stereotypes . in response to a question over the continued success of germany 's far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , muigai said that poverty and lack of opportunity led people to turn to right-wing politics , adding that while constitutional legal mechanisms should be used to keep the party in check , its weak political showing was a testament to the lack of real public support . there are regular calls for a ban on germany 's biggest far-right party , the npd , which has no seats in the bundestag national parliament , although it does have representatives in two of germany 's powerful regional assemblies . muigai 's full report will be presented to the council of human rights in 2010 and will also focus on the situation of muslims in germany following the increase in security measures since sept .

" the recognition that this country is today a country of immigration and will continue to be in the foreseeable future has made it possible for all involved to rededicate themselves to addressing the underlying problems that come with a multi-racial , multi-cultural , multi-ethnic , multi-religious society , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muigai was in germany for 10 days on a fact- finding trip germany has come a long way since former chancellor helmut kohl 's dogged insistence that it was not a country of immigration , muigai added .
seven years ago the conservative christian democratic union rephrased its former leader 's stance , saying that germany was not a country of immigration in the sense that it had not been historically formed by immigrants . with germany home to around 19 percent first and second generation immigrants , the country has acknowledged that it has attracted large numbers of immigrants and will continue to do so . minorities missing from public life muigai , who was the first un racism special rapporteur to visit germany in the last 12 years , said germany needed to do more to integrate more ethnic minorities into its political system , the police and its courts .
people with a migrant background were , according to muigai underrepresented in public life . " i think that this great country needs to turn its attention to the problems of daily racism and discrimination ; that is the racism and discrimination to be found in daily life in schools , public places , in housing , in employment etcetera , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem-özdemir is one of only a few turkish-german public figures .
last november , the greens became the first major party to elect a turkish-german as leader , cem ozdemir , but ethnic minorities are generally a rarity in german politics , making up fewer than 15 national representatives . muigai , who was in germany under an open invitation as special rapporteur , also said that due to the historical experience of germany with nazism , there was a " tendency to equate racism with extremist politics . "
while it was essential for the state and society to remain vigilant at all times , he said a greater problem remained discrimination within society . " much remains to be done " " i received representations that suggested that the education system in germany is not responding to the special needs of migrant communities with the sensitivity that the circumstances require , " muigai said . " the problems in the education system are translating into problems in the employment system and the two together are enforcing each other to create an inequality that may probably not be intended but that is the outcome , " he added . muigai 's comments were offset by praise for the country in its efforts to tackle the issues of discrimination , singling out the cities stuttgart and nuremberg for their good practices in the fight against racism .
muigai also made a plea to the media , calling on them to help stop the spread of racial stereotypes . in response to a question over the continued success of germany 's far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , muigai said that poverty and lack of opportunity led people to turn to right-wing politics , adding that while constitutional legal mechanisms should be used to keep the party in check , its weak political showing was a testament to the lack of real public support . there are regular calls for a ban on germany 's biggest far-right party , the npd , which has no seats in the bundestag national parliament , although it does have representatives in two of germany 's powerful regional assemblies . muigai 's full report will be presented to the council of human rights in 2010 and will also focus on the situation of muslims in germany following the increase in security measures since sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 01.07.2009 current tensions between iran , west cloud mutually beneficial relationship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear ambitions remain undimmed behind the unrest some experts claim iran is using the turmoil over its disputed presidential election to stall on a return to nuclear negotiations with the west .
others say the two sides need each other and will eventually reopen talks . the violent repercussions of iran 's disputed presidential election have somewhat eclipsed the on-going stalemate over tehran 's nuclear program recently .
but instead of being two separate issues in the islamic republic , some analysts believe that iran 's increasingly antagonizing approach to the west over the pro-opposition demonstrations has more to do with the atomic stand-off than first appears .
some observers say that the heightened tensions between iran and the west are allowing tehran to deflect demands to re-start talks on its nuclear program .
ratcheting up the animosity by arresting local staff at the british embassy and challenging the us over apparent broken promises over a new dialogue , iranian authorities have created an atmosphere in which nuclear talks are highly unlikely to resume .
it was assumed that a peaceful , undisputed election would have led to a return to western pressure on iran to restart nuclear negotiations .
but the subsequent eruption of violent protests and the hard-line , authoritarian crackdown has presented the west with a new dilemma .
it has been suggested that some of iran 's political elite have fomented the idea that countries like britain and the us are behind the uprising , driving another wedge into the divide over tehran 's nuclear ambitions .
this in turn has led some analysts to suggest that some factions in the iranian government were happy to stir up a crisis specifically for this purpose .
if the west could not be trusted to stay out of iranian domestic politics , then it could not be trusted in negotiations over uranium enrichment .
iran buying time through unrest ?
but not all experts believe that this is an official policy promoted by the upper echelons of iran 's political hierarchy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayatollah khamenei is unlikely to have approved any plan " it might be the case that some radical fractions within the iranian establishment have such a plan , " michael bauer , a middle east expert at the center for applied policy research in munich , told deutsche welle .
" unpredictability is an important characteristic and even strategic tool of iranian foreign policy .
this makes its behavior hard to predict .
however , i do n't think this position is held by the supreme leader ali khamenei and other important players in iran 's political system . "
" i would not say that iran is ' using ' the situation , " konstantin kosten , an iran expert at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , said .
" however there 's no doubt that any loss of time in discussing the nuclear issue will bring more advantage to iran than to the western negotiators if they are planning to develop an atomic bomb . "
despite the increased rhetoric , experts agree that iran has no intention of sliding into international isolation like north korea over its nuclear ambitions .
the unrest over the election results may buy iran some breathing space but most believe that the current stance against the west is not the beginning of a new downward spiral in relations .
mutual benefits too important to ignore the two-sides are intrinsically linked by a number of geo-political situations in which a certain degree of co-operation and diplomacy is needed .
in these situations it remains the case that iran needs the west and the west needs iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the distrust , the us needs iran and vice versa " iran knows that washington needs its support in afghanistan and iraq , " bauer said .
" with its role in lebanon through hezbollah and gaza through hamas , iran also shows that it can play a very destructive but influential role in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
iran also has an interest in improved political relations and negotiations with the west , in particular with the us .
tehran wants the us to accept the iranian regime - and obama has indicated that he is willing to do so - and accept iran as a regional power .
moreover , iran needs access to western technology . "
kosten agrees that good relations with iran are important to the west and could be mutually beneficial in a number of areas .
" good relations with iran could be useful in any discussions regarding regional stability in the middle east and the gulf region where iran could be a major player , " kosten said .
" also , in the middle east peace process , a more cooperative role for iran may lead to new possibilities for the integration of groups like hamas and hezbollah in a political solution . "
kosten also believes the benefits of good relations with iran could lead to more energy security and economic opportunities .
" there is a major interest in economic incentives and partnerships with the west , at least at the moment , " he said .
" however , this goes against the aim of some groups in iran which prefer cooperation with countries like russia and china . "
iran unlikely to suffer north korea 's fate of isolation bauer believes that the west , while pursuing a policy of sanctions , will never go as far as isolating iran in the manner of north korea and that the us has already made steps to reverse the previous administration 's attempts to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran does n't want to end up a pariah like north korea " the policy of isolating iran pursued under president bush failed completely , " bauer said .
" the strategy of the west needs a complete overhaul and president obama knows this .
as -lrb- national security advisor zbigniew -rrb- brzezinski said , ' sticks and carrots are appropriate tools to deal with a donkey , not with a country . '
" besides , iran is not north korea , " he added .
" iran is a regional power with strong influence and a strong administrative system .
it also has huge natural resources .
russia , china and many other countries have economic interests and do business with iran .
it is hardly possible to effectively isolate such an oil and gas-exporting country . "
konstantin kosten agrees .
" i do n't think iran would become a pariah-state like north korea because iran is much more developed .
if relations with the west become even more strained , then iran would orientate its cooperation towards the east which would be a loss of opportunities . "
so what does the future hold for relations between the west and iran , once the dust of the recent unrest settles ?
what needs to happen before both sides are willing to return to the table to discuss the nuclear stand-off ?
compromise and integration needed " iran has to learn to trust the western negotiators and at the very least open talks with on offer to maybe slightly alter its way of enriching uranium , " kosten said .
" the west has to find regulations and certain approaches to the discussion which allow the iranians to save face while also encouraging them to foster transparency in their civilian enriching program . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran needs assurances and the west needs to see action " regarding the nuclear program , a compromise could be western acceptance of the full -lrb- uranium enrichment -rrb- cycle in exchange for iranian ratification of the additional protocol to the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and iranian cooperation with the iaea , ensuring full transparency of the iranian nuclear program and ensuring verification of its civilian nature , " michael bauer said .
" this will be difficult to achieve and it would require a lot of confidence-building measures .
" to ensure the sustainability of any compromise with iran , it is crucial to include all regional actors , in particular the arab gulf states , most importantly saudi arabia , " he concluded .
" at the end , the rules of the game in the middle east need to be changed from a zero-sum game to a cooperative understanding of security .
a format like a sub-regional system for cooperation and security is needed . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the distrust , the us needs iran and vice versa " iran knows that washington needs its support in afghanistan and iraq , " bauer said .
" with its role in lebanon through hezbollah and gaza through hamas , iran also shows that it can play a very destructive but influential role in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
iran also has an interest in improved political relations and negotiations with the west , in particular with the us .
tehran wants the us to accept the iranian regime - and obama has indicated that he is willing to do so - and accept iran as a regional power .
moreover , iran needs access to western technology . "
kosten agrees that good relations with iran are important to the west and could be mutually beneficial in a number of areas .
" good relations with iran could be useful in any discussions regarding regional stability in the middle east and the gulf region where iran could be a major player , " kosten said .
" also , in the middle east peace process , a more cooperative role for iran may lead to new possibilities for the integration of groups like hamas and hezbollah in a political solution . "
kosten also believes the benefits of good relations with iran could lead to more energy security and economic opportunities .
" there is a major interest in economic incentives and partnerships with the west , at least at the moment , " he said .
" however , this goes against the aim of some groups in iran which prefer cooperation with countries like russia and china . "
iran unlikely to suffer north korea 's fate of isolation bauer believes that the west , while pursuing a policy of sanctions , will never go as far as isolating iran in the manner of north korea and that the us has already made steps to reverse the previous administration 's attempts to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran does n't want to end up a pariah like north korea " the policy of isolating iran pursued under president bush failed completely , " bauer said .
" the strategy of the west needs a complete overhaul and president obama knows this .
as -lrb- national security advisor zbigniew -rrb- brzezinski said , ' sticks and carrots are appropriate tools to deal with a donkey , not with a country . '
" besides , iran is not north korea , " he added .
" iran is a regional power with strong influence and a strong administrative system .
it also has huge natural resources .
russia , china and many other countries have economic interests and do business with iran .
it is hardly possible to effectively isolate such an oil and gas-exporting country . "
konstantin kosten agrees .
" i do n't think iran would become a pariah-state like north korea because iran is much more developed .
if relations with the west become even more strained , then iran would orientate its cooperation towards the east which would be a loss of opportunities . "
so what does the future hold for relations between the west and iran , once the dust of the recent unrest settles ?
what needs to happen before both sides are willing to return to the table to discuss the nuclear stand-off ?
compromise and integration needed " iran has to learn to trust the western negotiators and at the very least open talks with on offer to maybe slightly alter its way of enriching uranium , " kosten said .
" the west has to find regulations and certain approaches to the discussion which allow the iranians to save face while also encouraging them to foster transparency in their civilian enriching program . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran needs assurances and the west needs to see action " regarding the nuclear program , a compromise could be western acceptance of the full -lrb- uranium enrichment -rrb- cycle in exchange for iranian ratification of the additional protocol to the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and iranian cooperation with the iaea , ensuring full transparency of the iranian nuclear program and ensuring verification of its civilian nature , " michael bauer said .
" this will be difficult to achieve and it would require a lot of confidence-building measures .
" to ensure the sustainability of any compromise with iran , it is crucial to include all regional actors , in particular the arab gulf states , most importantly saudi arabia , " he concluded .
" at the end , the rules of the game in the middle east need to be changed from a zero-sum game to a cooperative understanding of security .
a format like a sub-regional system for cooperation and security is needed . "

others say the two sides need each other and will eventually reopen talks . the violent repercussions of iran 's disputed presidential election have somewhat eclipsed the on-going stalemate over tehran 's nuclear program recently .
but instead of being two separate issues in the islamic republic , some analysts believe that iran 's increasingly antagonizing approach to the west over the pro-opposition demonstrations has more to do with the atomic stand-off than first appears .
some observers say that the heightened tensions between iran and the west are allowing tehran to deflect demands to re-start talks on its nuclear program .
ratcheting up the animosity by arresting local staff at the british embassy and challenging the us over apparent broken promises over a new dialogue , iranian authorities have created an atmosphere in which nuclear talks are highly unlikely to resume .
it was assumed that a peaceful , undisputed election would have led to a return to western pressure on iran to restart nuclear negotiations .
but the subsequent eruption of violent protests and the hard-line , authoritarian crackdown has presented the west with a new dilemma .
it has been suggested that some of iran 's political elite have fomented the idea that countries like britain and the us are behind the uprising , driving another wedge into the divide over tehran 's nuclear ambitions .
this in turn has led some analysts to suggest that some factions in the iranian government were happy to stir up a crisis specifically for this purpose .
if the west could not be trusted to stay out of iranian domestic politics , then it could not be trusted in negotiations over uranium enrichment .
iran buying time through unrest ?
but not all experts believe that this is an official policy promoted by the upper echelons of iran 's political hierarchy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayatollah khamenei is unlikely to have approved any plan " it might be the case that some radical fractions within the iranian establishment have such a plan , " michael bauer , a middle east expert at the center for applied policy research in munich , told deutsche welle .
" unpredictability is an important characteristic and even strategic tool of iranian foreign policy .
this makes its behavior hard to predict .
however , i do n't think this position is held by the supreme leader ali khamenei and other important players in iran 's political system . "
" i would not say that iran is ' using ' the situation , " konstantin kosten , an iran expert at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , said .
" however there 's no doubt that any loss of time in discussing the nuclear issue will bring more advantage to iran than to the western negotiators if they are planning to develop an atomic bomb . "
despite the increased rhetoric , experts agree that iran has no intention of sliding into international isolation like north korea over its nuclear ambitions .
the unrest over the election results may buy iran some breathing space but most believe that the current stance against the west is not the beginning of a new downward spiral in relations .
mutual benefits too important to ignore the two-sides are intrinsically linked by a number of geo-political situations in which a certain degree of co-operation and diplomacy is needed .
in these situations it remains the case that iran needs the west and the west needs iran .

" there is a major interest in economic incentives and partnerships with the west , at least at the moment , " he said .
" however , this goes against the aim of some groups in iran which prefer cooperation with countries like russia and china . "
iran unlikely to suffer north korea 's fate of isolation bauer believes that the west , while pursuing a policy of sanctions , will never go as far as isolating iran in the manner of north korea and that the us has already made steps to reverse the previous administration 's attempts to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran does n't want to end up a pariah like north korea " the policy of isolating iran pursued under president bush failed completely , " bauer said .
" the strategy of the west needs a complete overhaul and president obama knows this .
as -lrb- national security advisor zbigniew -rrb- brzezinski said , ' sticks and carrots are appropriate tools to deal with a donkey , not with a country . '
" besides , iran is not north korea , " he added .
" iran is a regional power with strong influence and a strong administrative system .
it also has huge natural resources .
russia , china and many other countries have economic interests and do business with iran .
it is hardly possible to effectively isolate such an oil and gas-exporting country . "
konstantin kosten agrees .
" i do n't think iran would become a pariah-state like north korea because iran is much more developed .
if relations with the west become even more strained , then iran would orientate its cooperation towards the east which would be a loss of opportunities . "
so what does the future hold for relations between the west and iran , once the dust of the recent unrest settles ?
what needs to happen before both sides are willing to return to the table to discuss the nuclear stand-off ?
compromise and integration needed " iran has to learn to trust the western negotiators and at the very least open talks with on offer to maybe slightly alter its way of enriching uranium , " kosten said .
" the west has to find regulations and certain approaches to the discussion which allow the iranians to save face while also encouraging them to foster transparency in their civilian enriching program . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran needs assurances and the west needs to see action " regarding the nuclear program , a compromise could be western acceptance of the full -lrb- uranium enrichment -rrb- cycle in exchange for iranian ratification of the additional protocol to the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and iranian cooperation with the iaea , ensuring full transparency of the iranian nuclear program and ensuring verification of its civilian nature , " michael bauer said .
" this will be difficult to achieve and it would require a lot of confidence-building measures .
" to ensure the sustainability of any compromise with iran , it is crucial to include all regional actors , in particular the arab gulf states , most importantly saudi arabia , " he concluded .
" at the end , the rules of the game in the middle east need to be changed from a zero-sum game to a cooperative understanding of security .
a format like a sub-regional system for cooperation and security is needed . "

others say the two sides need each other and will eventually reopen talks . the violent repercussions of iran 's disputed presidential election have somewhat eclipsed the on-going stalemate over tehran 's nuclear program recently .
but instead of being two separate issues in the islamic republic , some analysts believe that iran 's increasingly antagonizing approach to the west over the pro-opposition demonstrations has more to do with the atomic stand-off than first appears .
some observers say that the heightened tensions between iran and the west are allowing tehran to deflect demands to re-start talks on its nuclear program .
ratcheting up the animosity by arresting local staff at the british embassy and challenging the us over apparent broken promises over a new dialogue , iranian authorities have created an atmosphere in which nuclear talks are highly unlikely to resume .
it was assumed that a peaceful , undisputed election would have led to a return to western pressure on iran to restart nuclear negotiations .
but the subsequent eruption of violent protests and the hard-line , authoritarian crackdown has presented the west with a new dilemma .
it has been suggested that some of iran 's political elite have fomented the idea that countries like britain and the us are behind the uprising , driving another wedge into the divide over tehran 's nuclear ambitions .
this in turn has led some analysts to suggest that some factions in the iranian government were happy to stir up a crisis specifically for this purpose .
if the west could not be trusted to stay out of iranian domestic politics , then it could not be trusted in negotiations over uranium enrichment .
iran buying time through unrest ?
but not all experts believe that this is an official policy promoted by the upper echelons of iran 's political hierarchy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayatollah khamenei is unlikely to have approved any plan " it might be the case that some radical fractions within the iranian establishment have such a plan , " michael bauer , a middle east expert at the center for applied policy research in munich , told deutsche welle .
" unpredictability is an important characteristic and even strategic tool of iranian foreign policy .
this makes its behavior hard to predict .
however , i do n't think this position is held by the supreme leader ali khamenei and other important players in iran 's political system . "
" i would not say that iran is ' using ' the situation , " konstantin kosten , an iran expert at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , said .
" however there 's no doubt that any loss of time in discussing the nuclear issue will bring more advantage to iran than to the western negotiators if they are planning to develop an atomic bomb . "
despite the increased rhetoric , experts agree that iran has no intention of sliding into international isolation like north korea over its nuclear ambitions .
the unrest over the election results may buy iran some breathing space but most believe that the current stance against the west is not the beginning of a new downward spiral in relations .
mutual benefits too important to ignore the two-sides are intrinsically linked by a number of geo-political situations in which a certain degree of co-operation and diplomacy is needed .
in these situations it remains the case that iran needs the west and the west needs iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the distrust , the us needs iran and vice versa " iran knows that washington needs its support in afghanistan and iraq , " bauer said .
" with its role in lebanon through hezbollah and gaza through hamas , iran also shows that it can play a very destructive but influential role in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
iran also has an interest in improved political relations and negotiations with the west , in particular with the us .
tehran wants the us to accept the iranian regime - and obama has indicated that he is willing to do so - and accept iran as a regional power .
moreover , iran needs access to western technology . "
kosten agrees that good relations with iran are important to the west and could be mutually beneficial in a number of areas .
" good relations with iran could be useful in any discussions regarding regional stability in the middle east and the gulf region where iran could be a major player , " kosten said .
" also , in the middle east peace process , a more cooperative role for iran may lead to new possibilities for the integration of groups like hamas and hezbollah in a political solution . "
kosten also believes the benefits of good relations with iran could lead to more energy security and economic opportunities .
" there is a major interest in economic incentives and partnerships with the west , at least at the moment , " he said .
" however , this goes against the aim of some groups in iran which prefer cooperation with countries like russia and china . "

tough new measures come into force on in an attempt to break the nicotine habit of greece , europe 's heaviest smoking nation .
but there are serious doubts that the new law will have much impact . greece lags behind the rest of europe in terms of smoking legislation and attitudes .
the new campaign , banning smoking in public places as of wednesday , is designed in part to reduce the heavy burden on government finances . each year , 20,000 greeks die from tobacco related illnesses and the cost in terms of health care amounts to 2.14 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- . some 40 percent of all greeks smoke and 60 percent of the population is exposed to passive smoking in the workplace . " the moment of truth has arrived , " said health minister dimitris avromopoulos .
" this ban aims to bring a change that will revolutionize people 's outlook .
greek society is mature nowadays and ready for the ban . " under the new rules , smoking will be banned in hospitals , schools , vehicles and all public spaces .
billboards advertising cigarettes will be banned . small cafes and restaurants with premises measuring less than 70 square meters can choose either to be tobacco free or to admit smoking only patrons .
bigger establishments can have clearly identified and ventilated smoking areas . in order to give teeth to the new regulations , smokers who break the law can be fined up to 500 euros .
on the first offence , businesses will be fined 1,000 euros .
repeat offenders will face even bigger fines , and ultimately on the fourth violation could risk losing their license . bad for business ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens nightlife wo n't be the same with the smoking ban in a country that has grown its own tobacco for centuries and seems to exist within a fog of nicotine fumes , many regard the new law as an infringement of civil liberties . " it 's going to be bad for business to start with , especially with the greeks because everybody smokes , " said restaurant manager lisa panti as she lit a cigarette outside the gondola in corfu 's old town .
" and if they ca n't smoke in the restaurant they are n't going to come out .
it 's really bad , it 's stupid . " panti said in terms of income , the new law is going to be bad for business everywhere .
but pericles katsaros at the rival rex restaurant 100 meters along the same pedestrian street disagreed . " look it 's really good for restaurants , because if you stop smoking in closed rooms , it does n't smell bad and customers can enjoy their food , " katsaros said . difficulties enforcing the law the health ministry has promised that its new anti-smoking task force will swoop on premises within twenty minutes of receiving a complaint about cigarettes .
but the head of the unit responsible for implementing the new rules has promised that it will be done gradually . on paper , it would appear that greece 's measures look certain to succeed .
but this is a country with a long tradition of defiance .
parliament is adept at introducing new legislation , but enforcement in many areas is an institutionalized failure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will greeks snub out their smokes the way they 're told ?
tens of thousands of motorcyclists , for example , routinely ignore rules demanding that they wear crash helmets .
motorists share a cavalier attitude towards regulations and frequently treat traffic lights as being a suggestion rather than compulsory . hundreds of millions of euros have been spent on closed circuit surveillance cameras in athens and other cities , but they are idle because of public resistance .
why should smoking be any different ? there may be occasional blitzes by the authorities , but unless the rules are firmly and consistently applied , they are at risk of failing . " i really think smoking is a bad habit , " said anastasia pettas from the island of zakynthos .
" but greeks are not used to following rules . " pettas said a fine of 500 or 1,000 euros wo n't force people to quit . " it 's just the way greeks react to any regulations , " she said .
" it 's our culture , i think .
we do n't go according to the rules , we go according to our minds . " her friend , denise patra , agreed . " when you try to make greeks do something , it 's worse , " patra said .

the new campaign , banning smoking in public places as of wednesday , is designed in part to reduce the heavy burden on government finances . each year , 20,000 greeks die from tobacco related illnesses and the cost in terms of health care amounts to 2.14 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- . some 40 percent of all greeks smoke and 60 percent of the population is exposed to passive smoking in the workplace . " the moment of truth has arrived , " said health minister dimitris avromopoulos .
" this ban aims to bring a change that will revolutionize people 's outlook .
greek society is mature nowadays and ready for the ban . " under the new rules , smoking will be banned in hospitals , schools , vehicles and all public spaces .
billboards advertising cigarettes will be banned . small cafes and restaurants with premises measuring less than 70 square meters can choose either to be tobacco free or to admit smoking only patrons .
bigger establishments can have clearly identified and ventilated smoking areas . in order to give teeth to the new regulations , smokers who break the law can be fined up to 500 euros .
on the first offence , businesses will be fined 1,000 euros .
repeat offenders will face even bigger fines , and ultimately on the fourth violation could risk losing their license . bad for business ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens nightlife wo n't be the same with the smoking ban in a country that has grown its own tobacco for centuries and seems to exist within a fog of nicotine fumes , many regard the new law as an infringement of civil liberties .

" the job of these leaders is to find the best options possible for the people , " he said .
" if their citizens do n't understand or believe this then more work should be done to convince them . " governments in europe need to take a greater share of responsibility , " he added .
" the fact is that of all the 28 nato member states there will always be some that will find excuses for idleness . " craddock also said the restricted mandate of germany 's armed forces serving in afghanistan had " extremely limited the flexibility of the commanders " there . " this concerns not only the explained concessions .
in addition there are also some restrictions -lrb- on troops -rrb- that we only learn about when we ask somebody for help , " he told the paper .
" they call home and then come back and say , ' we are not allowed to do this . " ' war or no war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : craddock said restrictions on german troops limits the mission 's effectiveness the role of the german armed forces in afghanistan has been the subject of tensions here for over two years , with the german government so far insisting their troops are not involved in war , but that they are there for peacekeeping and development purposes . but craddock said the debate over the bundeswehr 's status in afghanistan was superfluous .

" the job of these leaders is to find the best options possible for the people , " he said .
" if their citizens do n't understand or believe this then more work should be done to convince them . " governments in europe need to take a greater share of responsibility , " he added .
" the fact is that of all the 28 nato member states there will always be some that will find excuses for idleness . " craddock also said the restricted mandate of germany 's armed forces serving in afghanistan had " extremely limited the flexibility of the commanders " there . " this concerns not only the explained concessions .
in addition there are also some restrictions -lrb- on troops -rrb- that we only learn about when we ask somebody for help , " he told the paper .
" they call home and then come back and say , ' we are not allowed to do this . " ' war or no war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : craddock said restrictions on german troops limits the mission 's effectiveness the role of the german armed forces in afghanistan has been the subject of tensions here for over two years , with the german government so far insisting their troops are not involved in war , but that they are there for peacekeeping and development purposes . but craddock said the debate over the bundeswehr 's status in afghanistan was superfluous . " the politicians can call it whatever they like - i am a military man and for me it is a war , " he said .
" i think if you ask german soldiers they would call it the same thing . " germany has the third-largest contingent in the nato-led force in afghanistan , with about 3,380 troops . despite us pressure to contribute troops to the more violent southern provinces where members of nato and us soldiers have been fighting the taliban since the 2001 invasion that ousted the group from power , the german army has focused on the regional command north . handover ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stavridis said quelling the afghan insurgency would take more than bullets craddock made the comments tuesday , the day he formally handed over his post to admiral james stavridis , who assumes the role as the head of the us european command -lrb- eucom -rrb- .
the ceremony was held at eucom headquarters in the southwestern german city of stuttgart . stavridis said counter-insurgency elements in afghanistan such as the taliban could be pacified with renewed commitment from nato states . " i am very much interested in finding additional and alternative ways the allies can contribute -lrb- to the war effort -rrb- , " stavridis said . " we must pursue a policy in afghanistan that moves the defense and security of the afghan people to the center of our efforts , " he added . dfm / afp / ap editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the price will have dropped by around twenty percent . the french government has slashed value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- for restaurant and cafe owners from over 19 percent to just 5.5 percent .

former french president jacques chirac had pushed hard for the cut but was blocked by eu partners including germany .
germany was afraid of losing out in cross-border trade to french restaurants and was reluctant to match the proposed cuts because of budget ramifications .

27 , 2007 , her followers and many in pakistan reacted with angry disbelief .
in the weeks before her assassination , bhutto had more or less openly accused several politicians close to president musharraf of conspiring to murder her . in the weeks after bhutto 's murder , many other questions were raised : was it really a suicide bomb that killed benazir bhutto , or was she shot ?
why was the scene of the crime hosed down immediately afterwards and possible evidence destroyed ?
even an investigation by scotland yard that confirmed some of the government 's explanations could not remove the doubts . zardari 's confusing remarks the current president of pakistan and benazir bhutto 's widower , asif ali zardari , has contributed his own share to the confusion surrounding his wife 's assassination , not least by refusing an autopsy .
zardari immediately said he knew her killers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhutto 's wideo zardari refused an autopsy the retired general talat masood said , " he has been saying all sorts of things !
so if he knew , what was the point in taking up the case with the un and also not disclosing it to the people of pakistan and to his own party and to everyone else ? ” the question arises why pakistan can not simply investigate the murder itself , given that benazir bhutto 's party , the ppp , is ruling the country .
some observers believe the president , as benazir 's political heir , wants to boost his legitimacy by highlighting her murder on the international stage . " we do n't want this case to be left just to the local police in rawalpindi , " zardari said recently .
" we want this inquiry also for history .
we want that the verdict is remembered in history , and that it is remembered that such a leader was born who left such followers behind who have taken her name , this inquiry , her ideas and her words to the national stage . ” possible army-taliban nexus but rana jawad , a senior pakistani journalist , said there is another way to explain why zardari and his party want an international investigation : " i think they do want to clear themselves from any charges that it was a ppp government , hence the investigations were biased and they fixed their political opponents to settle scores . " jawad said the current political regime wanted the united nations to conclude that at the time of bhutto 's assassination a section of the military was in collusion with baitullah mehsud-led taliban groups . should the commission indeed come up with such a finding , it would cause a major political earthquake .
and although the pakistani army has been locked in heavy battles with baitullah mehsud and the taliban over the last few months , it is unclear to what extent the army would be ready to have former links between the military and the extremists exposed . chile 's un ambassador heraldo munoz will head the team .

can they make it stick this time ? it 's greece 's third try at kicking the habit , but critics fear loopholes in the legislation - and its unpopularity - mean it could prove as ineffective as previous attempts .
more than 40 percent of greece 's population smokes , with six out of ten being exposed to passive smoke in their workplaces .
around 20,000 greeks die a year from tobacco-related ailments , according to the country 's health minister , dimitris avramopoulos .
many european union countries have laws to limit exposure to second-hand , or passive , smoking .
britain and ireland have the strictest rules , where smoking is banned in enclosed public places , public transport and workplaces , as well as restaurants and bars .
eu aims for standardized smoking laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to standardize smoking laws across the bloc the european union 's health chief on tuesday proposed that uniform laws be drafted for all 27 countries in the bloc to regulate smoking more strictly in public areas and workplaces by 2012 .
" each and every european should be entitled to full protection from tobacco smoke , " eu health commissioner androulla vassiliou told a press conference on tuesday .
she said in countries with looser regulations on smoking , nearly one in five people were exposed to tobacco smoke in the workplace .
according to vassiliou , an estimated 19,000 non-smokers in the eu died due to second-hand smoke at home and in workplaces in 2002 . each member state decides the level of its own smoking restrictions .
in belgium , for example , smoking is allowed in restaurants only in separate rooms where no food is served , and smoking is banned in all enclosed workplaces .
only 10 member states - britain , ireland , italy , malta , sweden , latvia , finland , slovenia , france and the netherlands - have comprehensive anti-smoking laws , vassiliou said .
the eu defines such laws as ones that either ban smoking completely in public places or permit it only in separate smoking rooms .
bulgaria looks likely to be the next to join them , banning smoking in indoor public places and workplaces , including bars and restaurants , in 2010 .
german legislation among the weakest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baetzing says germany 's smoking laws should be stricter germany 's federal drug commissioner sabine baetzing has spoken out in favor of stricter anti-smoking laws in germany .
in germany laws vary from state to state , with north rhine-westphalia being the most lax .
in most restaurants and bars , puffers can still indulge to their heart 's content .
since 2007 , smoking has been banned on public transport , but the penalty is less than half that for traveling without a ticket .
“ protection for non-smokers should be uniform across the entire country , ” baetzing told the rheinische post newspaper .
“ other countries have set an example , ” she said , “ and they have showed that society has accepted these laws , and that in the end they do n't damage business . ”
those in favor of public puffing seem to be on a dramatic decline .
a poll by eu survey group eurobarometer last year indicated 84 percent of respondents supported smoke-free offices and other indoor workplaces , 77 percent favored smoke-free restaurants , and 61 percent supported smoke-free bars and pubs. ch / reuters / afp editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the job of these leaders is to find the best options possible for the people , " he said .
" if their citizens do n't understand or believe this then more work should be done to convince them . " governments in europe need to take a greater share of responsibility , " he added .
" the fact is that of all the 28 nato member states there will always be some that will find excuses for idleness . " craddock also said the restricted mandate of germany 's armed forces serving in afghanistan had " extremely limited the flexibility of the commanders " there . " this concerns not only the explained concessions .
in addition there are also some restrictions -lrb- on troops -rrb- that we only learn about when we ask somebody for help , " he told the paper .
" they call home and then come back and say , ' we are not allowed to do this . " ' war or no war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : craddock said restrictions on german troops limits the mission 's effectiveness the role of the german armed forces in afghanistan has been the subject of tensions here for over two years , with the german government so far insisting their troops are not involved in war , but that they are there for peacekeeping and development purposes . but craddock said the debate over the bundeswehr 's status in afghanistan was superfluous . " the politicians can call it whatever they like - i am a military man and for me it is a war , " he said .
" i think if you ask german soldiers they would call it the same thing . " germany has the third-largest contingent in the nato-led force in afghanistan , with about 3,380 troops . despite us pressure to contribute troops to the more violent southern provinces where members of nato and us soldiers have been fighting the taliban since the 2001 invasion that ousted the group from power , the german army has focused on the regional command north . handover ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stavridis said quelling the afghan insurgency would take more than bullets craddock made the comments tuesday , the day he formally handed over his post to admiral james stavridis , who assumes the role as the head of the us european command -lrb- eucom -rrb- .
the ceremony was held at eucom headquarters in the southwestern german city of stuttgart . stavridis said counter-insurgency elements in afghanistan such as the taliban could be pacified with renewed commitment from nato states . " i am very much interested in finding additional and alternative ways the allies can contribute -lrb- to the war effort -rrb- , " stavridis said . " we must pursue a policy in afghanistan that moves the defense and security of the afghan people to the center of our efforts , " he added . dfm / afp / ap editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the recognition that this country is today a country of immigration and will continue to be in the foreseeable future has made it possible for all involved to rededicate themselves to addressing the underlying problems that come with a multi-racial , multi-cultural , multi-ethnic , multi-religious society , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muigai was in germany for 10 days on a fact- finding trip germany has come a long way since former chancellor helmut kohl 's dogged insistence that it was not a country of immigration , muigai added .
seven years ago the conservative christian democratic union rephrased its former leader 's stance , saying that germany was not a country of immigration in the sense that it had not been historically formed by immigrants . with germany home to around 19 percent first and second generation immigrants , the country has acknowledged that it has attracted large numbers of immigrants and will continue to do so . minorities missing from public life muigai , who was the first un racism special rapporteur to visit germany in the last 12 years , said germany needed to do more to integrate more ethnic minorities into its political system , the police and its courts .
people with a migrant background were , according to muigai underrepresented in public life . " i think that this great country needs to turn its attention to the problems of daily racism and discrimination ; that is the racism and discrimination to be found in daily life in schools , public places , in housing , in employment etcetera , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem-özdemir is one of only a few turkish-german public figures .
last november , the greens became the first major party to elect a turkish-german as leader , cem ozdemir , but ethnic minorities are generally a rarity in german politics , making up fewer than 15 national representatives . muigai , who was in germany under an open invitation as special rapporteur , also said that due to the historical experience of germany with nazism , there was a " tendency to equate racism with extremist politics . "
while it was essential for the state and society to remain vigilant at all times , he said a greater problem remained discrimination within society . " much remains to be done " " i received representations that suggested that the education system in germany is not responding to the special needs of migrant communities with the sensitivity that the circumstances require , " muigai said . " the problems in the education system are translating into problems in the employment system and the two together are enforcing each other to create an inequality that may probably not be intended but that is the outcome , " he added . muigai 's comments were offset by praise for the country in its efforts to tackle the issues of discrimination , singling out the cities stuttgart and nuremberg for their good practices in the fight against racism .
muigai also made a plea to the media , calling on them to help stop the spread of racial stereotypes . in response to a question over the continued success of germany 's far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , muigai said that poverty and lack of opportunity led people to turn to right-wing politics , adding that while constitutional legal mechanisms should be used to keep the party in check , its weak political showing was a testament to the lack of real public support . there are regular calls for a ban on germany 's biggest far-right party , the npd , which has no seats in the bundestag national parliament , although it does have representatives in two of germany 's powerful regional assemblies . muigai 's full report will be presented to the council of human rights in 2010 and will also focus on the situation of muslims in germany following the increase in security measures since sept .

" the recognition that this country is today a country of immigration and will continue to be in the foreseeable future has made it possible for all involved to rededicate themselves to addressing the underlying problems that come with a multi-racial , multi-cultural , multi-ethnic , multi-religious society , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muigai was in germany for 10 days on a fact- finding trip germany has come a long way since former chancellor helmut kohl 's dogged insistence that it was not a country of immigration , muigai added .
seven years ago the conservative christian democratic union rephrased its former leader 's stance , saying that germany was not a country of immigration in the sense that it had not been historically formed by immigrants . with germany home to around 19 percent first and second generation immigrants , the country has acknowledged that it has attracted large numbers of immigrants and will continue to do so . minorities missing from public life muigai , who was the first un racism special rapporteur to visit germany in the last 12 years , said germany needed to do more to integrate more ethnic minorities into its political system , the police and its courts .

last november , the greens became the first major party to elect a turkish-german as leader , cem ozdemir , but ethnic minorities are generally a rarity in german politics , making up fewer than 15 national representatives . muigai , who was in germany under an open invitation as special rapporteur , also said that due to the historical experience of germany with nazism , there was a " tendency to equate racism with extremist politics . "
while it was essential for the state and society to remain vigilant at all times , he said a greater problem remained discrimination within society .

27 , 2007 , her followers and many in pakistan reacted with angry disbelief .
in the weeks before her assassination , bhutto had more or less openly accused several politicians close to president musharraf of conspiring to murder her . in the weeks after bhutto 's murder , many other questions were raised : was it really a suicide bomb that killed benazir bhutto , or was she shot ?
why was the scene of the crime hosed down immediately afterwards and possible evidence destroyed ?
even an investigation by scotland yard that confirmed some of the government 's explanations could not remove the doubts . zardari 's confusing remarks the current president of pakistan and benazir bhutto 's widower , asif ali zardari , has contributed his own share to the confusion surrounding his wife 's assassination , not least by refusing an autopsy .
zardari immediately said he knew her killers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhutto 's wideo zardari refused an autopsy the retired general talat masood said , " he has been saying all sorts of things !
so if he knew , what was the point in taking up the case with the un and also not disclosing it to the people of pakistan and to his own party and to everyone else ? ” the question arises why pakistan can not simply investigate the murder itself , given that benazir bhutto 's party , the ppp , is ruling the country .
some observers believe the president , as benazir 's political heir , wants to boost his legitimacy by highlighting her murder on the international stage . " we do n't want this case to be left just to the local police in rawalpindi , " zardari said recently .
" we want this inquiry also for history .
we want that the verdict is remembered in history , and that it is remembered that such a leader was born who left such followers behind who have taken her name , this inquiry , her ideas and her words to the national stage . ” possible army-taliban nexus but rana jawad , a senior pakistani journalist , said there is another way to explain why zardari and his party want an international investigation : " i think they do want to clear themselves from any charges that it was a ppp government , hence the investigations were biased and they fixed their political opponents to settle scores . " jawad said the current political regime wanted the united nations to conclude that at the time of bhutto 's assassination a section of the military was in collusion with baitullah mehsud-led taliban groups . should the commission indeed come up with such a finding , it would cause a major political earthquake .
and although the pakistani army has been locked in heavy battles with baitullah mehsud and the taliban over the last few months , it is unclear to what extent the army would be ready to have former links between the military and the extremists exposed . chile 's un ambassador heraldo munoz will head the team .
the other members are indonesia 's former attorney general marzuki darusman and irishman peter fitzgerald , who led the un investigation into the murder of lebanon 's former prime minister rafik hariri .
the un commission , which has a mandate for six months , is expected to visit pakistan for the first time in the third week of july . author : thomas bärthlein editor : disha uppal / kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

can they make it stick this time ? it 's greece 's third try at kicking the habit , but critics fear loopholes in the legislation - and its unpopularity - mean it could prove as ineffective as previous attempts .
more than 40 percent of greece 's population smokes , with six out of ten being exposed to passive smoke in their workplaces .
around 20,000 greeks die a year from tobacco-related ailments , according to the country 's health minister , dimitris avramopoulos .
many european union countries have laws to limit exposure to second-hand , or passive , smoking .
britain and ireland have the strictest rules , where smoking is banned in enclosed public places , public transport and workplaces , as well as restaurants and bars .
eu aims for standardized smoking laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to standardize smoking laws across the bloc the european union 's health chief on tuesday proposed that uniform laws be drafted for all 27 countries in the bloc to regulate smoking more strictly in public areas and workplaces by 2012 .
" each and every european should be entitled to full protection from tobacco smoke , " eu health commissioner androulla vassiliou told a press conference on tuesday .
she said in countries with looser regulations on smoking , nearly one in five people were exposed to tobacco smoke in the workplace .
according to vassiliou , an estimated 19,000 non-smokers in the eu died due to second-hand smoke at home and in workplaces in 2002 . each member state decides the level of its own smoking restrictions .
in belgium , for example , smoking is allowed in restaurants only in separate rooms where no food is served , and smoking is banned in all enclosed workplaces .
only 10 member states - britain , ireland , italy , malta , sweden , latvia , finland , slovenia , france and the netherlands - have comprehensive anti-smoking laws , vassiliou said .
the eu defines such laws as ones that either ban smoking completely in public places or permit it only in separate smoking rooms .
bulgaria looks likely to be the next to join them , banning smoking in indoor public places and workplaces , including bars and restaurants , in 2010 .
german legislation among the weakest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baetzing says germany 's smoking laws should be stricter germany 's federal drug commissioner sabine baetzing has spoken out in favor of stricter anti-smoking laws in germany .
in germany laws vary from state to state , with north rhine-westphalia being the most lax .
in most restaurants and bars , puffers can still indulge to their heart 's content .
since 2007 , smoking has been banned on public transport , but the penalty is less than half that for traveling without a ticket .
“ protection for non-smokers should be uniform across the entire country , ” baetzing told the rheinische post newspaper .
“ other countries have set an example , ” she said , “ and they have showed that society has accepted these laws , and that in the end they do n't damage business . ”
those in favor of public puffing seem to be on a dramatic decline .
a poll by eu survey group eurobarometer last year indicated 84 percent of respondents supported smoke-free offices and other indoor workplaces , 77 percent favored smoke-free restaurants , and 61 percent supported smoke-free bars and pubs. ch / reuters / afp editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tough new measures come into force on in an attempt to break the nicotine habit of greece , europe 's heaviest smoking nation .
but there are serious doubts that the new law will have much impact . greece lags behind the rest of europe in terms of smoking legislation and attitudes .
the new campaign , banning smoking in public places as of wednesday , is designed in part to reduce the heavy burden on government finances . each year , 20,000 greeks die from tobacco related illnesses and the cost in terms of health care amounts to 2.14 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- . some 40 percent of all greeks smoke and 60 percent of the population is exposed to passive smoking in the workplace . " the moment of truth has arrived , " said health minister dimitris avromopoulos .
" this ban aims to bring a change that will revolutionize people 's outlook .
greek society is mature nowadays and ready for the ban . " under the new rules , smoking will be banned in hospitals , schools , vehicles and all public spaces .
billboards advertising cigarettes will be banned . small cafes and restaurants with premises measuring less than 70 square meters can choose either to be tobacco free or to admit smoking only patrons .
bigger establishments can have clearly identified and ventilated smoking areas . in order to give teeth to the new regulations , smokers who break the law can be fined up to 500 euros .
on the first offence , businesses will be fined 1,000 euros .
repeat offenders will face even bigger fines , and ultimately on the fourth violation could risk losing their license . bad for business ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens nightlife wo n't be the same with the smoking ban in a country that has grown its own tobacco for centuries and seems to exist within a fog of nicotine fumes , many regard the new law as an infringement of civil liberties . " it 's going to be bad for business to start with , especially with the greeks because everybody smokes , " said restaurant manager lisa panti as she lit a cigarette outside the gondola in corfu 's old town .
" and if they ca n't smoke in the restaurant they are n't going to come out .
it 's really bad , it 's stupid . " panti said in terms of income , the new law is going to be bad for business everywhere .
but pericles katsaros at the rival rex restaurant 100 meters along the same pedestrian street disagreed . " look it 's really good for restaurants , because if you stop smoking in closed rooms , it does n't smell bad and customers can enjoy their food , " katsaros said . difficulties enforcing the law the health ministry has promised that its new anti-smoking task force will swoop on premises within twenty minutes of receiving a complaint about cigarettes .
but the head of the unit responsible for implementing the new rules has promised that it will be done gradually . on paper , it would appear that greece 's measures look certain to succeed .
but this is a country with a long tradition of defiance .
parliament is adept at introducing new legislation , but enforcement in many areas is an institutionalized failure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will greeks snub out their smokes the way they 're told ?
tens of thousands of motorcyclists , for example , routinely ignore rules demanding that they wear crash helmets .
motorists share a cavalier attitude towards regulations and frequently treat traffic lights as being a suggestion rather than compulsory . hundreds of millions of euros have been spent on closed circuit surveillance cameras in athens and other cities , but they are idle because of public resistance .
why should smoking be any different ? there may be occasional blitzes by the authorities , but unless the rules are firmly and consistently applied , they are at risk of failing . " i really think smoking is a bad habit , " said anastasia pettas from the island of zakynthos .
" but greeks are not used to following rules . " pettas said a fine of 500 or 1,000 euros wo n't force people to quit . " it 's just the way greeks react to any regulations , " she said .
" it 's our culture , i think .
we do n't go according to the rules , we go according to our minds . " her friend , denise patra , agreed . " when you try to make greeks do something , it 's worse , " patra said .
" they do the opposite on purpose and they are going to continue to do so .

tough new measures come into force on in an attempt to break the nicotine habit of greece , europe 's heaviest smoking nation .
but there are serious doubts that the new law will have much impact . greece lags behind the rest of europe in terms of smoking legislation and attitudes .
the new campaign , banning smoking in public places as of wednesday , is designed in part to reduce the heavy burden on government finances . each year , 20,000 greeks die from tobacco related illnesses and the cost in terms of health care amounts to 2.14 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- . some 40 percent of all greeks smoke and 60 percent of the population is exposed to passive smoking in the workplace . " the moment of truth has arrived , " said health minister dimitris avromopoulos .
" this ban aims to bring a change that will revolutionize people 's outlook .
greek society is mature nowadays and ready for the ban . " under the new rules , smoking will be banned in hospitals , schools , vehicles and all public spaces .
billboards advertising cigarettes will be banned . small cafes and restaurants with premises measuring less than 70 square meters can choose either to be tobacco free or to admit smoking only patrons .
bigger establishments can have clearly identified and ventilated smoking areas . in order to give teeth to the new regulations , smokers who break the law can be fined up to 500 euros .
on the first offence , businesses will be fined 1,000 euros .
repeat offenders will face even bigger fines , and ultimately on the fourth violation could risk losing their license . bad for business ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens nightlife wo n't be the same with the smoking ban in a country that has grown its own tobacco for centuries and seems to exist within a fog of nicotine fumes , many regard the new law as an infringement of civil liberties . " it 's going to be bad for business to start with , especially with the greeks because everybody smokes , " said restaurant manager lisa panti as she lit a cigarette outside the gondola in corfu 's old town .
" and if they ca n't smoke in the restaurant they are n't going to come out .
it 's really bad , it 's stupid . " panti said in terms of income , the new law is going to be bad for business everywhere .
but pericles katsaros at the rival rex restaurant 100 meters along the same pedestrian street disagreed . " look it 's really good for restaurants , because if you stop smoking in closed rooms , it does n't smell bad and customers can enjoy their food , " katsaros said . difficulties enforcing the law the health ministry has promised that its new anti-smoking task force will swoop on premises within twenty minutes of receiving a complaint about cigarettes .
but the head of the unit responsible for implementing the new rules has promised that it will be done gradually . on paper , it would appear that greece 's measures look certain to succeed .
but this is a country with a long tradition of defiance .
parliament is adept at introducing new legislation , but enforcement in many areas is an institutionalized failure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will greeks snub out their smokes the way they 're told ?
tens of thousands of motorcyclists , for example , routinely ignore rules demanding that they wear crash helmets .
motorists share a cavalier attitude towards regulations and frequently treat traffic lights as being a suggestion rather than compulsory . hundreds of millions of euros have been spent on closed circuit surveillance cameras in athens and other cities , but they are idle because of public resistance .
why should smoking be any different ? there may be occasional blitzes by the authorities , but unless the rules are firmly and consistently applied , they are at risk of failing . " i really think smoking is a bad habit , " said anastasia pettas from the island of zakynthos .

he said the time had come for others to take over at the top . at a hastily arranged press conference , the 56-year-old conservative leader of the country 's ruling croatian democratic union -lrb- hdz -rrb- , said he had " decided to withdraw from active politics and not to run for the presidency . " " my work is done , my political life is over , " sanader told reporters on wednesday .
" i have decided that i have done my part - now , it is time for others . " the country has faced growing economic troubles due to the global downturn , but sanader said this had not prompted his move .
" i never ran away from problems , " he said . sanader , who claimed he is in perfectly good health , said he would propose that his deputy , jadranka kosor , take over the government as his immediate successor . local media earlier had speculated that sanader might step down as prime minister to run for president in early 2010 .
he entered officeafter the hdz took power from the social democrats in 2003 .
he still had two years to go before his second term was to expire . eu membership on hold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the picturesque piran bay is at the heart of a dispute between croatia and slovenia sanader 's key political goals have been to lead croatia into the european union and nato , becoming a member of the latter in april .
a border dispute with neighboring eu member slovenia , however , has slowed down accession talks with the eu after a stabilization and association agreement with the bloc came into force in 2005 . how the eu and croatia address the border dispute will be a deciding factor in future relations , according to srecko matic of deutsche welle 's croatian service . " croatia is cooperating with the hague , it is making real improvement in negotiations about justice , the economy , and all the other open questions , " he said .
" the only open and big question is the dispute with slovenia about the border and the sea . " the long-standing dispute concerns the bay of piran , some 20 square kilometers of water in the northern adriatic sea .
both of the two former yugoslav republics claim ownership of the bay , which has no clear border demarcation . sanader has said he would not trade croatian territory to become the 28th eu nation . as speculation continues over the reasons behind the sudden resignation , the prime minister indicated the stalled eu membership talks might have played a role . meanwhile , eu commission president jose manuel barroso has made it clear that brussels is determined to make croatia a member .
on wednesday , the first day of its six-month eu presidency , sweden urged slovenia and croatia to jointly solve their border dispute . db / gb / dpa / ap / reuters / afp editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 01.07.2009 current tensions between iran , west cloud mutually beneficial relationship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear ambitions remain undimmed behind the unrest some experts claim iran is using the turmoil over its disputed presidential election to stall on a return to nuclear negotiations with the west .
others say the two sides need each other and will eventually reopen talks . the violent repercussions of iran 's disputed presidential election have somewhat eclipsed the on-going stalemate over tehran 's nuclear program recently .
but instead of being two separate issues in the islamic republic , some analysts believe that iran 's increasingly antagonizing approach to the west over the pro-opposition demonstrations has more to do with the atomic stand-off than first appears .
some observers say that the heightened tensions between iran and the west are allowing tehran to deflect demands to re-start talks on its nuclear program .
ratcheting up the animosity by arresting local staff at the british embassy and challenging the us over apparent broken promises over a new dialogue , iranian authorities have created an atmosphere in which nuclear talks are highly unlikely to resume .
it was assumed that a peaceful , undisputed election would have led to a return to western pressure on iran to restart nuclear negotiations .
but the subsequent eruption of violent protests and the hard-line , authoritarian crackdown has presented the west with a new dilemma .
it has been suggested that some of iran 's political elite have fomented the idea that countries like britain and the us are behind the uprising , driving another wedge into the divide over tehran 's nuclear ambitions .
this in turn has led some analysts to suggest that some factions in the iranian government were happy to stir up a crisis specifically for this purpose .
if the west could not be trusted to stay out of iranian domestic politics , then it could not be trusted in negotiations over uranium enrichment .
iran buying time through unrest ?
but not all experts believe that this is an official policy promoted by the upper echelons of iran 's political hierarchy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayatollah khamenei is unlikely to have approved any plan " it might be the case that some radical fractions within the iranian establishment have such a plan , " michael bauer , a middle east expert at the center for applied policy research in munich , told deutsche welle .
" unpredictability is an important characteristic and even strategic tool of iranian foreign policy .
this makes its behavior hard to predict .
however , i do n't think this position is held by the supreme leader ali khamenei and other important players in iran 's political system . "
" i would not say that iran is ' using ' the situation , " konstantin kosten , an iran expert at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , said .
" however there 's no doubt that any loss of time in discussing the nuclear issue will bring more advantage to iran than to the western negotiators if they are planning to develop an atomic bomb . "
despite the increased rhetoric , experts agree that iran has no intention of sliding into international isolation like north korea over its nuclear ambitions .
the unrest over the election results may buy iran some breathing space but most believe that the current stance against the west is not the beginning of a new downward spiral in relations .
mutual benefits too important to ignore the two-sides are intrinsically linked by a number of geo-political situations in which a certain degree of co-operation and diplomacy is needed .
in these situations it remains the case that iran needs the west and the west needs iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the distrust , the us needs iran and vice versa " iran knows that washington needs its support in afghanistan and iraq , " bauer said .
" with its role in lebanon through hezbollah and gaza through hamas , iran also shows that it can play a very destructive but influential role in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
iran also has an interest in improved political relations and negotiations with the west , in particular with the us .
tehran wants the us to accept the iranian regime - and obama has indicated that he is willing to do so - and accept iran as a regional power .
moreover , iran needs access to western technology . "
kosten agrees that good relations with iran are important to the west and could be mutually beneficial in a number of areas .
" good relations with iran could be useful in any discussions regarding regional stability in the middle east and the gulf region where iran could be a major player , " kosten said .
" also , in the middle east peace process , a more cooperative role for iran may lead to new possibilities for the integration of groups like hamas and hezbollah in a political solution . "
kosten also believes the benefits of good relations with iran could lead to more energy security and economic opportunities .
" there is a major interest in economic incentives and partnerships with the west , at least at the moment , " he said .
" however , this goes against the aim of some groups in iran which prefer cooperation with countries like russia and china . "
iran unlikely to suffer north korea 's fate of isolation bauer believes that the west , while pursuing a policy of sanctions , will never go as far as isolating iran in the manner of north korea and that the us has already made steps to reverse the previous administration 's attempts to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran does n't want to end up a pariah like north korea " the policy of isolating iran pursued under president bush failed completely , " bauer said .
" the strategy of the west needs a complete overhaul and president obama knows this .
as -lrb- national security advisor zbigniew -rrb- brzezinski said , ' sticks and carrots are appropriate tools to deal with a donkey , not with a country . '
" besides , iran is not north korea , " he added .
" iran is a regional power with strong influence and a strong administrative system .
it also has huge natural resources .
russia , china and many other countries have economic interests and do business with iran .
it is hardly possible to effectively isolate such an oil and gas-exporting country . "
konstantin kosten agrees .
" i do n't think iran would become a pariah-state like north korea because iran is much more developed .
if relations with the west become even more strained , then iran would orientate its cooperation towards the east which would be a loss of opportunities . "
so what does the future hold for relations between the west and iran , once the dust of the recent unrest settles ?
what needs to happen before both sides are willing to return to the table to discuss the nuclear stand-off ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 01.07.2009 current tensions between iran , west cloud mutually beneficial relationship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear ambitions remain undimmed behind the unrest some experts claim iran is using the turmoil over its disputed presidential election to stall on a return to nuclear negotiations with the west .
others say the two sides need each other and will eventually reopen talks . the violent repercussions of iran 's disputed presidential election have somewhat eclipsed the on-going stalemate over tehran 's nuclear program recently .
but instead of being two separate issues in the islamic republic , some analysts believe that iran 's increasingly antagonizing approach to the west over the pro-opposition demonstrations has more to do with the atomic stand-off than first appears .
some observers say that the heightened tensions between iran and the west are allowing tehran to deflect demands to re-start talks on its nuclear program .
ratcheting up the animosity by arresting local staff at the british embassy and challenging the us over apparent broken promises over a new dialogue , iranian authorities have created an atmosphere in which nuclear talks are highly unlikely to resume .
it was assumed that a peaceful , undisputed election would have led to a return to western pressure on iran to restart nuclear negotiations .
but the subsequent eruption of violent protests and the hard-line , authoritarian crackdown has presented the west with a new dilemma .
it has been suggested that some of iran 's political elite have fomented the idea that countries like britain and the us are behind the uprising , driving another wedge into the divide over tehran 's nuclear ambitions .
this in turn has led some analysts to suggest that some factions in the iranian government were happy to stir up a crisis specifically for this purpose .
if the west could not be trusted to stay out of iranian domestic politics , then it could not be trusted in negotiations over uranium enrichment .
iran buying time through unrest ?
but not all experts believe that this is an official policy promoted by the upper echelons of iran 's political hierarchy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayatollah khamenei is unlikely to have approved any plan " it might be the case that some radical fractions within the iranian establishment have such a plan , " michael bauer , a middle east expert at the center for applied policy research in munich , told deutsche welle .
" unpredictability is an important characteristic and even strategic tool of iranian foreign policy .
this makes its behavior hard to predict .
however , i do n't think this position is held by the supreme leader ali khamenei and other important players in iran 's political system . "
" i would not say that iran is ' using ' the situation , " konstantin kosten , an iran expert at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , said .
" however there 's no doubt that any loss of time in discussing the nuclear issue will bring more advantage to iran than to the western negotiators if they are planning to develop an atomic bomb . "
despite the increased rhetoric , experts agree that iran has no intention of sliding into international isolation like north korea over its nuclear ambitions .
the unrest over the election results may buy iran some breathing space but most believe that the current stance against the west is not the beginning of a new downward spiral in relations .
mutual benefits too important to ignore the two-sides are intrinsically linked by a number of geo-political situations in which a certain degree of co-operation and diplomacy is needed .
in these situations it remains the case that iran needs the west and the west needs iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the distrust , the us needs iran and vice versa " iran knows that washington needs its support in afghanistan and iraq , " bauer said .
" with its role in lebanon through hezbollah and gaza through hamas , iran also shows that it can play a very destructive but influential role in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
iran also has an interest in improved political relations and negotiations with the west , in particular with the us .
tehran wants the us to accept the iranian regime - and obama has indicated that he is willing to do so - and accept iran as a regional power .
moreover , iran needs access to western technology . "
kosten agrees that good relations with iran are important to the west and could be mutually beneficial in a number of areas .
" good relations with iran could be useful in any discussions regarding regional stability in the middle east and the gulf region where iran could be a major player , " kosten said .
" also , in the middle east peace process , a more cooperative role for iran may lead to new possibilities for the integration of groups like hamas and hezbollah in a political solution . "
kosten also believes the benefits of good relations with iran could lead to more energy security and economic opportunities .
" there is a major interest in economic incentives and partnerships with the west , at least at the moment , " he said .
" however , this goes against the aim of some groups in iran which prefer cooperation with countries like russia and china . "
iran unlikely to suffer north korea 's fate of isolation bauer believes that the west , while pursuing a policy of sanctions , will never go as far as isolating iran in the manner of north korea and that the us has already made steps to reverse the previous administration 's attempts to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran does n't want to end up a pariah like north korea " the policy of isolating iran pursued under president bush failed completely , " bauer said .
" the strategy of the west needs a complete overhaul and president obama knows this .
as -lrb- national security advisor zbigniew -rrb- brzezinski said , ' sticks and carrots are appropriate tools to deal with a donkey , not with a country . '
" besides , iran is not north korea , " he added .
" iran is a regional power with strong influence and a strong administrative system .
it also has huge natural resources .
russia , china and many other countries have economic interests and do business with iran .
it is hardly possible to effectively isolate such an oil and gas-exporting country . "
konstantin kosten agrees .
" i do n't think iran would become a pariah-state like north korea because iran is much more developed .
if relations with the west become even more strained , then iran would orientate its cooperation towards the east which would be a loss of opportunities . "
so what does the future hold for relations between the west and iran , once the dust of the recent unrest settles ?
what needs to happen before both sides are willing to return to the table to discuss the nuclear stand-off ?
compromise and integration needed " iran has to learn to trust the western negotiators and at the very least open talks with on offer to maybe slightly alter its way of enriching uranium , " kosten said .
" the west has to find regulations and certain approaches to the discussion which allow the iranians to save face while also encouraging them to foster transparency in their civilian enriching program . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 01.07.2009 current tensions between iran , west cloud mutually beneficial relationship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear ambitions remain undimmed behind the unrest some experts claim iran is using the turmoil over its disputed presidential election to stall on a return to nuclear negotiations with the west .
others say the two sides need each other and will eventually reopen talks . the violent repercussions of iran 's disputed presidential election have somewhat eclipsed the on-going stalemate over tehran 's nuclear program recently .
but instead of being two separate issues in the islamic republic , some analysts believe that iran 's increasingly antagonizing approach to the west over the pro-opposition demonstrations has more to do with the atomic stand-off than first appears .
some observers say that the heightened tensions between iran and the west are allowing tehran to deflect demands to re-start talks on its nuclear program .
ratcheting up the animosity by arresting local staff at the british embassy and challenging the us over apparent broken promises over a new dialogue , iranian authorities have created an atmosphere in which nuclear talks are highly unlikely to resume .
it was assumed that a peaceful , undisputed election would have led to a return to western pressure on iran to restart nuclear negotiations .
but the subsequent eruption of violent protests and the hard-line , authoritarian crackdown has presented the west with a new dilemma .
it has been suggested that some of iran 's political elite have fomented the idea that countries like britain and the us are behind the uprising , driving another wedge into the divide over tehran 's nuclear ambitions .
this in turn has led some analysts to suggest that some factions in the iranian government were happy to stir up a crisis specifically for this purpose .
if the west could not be trusted to stay out of iranian domestic politics , then it could not be trusted in negotiations over uranium enrichment .
iran buying time through unrest ?
but not all experts believe that this is an official policy promoted by the upper echelons of iran 's political hierarchy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayatollah khamenei is unlikely to have approved any plan " it might be the case that some radical fractions within the iranian establishment have such a plan , " michael bauer , a middle east expert at the center for applied policy research in munich , told deutsche welle .
" unpredictability is an important characteristic and even strategic tool of iranian foreign policy .
this makes its behavior hard to predict .
however , i do n't think this position is held by the supreme leader ali khamenei and other important players in iran 's political system . "
" i would not say that iran is ' using ' the situation , " konstantin kosten , an iran expert at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , said .
" however there 's no doubt that any loss of time in discussing the nuclear issue will bring more advantage to iran than to the western negotiators if they are planning to develop an atomic bomb . "
despite the increased rhetoric , experts agree that iran has no intention of sliding into international isolation like north korea over its nuclear ambitions .
the unrest over the election results may buy iran some breathing space but most believe that the current stance against the west is not the beginning of a new downward spiral in relations .
mutual benefits too important to ignore the two-sides are intrinsically linked by a number of geo-political situations in which a certain degree of co-operation and diplomacy is needed .
in these situations it remains the case that iran needs the west and the west needs iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the distrust , the us needs iran and vice versa " iran knows that washington needs its support in afghanistan and iraq , " bauer said .
" with its role in lebanon through hezbollah and gaza through hamas , iran also shows that it can play a very destructive but influential role in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
iran also has an interest in improved political relations and negotiations with the west , in particular with the us .
tehran wants the us to accept the iranian regime - and obama has indicated that he is willing to do so - and accept iran as a regional power .
moreover , iran needs access to western technology . "
kosten agrees that good relations with iran are important to the west and could be mutually beneficial in a number of areas .
" good relations with iran could be useful in any discussions regarding regional stability in the middle east and the gulf region where iran could be a major player , " kosten said .
" also , in the middle east peace process , a more cooperative role for iran may lead to new possibilities for the integration of groups like hamas and hezbollah in a political solution . "
kosten also believes the benefits of good relations with iran could lead to more energy security and economic opportunities .
" there is a major interest in economic incentives and partnerships with the west , at least at the moment , " he said .
" however , this goes against the aim of some groups in iran which prefer cooperation with countries like russia and china . "
iran unlikely to suffer north korea 's fate of isolation bauer believes that the west , while pursuing a policy of sanctions , will never go as far as isolating iran in the manner of north korea and that the us has already made steps to reverse the previous administration 's attempts to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran does n't want to end up a pariah like north korea " the policy of isolating iran pursued under president bush failed completely , " bauer said .
" the strategy of the west needs a complete overhaul and president obama knows this .
as -lrb- national security advisor zbigniew -rrb- brzezinski said , ' sticks and carrots are appropriate tools to deal with a donkey , not with a country . '
" besides , iran is not north korea , " he added .
" iran is a regional power with strong influence and a strong administrative system .
it also has huge natural resources .
russia , china and many other countries have economic interests and do business with iran .
it is hardly possible to effectively isolate such an oil and gas-exporting country . "
konstantin kosten agrees .
" i do n't think iran would become a pariah-state like north korea because iran is much more developed .
if relations with the west become even more strained , then iran would orientate its cooperation towards the east which would be a loss of opportunities . "
so what does the future hold for relations between the west and iran , once the dust of the recent unrest settles ?
what needs to happen before both sides are willing to return to the table to discuss the nuclear stand-off ?
compromise and integration needed " iran has to learn to trust the western negotiators and at the very least open talks with on offer to maybe slightly alter its way of enriching uranium , " kosten said .
" the west has to find regulations and certain approaches to the discussion which allow the iranians to save face while also encouraging them to foster transparency in their civilian enriching program . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran needs assurances and the west needs to see action " regarding the nuclear program , a compromise could be western acceptance of the full -lrb- uranium enrichment -rrb- cycle in exchange for iranian ratification of the additional protocol to the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and iranian cooperation with the iaea , ensuring full transparency of the iranian nuclear program and ensuring verification of its civilian nature , " michael bauer said .
" this will be difficult to achieve and it would require a lot of confidence-building measures .
" to ensure the sustainability of any compromise with iran , it is crucial to include all regional actors , in particular the arab gulf states , most importantly saudi arabia , " he concluded .
" at the end , the rules of the game in the middle east need to be changed from a zero-sum game to a cooperative understanding of security .
a format like a sub-regional system for cooperation and security is needed . "

can they make it stick this time ? it 's greece 's third try at kicking the habit , but critics fear loopholes in the legislation - and its unpopularity - mean it could prove as ineffective as previous attempts .
more than 40 percent of greece 's population smokes , with six out of ten being exposed to passive smoke in their workplaces .
around 20,000 greeks die a year from tobacco-related ailments , according to the country 's health minister , dimitris avramopoulos .
many european union countries have laws to limit exposure to second-hand , or passive , smoking .
britain and ireland have the strictest rules , where smoking is banned in enclosed public places , public transport and workplaces , as well as restaurants and bars .
eu aims for standardized smoking laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to standardize smoking laws across the bloc the european union 's health chief on tuesday proposed that uniform laws be drafted for all 27 countries in the bloc to regulate smoking more strictly in public areas and workplaces by 2012 .
" each and every european should be entitled to full protection from tobacco smoke , " eu health commissioner androulla vassiliou told a press conference on tuesday .
she said in countries with looser regulations on smoking , nearly one in five people were exposed to tobacco smoke in the workplace .
according to vassiliou , an estimated 19,000 non-smokers in the eu died due to second-hand smoke at home and in workplaces in 2002 . each member state decides the level of its own smoking restrictions .
in belgium , for example , smoking is allowed in restaurants only in separate rooms where no food is served , and smoking is banned in all enclosed workplaces .
only 10 member states - britain , ireland , italy , malta , sweden , latvia , finland , slovenia , france and the netherlands - have comprehensive anti-smoking laws , vassiliou said .
the eu defines such laws as ones that either ban smoking completely in public places or permit it only in separate smoking rooms .

in germany laws vary from state to state , with north rhine-westphalia being the most lax .
in most restaurants and bars , puffers can still indulge to their heart 's content .
since 2007 , smoking has been banned on public transport , but the penalty is less than half that for traveling without a ticket .
“ protection for non-smokers should be uniform across the entire country , ” baetzing told the rheinische post newspaper .

" the recognition that this country is today a country of immigration and will continue to be in the foreseeable future has made it possible for all involved to rededicate themselves to addressing the underlying problems that come with a multi-racial , multi-cultural , multi-ethnic , multi-religious society , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muigai was in germany for 10 days on a fact- finding trip germany has come a long way since former chancellor helmut kohl 's dogged insistence that it was not a country of immigration , muigai added .
seven years ago the conservative christian democratic union rephrased its former leader 's stance , saying that germany was not a country of immigration in the sense that it had not been historically formed by immigrants . with germany home to around 19 percent first and second generation immigrants , the country has acknowledged that it has attracted large numbers of immigrants and will continue to do so . minorities missing from public life muigai , who was the first un racism special rapporteur to visit germany in the last 12 years , said germany needed to do more to integrate more ethnic minorities into its political system , the police and its courts .
people with a migrant background were , according to muigai underrepresented in public life . " i think that this great country needs to turn its attention to the problems of daily racism and discrimination ; that is the racism and discrimination to be found in daily life in schools , public places , in housing , in employment etcetera , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem-özdemir is one of only a few turkish-german public figures .
last november , the greens became the first major party to elect a turkish-german as leader , cem ozdemir , but ethnic minorities are generally a rarity in german politics , making up fewer than 15 national representatives . muigai , who was in germany under an open invitation as special rapporteur , also said that due to the historical experience of germany with nazism , there was a " tendency to equate racism with extremist politics . "
while it was essential for the state and society to remain vigilant at all times , he said a greater problem remained discrimination within society . " much remains to be done " " i received representations that suggested that the education system in germany is not responding to the special needs of migrant communities with the sensitivity that the circumstances require , " muigai said . " the problems in the education system are translating into problems in the employment system and the two together are enforcing each other to create an inequality that may probably not be intended but that is the outcome , " he added . muigai 's comments were offset by praise for the country in its efforts to tackle the issues of discrimination , singling out the cities stuttgart and nuremberg for their good practices in the fight against racism .
muigai also made a plea to the media , calling on them to help stop the spread of racial stereotypes . in response to a question over the continued success of germany 's far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , muigai said that poverty and lack of opportunity led people to turn to right-wing politics , adding that while constitutional legal mechanisms should be used to keep the party in check , its weak political showing was a testament to the lack of real public support . there are regular calls for a ban on germany 's biggest far-right party , the npd , which has no seats in the bundestag national parliament , although it does have representatives in two of germany 's powerful regional assemblies . muigai 's full report will be presented to the council of human rights in 2010 and will also focus on the situation of muslims in germany following the increase in security measures since sept .

seven years ago the conservative christian democratic union rephrased its former leader 's stance , saying that germany was not a country of immigration in the sense that it had not been historically formed by immigrants . with germany home to around 19 percent first and second generation immigrants , the country has acknowledged that it has attracted large numbers of immigrants and will continue to do so . minorities missing from public life muigai , who was the first un racism special rapporteur to visit germany in the last 12 years , said germany needed to do more to integrate more ethnic minorities into its political system , the police and its courts .
people with a migrant background were , according to muigai underrepresented in public life . " i think that this great country needs to turn its attention to the problems of daily racism and discrimination ; that is the racism and discrimination to be found in daily life in schools , public places , in housing , in employment etcetera , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem-özdemir is one of only a few turkish-german public figures .
last november , the greens became the first major party to elect a turkish-german as leader , cem ozdemir , but ethnic minorities are generally a rarity in german politics , making up fewer than 15 national representatives . muigai , who was in germany under an open invitation as special rapporteur , also said that due to the historical experience of germany with nazism , there was a " tendency to equate racism with extremist politics . "
while it was essential for the state and society to remain vigilant at all times , he said a greater problem remained discrimination within society . " much remains to be done " " i received representations that suggested that the education system in germany is not responding to the special needs of migrant communities with the sensitivity that the circumstances require , " muigai said . " the problems in the education system are translating into problems in the employment system and the two together are enforcing each other to create an inequality that may probably not be intended but that is the outcome , " he added . muigai 's comments were offset by praise for the country in its efforts to tackle the issues of discrimination , singling out the cities stuttgart and nuremberg for their good practices in the fight against racism .
muigai also made a plea to the media , calling on them to help stop the spread of racial stereotypes . in response to a question over the continued success of germany 's far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , muigai said that poverty and lack of opportunity led people to turn to right-wing politics , adding that while constitutional legal mechanisms should be used to keep the party in check , its weak political showing was a testament to the lack of real public support . there are regular calls for a ban on germany 's biggest far-right party , the npd , which has no seats in the bundestag national parliament , although it does have representatives in two of germany 's powerful regional assemblies . muigai 's full report will be presented to the council of human rights in 2010 and will also focus on the situation of muslims in germany following the increase in security measures since sept .

tough new measures come into force on in an attempt to break the nicotine habit of greece , europe 's heaviest smoking nation .
but there are serious doubts that the new law will have much impact . greece lags behind the rest of europe in terms of smoking legislation and attitudes .
the new campaign , banning smoking in public places as of wednesday , is designed in part to reduce the heavy burden on government finances . each year , 20,000 greeks die from tobacco related illnesses and the cost in terms of health care amounts to 2.14 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- . some 40 percent of all greeks smoke and 60 percent of the population is exposed to passive smoking in the workplace . " the moment of truth has arrived , " said health minister dimitris avromopoulos .
" this ban aims to bring a change that will revolutionize people 's outlook .
greek society is mature nowadays and ready for the ban . " under the new rules , smoking will be banned in hospitals , schools , vehicles and all public spaces .
billboards advertising cigarettes will be banned . small cafes and restaurants with premises measuring less than 70 square meters can choose either to be tobacco free or to admit smoking only patrons .
bigger establishments can have clearly identified and ventilated smoking areas . in order to give teeth to the new regulations , smokers who break the law can be fined up to 500 euros .
on the first offence , businesses will be fined 1,000 euros .
repeat offenders will face even bigger fines , and ultimately on the fourth violation could risk losing their license . bad for business ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens nightlife wo n't be the same with the smoking ban in a country that has grown its own tobacco for centuries and seems to exist within a fog of nicotine fumes , many regard the new law as an infringement of civil liberties . " it 's going to be bad for business to start with , especially with the greeks because everybody smokes , " said restaurant manager lisa panti as she lit a cigarette outside the gondola in corfu 's old town .
" and if they ca n't smoke in the restaurant they are n't going to come out .
it 's really bad , it 's stupid . " panti said in terms of income , the new law is going to be bad for business everywhere .
but pericles katsaros at the rival rex restaurant 100 meters along the same pedestrian street disagreed . " look it 's really good for restaurants , because if you stop smoking in closed rooms , it does n't smell bad and customers can enjoy their food , " katsaros said . difficulties enforcing the law the health ministry has promised that its new anti-smoking task force will swoop on premises within twenty minutes of receiving a complaint about cigarettes .
but the head of the unit responsible for implementing the new rules has promised that it will be done gradually . on paper , it would appear that greece 's measures look certain to succeed .
but this is a country with a long tradition of defiance .
parliament is adept at introducing new legislation , but enforcement in many areas is an institutionalized failure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will greeks snub out their smokes the way they 're told ?
tens of thousands of motorcyclists , for example , routinely ignore rules demanding that they wear crash helmets .
motorists share a cavalier attitude towards regulations and frequently treat traffic lights as being a suggestion rather than compulsory . hundreds of millions of euros have been spent on closed circuit surveillance cameras in athens and other cities , but they are idle because of public resistance .
why should smoking be any different ? there may be occasional blitzes by the authorities , but unless the rules are firmly and consistently applied , they are at risk of failing . " i really think smoking is a bad habit , " said anastasia pettas from the island of zakynthos .
" but greeks are not used to following rules . " pettas said a fine of 500 or 1,000 euros wo n't force people to quit . " it 's just the way greeks react to any regulations , " she said .
" it 's our culture , i think .
we do n't go according to the rules , we go according to our minds . " her friend , denise patra , agreed . " when you try to make greeks do something , it 's worse , " patra said .
" they do the opposite on purpose and they are going to continue to do so .
but i 'm happy about the new rules , because where ever i go , everybody smokes , and i ca n't stand the smell .
i hope it works . " author : malcolm brabant in athens -lrb- sac -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the entire ikb board has been under investigation , but ortseifen is the only one who has been charged . ikb was eventually saved from collapse with a multi-billion-euro injection of cash from the state and then was sold last year to us-based investment fund lone star for over 100 million euros . db / dpa / ap / afp editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tough new measures come into force on in an attempt to break the nicotine habit of greece , europe 's heaviest smoking nation .
but there are serious doubts that the new law will have much impact . greece lags behind the rest of europe in terms of smoking legislation and attitudes .
the new campaign , banning smoking in public places as of wednesday , is designed in part to reduce the heavy burden on government finances . each year , 20,000 greeks die from tobacco related illnesses and the cost in terms of health care amounts to 2.14 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- . some 40 percent of all greeks smoke and 60 percent of the population is exposed to passive smoking in the workplace . " the moment of truth has arrived , " said health minister dimitris avromopoulos .
" this ban aims to bring a change that will revolutionize people 's outlook .
greek society is mature nowadays and ready for the ban . " under the new rules , smoking will be banned in hospitals , schools , vehicles and all public spaces .
billboards advertising cigarettes will be banned . small cafes and restaurants with premises measuring less than 70 square meters can choose either to be tobacco free or to admit smoking only patrons .
bigger establishments can have clearly identified and ventilated smoking areas . in order to give teeth to the new regulations , smokers who break the law can be fined up to 500 euros .
on the first offence , businesses will be fined 1,000 euros .
repeat offenders will face even bigger fines , and ultimately on the fourth violation could risk losing their license . bad for business ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens nightlife wo n't be the same with the smoking ban in a country that has grown its own tobacco for centuries and seems to exist within a fog of nicotine fumes , many regard the new law as an infringement of civil liberties . " it 's going to be bad for business to start with , especially with the greeks because everybody smokes , " said restaurant manager lisa panti as she lit a cigarette outside the gondola in corfu 's old town .
" and if they ca n't smoke in the restaurant they are n't going to come out .
it 's really bad , it 's stupid . " panti said in terms of income , the new law is going to be bad for business everywhere .
but pericles katsaros at the rival rex restaurant 100 meters along the same pedestrian street disagreed . " look it 's really good for restaurants , because if you stop smoking in closed rooms , it does n't smell bad and customers can enjoy their food , " katsaros said . difficulties enforcing the law the health ministry has promised that its new anti-smoking task force will swoop on premises within twenty minutes of receiving a complaint about cigarettes .
but the head of the unit responsible for implementing the new rules has promised that it will be done gradually . on paper , it would appear that greece 's measures look certain to succeed .
but this is a country with a long tradition of defiance .
parliament is adept at introducing new legislation , but enforcement in many areas is an institutionalized failure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will greeks snub out their smokes the way they 're told ?
tens of thousands of motorcyclists , for example , routinely ignore rules demanding that they wear crash helmets .
motorists share a cavalier attitude towards regulations and frequently treat traffic lights as being a suggestion rather than compulsory . hundreds of millions of euros have been spent on closed circuit surveillance cameras in athens and other cities , but they are idle because of public resistance .
why should smoking be any different ? there may be occasional blitzes by the authorities , but unless the rules are firmly and consistently applied , they are at risk of failing . " i really think smoking is a bad habit , " said anastasia pettas from the island of zakynthos .
" but greeks are not used to following rules . " pettas said a fine of 500 or 1,000 euros wo n't force people to quit . " it 's just the way greeks react to any regulations , " she said .
" it 's our culture , i think .
we do n't go according to the rules , we go according to our minds . " her friend , denise patra , agreed . " when you try to make greeks do something , it 's worse , " patra said .
" they do the opposite on purpose and they are going to continue to do so .

" the job of these leaders is to find the best options possible for the people , " he said .
" if their citizens do n't understand or believe this then more work should be done to convince them . " governments in europe need to take a greater share of responsibility , " he added .
" the fact is that of all the 28 nato member states there will always be some that will find excuses for idleness . " craddock also said the restricted mandate of germany 's armed forces serving in afghanistan had " extremely limited the flexibility of the commanders " there . " this concerns not only the explained concessions .
in addition there are also some restrictions -lrb- on troops -rrb- that we only learn about when we ask somebody for help , " he told the paper .

" the politicians can call it whatever they like - i am a military man and for me it is a war , " he said .
" i think if you ask german soldiers they would call it the same thing . " germany has the third-largest contingent in the nato-led force in afghanistan , with about 3,380 troops . despite us pressure to contribute troops to the more violent southern provinces where members of nato and us soldiers have been fighting the taliban since the 2001 invasion that ousted the group from power , the german army has focused on the regional command north . handover ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stavridis said quelling the afghan insurgency would take more than bullets craddock made the comments tuesday , the day he formally handed over his post to admiral james stavridis , who assumes the role as the head of the us european command -lrb- eucom -rrb- .
the ceremony was held at eucom headquarters in the southwestern german city of stuttgart . stavridis said counter-insurgency elements in afghanistan such as the taliban could be pacified with renewed commitment from nato states . " i am very much interested in finding additional and alternative ways the allies can contribute -lrb- to the war effort -rrb- , " stavridis said .

" " my work is done , my political life is over , " sanader told reporters on wednesday .
" i have decided that i have done my part - now , it is time for others . " the country has faced growing economic troubles due to the global downturn , but sanader said this had not prompted his move .
" i never ran away from problems , " he said . sanader , who claimed he is in perfectly good health , said he would propose that his deputy , jadranka kosor , take over the government as his immediate successor . local media earlier had speculated that sanader might step down as prime minister to run for president in early 2010 .

a border dispute with neighboring eu member slovenia , however , has slowed down accession talks with the eu after a stabilization and association agreement with the bloc came into force in 2005 . how the eu and croatia address the border dispute will be a deciding factor in future relations , according to srecko matic of deutsche welle 's croatian service . " croatia is cooperating with the hague , it is making real improvement in negotiations about justice , the economy , and all the other open questions , " he said .
" the only open and big question is the dispute with slovenia about the border and the sea . " the long-standing dispute concerns the bay of piran , some 20 square kilometers of water in the northern adriatic sea .
both of the two former yugoslav republics claim ownership of the bay , which has no clear border demarcation . sanader has said he would not trade croatian territory to become the 28th eu nation . as speculation continues over the reasons behind the sudden resignation , the prime minister indicated the stalled eu membership talks might have played a role . meanwhile , eu commission president jose manuel barroso has made it clear that brussels is determined to make croatia a member .

in a speech at the formal ceremony in jakarta on wednesday , president susilo bambang yudhoyono praised the police 's performance but fell short of mentioning anything related to recent concerns raised by rights groups over alleged abuses by the police .
last week , london-based rights group amnesty international accused the indonesian police force of torturing detainees . amnesty international says its report is based on interviews with abuse victims , police officers and rights groups in indonesia during the last two years .
it says despite the government ’ s efforts to introduce some reforms in the police sector , the cases of torture and abuses by the police remain high .
it says that during arrests , interrogation and detention , suspects are often subject to ill-treatment such as electric shocks , sexual assault and repeated beatings .
the most vulnerable groups are suspects living in poor communities , women , drug addicts and sex workers .
isabelle arradon , from amnesty international ’ s office in jakarta , explains : “ we ’ ve learned that a lot of abuse is happening .
police officers often try to extort money from suspects .
sometimes they also force suspects to give them information or to confess a crime . ”
no internal accountability on wednesday , the jakarta post daily , one of indonesia ’ s largest english-language newspapers published an editorial entitled : " police terror ” .
citing excerpts from amnesty ’ s report , the article confirmed that most indonesians feel terrified in the presence of the police and that police abuse and torture remain rampant in the country .
amnesty ’ s isabelle arradon questions the accountability of the police force : “ there is not much internal accountability ; the police force is not disciplined enough to handle cases of police abuse and brutality .
there are several commissions like kompolnas -lrb- national police commission -rrb- and komnas ham -lrb- the national human rights commission -rrb- who can accept complains but they don ’ t have the authority to do investigations . ”
following amnesty ’ s criticisms , indonesia ’ s national police chief recognised that there were some cases of abuse , though he insisted that the report was not entirely true .
he also passed a decree to implement human rights standards in daily policing and assured the public that the police were working towards improvement .
positive development jim della-giacoma of the international crisis group in jakarta sees this all as a positive development for a police force which was part of the military until 1999 .
“ i was on the streets of jakarta a decade ago reporting on the indonesia police in my previous work as a journalist and i couldn ’ t have imagined the chief of police getting up and talking about human rights , as he did last week .
in fact he also held up the amnesty report and acknowledged that there was a lot of criticism in the report and that they needed to do a lot of work . ”
boosting internal mechanism amnesty has urged the authorities to establish an independent watchdog to investigate the allegations and bring the guilty to justice .
jim della-giacoma supports the calls : “ i think amnesty has really made a solid recommendation for a much stronger independent body to investigate reports .
but they at the same time acknowledge that there should be many layers of investigation and police should have at least primary responsibility for enforcing their own rules regarding human rights standards and enforcing their own discipline . ”
with presidential elections due next week and amid predictions that president susilo bambang yudhoyono is running ahead of his rivals in the run-up to the polls , rights activists have been urging the yudhoyuno administration to look into the matter more seriously and guarantee substantial reforms .

sometimes they also force suspects to give them information or to confess a crime . ”
no internal accountability on wednesday , the jakarta post daily , one of indonesia ’ s largest english-language newspapers published an editorial entitled : " police terror ” .
citing excerpts from amnesty ’ s report , the article confirmed that most indonesians feel terrified in the presence of the police and that police abuse and torture remain rampant in the country .
amnesty ’ s isabelle arradon questions the accountability of the police force : “ there is not much internal accountability ; the police force is not disciplined enough to handle cases of police abuse and brutality .
there are several commissions like kompolnas -lrb- national police commission -rrb- and komnas ham -lrb- the national human rights commission -rrb- who can accept complains but they don ’ t have the authority to do investigations . ”
following amnesty ’ s criticisms , indonesia ’ s national police chief recognised that there were some cases of abuse , though he insisted that the report was not entirely true .
he also passed a decree to implement human rights standards in daily policing and assured the public that the police were working towards improvement .
positive development jim della-giacoma of the international crisis group in jakarta sees this all as a positive development for a police force which was part of the military until 1999 .
“ i was on the streets of jakarta a decade ago reporting on the indonesia police in my previous work as a journalist and i couldn ’ t have imagined the chief of police getting up and talking about human rights , as he did last week .
in fact he also held up the amnesty report and acknowledged that there was a lot of criticism in the report and that they needed to do a lot of work . ”
boosting internal mechanism amnesty has urged the authorities to establish an independent watchdog to investigate the allegations and bring the guilty to justice .
jim della-giacoma supports the calls : “ i think amnesty has really made a solid recommendation for a much stronger independent body to investigate reports .
but they at the same time acknowledge that there should be many layers of investigation and police should have at least primary responsibility for enforcing their own rules regarding human rights standards and enforcing their own discipline . ”

in a speech at the formal ceremony in jakarta on wednesday , president susilo bambang yudhoyono praised the police 's performance but fell short of mentioning anything related to recent concerns raised by rights groups over alleged abuses by the police .
last week , london-based rights group amnesty international accused the indonesian police force of torturing detainees . amnesty international says its report is based on interviews with abuse victims , police officers and rights groups in indonesia during the last two years .
it says despite the government ’ s efforts to introduce some reforms in the police sector , the cases of torture and abuses by the police remain high .
it says that during arrests , interrogation and detention , suspects are often subject to ill-treatment such as electric shocks , sexual assault and repeated beatings .
the most vulnerable groups are suspects living in poor communities , women , drug addicts and sex workers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 01.07.2009 current tensions between iran , west cloud mutually beneficial relationship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear ambitions remain undimmed behind the unrest some experts claim iran is using the turmoil over its disputed presidential election to stall on a return to nuclear negotiations with the west .
others say the two sides need each other and will eventually reopen talks . the violent repercussions of iran 's disputed presidential election have somewhat eclipsed the on-going stalemate over tehran 's nuclear program recently .
but instead of being two separate issues in the islamic republic , some analysts believe that iran 's increasingly antagonizing approach to the west over the pro-opposition demonstrations has more to do with the atomic stand-off than first appears .
some observers say that the heightened tensions between iran and the west are allowing tehran to deflect demands to re-start talks on its nuclear program .
ratcheting up the animosity by arresting local staff at the british embassy and challenging the us over apparent broken promises over a new dialogue , iranian authorities have created an atmosphere in which nuclear talks are highly unlikely to resume .
it was assumed that a peaceful , undisputed election would have led to a return to western pressure on iran to restart nuclear negotiations .
but the subsequent eruption of violent protests and the hard-line , authoritarian crackdown has presented the west with a new dilemma .
it has been suggested that some of iran 's political elite have fomented the idea that countries like britain and the us are behind the uprising , driving another wedge into the divide over tehran 's nuclear ambitions .
this in turn has led some analysts to suggest that some factions in the iranian government were happy to stir up a crisis specifically for this purpose .
if the west could not be trusted to stay out of iranian domestic politics , then it could not be trusted in negotiations over uranium enrichment .
iran buying time through unrest ?
but not all experts believe that this is an official policy promoted by the upper echelons of iran 's political hierarchy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayatollah khamenei is unlikely to have approved any plan " it might be the case that some radical fractions within the iranian establishment have such a plan , " michael bauer , a middle east expert at the center for applied policy research in munich , told deutsche welle .
" unpredictability is an important characteristic and even strategic tool of iranian foreign policy .
this makes its behavior hard to predict .
however , i do n't think this position is held by the supreme leader ali khamenei and other important players in iran 's political system . "
" i would not say that iran is ' using ' the situation , " konstantin kosten , an iran expert at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , said .
" however there 's no doubt that any loss of time in discussing the nuclear issue will bring more advantage to iran than to the western negotiators if they are planning to develop an atomic bomb . "
despite the increased rhetoric , experts agree that iran has no intention of sliding into international isolation like north korea over its nuclear ambitions .
the unrest over the election results may buy iran some breathing space but most believe that the current stance against the west is not the beginning of a new downward spiral in relations .
mutual benefits too important to ignore the two-sides are intrinsically linked by a number of geo-political situations in which a certain degree of co-operation and diplomacy is needed .
in these situations it remains the case that iran needs the west and the west needs iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the distrust , the us needs iran and vice versa " iran knows that washington needs its support in afghanistan and iraq , " bauer said .
" with its role in lebanon through hezbollah and gaza through hamas , iran also shows that it can play a very destructive but influential role in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
iran also has an interest in improved political relations and negotiations with the west , in particular with the us .
tehran wants the us to accept the iranian regime - and obama has indicated that he is willing to do so - and accept iran as a regional power .
moreover , iran needs access to western technology . "
kosten agrees that good relations with iran are important to the west and could be mutually beneficial in a number of areas .
" good relations with iran could be useful in any discussions regarding regional stability in the middle east and the gulf region where iran could be a major player , " kosten said .
" also , in the middle east peace process , a more cooperative role for iran may lead to new possibilities for the integration of groups like hamas and hezbollah in a political solution . "
kosten also believes the benefits of good relations with iran could lead to more energy security and economic opportunities .
" there is a major interest in economic incentives and partnerships with the west , at least at the moment , " he said .
" however , this goes against the aim of some groups in iran which prefer cooperation with countries like russia and china . "
iran unlikely to suffer north korea 's fate of isolation bauer believes that the west , while pursuing a policy of sanctions , will never go as far as isolating iran in the manner of north korea and that the us has already made steps to reverse the previous administration 's attempts to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran does n't want to end up a pariah like north korea " the policy of isolating iran pursued under president bush failed completely , " bauer said .
" the strategy of the west needs a complete overhaul and president obama knows this .
as -lrb- national security advisor zbigniew -rrb- brzezinski said , ' sticks and carrots are appropriate tools to deal with a donkey , not with a country . '
" besides , iran is not north korea , " he added .
" iran is a regional power with strong influence and a strong administrative system .
it also has huge natural resources .
russia , china and many other countries have economic interests and do business with iran .
it is hardly possible to effectively isolate such an oil and gas-exporting country . "
konstantin kosten agrees .
" i do n't think iran would become a pariah-state like north korea because iran is much more developed .
if relations with the west become even more strained , then iran would orientate its cooperation towards the east which would be a loss of opportunities . "
so what does the future hold for relations between the west and iran , once the dust of the recent unrest settles ?
what needs to happen before both sides are willing to return to the table to discuss the nuclear stand-off ?
compromise and integration needed " iran has to learn to trust the western negotiators and at the very least open talks with on offer to maybe slightly alter its way of enriching uranium , " kosten said .
" the west has to find regulations and certain approaches to the discussion which allow the iranians to save face while also encouraging them to foster transparency in their civilian enriching program . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran needs assurances and the west needs to see action " regarding the nuclear program , a compromise could be western acceptance of the full -lrb- uranium enrichment -rrb- cycle in exchange for iranian ratification of the additional protocol to the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and iranian cooperation with the iaea , ensuring full transparency of the iranian nuclear program and ensuring verification of its civilian nature , " michael bauer said .
" this will be difficult to achieve and it would require a lot of confidence-building measures .
" to ensure the sustainability of any compromise with iran , it is crucial to include all regional actors , in particular the arab gulf states , most importantly saudi arabia , " he concluded .
" at the end , the rules of the game in the middle east need to be changed from a zero-sum game to a cooperative understanding of security .
a format like a sub-regional system for cooperation and security is needed . "

if the west could not be trusted to stay out of iranian domestic politics , then it could not be trusted in negotiations over uranium enrichment .
iran buying time through unrest ?
but not all experts believe that this is an official policy promoted by the upper echelons of iran 's political hierarchy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayatollah khamenei is unlikely to have approved any plan " it might be the case that some radical fractions within the iranian establishment have such a plan , " michael bauer , a middle east expert at the center for applied policy research in munich , told deutsche welle .
" unpredictability is an important characteristic and even strategic tool of iranian foreign policy .
this makes its behavior hard to predict .
however , i do n't think this position is held by the supreme leader ali khamenei and other important players in iran 's political system . "
" i would not say that iran is ' using ' the situation , " konstantin kosten , an iran expert at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , said .
" however there 's no doubt that any loss of time in discussing the nuclear issue will bring more advantage to iran than to the western negotiators if they are planning to develop an atomic bomb . "
despite the increased rhetoric , experts agree that iran has no intention of sliding into international isolation like north korea over its nuclear ambitions .
the unrest over the election results may buy iran some breathing space but most believe that the current stance against the west is not the beginning of a new downward spiral in relations .
mutual benefits too important to ignore the two-sides are intrinsically linked by a number of geo-political situations in which a certain degree of co-operation and diplomacy is needed .
in these situations it remains the case that iran needs the west and the west needs iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the distrust , the us needs iran and vice versa " iran knows that washington needs its support in afghanistan and iraq , " bauer said .
" with its role in lebanon through hezbollah and gaza through hamas , iran also shows that it can play a very destructive but influential role in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
iran also has an interest in improved political relations and negotiations with the west , in particular with the us .
tehran wants the us to accept the iranian regime - and obama has indicated that he is willing to do so - and accept iran as a regional power .
moreover , iran needs access to western technology . "
kosten agrees that good relations with iran are important to the west and could be mutually beneficial in a number of areas .
" good relations with iran could be useful in any discussions regarding regional stability in the middle east and the gulf region where iran could be a major player , " kosten said .
" also , in the middle east peace process , a more cooperative role for iran may lead to new possibilities for the integration of groups like hamas and hezbollah in a political solution . "
kosten also believes the benefits of good relations with iran could lead to more energy security and economic opportunities .
" there is a major interest in economic incentives and partnerships with the west , at least at the moment , " he said .
" however , this goes against the aim of some groups in iran which prefer cooperation with countries like russia and china . "
iran unlikely to suffer north korea 's fate of isolation bauer believes that the west , while pursuing a policy of sanctions , will never go as far as isolating iran in the manner of north korea and that the us has already made steps to reverse the previous administration 's attempts to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran does n't want to end up a pariah like north korea " the policy of isolating iran pursued under president bush failed completely , " bauer said .
" the strategy of the west needs a complete overhaul and president obama knows this .
as -lrb- national security advisor zbigniew -rrb- brzezinski said , ' sticks and carrots are appropriate tools to deal with a donkey , not with a country . '
" besides , iran is not north korea , " he added .
" iran is a regional power with strong influence and a strong administrative system .
it also has huge natural resources .
russia , china and many other countries have economic interests and do business with iran .
it is hardly possible to effectively isolate such an oil and gas-exporting country . "
konstantin kosten agrees .
" i do n't think iran would become a pariah-state like north korea because iran is much more developed .
if relations with the west become even more strained , then iran would orientate its cooperation towards the east which would be a loss of opportunities . "
so what does the future hold for relations between the west and iran , once the dust of the recent unrest settles ?
what needs to happen before both sides are willing to return to the table to discuss the nuclear stand-off ?
compromise and integration needed " iran has to learn to trust the western negotiators and at the very least open talks with on offer to maybe slightly alter its way of enriching uranium , " kosten said .
" the west has to find regulations and certain approaches to the discussion which allow the iranians to save face while also encouraging them to foster transparency in their civilian enriching program . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran needs assurances and the west needs to see action " regarding the nuclear program , a compromise could be western acceptance of the full -lrb- uranium enrichment -rrb- cycle in exchange for iranian ratification of the additional protocol to the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and iranian cooperation with the iaea , ensuring full transparency of the iranian nuclear program and ensuring verification of its civilian nature , " michael bauer said .
" this will be difficult to achieve and it would require a lot of confidence-building measures .
" to ensure the sustainability of any compromise with iran , it is crucial to include all regional actors , in particular the arab gulf states , most importantly saudi arabia , " he concluded .
" at the end , the rules of the game in the middle east need to be changed from a zero-sum game to a cooperative understanding of security .
a format like a sub-regional system for cooperation and security is needed . "

the unrest over the election results may buy iran some breathing space but most believe that the current stance against the west is not the beginning of a new downward spiral in relations .
mutual benefits too important to ignore the two-sides are intrinsically linked by a number of geo-political situations in which a certain degree of co-operation and diplomacy is needed .
in these situations it remains the case that iran needs the west and the west needs iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the distrust , the us needs iran and vice versa " iran knows that washington needs its support in afghanistan and iraq , " bauer said .
" with its role in lebanon through hezbollah and gaza through hamas , iran also shows that it can play a very destructive but influential role in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
iran also has an interest in improved political relations and negotiations with the west , in particular with the us .
tehran wants the us to accept the iranian regime - and obama has indicated that he is willing to do so - and accept iran as a regional power .
moreover , iran needs access to western technology . "
kosten agrees that good relations with iran are important to the west and could be mutually beneficial in a number of areas .
" good relations with iran could be useful in any discussions regarding regional stability in the middle east and the gulf region where iran could be a major player , " kosten said .
" also , in the middle east peace process , a more cooperative role for iran may lead to new possibilities for the integration of groups like hamas and hezbollah in a political solution . "
kosten also believes the benefits of good relations with iran could lead to more energy security and economic opportunities .
" there is a major interest in economic incentives and partnerships with the west , at least at the moment , " he said .
" however , this goes against the aim of some groups in iran which prefer cooperation with countries like russia and china . "
iran unlikely to suffer north korea 's fate of isolation bauer believes that the west , while pursuing a policy of sanctions , will never go as far as isolating iran in the manner of north korea and that the us has already made steps to reverse the previous administration 's attempts to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran does n't want to end up a pariah like north korea " the policy of isolating iran pursued under president bush failed completely , " bauer said .
" the strategy of the west needs a complete overhaul and president obama knows this .
as -lrb- national security advisor zbigniew -rrb- brzezinski said , ' sticks and carrots are appropriate tools to deal with a donkey , not with a country . '
" besides , iran is not north korea , " he added .
" iran is a regional power with strong influence and a strong administrative system .
it also has huge natural resources .
russia , china and many other countries have economic interests and do business with iran .
it is hardly possible to effectively isolate such an oil and gas-exporting country . "
konstantin kosten agrees .
" i do n't think iran would become a pariah-state like north korea because iran is much more developed .
if relations with the west become even more strained , then iran would orientate its cooperation towards the east which would be a loss of opportunities . "
so what does the future hold for relations between the west and iran , once the dust of the recent unrest settles ?
what needs to happen before both sides are willing to return to the table to discuss the nuclear stand-off ?
compromise and integration needed " iran has to learn to trust the western negotiators and at the very least open talks with on offer to maybe slightly alter its way of enriching uranium , " kosten said .
" the west has to find regulations and certain approaches to the discussion which allow the iranians to save face while also encouraging them to foster transparency in their civilian enriching program . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran needs assurances and the west needs to see action " regarding the nuclear program , a compromise could be western acceptance of the full -lrb- uranium enrichment -rrb- cycle in exchange for iranian ratification of the additional protocol to the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and iranian cooperation with the iaea , ensuring full transparency of the iranian nuclear program and ensuring verification of its civilian nature , " michael bauer said .
" this will be difficult to achieve and it would require a lot of confidence-building measures .
" to ensure the sustainability of any compromise with iran , it is crucial to include all regional actors , in particular the arab gulf states , most importantly saudi arabia , " he concluded .
" at the end , the rules of the game in the middle east need to be changed from a zero-sum game to a cooperative understanding of security .
a format like a sub-regional system for cooperation and security is needed . "

others say the two sides need each other and will eventually reopen talks . the violent repercussions of iran 's disputed presidential election have somewhat eclipsed the on-going stalemate over tehran 's nuclear program recently .
but instead of being two separate issues in the islamic republic , some analysts believe that iran 's increasingly antagonizing approach to the west over the pro-opposition demonstrations has more to do with the atomic stand-off than first appears .
some observers say that the heightened tensions between iran and the west are allowing tehran to deflect demands to re-start talks on its nuclear program .
ratcheting up the animosity by arresting local staff at the british embassy and challenging the us over apparent broken promises over a new dialogue , iranian authorities have created an atmosphere in which nuclear talks are highly unlikely to resume .
it was assumed that a peaceful , undisputed election would have led to a return to western pressure on iran to restart nuclear negotiations .
but the subsequent eruption of violent protests and the hard-line , authoritarian crackdown has presented the west with a new dilemma .
it has been suggested that some of iran 's political elite have fomented the idea that countries like britain and the us are behind the uprising , driving another wedge into the divide over tehran 's nuclear ambitions .
this in turn has led some analysts to suggest that some factions in the iranian government were happy to stir up a crisis specifically for this purpose .
if the west could not be trusted to stay out of iranian domestic politics , then it could not be trusted in negotiations over uranium enrichment .
iran buying time through unrest ?
but not all experts believe that this is an official policy promoted by the upper echelons of iran 's political hierarchy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayatollah khamenei is unlikely to have approved any plan " it might be the case that some radical fractions within the iranian establishment have such a plan , " michael bauer , a middle east expert at the center for applied policy research in munich , told deutsche welle .
" unpredictability is an important characteristic and even strategic tool of iranian foreign policy .
this makes its behavior hard to predict .
however , i do n't think this position is held by the supreme leader ali khamenei and other important players in iran 's political system . "
" i would not say that iran is ' using ' the situation , " konstantin kosten , an iran expert at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , said .

" there is a major interest in economic incentives and partnerships with the west , at least at the moment , " he said .
" however , this goes against the aim of some groups in iran which prefer cooperation with countries like russia and china . "
iran unlikely to suffer north korea 's fate of isolation bauer believes that the west , while pursuing a policy of sanctions , will never go as far as isolating iran in the manner of north korea and that the us has already made steps to reverse the previous administration 's attempts to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran does n't want to end up a pariah like north korea " the policy of isolating iran pursued under president bush failed completely , " bauer said .
" the strategy of the west needs a complete overhaul and president obama knows this .
as -lrb- national security advisor zbigniew -rrb- brzezinski said , ' sticks and carrots are appropriate tools to deal with a donkey , not with a country . '
" besides , iran is not north korea , " he added .
" iran is a regional power with strong influence and a strong administrative system .
it also has huge natural resources .
russia , china and many other countries have economic interests and do business with iran .
it is hardly possible to effectively isolate such an oil and gas-exporting country . "
konstantin kosten agrees .
" i do n't think iran would become a pariah-state like north korea because iran is much more developed .
if relations with the west become even more strained , then iran would orientate its cooperation towards the east which would be a loss of opportunities . "
so what does the future hold for relations between the west and iran , once the dust of the recent unrest settles ?
what needs to happen before both sides are willing to return to the table to discuss the nuclear stand-off ?
compromise and integration needed " iran has to learn to trust the western negotiators and at the very least open talks with on offer to maybe slightly alter its way of enriching uranium , " kosten said .
" the west has to find regulations and certain approaches to the discussion which allow the iranians to save face while also encouraging them to foster transparency in their civilian enriching program . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran needs assurances and the west needs to see action " regarding the nuclear program , a compromise could be western acceptance of the full -lrb- uranium enrichment -rrb- cycle in exchange for iranian ratification of the additional protocol to the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and iranian cooperation with the iaea , ensuring full transparency of the iranian nuclear program and ensuring verification of its civilian nature , " michael bauer said .
" this will be difficult to achieve and it would require a lot of confidence-building measures .
" to ensure the sustainability of any compromise with iran , it is crucial to include all regional actors , in particular the arab gulf states , most importantly saudi arabia , " he concluded .
" at the end , the rules of the game in the middle east need to be changed from a zero-sum game to a cooperative understanding of security .
a format like a sub-regional system for cooperation and security is needed . "

others say the two sides need each other and will eventually reopen talks . the violent repercussions of iran 's disputed presidential election have somewhat eclipsed the on-going stalemate over tehran 's nuclear program recently .
but instead of being two separate issues in the islamic republic , some analysts believe that iran 's increasingly antagonizing approach to the west over the pro-opposition demonstrations has more to do with the atomic stand-off than first appears .
some observers say that the heightened tensions between iran and the west are allowing tehran to deflect demands to re-start talks on its nuclear program .
ratcheting up the animosity by arresting local staff at the british embassy and challenging the us over apparent broken promises over a new dialogue , iranian authorities have created an atmosphere in which nuclear talks are highly unlikely to resume .
it was assumed that a peaceful , undisputed election would have led to a return to western pressure on iran to restart nuclear negotiations .
but the subsequent eruption of violent protests and the hard-line , authoritarian crackdown has presented the west with a new dilemma .
it has been suggested that some of iran 's political elite have fomented the idea that countries like britain and the us are behind the uprising , driving another wedge into the divide over tehran 's nuclear ambitions .
this in turn has led some analysts to suggest that some factions in the iranian government were happy to stir up a crisis specifically for this purpose .
if the west could not be trusted to stay out of iranian domestic politics , then it could not be trusted in negotiations over uranium enrichment .
iran buying time through unrest ?
but not all experts believe that this is an official policy promoted by the upper echelons of iran 's political hierarchy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayatollah khamenei is unlikely to have approved any plan " it might be the case that some radical fractions within the iranian establishment have such a plan , " michael bauer , a middle east expert at the center for applied policy research in munich , told deutsche welle .
" unpredictability is an important characteristic and even strategic tool of iranian foreign policy .
this makes its behavior hard to predict .
however , i do n't think this position is held by the supreme leader ali khamenei and other important players in iran 's political system . "
" i would not say that iran is ' using ' the situation , " konstantin kosten , an iran expert at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , said .
" however there 's no doubt that any loss of time in discussing the nuclear issue will bring more advantage to iran than to the western negotiators if they are planning to develop an atomic bomb . "
despite the increased rhetoric , experts agree that iran has no intention of sliding into international isolation like north korea over its nuclear ambitions .
the unrest over the election results may buy iran some breathing space but most believe that the current stance against the west is not the beginning of a new downward spiral in relations .
mutual benefits too important to ignore the two-sides are intrinsically linked by a number of geo-political situations in which a certain degree of co-operation and diplomacy is needed .
in these situations it remains the case that iran needs the west and the west needs iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the distrust , the us needs iran and vice versa " iran knows that washington needs its support in afghanistan and iraq , " bauer said .
" with its role in lebanon through hezbollah and gaza through hamas , iran also shows that it can play a very destructive but influential role in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
iran also has an interest in improved political relations and negotiations with the west , in particular with the us .
tehran wants the us to accept the iranian regime - and obama has indicated that he is willing to do so - and accept iran as a regional power .
moreover , iran needs access to western technology . "
kosten agrees that good relations with iran are important to the west and could be mutually beneficial in a number of areas .
" good relations with iran could be useful in any discussions regarding regional stability in the middle east and the gulf region where iran could be a major player , " kosten said .
" also , in the middle east peace process , a more cooperative role for iran may lead to new possibilities for the integration of groups like hamas and hezbollah in a political solution . "
kosten also believes the benefits of good relations with iran could lead to more energy security and economic opportunities .

others say the two sides need each other and will eventually reopen talks . the violent repercussions of iran 's disputed presidential election have somewhat eclipsed the on-going stalemate over tehran 's nuclear program recently .
but instead of being two separate issues in the islamic republic , some analysts believe that iran 's increasingly antagonizing approach to the west over the pro-opposition demonstrations has more to do with the atomic stand-off than first appears .
some observers say that the heightened tensions between iran and the west are allowing tehran to deflect demands to re-start talks on its nuclear program .
ratcheting up the animosity by arresting local staff at the british embassy and challenging the us over apparent broken promises over a new dialogue , iranian authorities have created an atmosphere in which nuclear talks are highly unlikely to resume .
it was assumed that a peaceful , undisputed election would have led to a return to western pressure on iran to restart nuclear negotiations .
but the subsequent eruption of violent protests and the hard-line , authoritarian crackdown has presented the west with a new dilemma .
it has been suggested that some of iran 's political elite have fomented the idea that countries like britain and the us are behind the uprising , driving another wedge into the divide over tehran 's nuclear ambitions .
this in turn has led some analysts to suggest that some factions in the iranian government were happy to stir up a crisis specifically for this purpose .
if the west could not be trusted to stay out of iranian domestic politics , then it could not be trusted in negotiations over uranium enrichment .
iran buying time through unrest ?
but not all experts believe that this is an official policy promoted by the upper echelons of iran 's political hierarchy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayatollah khamenei is unlikely to have approved any plan " it might be the case that some radical fractions within the iranian establishment have such a plan , " michael bauer , a middle east expert at the center for applied policy research in munich , told deutsche welle .
" unpredictability is an important characteristic and even strategic tool of iranian foreign policy .
this makes its behavior hard to predict .
however , i do n't think this position is held by the supreme leader ali khamenei and other important players in iran 's political system . "
" i would not say that iran is ' using ' the situation , " konstantin kosten , an iran expert at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , said .
" however there 's no doubt that any loss of time in discussing the nuclear issue will bring more advantage to iran than to the western negotiators if they are planning to develop an atomic bomb . "
despite the increased rhetoric , experts agree that iran has no intention of sliding into international isolation like north korea over its nuclear ambitions .
the unrest over the election results may buy iran some breathing space but most believe that the current stance against the west is not the beginning of a new downward spiral in relations .
mutual benefits too important to ignore the two-sides are intrinsically linked by a number of geo-political situations in which a certain degree of co-operation and diplomacy is needed .
in these situations it remains the case that iran needs the west and the west needs iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the distrust , the us needs iran and vice versa " iran knows that washington needs its support in afghanistan and iraq , " bauer said .
" with its role in lebanon through hezbollah and gaza through hamas , iran also shows that it can play a very destructive but influential role in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
iran also has an interest in improved political relations and negotiations with the west , in particular with the us .
tehran wants the us to accept the iranian regime - and obama has indicated that he is willing to do so - and accept iran as a regional power .
moreover , iran needs access to western technology . "
kosten agrees that good relations with iran are important to the west and could be mutually beneficial in a number of areas .
" good relations with iran could be useful in any discussions regarding regional stability in the middle east and the gulf region where iran could be a major player , " kosten said .
" also , in the middle east peace process , a more cooperative role for iran may lead to new possibilities for the integration of groups like hamas and hezbollah in a political solution . "
kosten also believes the benefits of good relations with iran could lead to more energy security and economic opportunities .
" there is a major interest in economic incentives and partnerships with the west , at least at the moment , " he said .
" however , this goes against the aim of some groups in iran which prefer cooperation with countries like russia and china . "
iran unlikely to suffer north korea 's fate of isolation bauer believes that the west , while pursuing a policy of sanctions , will never go as far as isolating iran in the manner of north korea and that the us has already made steps to reverse the previous administration 's attempts to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran does n't want to end up a pariah like north korea " the policy of isolating iran pursued under president bush failed completely , " bauer said .
" the strategy of the west needs a complete overhaul and president obama knows this .
as -lrb- national security advisor zbigniew -rrb- brzezinski said , ' sticks and carrots are appropriate tools to deal with a donkey , not with a country . '
" besides , iran is not north korea , " he added .
" iran is a regional power with strong influence and a strong administrative system .
it also has huge natural resources .
russia , china and many other countries have economic interests and do business with iran .
it is hardly possible to effectively isolate such an oil and gas-exporting country . "
konstantin kosten agrees .
" i do n't think iran would become a pariah-state like north korea because iran is much more developed .
if relations with the west become even more strained , then iran would orientate its cooperation towards the east which would be a loss of opportunities . "
so what does the future hold for relations between the west and iran , once the dust of the recent unrest settles ?
what needs to happen before both sides are willing to return to the table to discuss the nuclear stand-off ?
compromise and integration needed " iran has to learn to trust the western negotiators and at the very least open talks with on offer to maybe slightly alter its way of enriching uranium , " kosten said .

in a speech at the formal ceremony in jakarta on wednesday , president susilo bambang yudhoyono praised the police 's performance but fell short of mentioning anything related to recent concerns raised by rights groups over alleged abuses by the police .
last week , london-based rights group amnesty international accused the indonesian police force of torturing detainees . amnesty international says its report is based on interviews with abuse victims , police officers and rights groups in indonesia during the last two years .
it says despite the government ’ s efforts to introduce some reforms in the police sector , the cases of torture and abuses by the police remain high .
it says that during arrests , interrogation and detention , suspects are often subject to ill-treatment such as electric shocks , sexual assault and repeated beatings .
the most vulnerable groups are suspects living in poor communities , women , drug addicts and sex workers .
isabelle arradon , from amnesty international ’ s office in jakarta , explains : “ we ’ ve learned that a lot of abuse is happening .
police officers often try to extort money from suspects .
sometimes they also force suspects to give them information or to confess a crime . ”
no internal accountability on wednesday , the jakarta post daily , one of indonesia ’ s largest english-language newspapers published an editorial entitled : " police terror ” .
citing excerpts from amnesty ’ s report , the article confirmed that most indonesians feel terrified in the presence of the police and that police abuse and torture remain rampant in the country .
amnesty ’ s isabelle arradon questions the accountability of the police force : “ there is not much internal accountability ; the police force is not disciplined enough to handle cases of police abuse and brutality .
there are several commissions like kompolnas -lrb- national police commission -rrb- and komnas ham -lrb- the national human rights commission -rrb- who can accept complains but they don ’ t have the authority to do investigations . ”
following amnesty ’ s criticisms , indonesia ’ s national police chief recognised that there were some cases of abuse , though he insisted that the report was not entirely true .
he also passed a decree to implement human rights standards in daily policing and assured the public that the police were working towards improvement .
positive development jim della-giacoma of the international crisis group in jakarta sees this all as a positive development for a police force which was part of the military until 1999 .
“ i was on the streets of jakarta a decade ago reporting on the indonesia police in my previous work as a journalist and i couldn ’ t have imagined the chief of police getting up and talking about human rights , as he did last week .
in fact he also held up the amnesty report and acknowledged that there was a lot of criticism in the report and that they needed to do a lot of work . ”
boosting internal mechanism amnesty has urged the authorities to establish an independent watchdog to investigate the allegations and bring the guilty to justice .
jim della-giacoma supports the calls : “ i think amnesty has really made a solid recommendation for a much stronger independent body to investigate reports .
but they at the same time acknowledge that there should be many layers of investigation and police should have at least primary responsibility for enforcing their own rules regarding human rights standards and enforcing their own discipline . ”
with presidential elections due next week and amid predictions that president susilo bambang yudhoyono is running ahead of his rivals in the run-up to the polls , rights activists have been urging the yudhoyuno administration to look into the matter more seriously and guarantee substantial reforms .

the price will have dropped by around twenty percent . the french government has slashed value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- for restaurant and cafe owners from over 19 percent to just 5.5 percent .
industry bodies say the move will be good for both the consumer and the employment market .
both the big restaurant chains and many smaller restaurants have said they will pass on the tax cut to their customers .
that means an average espresso will now cost just 1 euro -lrb- $ 1.40 -rrb- , a drop of 20 euro cents .
lowering prices is not obligatory under the new measure , but industry associations are tipping that more than 80 percent of businesses will adjust their menus in the customer 's favor .
france has campaigned for seven years to get the go-ahead from european union partners to lower the value-added tax which restaurateurs and cafe owners have to pay .
former french president jacques chirac had pushed hard for the cut but was blocked by eu partners including germany .
germany was afraid of losing out in cross-border trade to french restaurants and was reluctant to match the proposed cuts because of budget ramifications .
the french state will reportedly lose 2.38 billion euros a year in tax revenue , but the scheme is meant to stimulate the economy from the bottom up .

the price will have dropped by around twenty percent . the french government has slashed value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- for restaurant and cafe owners from over 19 percent to just 5.5 percent .
industry bodies say the move will be good for both the consumer and the employment market .
both the big restaurant chains and many smaller restaurants have said they will pass on the tax cut to their customers .
that means an average espresso will now cost just 1 euro -lrb- $ 1.40 -rrb- , a drop of 20 euro cents .
lowering prices is not obligatory under the new measure , but industry associations are tipping that more than 80 percent of businesses will adjust their menus in the customer 's favor .
france has campaigned for seven years to get the go-ahead from european union partners to lower the value-added tax which restaurateurs and cafe owners have to pay .
former french president jacques chirac had pushed hard for the cut but was blocked by eu partners including germany .
germany was afraid of losing out in cross-border trade to french restaurants and was reluctant to match the proposed cuts because of budget ramifications .
the french state will reportedly lose 2.38 billion euros a year in tax revenue , but the scheme is meant to stimulate the economy from the bottom up .
as part of the deal , restaurant proprietors agreed to step up hiring and create 40,000 new jobs over the next two years , including 20,000 apprentice positions. ch / reuters / afp editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the fact is that of all the 28 nato member states there will always be some that will find excuses for idleness . " craddock also said the restricted mandate of germany 's armed forces serving in afghanistan had " extremely limited the flexibility of the commanders " there . " this concerns not only the explained concessions .
in addition there are also some restrictions -lrb- on troops -rrb- that we only learn about when we ask somebody for help , " he told the paper .
" they call home and then come back and say , ' we are not allowed to do this . " ' war or no war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : craddock said restrictions on german troops limits the mission 's effectiveness the role of the german armed forces in afghanistan has been the subject of tensions here for over two years , with the german government so far insisting their troops are not involved in war , but that they are there for peacekeeping and development purposes . but craddock said the debate over the bundeswehr 's status in afghanistan was superfluous . " the politicians can call it whatever they like - i am a military man and for me it is a war , " he said .
" i think if you ask german soldiers they would call it the same thing . " germany has the third-largest contingent in the nato-led force in afghanistan , with about 3,380 troops . despite us pressure to contribute troops to the more violent southern provinces where members of nato and us soldiers have been fighting the taliban since the 2001 invasion that ousted the group from power , the german army has focused on the regional command north . handover ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stavridis said quelling the afghan insurgency would take more than bullets craddock made the comments tuesday , the day he formally handed over his post to admiral james stavridis , who assumes the role as the head of the us european command -lrb- eucom -rrb- .
the ceremony was held at eucom headquarters in the southwestern german city of stuttgart . stavridis said counter-insurgency elements in afghanistan such as the taliban could be pacified with renewed commitment from nato states . " i am very much interested in finding additional and alternative ways the allies can contribute -lrb- to the war effort -rrb- , " stavridis said . " we must pursue a policy in afghanistan that moves the defense and security of the afghan people to the center of our efforts , " he added . dfm / afp / ap editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tough new measures come into force on in an attempt to break the nicotine habit of greece , europe 's heaviest smoking nation .
but there are serious doubts that the new law will have much impact . greece lags behind the rest of europe in terms of smoking legislation and attitudes .
the new campaign , banning smoking in public places as of wednesday , is designed in part to reduce the heavy burden on government finances . each year , 20,000 greeks die from tobacco related illnesses and the cost in terms of health care amounts to 2.14 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- . some 40 percent of all greeks smoke and 60 percent of the population is exposed to passive smoking in the workplace . " the moment of truth has arrived , " said health minister dimitris avromopoulos .
" this ban aims to bring a change that will revolutionize people 's outlook .
greek society is mature nowadays and ready for the ban . " under the new rules , smoking will be banned in hospitals , schools , vehicles and all public spaces .
billboards advertising cigarettes will be banned . small cafes and restaurants with premises measuring less than 70 square meters can choose either to be tobacco free or to admit smoking only patrons .
bigger establishments can have clearly identified and ventilated smoking areas . in order to give teeth to the new regulations , smokers who break the law can be fined up to 500 euros .
on the first offence , businesses will be fined 1,000 euros .
repeat offenders will face even bigger fines , and ultimately on the fourth violation could risk losing their license . bad for business ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens nightlife wo n't be the same with the smoking ban in a country that has grown its own tobacco for centuries and seems to exist within a fog of nicotine fumes , many regard the new law as an infringement of civil liberties . " it 's going to be bad for business to start with , especially with the greeks because everybody smokes , " said restaurant manager lisa panti as she lit a cigarette outside the gondola in corfu 's old town .
" and if they ca n't smoke in the restaurant they are n't going to come out .
it 's really bad , it 's stupid . " panti said in terms of income , the new law is going to be bad for business everywhere .
but pericles katsaros at the rival rex restaurant 100 meters along the same pedestrian street disagreed . " look it 's really good for restaurants , because if you stop smoking in closed rooms , it does n't smell bad and customers can enjoy their food , " katsaros said . difficulties enforcing the law the health ministry has promised that its new anti-smoking task force will swoop on premises within twenty minutes of receiving a complaint about cigarettes .
but the head of the unit responsible for implementing the new rules has promised that it will be done gradually . on paper , it would appear that greece 's measures look certain to succeed .
but this is a country with a long tradition of defiance .
parliament is adept at introducing new legislation , but enforcement in many areas is an institutionalized failure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will greeks snub out their smokes the way they 're told ?

why should smoking be any different ? there may be occasional blitzes by the authorities , but unless the rules are firmly and consistently applied , they are at risk of failing . " i really think smoking is a bad habit , " said anastasia pettas from the island of zakynthos .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 01.07.2009 current tensions between iran , west cloud mutually beneficial relationship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear ambitions remain undimmed behind the unrest some experts claim iran is using the turmoil over its disputed presidential election to stall on a return to nuclear negotiations with the west .
others say the two sides need each other and will eventually reopen talks . the violent repercussions of iran 's disputed presidential election have somewhat eclipsed the on-going stalemate over tehran 's nuclear program recently .
but instead of being two separate issues in the islamic republic , some analysts believe that iran 's increasingly antagonizing approach to the west over the pro-opposition demonstrations has more to do with the atomic stand-off than first appears .
some observers say that the heightened tensions between iran and the west are allowing tehran to deflect demands to re-start talks on its nuclear program .
ratcheting up the animosity by arresting local staff at the british embassy and challenging the us over apparent broken promises over a new dialogue , iranian authorities have created an atmosphere in which nuclear talks are highly unlikely to resume .
it was assumed that a peaceful , undisputed election would have led to a return to western pressure on iran to restart nuclear negotiations .
but the subsequent eruption of violent protests and the hard-line , authoritarian crackdown has presented the west with a new dilemma .
it has been suggested that some of iran 's political elite have fomented the idea that countries like britain and the us are behind the uprising , driving another wedge into the divide over tehran 's nuclear ambitions .
this in turn has led some analysts to suggest that some factions in the iranian government were happy to stir up a crisis specifically for this purpose .
if the west could not be trusted to stay out of iranian domestic politics , then it could not be trusted in negotiations over uranium enrichment .
iran buying time through unrest ?
but not all experts believe that this is an official policy promoted by the upper echelons of iran 's political hierarchy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayatollah khamenei is unlikely to have approved any plan " it might be the case that some radical fractions within the iranian establishment have such a plan , " michael bauer , a middle east expert at the center for applied policy research in munich , told deutsche welle .
" unpredictability is an important characteristic and even strategic tool of iranian foreign policy .
this makes its behavior hard to predict .
however , i do n't think this position is held by the supreme leader ali khamenei and other important players in iran 's political system . "
" i would not say that iran is ' using ' the situation , " konstantin kosten , an iran expert at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , said .
" however there 's no doubt that any loss of time in discussing the nuclear issue will bring more advantage to iran than to the western negotiators if they are planning to develop an atomic bomb . "
despite the increased rhetoric , experts agree that iran has no intention of sliding into international isolation like north korea over its nuclear ambitions .
the unrest over the election results may buy iran some breathing space but most believe that the current stance against the west is not the beginning of a new downward spiral in relations .
mutual benefits too important to ignore the two-sides are intrinsically linked by a number of geo-political situations in which a certain degree of co-operation and diplomacy is needed .
in these situations it remains the case that iran needs the west and the west needs iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the distrust , the us needs iran and vice versa " iran knows that washington needs its support in afghanistan and iraq , " bauer said .
" with its role in lebanon through hezbollah and gaza through hamas , iran also shows that it can play a very destructive but influential role in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
iran also has an interest in improved political relations and negotiations with the west , in particular with the us .
tehran wants the us to accept the iranian regime - and obama has indicated that he is willing to do so - and accept iran as a regional power .
moreover , iran needs access to western technology . "
kosten agrees that good relations with iran are important to the west and could be mutually beneficial in a number of areas .
" good relations with iran could be useful in any discussions regarding regional stability in the middle east and the gulf region where iran could be a major player , " kosten said .
" also , in the middle east peace process , a more cooperative role for iran may lead to new possibilities for the integration of groups like hamas and hezbollah in a political solution . "
kosten also believes the benefits of good relations with iran could lead to more energy security and economic opportunities .
" there is a major interest in economic incentives and partnerships with the west , at least at the moment , " he said .
" however , this goes against the aim of some groups in iran which prefer cooperation with countries like russia and china . "
iran unlikely to suffer north korea 's fate of isolation bauer believes that the west , while pursuing a policy of sanctions , will never go as far as isolating iran in the manner of north korea and that the us has already made steps to reverse the previous administration 's attempts to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran does n't want to end up a pariah like north korea " the policy of isolating iran pursued under president bush failed completely , " bauer said .
" the strategy of the west needs a complete overhaul and president obama knows this .
as -lrb- national security advisor zbigniew -rrb- brzezinski said , ' sticks and carrots are appropriate tools to deal with a donkey , not with a country . '
" besides , iran is not north korea , " he added .
" iran is a regional power with strong influence and a strong administrative system .
it also has huge natural resources .
russia , china and many other countries have economic interests and do business with iran .
it is hardly possible to effectively isolate such an oil and gas-exporting country . "
konstantin kosten agrees .
" i do n't think iran would become a pariah-state like north korea because iran is much more developed .
if relations with the west become even more strained , then iran would orientate its cooperation towards the east which would be a loss of opportunities . "
so what does the future hold for relations between the west and iran , once the dust of the recent unrest settles ?
what needs to happen before both sides are willing to return to the table to discuss the nuclear stand-off ?
compromise and integration needed " iran has to learn to trust the western negotiators and at the very least open talks with on offer to maybe slightly alter its way of enriching uranium , " kosten said .
" the west has to find regulations and certain approaches to the discussion which allow the iranians to save face while also encouraging them to foster transparency in their civilian enriching program . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran needs assurances and the west needs to see action " regarding the nuclear program , a compromise could be western acceptance of the full -lrb- uranium enrichment -rrb- cycle in exchange for iranian ratification of the additional protocol to the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and iranian cooperation with the iaea , ensuring full transparency of the iranian nuclear program and ensuring verification of its civilian nature , " michael bauer said .
" this will be difficult to achieve and it would require a lot of confidence-building measures .
" to ensure the sustainability of any compromise with iran , it is crucial to include all regional actors , in particular the arab gulf states , most importantly saudi arabia , " he concluded .
" at the end , the rules of the game in the middle east need to be changed from a zero-sum game to a cooperative understanding of security .
a format like a sub-regional system for cooperation and security is needed . "

others say the two sides need each other and will eventually reopen talks . the violent repercussions of iran 's disputed presidential election have somewhat eclipsed the on-going stalemate over tehran 's nuclear program recently .
but instead of being two separate issues in the islamic republic , some analysts believe that iran 's increasingly antagonizing approach to the west over the pro-opposition demonstrations has more to do with the atomic stand-off than first appears .
some observers say that the heightened tensions between iran and the west are allowing tehran to deflect demands to re-start talks on its nuclear program .
ratcheting up the animosity by arresting local staff at the british embassy and challenging the us over apparent broken promises over a new dialogue , iranian authorities have created an atmosphere in which nuclear talks are highly unlikely to resume .
it was assumed that a peaceful , undisputed election would have led to a return to western pressure on iran to restart nuclear negotiations .
but the subsequent eruption of violent protests and the hard-line , authoritarian crackdown has presented the west with a new dilemma .
it has been suggested that some of iran 's political elite have fomented the idea that countries like britain and the us are behind the uprising , driving another wedge into the divide over tehran 's nuclear ambitions .
this in turn has led some analysts to suggest that some factions in the iranian government were happy to stir up a crisis specifically for this purpose .
if the west could not be trusted to stay out of iranian domestic politics , then it could not be trusted in negotiations over uranium enrichment .
iran buying time through unrest ?
but not all experts believe that this is an official policy promoted by the upper echelons of iran 's political hierarchy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayatollah khamenei is unlikely to have approved any plan " it might be the case that some radical fractions within the iranian establishment have such a plan , " michael bauer , a middle east expert at the center for applied policy research in munich , told deutsche welle .
" unpredictability is an important characteristic and even strategic tool of iranian foreign policy .
this makes its behavior hard to predict .
however , i do n't think this position is held by the supreme leader ali khamenei and other important players in iran 's political system . "
" i would not say that iran is ' using ' the situation , " konstantin kosten , an iran expert at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , said .
" however there 's no doubt that any loss of time in discussing the nuclear issue will bring more advantage to iran than to the western negotiators if they are planning to develop an atomic bomb . "
despite the increased rhetoric , experts agree that iran has no intention of sliding into international isolation like north korea over its nuclear ambitions .
the unrest over the election results may buy iran some breathing space but most believe that the current stance against the west is not the beginning of a new downward spiral in relations .
mutual benefits too important to ignore the two-sides are intrinsically linked by a number of geo-political situations in which a certain degree of co-operation and diplomacy is needed .
in these situations it remains the case that iran needs the west and the west needs iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the distrust , the us needs iran and vice versa " iran knows that washington needs its support in afghanistan and iraq , " bauer said .

iran unlikely to suffer north korea 's fate of isolation bauer believes that the west , while pursuing a policy of sanctions , will never go as far as isolating iran in the manner of north korea and that the us has already made steps to reverse the previous administration 's attempts to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran does n't want to end up a pariah like north korea " the policy of isolating iran pursued under president bush failed completely , " bauer said .
" the strategy of the west needs a complete overhaul and president obama knows this .
as -lrb- national security advisor zbigniew -rrb- brzezinski said , ' sticks and carrots are appropriate tools to deal with a donkey , not with a country . '
" besides , iran is not north korea , " he added .
" iran is a regional power with strong influence and a strong administrative system .
it also has huge natural resources .
russia , china and many other countries have economic interests and do business with iran .
it is hardly possible to effectively isolate such an oil and gas-exporting country . "
konstantin kosten agrees .
" i do n't think iran would become a pariah-state like north korea because iran is much more developed .
if relations with the west become even more strained , then iran would orientate its cooperation towards the east which would be a loss of opportunities . "
so what does the future hold for relations between the west and iran , once the dust of the recent unrest settles ?
what needs to happen before both sides are willing to return to the table to discuss the nuclear stand-off ?
compromise and integration needed " iran has to learn to trust the western negotiators and at the very least open talks with on offer to maybe slightly alter its way of enriching uranium , " kosten said .
" the west has to find regulations and certain approaches to the discussion which allow the iranians to save face while also encouraging them to foster transparency in their civilian enriching program . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran needs assurances and the west needs to see action " regarding the nuclear program , a compromise could be western acceptance of the full -lrb- uranium enrichment -rrb- cycle in exchange for iranian ratification of the additional protocol to the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and iranian cooperation with the iaea , ensuring full transparency of the iranian nuclear program and ensuring verification of its civilian nature , " michael bauer said .
" this will be difficult to achieve and it would require a lot of confidence-building measures .
" to ensure the sustainability of any compromise with iran , it is crucial to include all regional actors , in particular the arab gulf states , most importantly saudi arabia , " he concluded .
" at the end , the rules of the game in the middle east need to be changed from a zero-sum game to a cooperative understanding of security .
a format like a sub-regional system for cooperation and security is needed . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 01.07.2009 current tensions between iran , west cloud mutually beneficial relationship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear ambitions remain undimmed behind the unrest some experts claim iran is using the turmoil over its disputed presidential election to stall on a return to nuclear negotiations with the west .
others say the two sides need each other and will eventually reopen talks . the violent repercussions of iran 's disputed presidential election have somewhat eclipsed the on-going stalemate over tehran 's nuclear program recently .
but instead of being two separate issues in the islamic republic , some analysts believe that iran 's increasingly antagonizing approach to the west over the pro-opposition demonstrations has more to do with the atomic stand-off than first appears .
some observers say that the heightened tensions between iran and the west are allowing tehran to deflect demands to re-start talks on its nuclear program .
ratcheting up the animosity by arresting local staff at the british embassy and challenging the us over apparent broken promises over a new dialogue , iranian authorities have created an atmosphere in which nuclear talks are highly unlikely to resume .
it was assumed that a peaceful , undisputed election would have led to a return to western pressure on iran to restart nuclear negotiations .
but the subsequent eruption of violent protests and the hard-line , authoritarian crackdown has presented the west with a new dilemma .
it has been suggested that some of iran 's political elite have fomented the idea that countries like britain and the us are behind the uprising , driving another wedge into the divide over tehran 's nuclear ambitions .
this in turn has led some analysts to suggest that some factions in the iranian government were happy to stir up a crisis specifically for this purpose .
if the west could not be trusted to stay out of iranian domestic politics , then it could not be trusted in negotiations over uranium enrichment .
iran buying time through unrest ?
but not all experts believe that this is an official policy promoted by the upper echelons of iran 's political hierarchy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayatollah khamenei is unlikely to have approved any plan " it might be the case that some radical fractions within the iranian establishment have such a plan , " michael bauer , a middle east expert at the center for applied policy research in munich , told deutsche welle .
" unpredictability is an important characteristic and even strategic tool of iranian foreign policy .
this makes its behavior hard to predict .
however , i do n't think this position is held by the supreme leader ali khamenei and other important players in iran 's political system . "
" i would not say that iran is ' using ' the situation , " konstantin kosten , an iran expert at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , said .
" however there 's no doubt that any loss of time in discussing the nuclear issue will bring more advantage to iran than to the western negotiators if they are planning to develop an atomic bomb . "
despite the increased rhetoric , experts agree that iran has no intention of sliding into international isolation like north korea over its nuclear ambitions .
the unrest over the election results may buy iran some breathing space but most believe that the current stance against the west is not the beginning of a new downward spiral in relations .
mutual benefits too important to ignore the two-sides are intrinsically linked by a number of geo-political situations in which a certain degree of co-operation and diplomacy is needed .
in these situations it remains the case that iran needs the west and the west needs iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the distrust , the us needs iran and vice versa " iran knows that washington needs its support in afghanistan and iraq , " bauer said .
" with its role in lebanon through hezbollah and gaza through hamas , iran also shows that it can play a very destructive but influential role in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
iran also has an interest in improved political relations and negotiations with the west , in particular with the us .
tehran wants the us to accept the iranian regime - and obama has indicated that he is willing to do so - and accept iran as a regional power .
moreover , iran needs access to western technology . "
kosten agrees that good relations with iran are important to the west and could be mutually beneficial in a number of areas .
" good relations with iran could be useful in any discussions regarding regional stability in the middle east and the gulf region where iran could be a major player , " kosten said .
" also , in the middle east peace process , a more cooperative role for iran may lead to new possibilities for the integration of groups like hamas and hezbollah in a political solution . "
kosten also believes the benefits of good relations with iran could lead to more energy security and economic opportunities .
" there is a major interest in economic incentives and partnerships with the west , at least at the moment , " he said .
" however , this goes against the aim of some groups in iran which prefer cooperation with countries like russia and china . "

" the job of these leaders is to find the best options possible for the people , " he said .
" if their citizens do n't understand or believe this then more work should be done to convince them . " governments in europe need to take a greater share of responsibility , " he added .
" the fact is that of all the 28 nato member states there will always be some that will find excuses for idleness . " craddock also said the restricted mandate of germany 's armed forces serving in afghanistan had " extremely limited the flexibility of the commanders " there . " this concerns not only the explained concessions .
in addition there are also some restrictions -lrb- on troops -rrb- that we only learn about when we ask somebody for help , " he told the paper .
" they call home and then come back and say , ' we are not allowed to do this . " ' war or no war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : craddock said restrictions on german troops limits the mission 's effectiveness the role of the german armed forces in afghanistan has been the subject of tensions here for over two years , with the german government so far insisting their troops are not involved in war , but that they are there for peacekeeping and development purposes . but craddock said the debate over the bundeswehr 's status in afghanistan was superfluous . " the politicians can call it whatever they like - i am a military man and for me it is a war , " he said .
" i think if you ask german soldiers they would call it the same thing . " germany has the third-largest contingent in the nato-led force in afghanistan , with about 3,380 troops . despite us pressure to contribute troops to the more violent southern provinces where members of nato and us soldiers have been fighting the taliban since the 2001 invasion that ousted the group from power , the german army has focused on the regional command north . handover ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stavridis said quelling the afghan insurgency would take more than bullets craddock made the comments tuesday , the day he formally handed over his post to admiral james stavridis , who assumes the role as the head of the us european command -lrb- eucom -rrb- .
the ceremony was held at eucom headquarters in the southwestern german city of stuttgart . stavridis said counter-insurgency elements in afghanistan such as the taliban could be pacified with renewed commitment from nato states . " i am very much interested in finding additional and alternative ways the allies can contribute -lrb- to the war effort -rrb- , " stavridis said . " we must pursue a policy in afghanistan that moves the defense and security of the afghan people to the center of our efforts , " he added . dfm / afp / ap editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the job of these leaders is to find the best options possible for the people , " he said .
" if their citizens do n't understand or believe this then more work should be done to convince them . " governments in europe need to take a greater share of responsibility , " he added .
" the fact is that of all the 28 nato member states there will always be some that will find excuses for idleness . " craddock also said the restricted mandate of germany 's armed forces serving in afghanistan had " extremely limited the flexibility of the commanders " there . " this concerns not only the explained concessions .
in addition there are also some restrictions -lrb- on troops -rrb- that we only learn about when we ask somebody for help , " he told the paper .
" they call home and then come back and say , ' we are not allowed to do this . " ' war or no war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : craddock said restrictions on german troops limits the mission 's effectiveness the role of the german armed forces in afghanistan has been the subject of tensions here for over two years , with the german government so far insisting their troops are not involved in war , but that they are there for peacekeeping and development purposes . but craddock said the debate over the bundeswehr 's status in afghanistan was superfluous . " the politicians can call it whatever they like - i am a military man and for me it is a war , " he said .
" i think if you ask german soldiers they would call it the same thing . " germany has the third-largest contingent in the nato-led force in afghanistan , with about 3,380 troops . despite us pressure to contribute troops to the more violent southern provinces where members of nato and us soldiers have been fighting the taliban since the 2001 invasion that ousted the group from power , the german army has focused on the regional command north . handover ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stavridis said quelling the afghan insurgency would take more than bullets craddock made the comments tuesday , the day he formally handed over his post to admiral james stavridis , who assumes the role as the head of the us european command -lrb- eucom -rrb- .
the ceremony was held at eucom headquarters in the southwestern german city of stuttgart . stavridis said counter-insurgency elements in afghanistan such as the taliban could be pacified with renewed commitment from nato states . " i am very much interested in finding additional and alternative ways the allies can contribute -lrb- to the war effort -rrb- , " stavridis said . " we must pursue a policy in afghanistan that moves the defense and security of the afghan people to the center of our efforts , " he added . dfm / afp / ap editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the recognition that this country is today a country of immigration and will continue to be in the foreseeable future has made it possible for all involved to rededicate themselves to addressing the underlying problems that come with a multi-racial , multi-cultural , multi-ethnic , multi-religious society , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muigai was in germany for 10 days on a fact- finding trip germany has come a long way since former chancellor helmut kohl 's dogged insistence that it was not a country of immigration , muigai added .
seven years ago the conservative christian democratic union rephrased its former leader 's stance , saying that germany was not a country of immigration in the sense that it had not been historically formed by immigrants . with germany home to around 19 percent first and second generation immigrants , the country has acknowledged that it has attracted large numbers of immigrants and will continue to do so . minorities missing from public life muigai , who was the first un racism special rapporteur to visit germany in the last 12 years , said germany needed to do more to integrate more ethnic minorities into its political system , the police and its courts .
people with a migrant background were , according to muigai underrepresented in public life . " i think that this great country needs to turn its attention to the problems of daily racism and discrimination ; that is the racism and discrimination to be found in daily life in schools , public places , in housing , in employment etcetera , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem-özdemir is one of only a few turkish-german public figures .
last november , the greens became the first major party to elect a turkish-german as leader , cem ozdemir , but ethnic minorities are generally a rarity in german politics , making up fewer than 15 national representatives . muigai , who was in germany under an open invitation as special rapporteur , also said that due to the historical experience of germany with nazism , there was a " tendency to equate racism with extremist politics . "
while it was essential for the state and society to remain vigilant at all times , he said a greater problem remained discrimination within society . " much remains to be done " " i received representations that suggested that the education system in germany is not responding to the special needs of migrant communities with the sensitivity that the circumstances require , " muigai said . " the problems in the education system are translating into problems in the employment system and the two together are enforcing each other to create an inequality that may probably not be intended but that is the outcome , " he added . muigai 's comments were offset by praise for the country in its efforts to tackle the issues of discrimination , singling out the cities stuttgart and nuremberg for their good practices in the fight against racism .
muigai also made a plea to the media , calling on them to help stop the spread of racial stereotypes . in response to a question over the continued success of germany 's far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , muigai said that poverty and lack of opportunity led people to turn to right-wing politics , adding that while constitutional legal mechanisms should be used to keep the party in check , its weak political showing was a testament to the lack of real public support . there are regular calls for a ban on germany 's biggest far-right party , the npd , which has no seats in the bundestag national parliament , although it does have representatives in two of germany 's powerful regional assemblies . muigai 's full report will be presented to the council of human rights in 2010 and will also focus on the situation of muslims in germany following the increase in security measures since sept .

" the recognition that this country is today a country of immigration and will continue to be in the foreseeable future has made it possible for all involved to rededicate themselves to addressing the underlying problems that come with a multi-racial , multi-cultural , multi-ethnic , multi-religious society , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muigai was in germany for 10 days on a fact- finding trip germany has come a long way since former chancellor helmut kohl 's dogged insistence that it was not a country of immigration , muigai added .
seven years ago the conservative christian democratic union rephrased its former leader 's stance , saying that germany was not a country of immigration in the sense that it had not been historically formed by immigrants . with germany home to around 19 percent first and second generation immigrants , the country has acknowledged that it has attracted large numbers of immigrants and will continue to do so . minorities missing from public life muigai , who was the first un racism special rapporteur to visit germany in the last 12 years , said germany needed to do more to integrate more ethnic minorities into its political system , the police and its courts .
people with a migrant background were , according to muigai underrepresented in public life . " i think that this great country needs to turn its attention to the problems of daily racism and discrimination ; that is the racism and discrimination to be found in daily life in schools , public places , in housing , in employment etcetera , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem-özdemir is one of only a few turkish-german public figures .
last november , the greens became the first major party to elect a turkish-german as leader , cem ozdemir , but ethnic minorities are generally a rarity in german politics , making up fewer than 15 national representatives . muigai , who was in germany under an open invitation as special rapporteur , also said that due to the historical experience of germany with nazism , there was a " tendency to equate racism with extremist politics . "
while it was essential for the state and society to remain vigilant at all times , he said a greater problem remained discrimination within society . " much remains to be done " " i received representations that suggested that the education system in germany is not responding to the special needs of migrant communities with the sensitivity that the circumstances require , " muigai said . " the problems in the education system are translating into problems in the employment system and the two together are enforcing each other to create an inequality that may probably not be intended but that is the outcome , " he added . muigai 's comments were offset by praise for the country in its efforts to tackle the issues of discrimination , singling out the cities stuttgart and nuremberg for their good practices in the fight against racism .
muigai also made a plea to the media , calling on them to help stop the spread of racial stereotypes . in response to a question over the continued success of germany 's far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , muigai said that poverty and lack of opportunity led people to turn to right-wing politics , adding that while constitutional legal mechanisms should be used to keep the party in check , its weak political showing was a testament to the lack of real public support . there are regular calls for a ban on germany 's biggest far-right party , the npd , which has no seats in the bundestag national parliament , although it does have representatives in two of germany 's powerful regional assemblies . muigai 's full report will be presented to the council of human rights in 2010 and will also focus on the situation of muslims in germany following the increase in security measures since sept .

" i think that this great country needs to turn its attention to the problems of daily racism and discrimination ; that is the racism and discrimination to be found in daily life in schools , public places , in housing , in employment etcetera , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem-özdemir is one of only a few turkish-german public figures .
last november , the greens became the first major party to elect a turkish-german as leader , cem ozdemir , but ethnic minorities are generally a rarity in german politics , making up fewer than 15 national representatives . muigai , who was in germany under an open invitation as special rapporteur , also said that due to the historical experience of germany with nazism , there was a " tendency to equate racism with extremist politics . "
while it was essential for the state and society to remain vigilant at all times , he said a greater problem remained discrimination within society . " much remains to be done " " i received representations that suggested that the education system in germany is not responding to the special needs of migrant communities with the sensitivity that the circumstances require , " muigai said . " the problems in the education system are translating into problems in the employment system and the two together are enforcing each other to create an inequality that may probably not be intended but that is the outcome , " he added . muigai 's comments were offset by praise for the country in its efforts to tackle the issues of discrimination , singling out the cities stuttgart and nuremberg for their good practices in the fight against racism .
muigai also made a plea to the media , calling on them to help stop the spread of racial stereotypes . in response to a question over the continued success of germany 's far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , muigai said that poverty and lack of opportunity led people to turn to right-wing politics , adding that while constitutional legal mechanisms should be used to keep the party in check , its weak political showing was a testament to the lack of real public support . there are regular calls for a ban on germany 's biggest far-right party , the npd , which has no seats in the bundestag national parliament , although it does have representatives in two of germany 's powerful regional assemblies . muigai 's full report will be presented to the council of human rights in 2010 and will also focus on the situation of muslims in germany following the increase in security measures since sept .

can they make it stick this time ? it 's greece 's third try at kicking the habit , but critics fear loopholes in the legislation - and its unpopularity - mean it could prove as ineffective as previous attempts .
more than 40 percent of greece 's population smokes , with six out of ten being exposed to passive smoke in their workplaces .
around 20,000 greeks die a year from tobacco-related ailments , according to the country 's health minister , dimitris avramopoulos .
many european union countries have laws to limit exposure to second-hand , or passive , smoking .
britain and ireland have the strictest rules , where smoking is banned in enclosed public places , public transport and workplaces , as well as restaurants and bars .

" each and every european should be entitled to full protection from tobacco smoke , " eu health commissioner androulla vassiliou told a press conference on tuesday .
she said in countries with looser regulations on smoking , nearly one in five people were exposed to tobacco smoke in the workplace .
according to vassiliou , an estimated 19,000 non-smokers in the eu died due to second-hand smoke at home and in workplaces in 2002 . each member state decides the level of its own smoking restrictions .
in belgium , for example , smoking is allowed in restaurants only in separate rooms where no food is served , and smoking is banned in all enclosed workplaces .
only 10 member states - britain , ireland , italy , malta , sweden , latvia , finland , slovenia , france and the netherlands - have comprehensive anti-smoking laws , vassiliou said .

" each and every european should be entitled to full protection from tobacco smoke , " eu health commissioner androulla vassiliou told a press conference on tuesday .
she said in countries with looser regulations on smoking , nearly one in five people were exposed to tobacco smoke in the workplace .
according to vassiliou , an estimated 19,000 non-smokers in the eu died due to second-hand smoke at home and in workplaces in 2002 . each member state decides the level of its own smoking restrictions .
in belgium , for example , smoking is allowed in restaurants only in separate rooms where no food is served , and smoking is banned in all enclosed workplaces .
only 10 member states - britain , ireland , italy , malta , sweden , latvia , finland , slovenia , france and the netherlands - have comprehensive anti-smoking laws , vassiliou said .

lowering prices is not obligatory under the new measure , but industry associations are tipping that more than 80 percent of businesses will adjust their menus in the customer 's favor .
france has campaigned for seven years to get the go-ahead from european union partners to lower the value-added tax which restaurateurs and cafe owners have to pay .
former french president jacques chirac had pushed hard for the cut but was blocked by eu partners including germany .

in a speech at the formal ceremony in jakarta on wednesday , president susilo bambang yudhoyono praised the police 's performance but fell short of mentioning anything related to recent concerns raised by rights groups over alleged abuses by the police .
last week , london-based rights group amnesty international accused the indonesian police force of torturing detainees . amnesty international says its report is based on interviews with abuse victims , police officers and rights groups in indonesia during the last two years .
it says despite the government ’ s efforts to introduce some reforms in the police sector , the cases of torture and abuses by the police remain high .
it says that during arrests , interrogation and detention , suspects are often subject to ill-treatment such as electric shocks , sexual assault and repeated beatings .
the most vulnerable groups are suspects living in poor communities , women , drug addicts and sex workers .
isabelle arradon , from amnesty international ’ s office in jakarta , explains : “ we ’ ve learned that a lot of abuse is happening .
police officers often try to extort money from suspects .
sometimes they also force suspects to give them information or to confess a crime . ”
no internal accountability on wednesday , the jakarta post daily , one of indonesia ’ s largest english-language newspapers published an editorial entitled : " police terror ” .
citing excerpts from amnesty ’ s report , the article confirmed that most indonesians feel terrified in the presence of the police and that police abuse and torture remain rampant in the country .
amnesty ’ s isabelle arradon questions the accountability of the police force : “ there is not much internal accountability ; the police force is not disciplined enough to handle cases of police abuse and brutality .
there are several commissions like kompolnas -lrb- national police commission -rrb- and komnas ham -lrb- the national human rights commission -rrb- who can accept complains but they don ’ t have the authority to do investigations . ”
following amnesty ’ s criticisms , indonesia ’ s national police chief recognised that there were some cases of abuse , though he insisted that the report was not entirely true .
he also passed a decree to implement human rights standards in daily policing and assured the public that the police were working towards improvement .
positive development jim della-giacoma of the international crisis group in jakarta sees this all as a positive development for a police force which was part of the military until 1999 .
“ i was on the streets of jakarta a decade ago reporting on the indonesia police in my previous work as a journalist and i couldn ’ t have imagined the chief of police getting up and talking about human rights , as he did last week .
in fact he also held up the amnesty report and acknowledged that there was a lot of criticism in the report and that they needed to do a lot of work . ”
boosting internal mechanism amnesty has urged the authorities to establish an independent watchdog to investigate the allegations and bring the guilty to justice .
jim della-giacoma supports the calls : “ i think amnesty has really made a solid recommendation for a much stronger independent body to investigate reports .
but they at the same time acknowledge that there should be many layers of investigation and police should have at least primary responsibility for enforcing their own rules regarding human rights standards and enforcing their own discipline . ”
with presidential elections due next week and amid predictions that president susilo bambang yudhoyono is running ahead of his rivals in the run-up to the polls , rights activists have been urging the yudhoyuno administration to look into the matter more seriously and guarantee substantial reforms .

the win for haas was a repeat of his grass court victory over the serb three weeks ago in halle . german tennis star tommy haas moves into the penultimate round at wimbledon in convincing style . tommy haas of germany has reached the semi-finals at wimbledon after stunning fourth seed novak djokovic .
the win for haas was a repeat of his grass court victory over the serb three weeks ago in halle . haas will now face five-time wimbledon champion roger federer in the last four as he bids to reach a grand slam final for the first time in his 13-year career . djokovic squandered three set points in the second set and seemed to have trouble concentrating . " i just could n't relax , especially at five-all in the first two sets , " he said .
" i was playing very defensively and making some unforced errors . " djokovic added that haas deserved to win the match . " he was serving very well ... but i was returning really badly , " he said .
" it was a real disaster , so he deserved to win . " haas , 31 , is the oldest man left in the all england club tournament , but the 24th seed showed he can still burn up the lawn at the highest level with a superb display of grass court tennis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : djokovic squandered three set points the german sent djokovic packing in four sets - 7-5 , 7-6 -lrb- 8-6 -rrb- , 4-6 , 6-3 - with his strong serve , and some sublime serve and volley play . if haas can now find the right stuff to shock federer , he would be one win away from becoming the oldest wimbledon champion since arthur ashe in 1975 , and join the likes of steffi graf , boris becker and michael stich as a german wimbledon winner . federer needed five sets at the french open last month to get past haas , who was once the number two seed in the world .
more recently , however , he has had a succession of injuries , including shoulder problems . haas would love nothing more than to join his german colleagues , whom he watched when he was growing up , but he also knows who he is up against . " my next opponent is somebody that 's probably going to go down as the greatest player ever , " haas said , referring to federer .
" it 's going to be a tough hurdle , but we 'll see what happens .

" the recognition that this country is today a country of immigration and will continue to be in the foreseeable future has made it possible for all involved to rededicate themselves to addressing the underlying problems that come with a multi-racial , multi-cultural , multi-ethnic , multi-religious society , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muigai was in germany for 10 days on a fact- finding trip germany has come a long way since former chancellor helmut kohl 's dogged insistence that it was not a country of immigration , muigai added .
seven years ago the conservative christian democratic union rephrased its former leader 's stance , saying that germany was not a country of immigration in the sense that it had not been historically formed by immigrants . with germany home to around 19 percent first and second generation immigrants , the country has acknowledged that it has attracted large numbers of immigrants and will continue to do so . minorities missing from public life muigai , who was the first un racism special rapporteur to visit germany in the last 12 years , said germany needed to do more to integrate more ethnic minorities into its political system , the police and its courts .
people with a migrant background were , according to muigai underrepresented in public life . " i think that this great country needs to turn its attention to the problems of daily racism and discrimination ; that is the racism and discrimination to be found in daily life in schools , public places , in housing , in employment etcetera , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem-özdemir is one of only a few turkish-german public figures .
last november , the greens became the first major party to elect a turkish-german as leader , cem ozdemir , but ethnic minorities are generally a rarity in german politics , making up fewer than 15 national representatives . muigai , who was in germany under an open invitation as special rapporteur , also said that due to the historical experience of germany with nazism , there was a " tendency to equate racism with extremist politics . "
while it was essential for the state and society to remain vigilant at all times , he said a greater problem remained discrimination within society . " much remains to be done " " i received representations that suggested that the education system in germany is not responding to the special needs of migrant communities with the sensitivity that the circumstances require , " muigai said . " the problems in the education system are translating into problems in the employment system and the two together are enforcing each other to create an inequality that may probably not be intended but that is the outcome , " he added . muigai 's comments were offset by praise for the country in its efforts to tackle the issues of discrimination , singling out the cities stuttgart and nuremberg for their good practices in the fight against racism .
muigai also made a plea to the media , calling on them to help stop the spread of racial stereotypes . in response to a question over the continued success of germany 's far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , muigai said that poverty and lack of opportunity led people to turn to right-wing politics , adding that while constitutional legal mechanisms should be used to keep the party in check , its weak political showing was a testament to the lack of real public support . there are regular calls for a ban on germany 's biggest far-right party , the npd , which has no seats in the bundestag national parliament , although it does have representatives in two of germany 's powerful regional assemblies . muigai 's full report will be presented to the council of human rights in 2010 and will also focus on the situation of muslims in germany following the increase in security measures since sept .

" the recognition that this country is today a country of immigration and will continue to be in the foreseeable future has made it possible for all involved to rededicate themselves to addressing the underlying problems that come with a multi-racial , multi-cultural , multi-ethnic , multi-religious society , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muigai was in germany for 10 days on a fact- finding trip germany has come a long way since former chancellor helmut kohl 's dogged insistence that it was not a country of immigration , muigai added .
seven years ago the conservative christian democratic union rephrased its former leader 's stance , saying that germany was not a country of immigration in the sense that it had not been historically formed by immigrants . with germany home to around 19 percent first and second generation immigrants , the country has acknowledged that it has attracted large numbers of immigrants and will continue to do so . minorities missing from public life muigai , who was the first un racism special rapporteur to visit germany in the last 12 years , said germany needed to do more to integrate more ethnic minorities into its political system , the police and its courts .
people with a migrant background were , according to muigai underrepresented in public life . " i think that this great country needs to turn its attention to the problems of daily racism and discrimination ; that is the racism and discrimination to be found in daily life in schools , public places , in housing , in employment etcetera , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem-özdemir is one of only a few turkish-german public figures .
last november , the greens became the first major party to elect a turkish-german as leader , cem ozdemir , but ethnic minorities are generally a rarity in german politics , making up fewer than 15 national representatives . muigai , who was in germany under an open invitation as special rapporteur , also said that due to the historical experience of germany with nazism , there was a " tendency to equate racism with extremist politics . "
while it was essential for the state and society to remain vigilant at all times , he said a greater problem remained discrimination within society . " much remains to be done " " i received representations that suggested that the education system in germany is not responding to the special needs of migrant communities with the sensitivity that the circumstances require , " muigai said . " the problems in the education system are translating into problems in the employment system and the two together are enforcing each other to create an inequality that may probably not be intended but that is the outcome , " he added . muigai 's comments were offset by praise for the country in its efforts to tackle the issues of discrimination , singling out the cities stuttgart and nuremberg for their good practices in the fight against racism .
muigai also made a plea to the media , calling on them to help stop the spread of racial stereotypes . in response to a question over the continued success of germany 's far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , muigai said that poverty and lack of opportunity led people to turn to right-wing politics , adding that while constitutional legal mechanisms should be used to keep the party in check , its weak political showing was a testament to the lack of real public support . there are regular calls for a ban on germany 's biggest far-right party , the npd , which has no seats in the bundestag national parliament , although it does have representatives in two of germany 's powerful regional assemblies . muigai 's full report will be presented to the council of human rights in 2010 and will also focus on the situation of muslims in germany following the increase in security measures since sept .

27 , 2007 , her followers and many in pakistan reacted with angry disbelief .
in the weeks before her assassination , bhutto had more or less openly accused several politicians close to president musharraf of conspiring to murder her . in the weeks after bhutto 's murder , many other questions were raised : was it really a suicide bomb that killed benazir bhutto , or was she shot ?
why was the scene of the crime hosed down immediately afterwards and possible evidence destroyed ?
even an investigation by scotland yard that confirmed some of the government 's explanations could not remove the doubts . zardari 's confusing remarks the current president of pakistan and benazir bhutto 's widower , asif ali zardari , has contributed his own share to the confusion surrounding his wife 's assassination , not least by refusing an autopsy .
zardari immediately said he knew her killers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhutto 's wideo zardari refused an autopsy the retired general talat masood said , " he has been saying all sorts of things !
so if he knew , what was the point in taking up the case with the un and also not disclosing it to the people of pakistan and to his own party and to everyone else ? ” the question arises why pakistan can not simply investigate the murder itself , given that benazir bhutto 's party , the ppp , is ruling the country .
some observers believe the president , as benazir 's political heir , wants to boost his legitimacy by highlighting her murder on the international stage . " we do n't want this case to be left just to the local police in rawalpindi , " zardari said recently .
" we want this inquiry also for history .
we want that the verdict is remembered in history , and that it is remembered that such a leader was born who left such followers behind who have taken her name , this inquiry , her ideas and her words to the national stage . ” possible army-taliban nexus but rana jawad , a senior pakistani journalist , said there is another way to explain why zardari and his party want an international investigation : " i think they do want to clear themselves from any charges that it was a ppp government , hence the investigations were biased and they fixed their political opponents to settle scores . " jawad said the current political regime wanted the united nations to conclude that at the time of bhutto 's assassination a section of the military was in collusion with baitullah mehsud-led taliban groups . should the commission indeed come up with such a finding , it would cause a major political earthquake .
and although the pakistani army has been locked in heavy battles with baitullah mehsud and the taliban over the last few months , it is unclear to what extent the army would be ready to have former links between the military and the extremists exposed . chile 's un ambassador heraldo munoz will head the team .
the other members are indonesia 's former attorney general marzuki darusman and irishman peter fitzgerald , who led the un investigation into the murder of lebanon 's former prime minister rafik hariri .

" jawad said the current political regime wanted the united nations to conclude that at the time of bhutto 's assassination a section of the military was in collusion with baitullah mehsud-led taliban groups . should the commission indeed come up with such a finding , it would cause a major political earthquake .

the other members are indonesia 's former attorney general marzuki darusman and irishman peter fitzgerald , who led the un investigation into the murder of lebanon 's former prime minister rafik hariri .
the un commission , which has a mandate for six months , is expected to visit pakistan for the first time in the third week of july . author : thomas bärthlein editor : disha uppal / kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the recognition that this country is today a country of immigration and will continue to be in the foreseeable future has made it possible for all involved to rededicate themselves to addressing the underlying problems that come with a multi-racial , multi-cultural , multi-ethnic , multi-religious society , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muigai was in germany for 10 days on a fact- finding trip germany has come a long way since former chancellor helmut kohl 's dogged insistence that it was not a country of immigration , muigai added .
seven years ago the conservative christian democratic union rephrased its former leader 's stance , saying that germany was not a country of immigration in the sense that it had not been historically formed by immigrants . with germany home to around 19 percent first and second generation immigrants , the country has acknowledged that it has attracted large numbers of immigrants and will continue to do so . minorities missing from public life muigai , who was the first un racism special rapporteur to visit germany in the last 12 years , said germany needed to do more to integrate more ethnic minorities into its political system , the police and its courts .
people with a migrant background were , according to muigai underrepresented in public life . " i think that this great country needs to turn its attention to the problems of daily racism and discrimination ; that is the racism and discrimination to be found in daily life in schools , public places , in housing , in employment etcetera , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem-özdemir is one of only a few turkish-german public figures .
last november , the greens became the first major party to elect a turkish-german as leader , cem ozdemir , but ethnic minorities are generally a rarity in german politics , making up fewer than 15 national representatives . muigai , who was in germany under an open invitation as special rapporteur , also said that due to the historical experience of germany with nazism , there was a " tendency to equate racism with extremist politics . "
while it was essential for the state and society to remain vigilant at all times , he said a greater problem remained discrimination within society . " much remains to be done " " i received representations that suggested that the education system in germany is not responding to the special needs of migrant communities with the sensitivity that the circumstances require , " muigai said . " the problems in the education system are translating into problems in the employment system and the two together are enforcing each other to create an inequality that may probably not be intended but that is the outcome , " he added . muigai 's comments were offset by praise for the country in its efforts to tackle the issues of discrimination , singling out the cities stuttgart and nuremberg for their good practices in the fight against racism .
muigai also made a plea to the media , calling on them to help stop the spread of racial stereotypes . in response to a question over the continued success of germany 's far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , muigai said that poverty and lack of opportunity led people to turn to right-wing politics , adding that while constitutional legal mechanisms should be used to keep the party in check , its weak political showing was a testament to the lack of real public support . there are regular calls for a ban on germany 's biggest far-right party , the npd , which has no seats in the bundestag national parliament , although it does have representatives in two of germany 's powerful regional assemblies . muigai 's full report will be presented to the council of human rights in 2010 and will also focus on the situation of muslims in germany following the increase in security measures since sept .

now , their young start-up has been awarded a prize for young entrepreneurs for bringing the smoothie fruit drink to germany . true fruits is a success story that took a long time to get rolling .
about four years ago , three students started mixing and blending fruits in their kitchen in their search for the recipe for the perfect smoothie . two of them had studied abroad for a year in scotland , where they encountered their first smoothies .
a thick creamy drink made of blended fresh fruits and juice .
while smoothies have long been popular in the united states and britain , they were almost unknown in germany just a few years ago . " we drove all across germany to find some investors or a fruit juice company to work together with , " said nicolas lecloux , one of the three masterminds behind true fruit .
" we hooked up with a small , family-run juice company in stuttgart who said , ' okay , we 'll give these three guys a shot . " ' bildunterschrift : true fruits smoothies are available only in 200 ml glass bottles - for now the juice company then provided the apple juice , which is added to the blended fruits to make the drink more fluid .
nadine scherf , responsible for public relations at true fruits said the high quality of the products translates into a steep retail price .
a 0.2 liter bottle -lrb- 6.8 fluid ounces -rrb- costs more than 2 euros -lrb- $ 2.82 -rrb- . " we use only the best fruits and they are harvested only once they 're really ripe , " she said .
" our concept is : true fruits - no tricks .
and that means they are not made of concentrates , there 's no added sugar .
it 's really made only of fruit . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas leclous , inga koste and marko knauf of true fruits at the beginning , true fruit sold about 10,000 drinks per month , today it 's about half a million , which the company has said is significant since it does n't advertise .
the bottles have a little warning : " careful , this drink is addictive , " but that , the company said , is simply because what 's inside the bottles is so tasty and healthy . currently there are six different flavors on the market .
a larger bottle is just about to be launched .
when they set out four years ago , it was not easy to get a foothold in any of the supermarket chains .
only via personal contacts , they managed to put their drinks on the shelves of one single supermarket in their hometown bonn . eventually , word got around and true fruits is now part of the standard product range of one of germany 's largest supermarket chains . " at the beginning , it was very difficult , " lecloux said .
" and if you think how much money is wasted on bad loans , and how difficult it is for young entrepreneurs to get a bit of support – well that can make you bitter and disappointed .

tough new measures come into force on in an attempt to break the nicotine habit of greece , europe 's heaviest smoking nation .
but there are serious doubts that the new law will have much impact . greece lags behind the rest of europe in terms of smoking legislation and attitudes .
the new campaign , banning smoking in public places as of wednesday , is designed in part to reduce the heavy burden on government finances . each year , 20,000 greeks die from tobacco related illnesses and the cost in terms of health care amounts to 2.14 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- . some 40 percent of all greeks smoke and 60 percent of the population is exposed to passive smoking in the workplace . " the moment of truth has arrived , " said health minister dimitris avromopoulos .
" this ban aims to bring a change that will revolutionize people 's outlook .
greek society is mature nowadays and ready for the ban . " under the new rules , smoking will be banned in hospitals , schools , vehicles and all public spaces .
billboards advertising cigarettes will be banned . small cafes and restaurants with premises measuring less than 70 square meters can choose either to be tobacco free or to admit smoking only patrons .
bigger establishments can have clearly identified and ventilated smoking areas . in order to give teeth to the new regulations , smokers who break the law can be fined up to 500 euros .
on the first offence , businesses will be fined 1,000 euros .
repeat offenders will face even bigger fines , and ultimately on the fourth violation could risk losing their license . bad for business ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens nightlife wo n't be the same with the smoking ban in a country that has grown its own tobacco for centuries and seems to exist within a fog of nicotine fumes , many regard the new law as an infringement of civil liberties . " it 's going to be bad for business to start with , especially with the greeks because everybody smokes , " said restaurant manager lisa panti as she lit a cigarette outside the gondola in corfu 's old town .
" and if they ca n't smoke in the restaurant they are n't going to come out .
it 's really bad , it 's stupid . " panti said in terms of income , the new law is going to be bad for business everywhere .
but pericles katsaros at the rival rex restaurant 100 meters along the same pedestrian street disagreed . " look it 's really good for restaurants , because if you stop smoking in closed rooms , it does n't smell bad and customers can enjoy their food , " katsaros said . difficulties enforcing the law the health ministry has promised that its new anti-smoking task force will swoop on premises within twenty minutes of receiving a complaint about cigarettes .
but the head of the unit responsible for implementing the new rules has promised that it will be done gradually . on paper , it would appear that greece 's measures look certain to succeed .
but this is a country with a long tradition of defiance .
parliament is adept at introducing new legislation , but enforcement in many areas is an institutionalized failure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will greeks snub out their smokes the way they 're told ?
tens of thousands of motorcyclists , for example , routinely ignore rules demanding that they wear crash helmets .
motorists share a cavalier attitude towards regulations and frequently treat traffic lights as being a suggestion rather than compulsory . hundreds of millions of euros have been spent on closed circuit surveillance cameras in athens and other cities , but they are idle because of public resistance .
why should smoking be any different ? there may be occasional blitzes by the authorities , but unless the rules are firmly and consistently applied , they are at risk of failing . " i really think smoking is a bad habit , " said anastasia pettas from the island of zakynthos .
" but greeks are not used to following rules . " pettas said a fine of 500 or 1,000 euros wo n't force people to quit . " it 's just the way greeks react to any regulations , " she said .
" it 's our culture , i think .
we do n't go according to the rules , we go according to our minds . " her friend , denise patra , agreed . " when you try to make greeks do something , it 's worse , " patra said .

tough new measures come into force on in an attempt to break the nicotine habit of greece , europe 's heaviest smoking nation .

the new campaign , banning smoking in public places as of wednesday , is designed in part to reduce the heavy burden on government finances . each year , 20,000 greeks die from tobacco related illnesses and the cost in terms of health care amounts to 2.14 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- . some 40 percent of all greeks smoke and 60 percent of the population is exposed to passive smoking in the workplace . " the moment of truth has arrived , " said health minister dimitris avromopoulos .
" this ban aims to bring a change that will revolutionize people 's outlook .
greek society is mature nowadays and ready for the ban . " under the new rules , smoking will be banned in hospitals , schools , vehicles and all public spaces .
billboards advertising cigarettes will be banned . small cafes and restaurants with premises measuring less than 70 square meters can choose either to be tobacco free or to admit smoking only patrons .
bigger establishments can have clearly identified and ventilated smoking areas . in order to give teeth to the new regulations , smokers who break the law can be fined up to 500 euros .

" and if they ca n't smoke in the restaurant they are n't going to come out .
it 's really bad , it 's stupid . " panti said in terms of income , the new law is going to be bad for business everywhere .
but pericles katsaros at the rival rex restaurant 100 meters along the same pedestrian street disagreed . " look it 's really good for restaurants , because if you stop smoking in closed rooms , it does n't smell bad and customers can enjoy their food , " katsaros said . difficulties enforcing the law the health ministry has promised that its new anti-smoking task force will swoop on premises within twenty minutes of receiving a complaint about cigarettes .
but the head of the unit responsible for implementing the new rules has promised that it will be done gradually . on paper , it would appear that greece 's measures look certain to succeed .

" the job of these leaders is to find the best options possible for the people , " he said .
" if their citizens do n't understand or believe this then more work should be done to convince them . " governments in europe need to take a greater share of responsibility , " he added .
" the fact is that of all the 28 nato member states there will always be some that will find excuses for idleness . " craddock also said the restricted mandate of germany 's armed forces serving in afghanistan had " extremely limited the flexibility of the commanders " there . " this concerns not only the explained concessions .
in addition there are also some restrictions -lrb- on troops -rrb- that we only learn about when we ask somebody for help , " he told the paper .
" they call home and then come back and say , ' we are not allowed to do this . " ' war or no war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : craddock said restrictions on german troops limits the mission 's effectiveness the role of the german armed forces in afghanistan has been the subject of tensions here for over two years , with the german government so far insisting their troops are not involved in war , but that they are there for peacekeeping and development purposes . but craddock said the debate over the bundeswehr 's status in afghanistan was superfluous . " the politicians can call it whatever they like - i am a military man and for me it is a war , " he said .
" i think if you ask german soldiers they would call it the same thing . " germany has the third-largest contingent in the nato-led force in afghanistan , with about 3,380 troops . despite us pressure to contribute troops to the more violent southern provinces where members of nato and us soldiers have been fighting the taliban since the 2001 invasion that ousted the group from power , the german army has focused on the regional command north . handover ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stavridis said quelling the afghan insurgency would take more than bullets craddock made the comments tuesday , the day he formally handed over his post to admiral james stavridis , who assumes the role as the head of the us european command -lrb- eucom -rrb- .
the ceremony was held at eucom headquarters in the southwestern german city of stuttgart . stavridis said counter-insurgency elements in afghanistan such as the taliban could be pacified with renewed commitment from nato states . " i am very much interested in finding additional and alternative ways the allies can contribute -lrb- to the war effort -rrb- , " stavridis said . " we must pursue a policy in afghanistan that moves the defense and security of the afghan people to the center of our efforts , " he added . dfm / afp / ap editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also said it should stop using her name . " in the current structure , i no longer see the will of my late wife assured in the future , " he wrote in a letter to the foundation . a more precise reason for kohl 's departure is still unclear , though it is said to involve disagreements over staff and the foundation 's constitution .
he had also previously set forth a number of proposals for structural reform that were rejected . kohl surprises foundation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl founded the organization that would bear her name in 1983 kohl , however , gave " no signal " that he was planning to resign from his post , according to annegret ritz , the vice president of the bonn-based foundation . " everything he stated in his letter is absolutely false , " said foundation board member klaus mayer in an interview with the associated press .
" we feel a responsibility to hannelore kohl , her work , her commitment , and we have - as god knows - proven that throughout the years . " meyer accused kohl of wanting to the change the foundation from an independent organization to a " classic family foundation " where he would personally be able to major decisions . the foundation for victims of brain and skull injuries was established by hannelore kohl in 2001 to help victims explore treatment options and search for suitable rehabilitation clinics .
hannelore 's work with accident victims dates back to 1983 . after her death in 2002 , ute henriette-ohoven , a unesco special envoy , was appointed president of the foundation .
according to ritz , the ex-chancellor supported the decision , and there is no knowledge of a personal rift between the two . helmut kohl of germany 's christian democratic union party was chancellor from 1982 to 1998 .

" the recognition that this country is today a country of immigration and will continue to be in the foreseeable future has made it possible for all involved to rededicate themselves to addressing the underlying problems that come with a multi-racial , multi-cultural , multi-ethnic , multi-religious society , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muigai was in germany for 10 days on a fact- finding trip germany has come a long way since former chancellor helmut kohl 's dogged insistence that it was not a country of immigration , muigai added .
seven years ago the conservative christian democratic union rephrased its former leader 's stance , saying that germany was not a country of immigration in the sense that it had not been historically formed by immigrants . with germany home to around 19 percent first and second generation immigrants , the country has acknowledged that it has attracted large numbers of immigrants and will continue to do so . minorities missing from public life muigai , who was the first un racism special rapporteur to visit germany in the last 12 years , said germany needed to do more to integrate more ethnic minorities into its political system , the police and its courts .
people with a migrant background were , according to muigai underrepresented in public life . " i think that this great country needs to turn its attention to the problems of daily racism and discrimination ; that is the racism and discrimination to be found in daily life in schools , public places , in housing , in employment etcetera , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem-özdemir is one of only a few turkish-german public figures .
last november , the greens became the first major party to elect a turkish-german as leader , cem ozdemir , but ethnic minorities are generally a rarity in german politics , making up fewer than 15 national representatives . muigai , who was in germany under an open invitation as special rapporteur , also said that due to the historical experience of germany with nazism , there was a " tendency to equate racism with extremist politics . "
while it was essential for the state and society to remain vigilant at all times , he said a greater problem remained discrimination within society . " much remains to be done " " i received representations that suggested that the education system in germany is not responding to the special needs of migrant communities with the sensitivity that the circumstances require , " muigai said . " the problems in the education system are translating into problems in the employment system and the two together are enforcing each other to create an inequality that may probably not be intended but that is the outcome , " he added . muigai 's comments were offset by praise for the country in its efforts to tackle the issues of discrimination , singling out the cities stuttgart and nuremberg for their good practices in the fight against racism .
muigai also made a plea to the media , calling on them to help stop the spread of racial stereotypes . in response to a question over the continued success of germany 's far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , muigai said that poverty and lack of opportunity led people to turn to right-wing politics , adding that while constitutional legal mechanisms should be used to keep the party in check , its weak political showing was a testament to the lack of real public support . there are regular calls for a ban on germany 's biggest far-right party , the npd , which has no seats in the bundestag national parliament , although it does have representatives in two of germany 's powerful regional assemblies . muigai 's full report will be presented to the council of human rights in 2010 and will also focus on the situation of muslims in germany following the increase in security measures since sept .

tough new measures come into force on in an attempt to break the nicotine habit of greece , europe 's heaviest smoking nation .
but there are serious doubts that the new law will have much impact . greece lags behind the rest of europe in terms of smoking legislation and attitudes .
the new campaign , banning smoking in public places as of wednesday , is designed in part to reduce the heavy burden on government finances . each year , 20,000 greeks die from tobacco related illnesses and the cost in terms of health care amounts to 2.14 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- . some 40 percent of all greeks smoke and 60 percent of the population is exposed to passive smoking in the workplace . " the moment of truth has arrived , " said health minister dimitris avromopoulos .
" this ban aims to bring a change that will revolutionize people 's outlook .
greek society is mature nowadays and ready for the ban . " under the new rules , smoking will be banned in hospitals , schools , vehicles and all public spaces .
billboards advertising cigarettes will be banned . small cafes and restaurants with premises measuring less than 70 square meters can choose either to be tobacco free or to admit smoking only patrons .
bigger establishments can have clearly identified and ventilated smoking areas . in order to give teeth to the new regulations , smokers who break the law can be fined up to 500 euros .

" and if they ca n't smoke in the restaurant they are n't going to come out .

" the recognition that this country is today a country of immigration and will continue to be in the foreseeable future has made it possible for all involved to rededicate themselves to addressing the underlying problems that come with a multi-racial , multi-cultural , multi-ethnic , multi-religious society , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muigai was in germany for 10 days on a fact- finding trip germany has come a long way since former chancellor helmut kohl 's dogged insistence that it was not a country of immigration , muigai added .
seven years ago the conservative christian democratic union rephrased its former leader 's stance , saying that germany was not a country of immigration in the sense that it had not been historically formed by immigrants . with germany home to around 19 percent first and second generation immigrants , the country has acknowledged that it has attracted large numbers of immigrants and will continue to do so . minorities missing from public life muigai , who was the first un racism special rapporteur to visit germany in the last 12 years , said germany needed to do more to integrate more ethnic minorities into its political system , the police and its courts .
people with a migrant background were , according to muigai underrepresented in public life . " i think that this great country needs to turn its attention to the problems of daily racism and discrimination ; that is the racism and discrimination to be found in daily life in schools , public places , in housing , in employment etcetera , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem-özdemir is one of only a few turkish-german public figures .
last november , the greens became the first major party to elect a turkish-german as leader , cem ozdemir , but ethnic minorities are generally a rarity in german politics , making up fewer than 15 national representatives . muigai , who was in germany under an open invitation as special rapporteur , also said that due to the historical experience of germany with nazism , there was a " tendency to equate racism with extremist politics . "
while it was essential for the state and society to remain vigilant at all times , he said a greater problem remained discrimination within society . " much remains to be done " " i received representations that suggested that the education system in germany is not responding to the special needs of migrant communities with the sensitivity that the circumstances require , " muigai said . " the problems in the education system are translating into problems in the employment system and the two together are enforcing each other to create an inequality that may probably not be intended but that is the outcome , " he added . muigai 's comments were offset by praise for the country in its efforts to tackle the issues of discrimination , singling out the cities stuttgart and nuremberg for their good practices in the fight against racism .
muigai also made a plea to the media , calling on them to help stop the spread of racial stereotypes . in response to a question over the continued success of germany 's far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , muigai said that poverty and lack of opportunity led people to turn to right-wing politics , adding that while constitutional legal mechanisms should be used to keep the party in check , its weak political showing was a testament to the lack of real public support . there are regular calls for a ban on germany 's biggest far-right party , the npd , which has no seats in the bundestag national parliament , although it does have representatives in two of germany 's powerful regional assemblies . muigai 's full report will be presented to the council of human rights in 2010 and will also focus on the situation of muslims in germany following the increase in security measures since sept .

tough new measures come into force on in an attempt to break the nicotine habit of greece , europe 's heaviest smoking nation .
but there are serious doubts that the new law will have much impact . greece lags behind the rest of europe in terms of smoking legislation and attitudes .
the new campaign , banning smoking in public places as of wednesday , is designed in part to reduce the heavy burden on government finances . each year , 20,000 greeks die from tobacco related illnesses and the cost in terms of health care amounts to 2.14 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- . some 40 percent of all greeks smoke and 60 percent of the population is exposed to passive smoking in the workplace . " the moment of truth has arrived , " said health minister dimitris avromopoulos .
" this ban aims to bring a change that will revolutionize people 's outlook .
greek society is mature nowadays and ready for the ban . " under the new rules , smoking will be banned in hospitals , schools , vehicles and all public spaces .
billboards advertising cigarettes will be banned . small cafes and restaurants with premises measuring less than 70 square meters can choose either to be tobacco free or to admit smoking only patrons .
bigger establishments can have clearly identified and ventilated smoking areas . in order to give teeth to the new regulations , smokers who break the law can be fined up to 500 euros .

" the recognition that this country is today a country of immigration and will continue to be in the foreseeable future has made it possible for all involved to rededicate themselves to addressing the underlying problems that come with a multi-racial , multi-cultural , multi-ethnic , multi-religious society , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muigai was in germany for 10 days on a fact- finding trip germany has come a long way since former chancellor helmut kohl 's dogged insistence that it was not a country of immigration , muigai added .
seven years ago the conservative christian democratic union rephrased its former leader 's stance , saying that germany was not a country of immigration in the sense that it had not been historically formed by immigrants . with germany home to around 19 percent first and second generation immigrants , the country has acknowledged that it has attracted large numbers of immigrants and will continue to do so . minorities missing from public life muigai , who was the first un racism special rapporteur to visit germany in the last 12 years , said germany needed to do more to integrate more ethnic minorities into its political system , the police and its courts .
people with a migrant background were , according to muigai underrepresented in public life . " i think that this great country needs to turn its attention to the problems of daily racism and discrimination ; that is the racism and discrimination to be found in daily life in schools , public places , in housing , in employment etcetera , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem-özdemir is one of only a few turkish-german public figures .
last november , the greens became the first major party to elect a turkish-german as leader , cem ozdemir , but ethnic minorities are generally a rarity in german politics , making up fewer than 15 national representatives . muigai , who was in germany under an open invitation as special rapporteur , also said that due to the historical experience of germany with nazism , there was a " tendency to equate racism with extremist politics . "
while it was essential for the state and society to remain vigilant at all times , he said a greater problem remained discrimination within society . " much remains to be done " " i received representations that suggested that the education system in germany is not responding to the special needs of migrant communities with the sensitivity that the circumstances require , " muigai said . " the problems in the education system are translating into problems in the employment system and the two together are enforcing each other to create an inequality that may probably not be intended but that is the outcome , " he added . muigai 's comments were offset by praise for the country in its efforts to tackle the issues of discrimination , singling out the cities stuttgart and nuremberg for their good practices in the fight against racism .
muigai also made a plea to the media , calling on them to help stop the spread of racial stereotypes . in response to a question over the continued success of germany 's far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , muigai said that poverty and lack of opportunity led people to turn to right-wing politics , adding that while constitutional legal mechanisms should be used to keep the party in check , its weak political showing was a testament to the lack of real public support . there are regular calls for a ban on germany 's biggest far-right party , the npd , which has no seats in the bundestag national parliament , although it does have representatives in two of germany 's powerful regional assemblies . muigai 's full report will be presented to the council of human rights in 2010 and will also focus on the situation of muslims in germany following the increase in security measures since sept .

" the recognition that this country is today a country of immigration and will continue to be in the foreseeable future has made it possible for all involved to rededicate themselves to addressing the underlying problems that come with a multi-racial , multi-cultural , multi-ethnic , multi-religious society , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muigai was in germany for 10 days on a fact- finding trip germany has come a long way since former chancellor helmut kohl 's dogged insistence that it was not a country of immigration , muigai added .
seven years ago the conservative christian democratic union rephrased its former leader 's stance , saying that germany was not a country of immigration in the sense that it had not been historically formed by immigrants . with germany home to around 19 percent first and second generation immigrants , the country has acknowledged that it has attracted large numbers of immigrants and will continue to do so . minorities missing from public life muigai , who was the first un racism special rapporteur to visit germany in the last 12 years , said germany needed to do more to integrate more ethnic minorities into its political system , the police and its courts .
people with a migrant background were , according to muigai underrepresented in public life . " i think that this great country needs to turn its attention to the problems of daily racism and discrimination ; that is the racism and discrimination to be found in daily life in schools , public places , in housing , in employment etcetera , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem-özdemir is one of only a few turkish-german public figures .
last november , the greens became the first major party to elect a turkish-german as leader , cem ozdemir , but ethnic minorities are generally a rarity in german politics , making up fewer than 15 national representatives . muigai , who was in germany under an open invitation as special rapporteur , also said that due to the historical experience of germany with nazism , there was a " tendency to equate racism with extremist politics . "
while it was essential for the state and society to remain vigilant at all times , he said a greater problem remained discrimination within society . " much remains to be done " " i received representations that suggested that the education system in germany is not responding to the special needs of migrant communities with the sensitivity that the circumstances require , " muigai said . " the problems in the education system are translating into problems in the employment system and the two together are enforcing each other to create an inequality that may probably not be intended but that is the outcome , " he added . muigai 's comments were offset by praise for the country in its efforts to tackle the issues of discrimination , singling out the cities stuttgart and nuremberg for their good practices in the fight against racism .
muigai also made a plea to the media , calling on them to help stop the spread of racial stereotypes . in response to a question over the continued success of germany 's far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , muigai said that poverty and lack of opportunity led people to turn to right-wing politics , adding that while constitutional legal mechanisms should be used to keep the party in check , its weak political showing was a testament to the lack of real public support . there are regular calls for a ban on germany 's biggest far-right party , the npd , which has no seats in the bundestag national parliament , although it does have representatives in two of germany 's powerful regional assemblies . muigai 's full report will be presented to the council of human rights in 2010 and will also focus on the situation of muslims in germany following the increase in security measures since sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 01.07.2009 greece sends smoke signal to europe and bans the butt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ban is unpopular in greece europe 's heaviest smokers , the greeks , can no longer light up in public places as of july 1 .
can they make it stick this time ? it 's greece 's third try at kicking the habit , but critics fear loopholes in the legislation - and its unpopularity - mean it could prove as ineffective as previous attempts .
more than 40 percent of greece 's population smokes , with six out of ten being exposed to passive smoke in their workplaces .
around 20,000 greeks die a year from tobacco-related ailments , according to the country 's health minister , dimitris avramopoulos .
many european union countries have laws to limit exposure to second-hand , or passive , smoking .
britain and ireland have the strictest rules , where smoking is banned in enclosed public places , public transport and workplaces , as well as restaurants and bars .
eu aims for standardized smoking laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to standardize smoking laws across the bloc the european union 's health chief on tuesday proposed that uniform laws be drafted for all 27 countries in the bloc to regulate smoking more strictly in public areas and workplaces by 2012 .
" each and every european should be entitled to full protection from tobacco smoke , " eu health commissioner androulla vassiliou told a press conference on tuesday .
she said in countries with looser regulations on smoking , nearly one in five people were exposed to tobacco smoke in the workplace .
according to vassiliou , an estimated 19,000 non-smokers in the eu died due to second-hand smoke at home and in workplaces in 2002 . each member state decides the level of its own smoking restrictions .
in belgium , for example , smoking is allowed in restaurants only in separate rooms where no food is served , and smoking is banned in all enclosed workplaces .
only 10 member states - britain , ireland , italy , malta , sweden , latvia , finland , slovenia , france and the netherlands - have comprehensive anti-smoking laws , vassiliou said .
the eu defines such laws as ones that either ban smoking completely in public places or permit it only in separate smoking rooms .
bulgaria looks likely to be the next to join them , banning smoking in indoor public places and workplaces , including bars and restaurants , in 2010 .
german legislation among the weakest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baetzing says germany 's smoking laws should be stricter germany 's federal drug commissioner sabine baetzing has spoken out in favor of stricter anti-smoking laws in germany .
in germany laws vary from state to state , with north rhine-westphalia being the most lax .
in most restaurants and bars , puffers can still indulge to their heart 's content .
since 2007 , smoking has been banned on public transport , but the penalty is less than half that for traveling without a ticket .
“ protection for non-smokers should be uniform across the entire country , ” baetzing told the rheinische post newspaper .
“ other countries have set an example , ” she said , “ and they have showed that society has accepted these laws , and that in the end they do n't damage business . ”
those in favor of public puffing seem to be on a dramatic decline .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 01.07.2009 current tensions between iran , west cloud mutually beneficial relationship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear ambitions remain undimmed behind the unrest some experts claim iran is using the turmoil over its disputed presidential election to stall on a return to nuclear negotiations with the west .
others say the two sides need each other and will eventually reopen talks . the violent repercussions of iran 's disputed presidential election have somewhat eclipsed the on-going stalemate over tehran 's nuclear program recently .
but instead of being two separate issues in the islamic republic , some analysts believe that iran 's increasingly antagonizing approach to the west over the pro-opposition demonstrations has more to do with the atomic stand-off than first appears .
some observers say that the heightened tensions between iran and the west are allowing tehran to deflect demands to re-start talks on its nuclear program .
ratcheting up the animosity by arresting local staff at the british embassy and challenging the us over apparent broken promises over a new dialogue , iranian authorities have created an atmosphere in which nuclear talks are highly unlikely to resume .
it was assumed that a peaceful , undisputed election would have led to a return to western pressure on iran to restart nuclear negotiations .
but the subsequent eruption of violent protests and the hard-line , authoritarian crackdown has presented the west with a new dilemma .
it has been suggested that some of iran 's political elite have fomented the idea that countries like britain and the us are behind the uprising , driving another wedge into the divide over tehran 's nuclear ambitions .
this in turn has led some analysts to suggest that some factions in the iranian government were happy to stir up a crisis specifically for this purpose .
if the west could not be trusted to stay out of iranian domestic politics , then it could not be trusted in negotiations over uranium enrichment .
iran buying time through unrest ?
but not all experts believe that this is an official policy promoted by the upper echelons of iran 's political hierarchy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayatollah khamenei is unlikely to have approved any plan " it might be the case that some radical fractions within the iranian establishment have such a plan , " michael bauer , a middle east expert at the center for applied policy research in munich , told deutsche welle .
" unpredictability is an important characteristic and even strategic tool of iranian foreign policy .
this makes its behavior hard to predict .
however , i do n't think this position is held by the supreme leader ali khamenei and other important players in iran 's political system . "
" i would not say that iran is ' using ' the situation , " konstantin kosten , an iran expert at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , said .
" however there 's no doubt that any loss of time in discussing the nuclear issue will bring more advantage to iran than to the western negotiators if they are planning to develop an atomic bomb . "
despite the increased rhetoric , experts agree that iran has no intention of sliding into international isolation like north korea over its nuclear ambitions .
the unrest over the election results may buy iran some breathing space but most believe that the current stance against the west is not the beginning of a new downward spiral in relations .
mutual benefits too important to ignore the two-sides are intrinsically linked by a number of geo-political situations in which a certain degree of co-operation and diplomacy is needed .
in these situations it remains the case that iran needs the west and the west needs iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the distrust , the us needs iran and vice versa " iran knows that washington needs its support in afghanistan and iraq , " bauer said .
" with its role in lebanon through hezbollah and gaza through hamas , iran also shows that it can play a very destructive but influential role in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
iran also has an interest in improved political relations and negotiations with the west , in particular with the us .
tehran wants the us to accept the iranian regime - and obama has indicated that he is willing to do so - and accept iran as a regional power .
moreover , iran needs access to western technology . "
kosten agrees that good relations with iran are important to the west and could be mutually beneficial in a number of areas .
" good relations with iran could be useful in any discussions regarding regional stability in the middle east and the gulf region where iran could be a major player , " kosten said .
" also , in the middle east peace process , a more cooperative role for iran may lead to new possibilities for the integration of groups like hamas and hezbollah in a political solution . "
kosten also believes the benefits of good relations with iran could lead to more energy security and economic opportunities .
" there is a major interest in economic incentives and partnerships with the west , at least at the moment , " he said .
" however , this goes against the aim of some groups in iran which prefer cooperation with countries like russia and china . "
iran unlikely to suffer north korea 's fate of isolation bauer believes that the west , while pursuing a policy of sanctions , will never go as far as isolating iran in the manner of north korea and that the us has already made steps to reverse the previous administration 's attempts to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran does n't want to end up a pariah like north korea " the policy of isolating iran pursued under president bush failed completely , " bauer said .
" the strategy of the west needs a complete overhaul and president obama knows this .
as -lrb- national security advisor zbigniew -rrb- brzezinski said , ' sticks and carrots are appropriate tools to deal with a donkey , not with a country . '
" besides , iran is not north korea , " he added .
" iran is a regional power with strong influence and a strong administrative system .
it also has huge natural resources .
russia , china and many other countries have economic interests and do business with iran .
it is hardly possible to effectively isolate such an oil and gas-exporting country . "
konstantin kosten agrees .
" i do n't think iran would become a pariah-state like north korea because iran is much more developed .
if relations with the west become even more strained , then iran would orientate its cooperation towards the east which would be a loss of opportunities . "
so what does the future hold for relations between the west and iran , once the dust of the recent unrest settles ?
what needs to happen before both sides are willing to return to the table to discuss the nuclear stand-off ?
compromise and integration needed " iran has to learn to trust the western negotiators and at the very least open talks with on offer to maybe slightly alter its way of enriching uranium , " kosten said .

others say the two sides need each other and will eventually reopen talks . the violent repercussions of iran 's disputed presidential election have somewhat eclipsed the on-going stalemate over tehran 's nuclear program recently .
but instead of being two separate issues in the islamic republic , some analysts believe that iran 's increasingly antagonizing approach to the west over the pro-opposition demonstrations has more to do with the atomic stand-off than first appears .
some observers say that the heightened tensions between iran and the west are allowing tehran to deflect demands to re-start talks on its nuclear program .
ratcheting up the animosity by arresting local staff at the british embassy and challenging the us over apparent broken promises over a new dialogue , iranian authorities have created an atmosphere in which nuclear talks are highly unlikely to resume .
it was assumed that a peaceful , undisputed election would have led to a return to western pressure on iran to restart nuclear negotiations .
but the subsequent eruption of violent protests and the hard-line , authoritarian crackdown has presented the west with a new dilemma .
it has been suggested that some of iran 's political elite have fomented the idea that countries like britain and the us are behind the uprising , driving another wedge into the divide over tehran 's nuclear ambitions .
this in turn has led some analysts to suggest that some factions in the iranian government were happy to stir up a crisis specifically for this purpose .
if the west could not be trusted to stay out of iranian domestic politics , then it could not be trusted in negotiations over uranium enrichment .
iran buying time through unrest ?
but not all experts believe that this is an official policy promoted by the upper echelons of iran 's political hierarchy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayatollah khamenei is unlikely to have approved any plan " it might be the case that some radical fractions within the iranian establishment have such a plan , " michael bauer , a middle east expert at the center for applied policy research in munich , told deutsche welle .
" unpredictability is an important characteristic and even strategic tool of iranian foreign policy .
this makes its behavior hard to predict .
however , i do n't think this position is held by the supreme leader ali khamenei and other important players in iran 's political system . "
" i would not say that iran is ' using ' the situation , " konstantin kosten , an iran expert at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , said .
" however there 's no doubt that any loss of time in discussing the nuclear issue will bring more advantage to iran than to the western negotiators if they are planning to develop an atomic bomb . "
despite the increased rhetoric , experts agree that iran has no intention of sliding into international isolation like north korea over its nuclear ambitions .
the unrest over the election results may buy iran some breathing space but most believe that the current stance against the west is not the beginning of a new downward spiral in relations .
mutual benefits too important to ignore the two-sides are intrinsically linked by a number of geo-political situations in which a certain degree of co-operation and diplomacy is needed .
in these situations it remains the case that iran needs the west and the west needs iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the distrust , the us needs iran and vice versa " iran knows that washington needs its support in afghanistan and iraq , " bauer said .
" with its role in lebanon through hezbollah and gaza through hamas , iran also shows that it can play a very destructive but influential role in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
iran also has an interest in improved political relations and negotiations with the west , in particular with the us .
tehran wants the us to accept the iranian regime - and obama has indicated that he is willing to do so - and accept iran as a regional power .
moreover , iran needs access to western technology . "
kosten agrees that good relations with iran are important to the west and could be mutually beneficial in a number of areas .
" good relations with iran could be useful in any discussions regarding regional stability in the middle east and the gulf region where iran could be a major player , " kosten said .
" also , in the middle east peace process , a more cooperative role for iran may lead to new possibilities for the integration of groups like hamas and hezbollah in a political solution . "
kosten also believes the benefits of good relations with iran could lead to more energy security and economic opportunities .
" there is a major interest in economic incentives and partnerships with the west , at least at the moment , " he said .
" however , this goes against the aim of some groups in iran which prefer cooperation with countries like russia and china . "
iran unlikely to suffer north korea 's fate of isolation bauer believes that the west , while pursuing a policy of sanctions , will never go as far as isolating iran in the manner of north korea and that the us has already made steps to reverse the previous administration 's attempts to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran does n't want to end up a pariah like north korea " the policy of isolating iran pursued under president bush failed completely , " bauer said .
" the strategy of the west needs a complete overhaul and president obama knows this .
as -lrb- national security advisor zbigniew -rrb- brzezinski said , ' sticks and carrots are appropriate tools to deal with a donkey , not with a country . '
" besides , iran is not north korea , " he added .
" iran is a regional power with strong influence and a strong administrative system .
it also has huge natural resources .
russia , china and many other countries have economic interests and do business with iran .
it is hardly possible to effectively isolate such an oil and gas-exporting country . "
konstantin kosten agrees .
" i do n't think iran would become a pariah-state like north korea because iran is much more developed .
if relations with the west become even more strained , then iran would orientate its cooperation towards the east which would be a loss of opportunities . "
so what does the future hold for relations between the west and iran , once the dust of the recent unrest settles ?
what needs to happen before both sides are willing to return to the table to discuss the nuclear stand-off ?
compromise and integration needed " iran has to learn to trust the western negotiators and at the very least open talks with on offer to maybe slightly alter its way of enriching uranium , " kosten said .
" the west has to find regulations and certain approaches to the discussion which allow the iranians to save face while also encouraging them to foster transparency in their civilian enriching program . "

others say the two sides need each other and will eventually reopen talks . the violent repercussions of iran 's disputed presidential election have somewhat eclipsed the on-going stalemate over tehran 's nuclear program recently .
but instead of being two separate issues in the islamic republic , some analysts believe that iran 's increasingly antagonizing approach to the west over the pro-opposition demonstrations has more to do with the atomic stand-off than first appears .
some observers say that the heightened tensions between iran and the west are allowing tehran to deflect demands to re-start talks on its nuclear program .
ratcheting up the animosity by arresting local staff at the british embassy and challenging the us over apparent broken promises over a new dialogue , iranian authorities have created an atmosphere in which nuclear talks are highly unlikely to resume .
it was assumed that a peaceful , undisputed election would have led to a return to western pressure on iran to restart nuclear negotiations .
but the subsequent eruption of violent protests and the hard-line , authoritarian crackdown has presented the west with a new dilemma .
it has been suggested that some of iran 's political elite have fomented the idea that countries like britain and the us are behind the uprising , driving another wedge into the divide over tehran 's nuclear ambitions .
this in turn has led some analysts to suggest that some factions in the iranian government were happy to stir up a crisis specifically for this purpose .
if the west could not be trusted to stay out of iranian domestic politics , then it could not be trusted in negotiations over uranium enrichment .
iran buying time through unrest ?
but not all experts believe that this is an official policy promoted by the upper echelons of iran 's political hierarchy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayatollah khamenei is unlikely to have approved any plan " it might be the case that some radical fractions within the iranian establishment have such a plan , " michael bauer , a middle east expert at the center for applied policy research in munich , told deutsche welle .
" unpredictability is an important characteristic and even strategic tool of iranian foreign policy .
this makes its behavior hard to predict .
however , i do n't think this position is held by the supreme leader ali khamenei and other important players in iran 's political system . "
" i would not say that iran is ' using ' the situation , " konstantin kosten , an iran expert at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , said .
" however there 's no doubt that any loss of time in discussing the nuclear issue will bring more advantage to iran than to the western negotiators if they are planning to develop an atomic bomb . "
despite the increased rhetoric , experts agree that iran has no intention of sliding into international isolation like north korea over its nuclear ambitions .
the unrest over the election results may buy iran some breathing space but most believe that the current stance against the west is not the beginning of a new downward spiral in relations .
mutual benefits too important to ignore the two-sides are intrinsically linked by a number of geo-political situations in which a certain degree of co-operation and diplomacy is needed .
in these situations it remains the case that iran needs the west and the west needs iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the distrust , the us needs iran and vice versa " iran knows that washington needs its support in afghanistan and iraq , " bauer said .
" with its role in lebanon through hezbollah and gaza through hamas , iran also shows that it can play a very destructive but influential role in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
iran also has an interest in improved political relations and negotiations with the west , in particular with the us .
tehran wants the us to accept the iranian regime - and obama has indicated that he is willing to do so - and accept iran as a regional power .
moreover , iran needs access to western technology . "
kosten agrees that good relations with iran are important to the west and could be mutually beneficial in a number of areas .
" good relations with iran could be useful in any discussions regarding regional stability in the middle east and the gulf region where iran could be a major player , " kosten said .
" also , in the middle east peace process , a more cooperative role for iran may lead to new possibilities for the integration of groups like hamas and hezbollah in a political solution . "
kosten also believes the benefits of good relations with iran could lead to more energy security and economic opportunities .
" there is a major interest in economic incentives and partnerships with the west , at least at the moment , " he said .
" however , this goes against the aim of some groups in iran which prefer cooperation with countries like russia and china . "
iran unlikely to suffer north korea 's fate of isolation bauer believes that the west , while pursuing a policy of sanctions , will never go as far as isolating iran in the manner of north korea and that the us has already made steps to reverse the previous administration 's attempts to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran does n't want to end up a pariah like north korea " the policy of isolating iran pursued under president bush failed completely , " bauer said .
" the strategy of the west needs a complete overhaul and president obama knows this .
as -lrb- national security advisor zbigniew -rrb- brzezinski said , ' sticks and carrots are appropriate tools to deal with a donkey , not with a country . '
" besides , iran is not north korea , " he added .
" iran is a regional power with strong influence and a strong administrative system .
it also has huge natural resources .
russia , china and many other countries have economic interests and do business with iran .
it is hardly possible to effectively isolate such an oil and gas-exporting country . "
konstantin kosten agrees .
" i do n't think iran would become a pariah-state like north korea because iran is much more developed .
if relations with the west become even more strained , then iran would orientate its cooperation towards the east which would be a loss of opportunities . "
so what does the future hold for relations between the west and iran , once the dust of the recent unrest settles ?
what needs to happen before both sides are willing to return to the table to discuss the nuclear stand-off ?
compromise and integration needed " iran has to learn to trust the western negotiators and at the very least open talks with on offer to maybe slightly alter its way of enriching uranium , " kosten said .
" the west has to find regulations and certain approaches to the discussion which allow the iranians to save face while also encouraging them to foster transparency in their civilian enriching program . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran needs assurances and the west needs to see action " regarding the nuclear program , a compromise could be western acceptance of the full -lrb- uranium enrichment -rrb- cycle in exchange for iranian ratification of the additional protocol to the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and iranian cooperation with the iaea , ensuring full transparency of the iranian nuclear program and ensuring verification of its civilian nature , " michael bauer said .
" this will be difficult to achieve and it would require a lot of confidence-building measures .
" to ensure the sustainability of any compromise with iran , it is crucial to include all regional actors , in particular the arab gulf states , most importantly saudi arabia , " he concluded .
" at the end , the rules of the game in the middle east need to be changed from a zero-sum game to a cooperative understanding of security .
a format like a sub-regional system for cooperation and security is needed . "

now , their young start-up has been awarded a prize for young entrepreneurs for bringing the smoothie fruit drink to germany . true fruits is a success story that took a long time to get rolling .
about four years ago , three students started mixing and blending fruits in their kitchen in their search for the recipe for the perfect smoothie . two of them had studied abroad for a year in scotland , where they encountered their first smoothies .
a thick creamy drink made of blended fresh fruits and juice .
while smoothies have long been popular in the united states and britain , they were almost unknown in germany just a few years ago . " we drove all across germany to find some investors or a fruit juice company to work together with , " said nicolas lecloux , one of the three masterminds behind true fruit .
" we hooked up with a small , family-run juice company in stuttgart who said , ' okay , we 'll give these three guys a shot . " ' bildunterschrift : true fruits smoothies are available only in 200 ml glass bottles - for now the juice company then provided the apple juice , which is added to the blended fruits to make the drink more fluid .
nadine scherf , responsible for public relations at true fruits said the high quality of the products translates into a steep retail price .
a 0.2 liter bottle -lrb- 6.8 fluid ounces -rrb- costs more than 2 euros -lrb- $ 2.82 -rrb- . " we use only the best fruits and they are harvested only once they 're really ripe , " she said .
" our concept is : true fruits - no tricks .
and that means they are not made of concentrates , there 's no added sugar .
it 's really made only of fruit . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas leclous , inga koste and marko knauf of true fruits at the beginning , true fruit sold about 10,000 drinks per month , today it 's about half a million , which the company has said is significant since it does n't advertise .
the bottles have a little warning : " careful , this drink is addictive , " but that , the company said , is simply because what 's inside the bottles is so tasty and healthy . currently there are six different flavors on the market .
a larger bottle is just about to be launched .
when they set out four years ago , it was not easy to get a foothold in any of the supermarket chains .
only via personal contacts , they managed to put their drinks on the shelves of one single supermarket in their hometown bonn . eventually , word got around and true fruits is now part of the standard product range of one of germany 's largest supermarket chains . " at the beginning , it was very difficult , " lecloux said .
" and if you think how much money is wasted on bad loans , and how difficult it is for young entrepreneurs to get a bit of support – well that can make you bitter and disappointed .

tough new measures come into force on in an attempt to break the nicotine habit of greece , europe 's heaviest smoking nation .
but there are serious doubts that the new law will have much impact . greece lags behind the rest of europe in terms of smoking legislation and attitudes .
the new campaign , banning smoking in public places as of wednesday , is designed in part to reduce the heavy burden on government finances . each year , 20,000 greeks die from tobacco related illnesses and the cost in terms of health care amounts to 2.14 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- . some 40 percent of all greeks smoke and 60 percent of the population is exposed to passive smoking in the workplace . " the moment of truth has arrived , " said health minister dimitris avromopoulos .
" this ban aims to bring a change that will revolutionize people 's outlook .
greek society is mature nowadays and ready for the ban . " under the new rules , smoking will be banned in hospitals , schools , vehicles and all public spaces .
billboards advertising cigarettes will be banned . small cafes and restaurants with premises measuring less than 70 square meters can choose either to be tobacco free or to admit smoking only patrons .
bigger establishments can have clearly identified and ventilated smoking areas . in order to give teeth to the new regulations , smokers who break the law can be fined up to 500 euros .
on the first offence , businesses will be fined 1,000 euros .
repeat offenders will face even bigger fines , and ultimately on the fourth violation could risk losing their license . bad for business ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens nightlife wo n't be the same with the smoking ban in a country that has grown its own tobacco for centuries and seems to exist within a fog of nicotine fumes , many regard the new law as an infringement of civil liberties . " it 's going to be bad for business to start with , especially with the greeks because everybody smokes , " said restaurant manager lisa panti as she lit a cigarette outside the gondola in corfu 's old town .
" and if they ca n't smoke in the restaurant they are n't going to come out .
it 's really bad , it 's stupid . " panti said in terms of income , the new law is going to be bad for business everywhere .
but pericles katsaros at the rival rex restaurant 100 meters along the same pedestrian street disagreed . " look it 's really good for restaurants , because if you stop smoking in closed rooms , it does n't smell bad and customers can enjoy their food , " katsaros said . difficulties enforcing the law the health ministry has promised that its new anti-smoking task force will swoop on premises within twenty minutes of receiving a complaint about cigarettes .
but the head of the unit responsible for implementing the new rules has promised that it will be done gradually . on paper , it would appear that greece 's measures look certain to succeed .
but this is a country with a long tradition of defiance .
parliament is adept at introducing new legislation , but enforcement in many areas is an institutionalized failure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will greeks snub out their smokes the way they 're told ?
tens of thousands of motorcyclists , for example , routinely ignore rules demanding that they wear crash helmets .
motorists share a cavalier attitude towards regulations and frequently treat traffic lights as being a suggestion rather than compulsory . hundreds of millions of euros have been spent on closed circuit surveillance cameras in athens and other cities , but they are idle because of public resistance .
why should smoking be any different ? there may be occasional blitzes by the authorities , but unless the rules are firmly and consistently applied , they are at risk of failing . " i really think smoking is a bad habit , " said anastasia pettas from the island of zakynthos .
" but greeks are not used to following rules . " pettas said a fine of 500 or 1,000 euros wo n't force people to quit . " it 's just the way greeks react to any regulations , " she said .
" it 's our culture , i think .
we do n't go according to the rules , we go according to our minds . " her friend , denise patra , agreed . " when you try to make greeks do something , it 's worse , " patra said .
" they do the opposite on purpose and they are going to continue to do so .
but i 'm happy about the new rules , because where ever i go , everybody smokes , and i ca n't stand the smell .
i hope it works . " author : malcolm brabant in athens -lrb- sac -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tough new measures come into force on in an attempt to break the nicotine habit of greece , europe 's heaviest smoking nation .
but there are serious doubts that the new law will have much impact . greece lags behind the rest of europe in terms of smoking legislation and attitudes .
the new campaign , banning smoking in public places as of wednesday , is designed in part to reduce the heavy burden on government finances . each year , 20,000 greeks die from tobacco related illnesses and the cost in terms of health care amounts to 2.14 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- . some 40 percent of all greeks smoke and 60 percent of the population is exposed to passive smoking in the workplace . " the moment of truth has arrived , " said health minister dimitris avromopoulos .
" this ban aims to bring a change that will revolutionize people 's outlook .
greek society is mature nowadays and ready for the ban . " under the new rules , smoking will be banned in hospitals , schools , vehicles and all public spaces .
billboards advertising cigarettes will be banned . small cafes and restaurants with premises measuring less than 70 square meters can choose either to be tobacco free or to admit smoking only patrons .
bigger establishments can have clearly identified and ventilated smoking areas . in order to give teeth to the new regulations , smokers who break the law can be fined up to 500 euros .
on the first offence , businesses will be fined 1,000 euros .
repeat offenders will face even bigger fines , and ultimately on the fourth violation could risk losing their license . bad for business ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens nightlife wo n't be the same with the smoking ban in a country that has grown its own tobacco for centuries and seems to exist within a fog of nicotine fumes , many regard the new law as an infringement of civil liberties . " it 's going to be bad for business to start with , especially with the greeks because everybody smokes , " said restaurant manager lisa panti as she lit a cigarette outside the gondola in corfu 's old town .
" and if they ca n't smoke in the restaurant they are n't going to come out .
it 's really bad , it 's stupid . " panti said in terms of income , the new law is going to be bad for business everywhere .
but pericles katsaros at the rival rex restaurant 100 meters along the same pedestrian street disagreed . " look it 's really good for restaurants , because if you stop smoking in closed rooms , it does n't smell bad and customers can enjoy their food , " katsaros said . difficulties enforcing the law the health ministry has promised that its new anti-smoking task force will swoop on premises within twenty minutes of receiving a complaint about cigarettes .
but the head of the unit responsible for implementing the new rules has promised that it will be done gradually . on paper , it would appear that greece 's measures look certain to succeed .
but this is a country with a long tradition of defiance .
parliament is adept at introducing new legislation , but enforcement in many areas is an institutionalized failure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will greeks snub out their smokes the way they 're told ?
tens of thousands of motorcyclists , for example , routinely ignore rules demanding that they wear crash helmets .
motorists share a cavalier attitude towards regulations and frequently treat traffic lights as being a suggestion rather than compulsory . hundreds of millions of euros have been spent on closed circuit surveillance cameras in athens and other cities , but they are idle because of public resistance .
why should smoking be any different ? there may be occasional blitzes by the authorities , but unless the rules are firmly and consistently applied , they are at risk of failing . " i really think smoking is a bad habit , " said anastasia pettas from the island of zakynthos .
" but greeks are not used to following rules . " pettas said a fine of 500 or 1,000 euros wo n't force people to quit . " it 's just the way greeks react to any regulations , " she said .

can they make it stick this time ? it 's greece 's third try at kicking the habit , but critics fear loopholes in the legislation - and its unpopularity - mean it could prove as ineffective as previous attempts .
more than 40 percent of greece 's population smokes , with six out of ten being exposed to passive smoke in their workplaces .
around 20,000 greeks die a year from tobacco-related ailments , according to the country 's health minister , dimitris avramopoulos .
many european union countries have laws to limit exposure to second-hand , or passive , smoking .
britain and ireland have the strictest rules , where smoking is banned in enclosed public places , public transport and workplaces , as well as restaurants and bars .
eu aims for standardized smoking laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to standardize smoking laws across the bloc the european union 's health chief on tuesday proposed that uniform laws be drafted for all 27 countries in the bloc to regulate smoking more strictly in public areas and workplaces by 2012 .
" each and every european should be entitled to full protection from tobacco smoke , " eu health commissioner androulla vassiliou told a press conference on tuesday .
she said in countries with looser regulations on smoking , nearly one in five people were exposed to tobacco smoke in the workplace .
according to vassiliou , an estimated 19,000 non-smokers in the eu died due to second-hand smoke at home and in workplaces in 2002 . each member state decides the level of its own smoking restrictions .
in belgium , for example , smoking is allowed in restaurants only in separate rooms where no food is served , and smoking is banned in all enclosed workplaces .
only 10 member states - britain , ireland , italy , malta , sweden , latvia , finland , slovenia , france and the netherlands - have comprehensive anti-smoking laws , vassiliou said .
the eu defines such laws as ones that either ban smoking completely in public places or permit it only in separate smoking rooms .
bulgaria looks likely to be the next to join them , banning smoking in indoor public places and workplaces , including bars and restaurants , in 2010 .
german legislation among the weakest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baetzing says germany 's smoking laws should be stricter germany 's federal drug commissioner sabine baetzing has spoken out in favor of stricter anti-smoking laws in germany .
in germany laws vary from state to state , with north rhine-westphalia being the most lax .
in most restaurants and bars , puffers can still indulge to their heart 's content .
since 2007 , smoking has been banned on public transport , but the penalty is less than half that for traveling without a ticket .
“ protection for non-smokers should be uniform across the entire country , ” baetzing told the rheinische post newspaper .
“ other countries have set an example , ” she said , “ and they have showed that society has accepted these laws , and that in the end they do n't damage business . ”
those in favor of public puffing seem to be on a dramatic decline .
a poll by eu survey group eurobarometer last year indicated 84 percent of respondents supported smoke-free offices and other indoor workplaces , 77 percent favored smoke-free restaurants , and 61 percent supported smoke-free bars and pubs. ch / reuters / afp editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

preventive healthcare is liable to see serious budget cuts - but public health expert dr alan maryon-davis says in this week 's scrubbing up health column that this would be " short-sighted folly " .
after a decade of record investment , with a tripling of its budget since 1997 , the health service is facing " seven years of famine " from april 2011 as the treasury claws back money to help rebuild the reserves it spent on bailing out the banks .
even now , with 15 months of the good times still to go , the planners are looking to see where they can make so-called ' efficiency savings ' - cuts to you and me .
the nhs is facing a new ice age my worry is that , if history is anything to go by , the first things for the chop will be preventive programmes such as stop smoking services , healthy eating initiatives , physical activity promotion , alcohol education projects , mental health work and safe sex drives .
these are all ' soft targets ' for the axe-swingers .
the benefits are in the future and there are n't any immediate shrouds to wave .
history lesson the last time there was a raid on nhs budgets in 2006-07 , the millions allocated to a national health improvement strategy called choosing health were quietly snaffled to prop up the massive overspend on hospital services and medication .
suddenly , the much-vaunted choosing health strategy , with its high hopes of a healthier nation , was dead in the water .
but that financial crisis was a mere hiccup compared to the year-on-year hard times just over the horizon .
this time the ' efficiencies ' will be deeper and longer-lasting .
the nhs is facing a new ice age .
only a paltry 1 % or so of the nhs budget is currently spent on promoting health - a proportion that has hardly changed in 20 years my plea to the army of health service planners and commissioners is simple ; hands off prevention .
find your savings elsewhere .
precious nhs money is still being wasted .
too many cases are being inappropriately treated in hospital .
too many people are using a & e instead of a gp .
too many are being sent for unnecessary tests .
too many are prescribed high cost drugs when cheaper ones would do .
we need to spend more money on prevention , not less .
' adding to the burden ' it is sheer short-sighted folly to cut back the very programmes that can help prevent the chronic conditions like high blood pressure , diabetes , heart disease , strokes , cancers , chronic lung disease and mental illness , that are crippling the health service .
our ageing population with its greater health needs , the spiralling cost of high-tech hospital diagnosis and treatment , expensive new drugs and long-term care are all adding to the burden the nhs has to bear .
by promoting health and wellbeing , and preventing disease , we can help people stay younger longer , in better physical and mental shape and less dependent on drugs and expensive treatments .
in short , we should be aiming to add life to years rather than simply adding years to life .
absolutely preventative health is way to go .
read your comments the national institute for health and clinical effectiveness -lrb- nice -rrb- has repeatedly shown how cost-effective low-tech preventive programmes such as stopping smoking and promoting exercise can be compared to long-term medication and high-tech diagnosis and treatment .
only a paltry 1 % or so of the nhs budget is currently spent on promoting health - a proportion that has hardly changed in 20 years .
true , rather more is spent on clinical preventive services such as antenatal care , newborn screening , childhood immunisation , cancer checks , contraception , eye tests , oral health and check-ups in general practice .
lip service but even so , the whole prevention slice is tiny compared to the money spent on trying to patch people up after they have already fallen ill .
this is simply unsustainable .
we need to move from a ' national illness service ' to much more of a ' national health service ' .
politicians of all hues pay lip-service to this mantra .
but there 's real danger that such good intentions will be steamrollered thinner than an nhs finance director 's smile by the impending cuts .
the recession has meant that many people are finding it harder to lead healthy lives and need all the support they can get .
health inequalities continue to widen .
prescriptions for depression are soaring .
we need not only to protect the health promotion and disease prevention services we 've got , but actually invest more in them .
and we need to start doing that right now .

' adding to the burden ' it is sheer short-sighted folly to cut back the very programmes that can help prevent the chronic conditions like high blood pressure , diabetes , heart disease , strokes , cancers , chronic lung disease and mental illness , that are crippling the health service .
our ageing population with its greater health needs , the spiralling cost of high-tech hospital diagnosis and treatment , expensive new drugs and long-term care are all adding to the burden the nhs has to bear .
by promoting health and wellbeing , and preventing disease , we can help people stay younger longer , in better physical and mental shape and less dependent on drugs and expensive treatments .
in short , we should be aiming to add life to years rather than simply adding years to life .
absolutely preventative health is way to go .
read your comments the national institute for health and clinical effectiveness -lrb- nice -rrb- has repeatedly shown how cost-effective low-tech preventive programmes such as stopping smoking and promoting exercise can be compared to long-term medication and high-tech diagnosis and treatment .
only a paltry 1 % or so of the nhs budget is currently spent on promoting health - a proportion that has hardly changed in 20 years .
true , rather more is spent on clinical preventive services such as antenatal care , newborn screening , childhood immunisation , cancer checks , contraception , eye tests , oral health and check-ups in general practice .
lip service but even so , the whole prevention slice is tiny compared to the money spent on trying to patch people up after they have already fallen ill .
this is simply unsustainable .
we need to move from a ' national illness service ' to much more of a ' national health service ' .
politicians of all hues pay lip-service to this mantra .
but there 's real danger that such good intentions will be steamrollered thinner than an nhs finance director 's smile by the impending cuts .
the recession has meant that many people are finding it harder to lead healthy lives and need all the support they can get .
health inequalities continue to widen .
prescriptions for depression are soaring .
we need not only to protect the health promotion and disease prevention services we 've got , but actually invest more in them .
and we need to start doing that right now .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- nhs faces ' folly ' of short-sighted cuts bbc news / health graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- health contents : medical notes 05:04 gmt , wednesday , 1 july 2009 06:04 uk nhs faces ' folly ' of short-sighted cuts viewpoint dr alan maryon-davis president , uk faculty of public health the nhs is facing " seven years of famine " because of the economic downturn , whoever wins the next election .
preventive healthcare is liable to see serious budget cuts - but public health expert dr alan maryon-davis says in this week 's scrubbing up health column that this would be " short-sighted folly " . "
after a decade of record investment , with a tripling of its budget since 1997 , the health service is facing " seven years of famine " from april 2011 as the treasury claws back money to help rebuild the reserves it spent on bailing out the banks .
even now , with 15 months of the good times still to go , the planners are looking to see where they can make so-called ' efficiency savings ' - cuts to you and me . "
the nhs is facing a new ice age " my worry is that , if history is anything to go by , the first things for the chop will be preventive programmes such as stop smoking services , healthy eating initiatives , physical activity promotion , alcohol education projects , mental health work and safe sex drives .
these are all ' soft targets ' for the axe-swingers .
the benefits are in the future and there are n't any immediate shrouds to wave .
history lesson the last time there was a raid on nhs budgets in 2006-07 , the millions allocated to a national health improvement strategy called choosing health were quietly snaffled to prop up the massive overspend on hospital services and medication .
suddenly , the much-vaunted choosing health strategy , with its high hopes of a healthier nation , was dead in the water .
but that financial crisis was a mere hiccup compared to the year-on-year hard times just over the horizon .
this time the ' efficiencies ' will be deeper and longer-lasting .
the nhs is facing a new ice age . "
only a paltry 1 % or so of the nhs budget is currently spent on promoting health - a proportion that has hardly changed in 20 years " my plea to the army of health service planners and commissioners is simple ; hands off prevention .
find your savings elsewhere .
precious nhs money is still being wasted .
too many cases are being inappropriately treated in hospital .
too many people are using a & e instead of a gp .
too many are being sent for unnecessary tests .
too many are prescribed high cost drugs when cheaper ones would do .
we need to spend more money on prevention , not less .
' adding to the burden ' it is sheer short-sighted folly to cut back the very programmes that can help prevent the chronic conditions like high blood pressure , diabetes , heart disease , strokes , cancers , chronic lung disease and mental illness , that are crippling the health service .
our ageing population with its greater health needs , the spiralling cost of high-tech hospital diagnosis and treatment , expensive new drugs and long-term care are all adding to the burden the nhs has to bear .
by promoting health and wellbeing , and preventing disease , we can help people stay younger longer , in better physical and mental shape and less dependent on drugs and expensive treatments .
in short , we should be aiming to add life to years rather than simply adding years to life . "
absolutely preventative health is way to go . "
read your comments the national institute for health and clinical effectiveness -lrb- nice -rrb- has repeatedly shown how cost-effective low-tech preventive programmes such as stopping smoking and promoting exercise can be compared to long-term medication and high-tech diagnosis and treatment .
only a paltry 1 % or so of the nhs budget is currently spent on promoting health - a proportion that has hardly changed in 20 years .
true , rather more is spent on clinical preventive services such as antenatal care , newborn screening , childhood immunisation , cancer checks , contraception , eye tests , oral health and check-ups in general practice .
lip service but even so , the whole prevention slice is tiny compared to the money spent on trying to patch people up after they have already fallen ill .
this is simply unsustainable .
we need to move from a ' national illness service ' to much more of a ' national health service ' .
politicians of all hues pay lip-service to this mantra .
but there 's real danger that such good intentions will be steamrollered thinner than an nhs finance director 's smile by the impending cuts .
the recession has meant that many people are finding it harder to lead healthy lives and need all the support they can get .
health inequalities continue to widen .
prescriptions for depression are soaring .
we need not only to protect the health promotion and disease prevention services we 've got , but actually invest more in them .
and we need to start doing that right now . "

eight volunteer members of the sea trust came across the " mile-long wall of dolphins " near the smalls lighthouse in the irish sea .
the charity 's founder cliff benson said in wildlife terms the sight " was like winning the lottery " .
meanwhile sea watch said there had been dolphin sightings off parts of the welsh coast they rarely visit .
the sea trust volunteers had been carrying out a small boat survey around the pembrokeshire islands .
mr benson said : " as we were approaching the smalls lighthouse the sea was quite choppy , the sky grey and overcast .
" suddenly in the distance we saw what appeared to be a blizzard . "
i did not expect to see such an awesome sight again in my life time " cliff benson " as we approached , we realised that the " blizzard " was thousands of gannets spread out over a mile or more .
" beneath them was a living wall of dolphins - a mile long and several deep .
" they just kept on coming pod after pod passing by the boat .
some came and looked at us but most just kept on going .
" this must have been a combination of many smaller pods joined together to exploit a huge bait ball of fish .
it was possible to see all ages of dolphins from big adults to tiny babies . "
he said it was the second time the pembrokeshire-based charity had witnessed such a phenomenon .
" back in august 2005 we had another superpod which i filmed and which was then shown around the world , " added mr benson .
" i did not expect to see such an awesome sight again in my lifetime , this was in wildlife terms like winning the lottery a second time . "
protective measures in a separate development , the marine research and education charity sea watch has called for an extension to the special areas of conservation for the species within cardigan bay .
it follows sightings in the past few weeks of bottlenose dolphins off anglesey and rhyl on the north wales coast and gower on the south .
research director peter evans said : " our surveys and photo id research are revealing just how far the bottlenose dolphins from cardigan bay can range not just in winter but in summer too .
" these sightings have important implications for the wind farm developments at nearby north hoyle and gwynt y mor since there has been cause for concern over possible disturbance during both the construction and production phases .
" under the eu habitats directive , bottlenose dolphins require specific protective measures and that 's why two of three sacs in the uk were created in cardigan bay for the species .
" however , we now know that the cardigan bay animals are regularly coming here as well , so that conservation management must extend to this region . "
