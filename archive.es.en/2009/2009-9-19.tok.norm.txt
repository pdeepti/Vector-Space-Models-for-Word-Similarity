the 155-point list addresses problems from bullets to air conditioning . the outgoing commander of the german bundeswehr in afghanistan has outlined troop and equipment shortcomings hampering german efforts to stabilize the region .
parts of his report were quoted in the german magazine focus and the bild newspaper .
according to statements in focus , general joerg vollmer says at least one additional infantry company is necessary in the kunduz region .
the current number of troops " can not achieve the immediate and wide-reaching improvement of the circumstances in the greater kunduz region , " vollmer is quoted as saying .
equipment shortages additionally , the bild newspaper reports that vollmer advises for more armored vehicles for german troops in the area .
he says that of 38 armored vehicles that have been taken out of service between january and june , none have been replaced .
vollmer adds that some of the equipment that is already available does not fulfil the needs of the troops .
for example , the helicopters in service are " effectively limited only to support operations , " vollmer told focus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier met vollmer in afghanistan last april according to the commander , the lack of air conditioning in the german marder tanks leads to blistering internal temperatures of 80 degrees celcius -lrb- 176 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , and the type of munitions supplied for certain machine guns are not appropriate for the tasks the soldiers are doing .
in a separate article published in focus , foreign minister and candidate for chancellor frank-walter steinmeier however insisted that german forces in northern afghanistan are in good shape , and also spoke against spreading german troops into other regions of the country .
" the civilian organizations and the bundeswehr troops are networked really well , they know the political figures and the tribal structure , " steinmeier said in focus .
" it would be absurd to give up this position and spread into other regions . "
mistakes by german officer in tanker bombing ?
german magazine spiegel meanwhile on saturday alleged that serious mistakes were made by a german officer regarding the controversial tanker bombing earlier in the month in afghanistan .
taliban militants had hijacked the tankers from nato forces .
estimates by afghan officials claim 99 dead in the attack , including 30 civilians .
according to the spiegel article , german colonel georg klein opted against a fly-by of f-15 airplanes before the actual bombing began .
had a fly-by been ordered , it could have given civilians near the tanker the chance to flee before the bombing began. mz / afp / reuters / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
sarkozy , whose government is to introduce a carbon levy on domestic fuel emissions in 2010 , has repeatedly argued for a european union carbon tax on imports from regions with poor environmental standards .
germany had yet to come out in favor of a carbon tax on imports , which a german minister has warned could be perceived by developing nations as a form of " eco-imperialism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy will meet with world leaders at the un on tuesday before heading off to the g20 summit in pittsburgh in addition , the letter also stated that efforts for an international agreement to fight global warming have to start at next week 's un conference on climate change in new york .
in order to reach a " global and ambitious treaty " at december 's climate summit in copenhagen , the negotiators have to receive " a clear mandate . "
it was only in this way that global warming would be limited to two degrees celsius over the pre-industrial level , the statement said .
us and india consider their own climate tax france and germany are n't the only nations considering a climate tax .
across the atlantic the us house of representatives has included a carbon tariff in its climate change bill to address concerns the nation 's steel , cement and other big energy-consuming industries would be adversely affected by any deal to reduce carbon emissions .
however , many of the country 's experts have warned that the proposal could backfire on the united states by causing other nations to pose their own tariffs on us goods .
both china and india , the world 's largest and fourth largest emitters of greenhouse gases respectively , have criticized the move , calling it an unfair attack on their trade , and have already proposed measures to counteract it .
india , for example , has suggested taxing imports based on the carbon emissions of the exporting country , which would have a large impact on the us , as its per capita emissions are higher than most countries . mrm / dpa / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 19.09.2009 literature festivals in germany are drawing record crowds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : book festivals are catching on in almost every city in germany there 've never been so many opportunities to hear literature read aloud in germany .
as berlin 's international literature festival draws to a close , deutsche welle takes a look at why book festivals are catching on . the days of simply buying a book and enjoying it for the text between its covers are over .
germany has become the land of literature festivals . three hundred separate events are listed on the program for berlin 's international literature festival this year . the festival – the city 's ninth – has drawn around 30,000 book lovers . meanwhile , in the city of hamburg , many authors are taking the stage at the harbor front literature festival . return to the spoken word bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some visitors cherish hearing their favorite authors speak to an audience every city that prizes culture in germany naturally holds books and authors in high regard .
if it 's a nice summer night , visitors to these literature events will sit outside for hours on hard wooden stools just to hear the voices of their favorite authors reading on stage . these days most books are translated into multiple languages .
so even if the author reads his work in another language , which may not even be one that the visitor understands , many say the experience can still be a powerful one .
for some visitors , all that matters is that the author himself is reading his work . regina dyck leads one of the oldest literature festivals in germany : " poetry on the road , " which is held in the northern port city of bremen . " meeting an author and listening to him read his own work is an intimate experience , which makes the pleasure of literature more sensual .
for some , the paperback alone can not offer such an experience , " she says , trying to offer some insight into what draws the readers to such events . " perhaps these spoken word events awaken something primal in the visitor , something that responds to the spoken narrative .
before the printing press was invented , of course , stories were told verbally and people relied on the spoken word much more . " sweating , stuttering and extroverted berlin literature researcher christina foerner also believes there is another reason for the literature festivals ' popularity : they demystify the author . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literature expert christina foerner " the only thing most people often know about these authors is their work , " she says . " the author to them is usually a great mystery .
when people come to these events , many questions regarding the author and his work get answered .
some of the mystery is taken out , which many find pleasing . " some authors are shy ; some are extroverted .
some sweat or stutter .
some are gray and balding .
" the public is able to connect with the authors more easily when they see that the authors are only human , and the book was not created by some divine force but by a regular hardworking person , " foerner says . most importantly , the audience wants to see the authors , for all their imperfections .
sometimes the literature event can even turn into a spectacle .
such was the case in 1983 , when the german author rainald goetz made an appearance on tv for a literature debate . when a critic made a comment goetz did n't like , the writer pulled out a razorblade and slashed his own forehead , letting the blood run down his face . the german writer harry rowohlts , whose readings are enormously popular , describes his spoken word events as a place to get drunk and maybe talk about literature . catering and fun for the kids the act of seeking contact with an author is an old tradition .
earlier , this was restricted to people who belonged to the author 's " literary circle . "
nowadays , writers are more available to the general public .
it also helps that publishing houses sometimes push authors to do the readings .
literature festivals , after all , are places where books are marketed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich schreiber , head of the berlin festival says the event is good for readers and industry " everyone goes home happy , both the readers and the industry , " says ulrich schreiber , host of berlin 's international literature festival . and the events are all-inclusive affairs : some are fully catered while others provide activities for children . although not all authors enjoy taking part in such literature festivals , there are many that are still willing to discuss their hard work and the creative process with an audience . foerner , however , believes that the festivals are directing too much attention away from the actual product .
" unfortunately , " she says , " in today 's day and age , it 's not longer sufficient to be a very good writer .
you also have to learn how to deliver your product effectively . " love for books nothing new although spoken word events seem to be the latest manifestation of germany 's love for literature , the country has long held the genre in high esteem and therefore done much to foster the book industry . in fact , the frankfurt book fair , which is held every year in the city , is considered one of the most important trade fairs for the publishing industry .
representatives from thousands of publishing houses across the world come to the fair to negotiate international publishing rights and licensing fees . this year the fair runs from october 14 to 18 . author : heiner kiesel -lrb- cs -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 155-point list addresses problems from bullets to air conditioning . the outgoing commander of the german bundeswehr in afghanistan has outlined troop and equipment shortcomings hampering german efforts to stabilize the region .
parts of his report were quoted in the german magazine focus and the bild newspaper .
according to statements in focus , general joerg vollmer says at least one additional infantry company is necessary in the kunduz region .
the current number of troops " can not achieve the immediate and wide-reaching improvement of the circumstances in the greater kunduz region , " vollmer is quoted as saying .
equipment shortages additionally , the bild newspaper reports that vollmer advises for more armored vehicles for german troops in the area .
he says that of 38 armored vehicles that have been taken out of service between january and june , none have been replaced .
vollmer adds that some of the equipment that is already available does not fulfil the needs of the troops .
for example , the helicopters in service are " effectively limited only to support operations , " vollmer told focus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier met vollmer in afghanistan last april according to the commander , the lack of air conditioning in the german marder tanks leads to blistering internal temperatures of 80 degrees celcius -lrb- 176 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , and the type of munitions supplied for certain machine guns are not appropriate for the tasks the soldiers are doing .
in a separate article published in focus , foreign minister and candidate for chancellor frank-walter steinmeier however insisted that german forces in northern afghanistan are in good shape , and also spoke against spreading german troops into other regions of the country .
" the civilian organizations and the bundeswehr troops are networked really well , they know the political figures and the tribal structure , " steinmeier said in focus .
" it would be absurd to give up this position and spread into other regions . "
mistakes by german officer in tanker bombing ?
german magazine spiegel meanwhile on saturday alleged that serious mistakes were made by a german officer regarding the controversial tanker bombing earlier in the month in afghanistan .
taliban militants had hijacked the tankers from nato forces .
estimates by afghan officials claim 99 dead in the attack , including 30 civilians .
according to the spiegel article , german colonel georg klein opted against a fly-by of f-15 airplanes before the actual bombing began .
had a fly-by been ordered , it could have given civilians near the tanker the chance to flee before the bombing began. mz / afp / reuters / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as berlin 's international literature festival draws to a close , deutsche welle takes a look at why book festivals are catching on . the days of simply buying a book and enjoying it for the text between its covers are over .
germany has become the land of literature festivals . three hundred separate events are listed on the program for berlin 's international literature festival this year . the festival – the city 's ninth – has drawn around 30,000 book lovers . meanwhile , in the city of hamburg , many authors are taking the stage at the harbor front literature festival . return to the spoken word bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some visitors cherish hearing their favorite authors speak to an audience every city that prizes culture in germany naturally holds books and authors in high regard .
if it 's a nice summer night , visitors to these literature events will sit outside for hours on hard wooden stools just to hear the voices of their favorite authors reading on stage . these days most books are translated into multiple languages .
so even if the author reads his work in another language , which may not even be one that the visitor understands , many say the experience can still be a powerful one .
for some visitors , all that matters is that the author himself is reading his work . regina dyck leads one of the oldest literature festivals in germany : " poetry on the road , " which is held in the northern port city of bremen . " meeting an author and listening to him read his own work is an intimate experience , which makes the pleasure of literature more sensual .
for some , the paperback alone can not offer such an experience , " she says , trying to offer some insight into what draws the readers to such events . " perhaps these spoken word events awaken something primal in the visitor , something that responds to the spoken narrative .
before the printing press was invented , of course , stories were told verbally and people relied on the spoken word much more . " sweating , stuttering and extroverted berlin literature researcher christina foerner also believes there is another reason for the literature festivals ' popularity : they demystify the author . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literature expert christina foerner " the only thing most people often know about these authors is their work , " she says . " the author to them is usually a great mystery .
when people come to these events , many questions regarding the author and his work get answered .
some of the mystery is taken out , which many find pleasing . " some authors are shy ; some are extroverted .
some sweat or stutter .
some are gray and balding .
" the public is able to connect with the authors more easily when they see that the authors are only human , and the book was not created by some divine force but by a regular hardworking person , " foerner says . most importantly , the audience wants to see the authors , for all their imperfections .
sometimes the literature event can even turn into a spectacle .
such was the case in 1983 , when the german author rainald goetz made an appearance on tv for a literature debate . when a critic made a comment goetz did n't like , the writer pulled out a razorblade and slashed his own forehead , letting the blood run down his face . the german writer harry rowohlts , whose readings are enormously popular , describes his spoken word events as a place to get drunk and maybe talk about literature . catering and fun for the kids the act of seeking contact with an author is an old tradition .
earlier , this was restricted to people who belonged to the author 's " literary circle . "
nowadays , writers are more available to the general public .
it also helps that publishing houses sometimes push authors to do the readings .
literature festivals , after all , are places where books are marketed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich schreiber , head of the berlin festival says the event is good for readers and industry " everyone goes home happy , both the readers and the industry , " says ulrich schreiber , host of berlin 's international literature festival . and the events are all-inclusive affairs : some are fully catered while others provide activities for children . although not all authors enjoy taking part in such literature festivals , there are many that are still willing to discuss their hard work and the creative process with an audience . foerner , however , believes that the festivals are directing too much attention away from the actual product .
" unfortunately , " she says , " in today 's day and age , it 's not longer sufficient to be a very good writer .
you also have to learn how to deliver your product effectively . " love for books nothing new although spoken word events seem to be the latest manifestation of germany 's love for literature , the country has long held the genre in high esteem and therefore done much to foster the book industry . in fact , the frankfurt book fair , which is held every year in the city , is considered one of the most important trade fairs for the publishing industry .

as berlin 's international literature festival draws to a close , deutsche welle takes a look at why book festivals are catching on . the days of simply buying a book and enjoying it for the text between its covers are over .
germany has become the land of literature festivals . three hundred separate events are listed on the program for berlin 's international literature festival this year . the festival – the city 's ninth – has drawn around 30,000 book lovers . meanwhile , in the city of hamburg , many authors are taking the stage at the harbor front literature festival . return to the spoken word bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some visitors cherish hearing their favorite authors speak to an audience every city that prizes culture in germany naturally holds books and authors in high regard .
if it 's a nice summer night , visitors to these literature events will sit outside for hours on hard wooden stools just to hear the voices of their favorite authors reading on stage . these days most books are translated into multiple languages .
so even if the author reads his work in another language , which may not even be one that the visitor understands , many say the experience can still be a powerful one .
for some visitors , all that matters is that the author himself is reading his work . regina dyck leads one of the oldest literature festivals in germany : " poetry on the road , " which is held in the northern port city of bremen . " meeting an author and listening to him read his own work is an intimate experience , which makes the pleasure of literature more sensual .
for some , the paperback alone can not offer such an experience , " she says , trying to offer some insight into what draws the readers to such events . " perhaps these spoken word events awaken something primal in the visitor , something that responds to the spoken narrative .
before the printing press was invented , of course , stories were told verbally and people relied on the spoken word much more . " sweating , stuttering and extroverted berlin literature researcher christina foerner also believes there is another reason for the literature festivals ' popularity : they demystify the author . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literature expert christina foerner " the only thing most people often know about these authors is their work , " she says . " the author to them is usually a great mystery .
when people come to these events , many questions regarding the author and his work get answered .
some of the mystery is taken out , which many find pleasing . " some authors are shy ; some are extroverted .
some sweat or stutter .
some are gray and balding .
" the public is able to connect with the authors more easily when they see that the authors are only human , and the book was not created by some divine force but by a regular hardworking person , " foerner says . most importantly , the audience wants to see the authors , for all their imperfections .
sometimes the literature event can even turn into a spectacle .
such was the case in 1983 , when the german author rainald goetz made an appearance on tv for a literature debate . when a critic made a comment goetz did n't like , the writer pulled out a razorblade and slashed his own forehead , letting the blood run down his face . the german writer harry rowohlts , whose readings are enormously popular , describes his spoken word events as a place to get drunk and maybe talk about literature . catering and fun for the kids the act of seeking contact with an author is an old tradition .
earlier , this was restricted to people who belonged to the author 's " literary circle . "
nowadays , writers are more available to the general public .
it also helps that publishing houses sometimes push authors to do the readings .
literature festivals , after all , are places where books are marketed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich schreiber , head of the berlin festival says the event is good for readers and industry " everyone goes home happy , both the readers and the industry , " says ulrich schreiber , host of berlin 's international literature festival . and the events are all-inclusive affairs : some are fully catered while others provide activities for children . although not all authors enjoy taking part in such literature festivals , there are many that are still willing to discuss their hard work and the creative process with an audience . foerner , however , believes that the festivals are directing too much attention away from the actual product .
" unfortunately , " she says , " in today 's day and age , it 's not longer sufficient to be a very good writer .
you also have to learn how to deliver your product effectively . " love for books nothing new although spoken word events seem to be the latest manifestation of germany 's love for literature , the country has long held the genre in high esteem and therefore done much to foster the book industry . in fact , the frankfurt book fair , which is held every year in the city , is considered one of the most important trade fairs for the publishing industry .
representatives from thousands of publishing houses across the world come to the fair to negotiate international publishing rights and licensing fees . this year the fair runs from october 14 to 18 . author : heiner kiesel -lrb- cs -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
sarkozy , whose government is to introduce a carbon levy on domestic fuel emissions in 2010 , has repeatedly argued for a european union carbon tax on imports from regions with poor environmental standards .
germany had yet to come out in favor of a carbon tax on imports , which a german minister has warned could be perceived by developing nations as a form of " eco-imperialism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy will meet with world leaders at the un on tuesday before heading off to the g20 summit in pittsburgh in addition , the letter also stated that efforts for an international agreement to fight global warming have to start at next week 's un conference on climate change in new york .
in order to reach a " global and ambitious treaty " at december 's climate summit in copenhagen , the negotiators have to receive " a clear mandate . "
it was only in this way that global warming would be limited to two degrees celsius over the pre-industrial level , the statement said .
us and india consider their own climate tax france and germany are n't the only nations considering a climate tax .
across the atlantic the us house of representatives has included a carbon tariff in its climate change bill to address concerns the nation 's steel , cement and other big energy-consuming industries would be adversely affected by any deal to reduce carbon emissions .
however , many of the country 's experts have warned that the proposal could backfire on the united states by causing other nations to pose their own tariffs on us goods .
both china and india , the world 's largest and fourth largest emitters of greenhouse gases respectively , have criticized the move , calling it an unfair attack on their trade , and have already proposed measures to counteract it .
india , for example , has suggested taxing imports based on the carbon emissions of the exporting country , which would have a large impact on the us , as its per capita emissions are higher than most countries . mrm / dpa / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

india , for example , has suggested taxing imports based on the carbon emissions of the exporting country , which would have a large impact on the us , as its per capita emissions are higher than most countries . mrm / dpa / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 19.09.2009 literature festivals in germany are drawing record crowds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : book festivals are catching on in almost every city in germany there 've never been so many opportunities to hear literature read aloud in germany .
as berlin 's international literature festival draws to a close , deutsche welle takes a look at why book festivals are catching on . the days of simply buying a book and enjoying it for the text between its covers are over .
germany has become the land of literature festivals . three hundred separate events are listed on the program for berlin 's international literature festival this year . the festival – the city 's ninth – has drawn around 30,000 book lovers . meanwhile , in the city of hamburg , many authors are taking the stage at the harbor front literature festival . return to the spoken word bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some visitors cherish hearing their favorite authors speak to an audience every city that prizes culture in germany naturally holds books and authors in high regard .
if it 's a nice summer night , visitors to these literature events will sit outside for hours on hard wooden stools just to hear the voices of their favorite authors reading on stage . these days most books are translated into multiple languages .
so even if the author reads his work in another language , which may not even be one that the visitor understands , many say the experience can still be a powerful one .
for some visitors , all that matters is that the author himself is reading his work . regina dyck leads one of the oldest literature festivals in germany : " poetry on the road , " which is held in the northern port city of bremen . " meeting an author and listening to him read his own work is an intimate experience , which makes the pleasure of literature more sensual .
for some , the paperback alone can not offer such an experience , " she says , trying to offer some insight into what draws the readers to such events . " perhaps these spoken word events awaken something primal in the visitor , something that responds to the spoken narrative .
before the printing press was invented , of course , stories were told verbally and people relied on the spoken word much more . " sweating , stuttering and extroverted berlin literature researcher christina foerner also believes there is another reason for the literature festivals ' popularity : they demystify the author . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literature expert christina foerner " the only thing most people often know about these authors is their work , " she says . " the author to them is usually a great mystery .
when people come to these events , many questions regarding the author and his work get answered .
some of the mystery is taken out , which many find pleasing . " some authors are shy ; some are extroverted .
some sweat or stutter .
some are gray and balding .
" the public is able to connect with the authors more easily when they see that the authors are only human , and the book was not created by some divine force but by a regular hardworking person , " foerner says . most importantly , the audience wants to see the authors , for all their imperfections .
sometimes the literature event can even turn into a spectacle .
such was the case in 1983 , when the german author rainald goetz made an appearance on tv for a literature debate . when a critic made a comment goetz did n't like , the writer pulled out a razorblade and slashed his own forehead , letting the blood run down his face . the german writer harry rowohlts , whose readings are enormously popular , describes his spoken word events as a place to get drunk and maybe talk about literature . catering and fun for the kids the act of seeking contact with an author is an old tradition .
earlier , this was restricted to people who belonged to the author 's " literary circle . "
nowadays , writers are more available to the general public .
it also helps that publishing houses sometimes push authors to do the readings .
literature festivals , after all , are places where books are marketed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich schreiber , head of the berlin festival says the event is good for readers and industry " everyone goes home happy , both the readers and the industry , " says ulrich schreiber , host of berlin 's international literature festival . and the events are all-inclusive affairs : some are fully catered while others provide activities for children . although not all authors enjoy taking part in such literature festivals , there are many that are still willing to discuss their hard work and the creative process with an audience . foerner , however , believes that the festivals are directing too much attention away from the actual product .
" unfortunately , " she says , " in today 's day and age , it 's not longer sufficient to be a very good writer .
you also have to learn how to deliver your product effectively . " love for books nothing new although spoken word events seem to be the latest manifestation of germany 's love for literature , the country has long held the genre in high esteem and therefore done much to foster the book industry . in fact , the frankfurt book fair , which is held every year in the city , is considered one of the most important trade fairs for the publishing industry .
representatives from thousands of publishing houses across the world come to the fair to negotiate international publishing rights and licensing fees . this year the fair runs from october 14 to 18 . author : heiner kiesel -lrb- cs -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
sarkozy , whose government is to introduce a carbon levy on domestic fuel emissions in 2010 , has repeatedly argued for a european union carbon tax on imports from regions with poor environmental standards .
germany had yet to come out in favor of a carbon tax on imports , which a german minister has warned could be perceived by developing nations as a form of " eco-imperialism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy will meet with world leaders at the un on tuesday before heading off to the g20 summit in pittsburgh in addition , the letter also stated that efforts for an international agreement to fight global warming have to start at next week 's un conference on climate change in new york .
in order to reach a " global and ambitious treaty " at december 's climate summit in copenhagen , the negotiators have to receive " a clear mandate . "
it was only in this way that global warming would be limited to two degrees celsius over the pre-industrial level , the statement said .
us and india consider their own climate tax france and germany are n't the only nations considering a climate tax .
across the atlantic the us house of representatives has included a carbon tariff in its climate change bill to address concerns the nation 's steel , cement and other big energy-consuming industries would be adversely affected by any deal to reduce carbon emissions .
however , many of the country 's experts have warned that the proposal could backfire on the united states by causing other nations to pose their own tariffs on us goods .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sberbank is part of the consortium that has purchased a majority stake in opel gref 's comments echo sentiments expressed by russian prime minister vladimir putin , who said that his country needed more foreign technology than foreign investors .
" we have a need not only for money – though this is of course very important – but first of all for the knowledge and experience of the main world players , " putin in a speech on the first day of the economic forum .
when general motors sold its german subsidiary opel to magna , it insisted on restrictions to the transfer of technology .
putin commends opel purchase however , the russian leader praised the opel purchase as an " encouraging example " that he hopes will set a precedent for further fruitful partnerships with foreign companies .
opel chairman hans demant said in an interview with a polish daily this week that under the deal , opel would produce its astra model cars in russia .
gaz , russia 's second-largest car manufacturer , is poised to turn over its sprawling assembly line and distribution network to produce opel cars for the russian market .
the deal comes at a time when russia 's car market , hailed as the world 's fastest growing before the economic crisis , has shrunk by almost half this year .
the downturn has dealt a blow to russian carmakers already struggling to compete with the flood of foreign imports .
talks over job losses meanwhile , talks between european unions and delegates from general motors and magna are set to begin next week over plans to cut 10,500 jobs at opel to save labour costs to the tune of hundreds of millions of euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bochum plant is expected to shed thousands of jobs " in the coming week , works councils and trade unions will begin the negotiations over the future of the european sites and our jobs , " a flyer distributed to opel workers in germany said .
each country that is home to an opel plant is expected to send workers ' representatives to ruesselsheim to meet with negotiating partners from gm and magna .
trade union leaders at opel 's eight western european plants are worried about how much volume they each might have to relinquish to benefit another site .
however , the biggest job losses are expected to be in the bochum factory in germany – which could lose production of the astra compact and transmission production – as well as the unit in antwerp .
opel 's belgian plant is in danger of being closed entirely .

the 155-point list addresses problems from bullets to air conditioning . the outgoing commander of the german bundeswehr in afghanistan has outlined troop and equipment shortcomings hampering german efforts to stabilize the region .
parts of his report were quoted in the german magazine focus and the bild newspaper .
according to statements in focus , general joerg vollmer says at least one additional infantry company is necessary in the kunduz region .
the current number of troops " can not achieve the immediate and wide-reaching improvement of the circumstances in the greater kunduz region , " vollmer is quoted as saying .
equipment shortages additionally , the bild newspaper reports that vollmer advises for more armored vehicles for german troops in the area .
he says that of 38 armored vehicles that have been taken out of service between january and june , none have been replaced .
vollmer adds that some of the equipment that is already available does not fulfil the needs of the troops .
for example , the helicopters in service are " effectively limited only to support operations , " vollmer told focus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier met vollmer in afghanistan last april according to the commander , the lack of air conditioning in the german marder tanks leads to blistering internal temperatures of 80 degrees celcius -lrb- 176 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , and the type of munitions supplied for certain machine guns are not appropriate for the tasks the soldiers are doing .
in a separate article published in focus , foreign minister and candidate for chancellor frank-walter steinmeier however insisted that german forces in northern afghanistan are in good shape , and also spoke against spreading german troops into other regions of the country .
" the civilian organizations and the bundeswehr troops are networked really well , they know the political figures and the tribal structure , " steinmeier said in focus .
" it would be absurd to give up this position and spread into other regions . "
mistakes by german officer in tanker bombing ?
german magazine spiegel meanwhile on saturday alleged that serious mistakes were made by a german officer regarding the controversial tanker bombing earlier in the month in afghanistan .
taliban militants had hijacked the tankers from nato forces .
estimates by afghan officials claim 99 dead in the attack , including 30 civilians .
according to the spiegel article , german colonel georg klein opted against a fly-by of f-15 airplanes before the actual bombing began .
had a fly-by been ordered , it could have given civilians near the tanker the chance to flee before the bombing began. mz / afp / reuters / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as berlin 's international literature festival draws to a close , deutsche welle takes a look at why book festivals are catching on . the days of simply buying a book and enjoying it for the text between its covers are over .
germany has become the land of literature festivals . three hundred separate events are listed on the program for berlin 's international literature festival this year . the festival – the city 's ninth – has drawn around 30,000 book lovers . meanwhile , in the city of hamburg , many authors are taking the stage at the harbor front literature festival . return to the spoken word bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some visitors cherish hearing their favorite authors speak to an audience every city that prizes culture in germany naturally holds books and authors in high regard .
if it 's a nice summer night , visitors to these literature events will sit outside for hours on hard wooden stools just to hear the voices of their favorite authors reading on stage . these days most books are translated into multiple languages .
so even if the author reads his work in another language , which may not even be one that the visitor understands , many say the experience can still be a powerful one .
for some visitors , all that matters is that the author himself is reading his work . regina dyck leads one of the oldest literature festivals in germany : " poetry on the road , " which is held in the northern port city of bremen . " meeting an author and listening to him read his own work is an intimate experience , which makes the pleasure of literature more sensual .
for some , the paperback alone can not offer such an experience , " she says , trying to offer some insight into what draws the readers to such events . " perhaps these spoken word events awaken something primal in the visitor , something that responds to the spoken narrative .
before the printing press was invented , of course , stories were told verbally and people relied on the spoken word much more . " sweating , stuttering and extroverted berlin literature researcher christina foerner also believes there is another reason for the literature festivals ' popularity : they demystify the author . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literature expert christina foerner " the only thing most people often know about these authors is their work , " she says . " the author to them is usually a great mystery .
when people come to these events , many questions regarding the author and his work get answered .
some of the mystery is taken out , which many find pleasing . " some authors are shy ; some are extroverted .
some sweat or stutter .
some are gray and balding .
" the public is able to connect with the authors more easily when they see that the authors are only human , and the book was not created by some divine force but by a regular hardworking person , " foerner says . most importantly , the audience wants to see the authors , for all their imperfections .
sometimes the literature event can even turn into a spectacle .
such was the case in 1983 , when the german author rainald goetz made an appearance on tv for a literature debate . when a critic made a comment goetz did n't like , the writer pulled out a razorblade and slashed his own forehead , letting the blood run down his face . the german writer harry rowohlts , whose readings are enormously popular , describes his spoken word events as a place to get drunk and maybe talk about literature . catering and fun for the kids the act of seeking contact with an author is an old tradition .
earlier , this was restricted to people who belonged to the author 's " literary circle . "
nowadays , writers are more available to the general public .
it also helps that publishing houses sometimes push authors to do the readings .
literature festivals , after all , are places where books are marketed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich schreiber , head of the berlin festival says the event is good for readers and industry " everyone goes home happy , both the readers and the industry , " says ulrich schreiber , host of berlin 's international literature festival . and the events are all-inclusive affairs : some are fully catered while others provide activities for children . although not all authors enjoy taking part in such literature festivals , there are many that are still willing to discuss their hard work and the creative process with an audience . foerner , however , believes that the festivals are directing too much attention away from the actual product .
" unfortunately , " she says , " in today 's day and age , it 's not longer sufficient to be a very good writer .

as berlin 's international literature festival draws to a close , deutsche welle takes a look at why book festivals are catching on . the days of simply buying a book and enjoying it for the text between its covers are over .
germany has become the land of literature festivals . three hundred separate events are listed on the program for berlin 's international literature festival this year . the festival – the city 's ninth – has drawn around 30,000 book lovers . meanwhile , in the city of hamburg , many authors are taking the stage at the harbor front literature festival . return to the spoken word bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some visitors cherish hearing their favorite authors speak to an audience every city that prizes culture in germany naturally holds books and authors in high regard .
if it 's a nice summer night , visitors to these literature events will sit outside for hours on hard wooden stools just to hear the voices of their favorite authors reading on stage . these days most books are translated into multiple languages .
so even if the author reads his work in another language , which may not even be one that the visitor understands , many say the experience can still be a powerful one .
for some visitors , all that matters is that the author himself is reading his work . regina dyck leads one of the oldest literature festivals in germany : " poetry on the road , " which is held in the northern port city of bremen . " meeting an author and listening to him read his own work is an intimate experience , which makes the pleasure of literature more sensual .
for some , the paperback alone can not offer such an experience , " she says , trying to offer some insight into what draws the readers to such events . " perhaps these spoken word events awaken something primal in the visitor , something that responds to the spoken narrative .
before the printing press was invented , of course , stories were told verbally and people relied on the spoken word much more . " sweating , stuttering and extroverted berlin literature researcher christina foerner also believes there is another reason for the literature festivals ' popularity : they demystify the author . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literature expert christina foerner " the only thing most people often know about these authors is their work , " she says . " the author to them is usually a great mystery .
when people come to these events , many questions regarding the author and his work get answered .
some of the mystery is taken out , which many find pleasing . " some authors are shy ; some are extroverted .
some sweat or stutter .
some are gray and balding .
" the public is able to connect with the authors more easily when they see that the authors are only human , and the book was not created by some divine force but by a regular hardworking person , " foerner says . most importantly , the audience wants to see the authors , for all their imperfections .
sometimes the literature event can even turn into a spectacle .
such was the case in 1983 , when the german author rainald goetz made an appearance on tv for a literature debate . when a critic made a comment goetz did n't like , the writer pulled out a razorblade and slashed his own forehead , letting the blood run down his face . the german writer harry rowohlts , whose readings are enormously popular , describes his spoken word events as a place to get drunk and maybe talk about literature . catering and fun for the kids the act of seeking contact with an author is an old tradition .
earlier , this was restricted to people who belonged to the author 's " literary circle . "
nowadays , writers are more available to the general public .
it also helps that publishing houses sometimes push authors to do the readings .
literature festivals , after all , are places where books are marketed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich schreiber , head of the berlin festival says the event is good for readers and industry " everyone goes home happy , both the readers and the industry , " says ulrich schreiber , host of berlin 's international literature festival . and the events are all-inclusive affairs : some are fully catered while others provide activities for children . although not all authors enjoy taking part in such literature festivals , there are many that are still willing to discuss their hard work and the creative process with an audience . foerner , however , believes that the festivals are directing too much attention away from the actual product .
" unfortunately , " she says , " in today 's day and age , it 's not longer sufficient to be a very good writer .
you also have to learn how to deliver your product effectively .

the celebration was spared last year 's dirndl scandal by seehofer 's wife , karin , who showed up dressed in the traditional manner .

the 16-day festival , which goes until october 4 , is a huge tourist draw for the southern german city , which began holding the event back in 1810 .
it started out as a party to celebrate the wedding of crown prince ludwig i to princess therese von saxe-hildburghausen .
the large green on which everyone celebrates today is known as theresienwiese , named in honor of the bride , and was the site of a horse race on the couple 's wedding day. mrm / dpa / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the point of our participation in the deal is for the import of technology .
if this does n't happen , then we wasted our time , " german gref was quoted by news agency ria novosti as saying .
he was speaking at an economic forum in the black sea resort of sochi meant to garner greater foreign investment in russia .
the state-owned sberbank has teamed up with canadian auto parts maker magna to purchase a joint majority 55-percent stake in opel , while general motors will retain 35 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sberbank is part of the consortium that has purchased a majority stake in opel gref 's comments echo sentiments expressed by russian prime minister vladimir putin , who said that his country needed more foreign technology than foreign investors .
" we have a need not only for money – though this is of course very important – but first of all for the knowledge and experience of the main world players , " putin in a speech on the first day of the economic forum .
when general motors sold its german subsidiary opel to magna , it insisted on restrictions to the transfer of technology .
putin commends opel purchase however , the russian leader praised the opel purchase as an " encouraging example " that he hopes will set a precedent for further fruitful partnerships with foreign companies .
opel chairman hans demant said in an interview with a polish daily this week that under the deal , opel would produce its astra model cars in russia .
gaz , russia 's second-largest car manufacturer , is poised to turn over its sprawling assembly line and distribution network to produce opel cars for the russian market .
the deal comes at a time when russia 's car market , hailed as the world 's fastest growing before the economic crisis , has shrunk by almost half this year .
the downturn has dealt a blow to russian carmakers already struggling to compete with the flood of foreign imports .
talks over job losses meanwhile , talks between european unions and delegates from general motors and magna are set to begin next week over plans to cut 10,500 jobs at opel to save labour costs to the tune of hundreds of millions of euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bochum plant is expected to shed thousands of jobs " in the coming week , works councils and trade unions will begin the negotiations over the future of the european sites and our jobs , " a flyer distributed to opel workers in germany said .
each country that is home to an opel plant is expected to send workers ' representatives to ruesselsheim to meet with negotiating partners from gm and magna .
trade union leaders at opel 's eight western european plants are worried about how much volume they each might have to relinquish to benefit another site .
however , the biggest job losses are expected to be in the bochum factory in germany – which could lose production of the astra compact and transmission production – as well as the unit in antwerp .
opel 's belgian plant is in danger of being closed entirely .

" the point of our participation in the deal is for the import of technology .
if this does n't happen , then we wasted our time , " german gref was quoted by news agency ria novosti as saying .
he was speaking at an economic forum in the black sea resort of sochi meant to garner greater foreign investment in russia .
the state-owned sberbank has teamed up with canadian auto parts maker magna to purchase a joint majority 55-percent stake in opel , while general motors will retain 35 percent .

gaz , russia 's second-largest car manufacturer , is poised to turn over its sprawling assembly line and distribution network to produce opel cars for the russian market .
the deal comes at a time when russia 's car market , hailed as the world 's fastest growing before the economic crisis , has shrunk by almost half this year .
the downturn has dealt a blow to russian carmakers already struggling to compete with the flood of foreign imports .
talks over job losses meanwhile , talks between european unions and delegates from general motors and magna are set to begin next week over plans to cut 10,500 jobs at opel to save labour costs to the tune of hundreds of millions of euros .

" the point of our participation in the deal is for the import of technology .
if this does n't happen , then we wasted our time , " german gref was quoted by news agency ria novosti as saying .
he was speaking at an economic forum in the black sea resort of sochi meant to garner greater foreign investment in russia .
the state-owned sberbank has teamed up with canadian auto parts maker magna to purchase a joint majority 55-percent stake in opel , while general motors will retain 35 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sberbank is part of the consortium that has purchased a majority stake in opel gref 's comments echo sentiments expressed by russian prime minister vladimir putin , who said that his country needed more foreign technology than foreign investors .
" we have a need not only for money – though this is of course very important – but first of all for the knowledge and experience of the main world players , " putin in a speech on the first day of the economic forum .
when general motors sold its german subsidiary opel to magna , it insisted on restrictions to the transfer of technology .
putin commends opel purchase however , the russian leader praised the opel purchase as an " encouraging example " that he hopes will set a precedent for further fruitful partnerships with foreign companies .
opel chairman hans demant said in an interview with a polish daily this week that under the deal , opel would produce its astra model cars in russia .
gaz , russia 's second-largest car manufacturer , is poised to turn over its sprawling assembly line and distribution network to produce opel cars for the russian market .
the deal comes at a time when russia 's car market , hailed as the world 's fastest growing before the economic crisis , has shrunk by almost half this year .
the downturn has dealt a blow to russian carmakers already struggling to compete with the flood of foreign imports .
talks over job losses meanwhile , talks between european unions and delegates from general motors and magna are set to begin next week over plans to cut 10,500 jobs at opel to save labour costs to the tune of hundreds of millions of euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bochum plant is expected to shed thousands of jobs " in the coming week , works councils and trade unions will begin the negotiations over the future of the european sites and our jobs , " a flyer distributed to opel workers in germany said .
each country that is home to an opel plant is expected to send workers ' representatives to ruesselsheim to meet with negotiating partners from gm and magna .
trade union leaders at opel 's eight western european plants are worried about how much volume they each might have to relinquish to benefit another site .
however , the biggest job losses are expected to be in the bochum factory in germany – which could lose production of the astra compact and transmission production – as well as the unit in antwerp .
opel 's belgian plant is in danger of being closed entirely .

" the point of our participation in the deal is for the import of technology .
if this does n't happen , then we wasted our time , " german gref was quoted by news agency ria novosti as saying .
he was speaking at an economic forum in the black sea resort of sochi meant to garner greater foreign investment in russia .
the state-owned sberbank has teamed up with canadian auto parts maker magna to purchase a joint majority 55-percent stake in opel , while general motors will retain 35 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sberbank is part of the consortium that has purchased a majority stake in opel gref 's comments echo sentiments expressed by russian prime minister vladimir putin , who said that his country needed more foreign technology than foreign investors .
" we have a need not only for money – though this is of course very important – but first of all for the knowledge and experience of the main world players , " putin in a speech on the first day of the economic forum .
when general motors sold its german subsidiary opel to magna , it insisted on restrictions to the transfer of technology .
putin commends opel purchase however , the russian leader praised the opel purchase as an " encouraging example " that he hopes will set a precedent for further fruitful partnerships with foreign companies .
opel chairman hans demant said in an interview with a polish daily this week that under the deal , opel would produce its astra model cars in russia .
gaz , russia 's second-largest car manufacturer , is poised to turn over its sprawling assembly line and distribution network to produce opel cars for the russian market .
the deal comes at a time when russia 's car market , hailed as the world 's fastest growing before the economic crisis , has shrunk by almost half this year .
the downturn has dealt a blow to russian carmakers already struggling to compete with the flood of foreign imports .
talks over job losses meanwhile , talks between european unions and delegates from general motors and magna are set to begin next week over plans to cut 10,500 jobs at opel to save labour costs to the tune of hundreds of millions of euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bochum plant is expected to shed thousands of jobs " in the coming week , works councils and trade unions will begin the negotiations over the future of the european sites and our jobs , " a flyer distributed to opel workers in germany said .
each country that is home to an opel plant is expected to send workers ' representatives to ruesselsheim to meet with negotiating partners from gm and magna .
trade union leaders at opel 's eight western european plants are worried about how much volume they each might have to relinquish to benefit another site .
however , the biggest job losses are expected to be in the bochum factory in germany – which could lose production of the astra compact and transmission production – as well as the unit in antwerp .
opel 's belgian plant is in danger of being closed entirely .

the 155-point list addresses problems from bullets to air conditioning . the outgoing commander of the german bundeswehr in afghanistan has outlined troop and equipment shortcomings hampering german efforts to stabilize the region .
parts of his report were quoted in the german magazine focus and the bild newspaper .
according to statements in focus , general joerg vollmer says at least one additional infantry company is necessary in the kunduz region .
the current number of troops " can not achieve the immediate and wide-reaching improvement of the circumstances in the greater kunduz region , " vollmer is quoted as saying .
equipment shortages additionally , the bild newspaper reports that vollmer advises for more armored vehicles for german troops in the area .
he says that of 38 armored vehicles that have been taken out of service between january and june , none have been replaced .
vollmer adds that some of the equipment that is already available does not fulfil the needs of the troops .
for example , the helicopters in service are " effectively limited only to support operations , " vollmer told focus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier met vollmer in afghanistan last april according to the commander , the lack of air conditioning in the german marder tanks leads to blistering internal temperatures of 80 degrees celcius -lrb- 176 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , and the type of munitions supplied for certain machine guns are not appropriate for the tasks the soldiers are doing .
in a separate article published in focus , foreign minister and candidate for chancellor frank-walter steinmeier however insisted that german forces in northern afghanistan are in good shape , and also spoke against spreading german troops into other regions of the country .
" the civilian organizations and the bundeswehr troops are networked really well , they know the political figures and the tribal structure , " steinmeier said in focus .
" it would be absurd to give up this position and spread into other regions . "
mistakes by german officer in tanker bombing ?
german magazine spiegel meanwhile on saturday alleged that serious mistakes were made by a german officer regarding the controversial tanker bombing earlier in the month in afghanistan .
taliban militants had hijacked the tankers from nato forces .
estimates by afghan officials claim 99 dead in the attack , including 30 civilians .
according to the spiegel article , german colonel georg klein opted against a fly-by of f-15 airplanes before the actual bombing began .
had a fly-by been ordered , it could have given civilians near the tanker the chance to flee before the bombing began. mz / afp / reuters / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 19.09.2009 literature festivals in germany are drawing record crowds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : book festivals are catching on in almost every city in germany there 've never been so many opportunities to hear literature read aloud in germany .
as berlin 's international literature festival draws to a close , deutsche welle takes a look at why book festivals are catching on . the days of simply buying a book and enjoying it for the text between its covers are over .
germany has become the land of literature festivals . three hundred separate events are listed on the program for berlin 's international literature festival this year . the festival – the city 's ninth – has drawn around 30,000 book lovers . meanwhile , in the city of hamburg , many authors are taking the stage at the harbor front literature festival . return to the spoken word bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some visitors cherish hearing their favorite authors speak to an audience every city that prizes culture in germany naturally holds books and authors in high regard .
if it 's a nice summer night , visitors to these literature events will sit outside for hours on hard wooden stools just to hear the voices of their favorite authors reading on stage . these days most books are translated into multiple languages .
so even if the author reads his work in another language , which may not even be one that the visitor understands , many say the experience can still be a powerful one .
for some visitors , all that matters is that the author himself is reading his work . regina dyck leads one of the oldest literature festivals in germany : " poetry on the road , " which is held in the northern port city of bremen . " meeting an author and listening to him read his own work is an intimate experience , which makes the pleasure of literature more sensual .
for some , the paperback alone can not offer such an experience , " she says , trying to offer some insight into what draws the readers to such events . " perhaps these spoken word events awaken something primal in the visitor , something that responds to the spoken narrative .
before the printing press was invented , of course , stories were told verbally and people relied on the spoken word much more . " sweating , stuttering and extroverted berlin literature researcher christina foerner also believes there is another reason for the literature festivals ' popularity : they demystify the author . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literature expert christina foerner " the only thing most people often know about these authors is their work , " she says . " the author to them is usually a great mystery .
when people come to these events , many questions regarding the author and his work get answered .
some of the mystery is taken out , which many find pleasing . " some authors are shy ; some are extroverted .
some sweat or stutter .
some are gray and balding .
" the public is able to connect with the authors more easily when they see that the authors are only human , and the book was not created by some divine force but by a regular hardworking person , " foerner says . most importantly , the audience wants to see the authors , for all their imperfections .
sometimes the literature event can even turn into a spectacle .
such was the case in 1983 , when the german author rainald goetz made an appearance on tv for a literature debate . when a critic made a comment goetz did n't like , the writer pulled out a razorblade and slashed his own forehead , letting the blood run down his face . the german writer harry rowohlts , whose readings are enormously popular , describes his spoken word events as a place to get drunk and maybe talk about literature . catering and fun for the kids the act of seeking contact with an author is an old tradition .
earlier , this was restricted to people who belonged to the author 's " literary circle . "

as berlin 's international literature festival draws to a close , deutsche welle takes a look at why book festivals are catching on . the days of simply buying a book and enjoying it for the text between its covers are over .
germany has become the land of literature festivals . three hundred separate events are listed on the program for berlin 's international literature festival this year . the festival – the city 's ninth – has drawn around 30,000 book lovers . meanwhile , in the city of hamburg , many authors are taking the stage at the harbor front literature festival . return to the spoken word bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some visitors cherish hearing their favorite authors speak to an audience every city that prizes culture in germany naturally holds books and authors in high regard .
if it 's a nice summer night , visitors to these literature events will sit outside for hours on hard wooden stools just to hear the voices of their favorite authors reading on stage . these days most books are translated into multiple languages .
so even if the author reads his work in another language , which may not even be one that the visitor understands , many say the experience can still be a powerful one .
for some visitors , all that matters is that the author himself is reading his work . regina dyck leads one of the oldest literature festivals in germany : " poetry on the road , " which is held in the northern port city of bremen . " meeting an author and listening to him read his own work is an intimate experience , which makes the pleasure of literature more sensual .
for some , the paperback alone can not offer such an experience , " she says , trying to offer some insight into what draws the readers to such events . " perhaps these spoken word events awaken something primal in the visitor , something that responds to the spoken narrative .
before the printing press was invented , of course , stories were told verbally and people relied on the spoken word much more . " sweating , stuttering and extroverted berlin literature researcher christina foerner also believes there is another reason for the literature festivals ' popularity : they demystify the author . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literature expert christina foerner " the only thing most people often know about these authors is their work , " she says . " the author to them is usually a great mystery .
when people come to these events , many questions regarding the author and his work get answered .
some of the mystery is taken out , which many find pleasing . " some authors are shy ; some are extroverted .
some sweat or stutter .
some are gray and balding .
" the public is able to connect with the authors more easily when they see that the authors are only human , and the book was not created by some divine force but by a regular hardworking person , " foerner says . most importantly , the audience wants to see the authors , for all their imperfections .
sometimes the literature event can even turn into a spectacle .
such was the case in 1983 , when the german author rainald goetz made an appearance on tv for a literature debate . when a critic made a comment goetz did n't like , the writer pulled out a razorblade and slashed his own forehead , letting the blood run down his face . the german writer harry rowohlts , whose readings are enormously popular , describes his spoken word events as a place to get drunk and maybe talk about literature . catering and fun for the kids the act of seeking contact with an author is an old tradition .
earlier , this was restricted to people who belonged to the author 's " literary circle . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 19.09.2009 literature festivals in germany are drawing record crowds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : book festivals are catching on in almost every city in germany there 've never been so many opportunities to hear literature read aloud in germany .
as berlin 's international literature festival draws to a close , deutsche welle takes a look at why book festivals are catching on . the days of simply buying a book and enjoying it for the text between its covers are over .
germany has become the land of literature festivals . three hundred separate events are listed on the program for berlin 's international literature festival this year . the festival – the city 's ninth – has drawn around 30,000 book lovers . meanwhile , in the city of hamburg , many authors are taking the stage at the harbor front literature festival . return to the spoken word bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some visitors cherish hearing their favorite authors speak to an audience every city that prizes culture in germany naturally holds books and authors in high regard .
if it 's a nice summer night , visitors to these literature events will sit outside for hours on hard wooden stools just to hear the voices of their favorite authors reading on stage . these days most books are translated into multiple languages .
so even if the author reads his work in another language , which may not even be one that the visitor understands , many say the experience can still be a powerful one .
for some visitors , all that matters is that the author himself is reading his work . regina dyck leads one of the oldest literature festivals in germany : " poetry on the road , " which is held in the northern port city of bremen . " meeting an author and listening to him read his own work is an intimate experience , which makes the pleasure of literature more sensual .
for some , the paperback alone can not offer such an experience , " she says , trying to offer some insight into what draws the readers to such events . " perhaps these spoken word events awaken something primal in the visitor , something that responds to the spoken narrative .
before the printing press was invented , of course , stories were told verbally and people relied on the spoken word much more . " sweating , stuttering and extroverted berlin literature researcher christina foerner also believes there is another reason for the literature festivals ' popularity : they demystify the author . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literature expert christina foerner " the only thing most people often know about these authors is their work , " she says . " the author to them is usually a great mystery .
when people come to these events , many questions regarding the author and his work get answered .
some of the mystery is taken out , which many find pleasing . " some authors are shy ; some are extroverted .
some sweat or stutter .
some are gray and balding .
" the public is able to connect with the authors more easily when they see that the authors are only human , and the book was not created by some divine force but by a regular hardworking person , " foerner says . most importantly , the audience wants to see the authors , for all their imperfections .
sometimes the literature event can even turn into a spectacle .
such was the case in 1983 , when the german author rainald goetz made an appearance on tv for a literature debate . when a critic made a comment goetz did n't like , the writer pulled out a razorblade and slashed his own forehead , letting the blood run down his face . the german writer harry rowohlts , whose readings are enormously popular , describes his spoken word events as a place to get drunk and maybe talk about literature . catering and fun for the kids the act of seeking contact with an author is an old tradition .
earlier , this was restricted to people who belonged to the author 's " literary circle . "
nowadays , writers are more available to the general public .
it also helps that publishing houses sometimes push authors to do the readings .
literature festivals , after all , are places where books are marketed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich schreiber , head of the berlin festival says the event is good for readers and industry " everyone goes home happy , both the readers and the industry , " says ulrich schreiber , host of berlin 's international literature festival . and the events are all-inclusive affairs : some are fully catered while others provide activities for children . although not all authors enjoy taking part in such literature festivals , there are many that are still willing to discuss their hard work and the creative process with an audience . foerner , however , believes that the festivals are directing too much attention away from the actual product .

"
sarkozy , whose government is to introduce a carbon levy on domestic fuel emissions in 2010 , has repeatedly argued for a european union carbon tax on imports from regions with poor environmental standards .
germany had yet to come out in favor of a carbon tax on imports , which a german minister has warned could be perceived by developing nations as a form of " eco-imperialism . "

however , many of the country 's experts have warned that the proposal could backfire on the united states by causing other nations to pose their own tariffs on us goods .
both china and india , the world 's largest and fourth largest emitters of greenhouse gases respectively , have criticized the move , calling it an unfair attack on their trade , and have already proposed measures to counteract it .
india , for example , has suggested taxing imports based on the carbon emissions of the exporting country , which would have a large impact on the us , as its per capita emissions are higher than most countries . mrm / dpa / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
sarkozy , whose government is to introduce a carbon levy on domestic fuel emissions in 2010 , has repeatedly argued for a european union carbon tax on imports from regions with poor environmental standards .
germany had yet to come out in favor of a carbon tax on imports , which a german minister has warned could be perceived by developing nations as a form of " eco-imperialism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy will meet with world leaders at the un on tuesday before heading off to the g20 summit in pittsburgh in addition , the letter also stated that efforts for an international agreement to fight global warming have to start at next week 's un conference on climate change in new york .
in order to reach a " global and ambitious treaty " at december 's climate summit in copenhagen , the negotiators have to receive " a clear mandate . "
it was only in this way that global warming would be limited to two degrees celsius over the pre-industrial level , the statement said .
us and india consider their own climate tax france and germany are n't the only nations considering a climate tax .
across the atlantic the us house of representatives has included a carbon tariff in its climate change bill to address concerns the nation 's steel , cement and other big energy-consuming industries would be adversely affected by any deal to reduce carbon emissions .
however , many of the country 's experts have warned that the proposal could backfire on the united states by causing other nations to pose their own tariffs on us goods .
both china and india , the world 's largest and fourth largest emitters of greenhouse gases respectively , have criticized the move , calling it an unfair attack on their trade , and have already proposed measures to counteract it .
india , for example , has suggested taxing imports based on the carbon emissions of the exporting country , which would have a large impact on the us , as its per capita emissions are higher than most countries . mrm / dpa / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the point of our participation in the deal is for the import of technology .
if this does n't happen , then we wasted our time , " german gref was quoted by news agency ria novosti as saying .
he was speaking at an economic forum in the black sea resort of sochi meant to garner greater foreign investment in russia .
the state-owned sberbank has teamed up with canadian auto parts maker magna to purchase a joint majority 55-percent stake in opel , while general motors will retain 35 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sberbank is part of the consortium that has purchased a majority stake in opel gref 's comments echo sentiments expressed by russian prime minister vladimir putin , who said that his country needed more foreign technology than foreign investors .

when general motors sold its german subsidiary opel to magna , it insisted on restrictions to the transfer of technology .
putin commends opel purchase however , the russian leader praised the opel purchase as an " encouraging example " that he hopes will set a precedent for further fruitful partnerships with foreign companies .
opel chairman hans demant said in an interview with a polish daily this week that under the deal , opel would produce its astra model cars in russia .
gaz , russia 's second-largest car manufacturer , is poised to turn over its sprawling assembly line and distribution network to produce opel cars for the russian market .
the deal comes at a time when russia 's car market , hailed as the world 's fastest growing before the economic crisis , has shrunk by almost half this year .
the downturn has dealt a blow to russian carmakers already struggling to compete with the flood of foreign imports .
talks over job losses meanwhile , talks between european unions and delegates from general motors and magna are set to begin next week over plans to cut 10,500 jobs at opel to save labour costs to the tune of hundreds of millions of euros .

each country that is home to an opel plant is expected to send workers ' representatives to ruesselsheim to meet with negotiating partners from gm and magna .
trade union leaders at opel 's eight western european plants are worried about how much volume they each might have to relinquish to benefit another site .
however , the biggest job losses are expected to be in the bochum factory in germany – which could lose production of the astra compact and transmission production – as well as the unit in antwerp .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 19.09.2009 literature festivals in germany are drawing record crowds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : book festivals are catching on in almost every city in germany there 've never been so many opportunities to hear literature read aloud in germany .
as berlin 's international literature festival draws to a close , deutsche welle takes a look at why book festivals are catching on . the days of simply buying a book and enjoying it for the text between its covers are over .
germany has become the land of literature festivals . three hundred separate events are listed on the program for berlin 's international literature festival this year . the festival – the city 's ninth – has drawn around 30,000 book lovers . meanwhile , in the city of hamburg , many authors are taking the stage at the harbor front literature festival . return to the spoken word bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some visitors cherish hearing their favorite authors speak to an audience every city that prizes culture in germany naturally holds books and authors in high regard .
if it 's a nice summer night , visitors to these literature events will sit outside for hours on hard wooden stools just to hear the voices of their favorite authors reading on stage . these days most books are translated into multiple languages .
so even if the author reads his work in another language , which may not even be one that the visitor understands , many say the experience can still be a powerful one .
for some visitors , all that matters is that the author himself is reading his work . regina dyck leads one of the oldest literature festivals in germany : " poetry on the road , " which is held in the northern port city of bremen . " meeting an author and listening to him read his own work is an intimate experience , which makes the pleasure of literature more sensual .

as berlin 's international literature festival draws to a close , deutsche welle takes a look at why book festivals are catching on . the days of simply buying a book and enjoying it for the text between its covers are over .
germany has become the land of literature festivals . three hundred separate events are listed on the program for berlin 's international literature festival this year . the festival – the city 's ninth – has drawn around 30,000 book lovers . meanwhile , in the city of hamburg , many authors are taking the stage at the harbor front literature festival . return to the spoken word bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some visitors cherish hearing their favorite authors speak to an audience every city that prizes culture in germany naturally holds books and authors in high regard .
if it 's a nice summer night , visitors to these literature events will sit outside for hours on hard wooden stools just to hear the voices of their favorite authors reading on stage . these days most books are translated into multiple languages .
so even if the author reads his work in another language , which may not even be one that the visitor understands , many say the experience can still be a powerful one .
for some visitors , all that matters is that the author himself is reading his work . regina dyck leads one of the oldest literature festivals in germany : " poetry on the road , " which is held in the northern port city of bremen . " meeting an author and listening to him read his own work is an intimate experience , which makes the pleasure of literature more sensual .
for some , the paperback alone can not offer such an experience , " she says , trying to offer some insight into what draws the readers to such events . " perhaps these spoken word events awaken something primal in the visitor , something that responds to the spoken narrative .
before the printing press was invented , of course , stories were told verbally and people relied on the spoken word much more .

" the point of our participation in the deal is for the import of technology .
if this does n't happen , then we wasted our time , " german gref was quoted by news agency ria novosti as saying .
he was speaking at an economic forum in the black sea resort of sochi meant to garner greater foreign investment in russia .
the state-owned sberbank has teamed up with canadian auto parts maker magna to purchase a joint majority 55-percent stake in opel , while general motors will retain 35 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sberbank is part of the consortium that has purchased a majority stake in opel gref 's comments echo sentiments expressed by russian prime minister vladimir putin , who said that his country needed more foreign technology than foreign investors .
" we have a need not only for money – though this is of course very important – but first of all for the knowledge and experience of the main world players , " putin in a speech on the first day of the economic forum .
when general motors sold its german subsidiary opel to magna , it insisted on restrictions to the transfer of technology .
putin commends opel purchase however , the russian leader praised the opel purchase as an " encouraging example " that he hopes will set a precedent for further fruitful partnerships with foreign companies .
opel chairman hans demant said in an interview with a polish daily this week that under the deal , opel would produce its astra model cars in russia .
gaz , russia 's second-largest car manufacturer , is poised to turn over its sprawling assembly line and distribution network to produce opel cars for the russian market .
the deal comes at a time when russia 's car market , hailed as the world 's fastest growing before the economic crisis , has shrunk by almost half this year .
the downturn has dealt a blow to russian carmakers already struggling to compete with the flood of foreign imports .
talks over job losses meanwhile , talks between european unions and delegates from general motors and magna are set to begin next week over plans to cut 10,500 jobs at opel to save labour costs to the tune of hundreds of millions of euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bochum plant is expected to shed thousands of jobs " in the coming week , works councils and trade unions will begin the negotiations over the future of the european sites and our jobs , " a flyer distributed to opel workers in germany said .
each country that is home to an opel plant is expected to send workers ' representatives to ruesselsheim to meet with negotiating partners from gm and magna .
trade union leaders at opel 's eight western european plants are worried about how much volume they each might have to relinquish to benefit another site .
however , the biggest job losses are expected to be in the bochum factory in germany – which could lose production of the astra compact and transmission production – as well as the unit in antwerp .
opel 's belgian plant is in danger of being closed entirely .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 19.09.2009 russians demand technology transfer as part of opel deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm insisted on restrictions to the transfer of technology when it sold opel to magna the russian partner of magna , the canadian company that has bought german carmaker opel , says without a transfer of technology to russia the deal would be worthless . the head of russian lender sberbank said on friday that russian automakers avtovaz and gaz were interested in joining the new opel venture for the technology .
" the point of our participation in the deal is for the import of technology .
if this does n't happen , then we wasted our time , " german gref was quoted by news agency ria novosti as saying .
he was speaking at an economic forum in the black sea resort of sochi meant to garner greater foreign investment in russia .
the state-owned sberbank has teamed up with canadian auto parts maker magna to purchase a joint majority 55-percent stake in opel , while general motors will retain 35 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sberbank is part of the consortium that has purchased a majority stake in opel gref 's comments echo sentiments expressed by russian prime minister vladimir putin , who said that his country needed more foreign technology than foreign investors .
" we have a need not only for money – though this is of course very important – but first of all for the knowledge and experience of the main world players , " putin in a speech on the first day of the economic forum .
when general motors sold its german subsidiary opel to magna , it insisted on restrictions to the transfer of technology .
putin commends opel purchase however , the russian leader praised the opel purchase as an " encouraging example " that he hopes will set a precedent for further fruitful partnerships with foreign companies .
opel chairman hans demant said in an interview with a polish daily this week that under the deal , opel would produce its astra model cars in russia .
gaz , russia 's second-largest car manufacturer , is poised to turn over its sprawling assembly line and distribution network to produce opel cars for the russian market .
the deal comes at a time when russia 's car market , hailed as the world 's fastest growing before the economic crisis , has shrunk by almost half this year .
the downturn has dealt a blow to russian carmakers already struggling to compete with the flood of foreign imports .
talks over job losses meanwhile , talks between european unions and delegates from general motors and magna are set to begin next week over plans to cut 10,500 jobs at opel to save labour costs to the tune of hundreds of millions of euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bochum plant is expected to shed thousands of jobs " in the coming week , works councils and trade unions will begin the negotiations over the future of the european sites and our jobs , " a flyer distributed to opel workers in germany said .
each country that is home to an opel plant is expected to send workers ' representatives to ruesselsheim to meet with negotiating partners from gm and magna .
trade union leaders at opel 's eight western european plants are worried about how much volume they each might have to relinquish to benefit another site .
however , the biggest job losses are expected to be in the bochum factory in germany – which could lose production of the astra compact and transmission production – as well as the unit in antwerp .
opel 's belgian plant is in danger of being closed entirely .

" the washington-based institution said the decision was a core element of a new income model to make it less dependent on its lending revenue . the sale amounts to one-eighth of the current holdings of the imf , which is the third-largest holder of gold after the united states and germany . last year the imf announced it was going to diversify its income by selling part of its gold reserves to create an endowment .
the money will help to fund a major increase in the imf 's lending over the past year to help countries suffering from the global financial downturn . the g20 at their april summit in london agreed the gold sales should allow the imf to offer favorable conditions on loans to the poorest countries .

"
sarkozy , whose government is to introduce a carbon levy on domestic fuel emissions in 2010 , has repeatedly argued for a european union carbon tax on imports from regions with poor environmental standards .
germany had yet to come out in favor of a carbon tax on imports , which a german minister has warned could be perceived by developing nations as a form of " eco-imperialism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy will meet with world leaders at the un on tuesday before heading off to the g20 summit in pittsburgh in addition , the letter also stated that efforts for an international agreement to fight global warming have to start at next week 's un conference on climate change in new york .
in order to reach a " global and ambitious treaty " at december 's climate summit in copenhagen , the negotiators have to receive " a clear mandate . "
it was only in this way that global warming would be limited to two degrees celsius over the pre-industrial level , the statement said .
us and india consider their own climate tax france and germany are n't the only nations considering a climate tax .
across the atlantic the us house of representatives has included a carbon tariff in its climate change bill to address concerns the nation 's steel , cement and other big energy-consuming industries would be adversely affected by any deal to reduce carbon emissions .
however , many of the country 's experts have warned that the proposal could backfire on the united states by causing other nations to pose their own tariffs on us goods .
both china and india , the world 's largest and fourth largest emitters of greenhouse gases respectively , have criticized the move , calling it an unfair attack on their trade , and have already proposed measures to counteract it .
india , for example , has suggested taxing imports based on the carbon emissions of the exporting country , which would have a large impact on the us , as its per capita emissions are higher than most countries . mrm / dpa / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the point of our participation in the deal is for the import of technology .
if this does n't happen , then we wasted our time , " german gref was quoted by news agency ria novosti as saying .
he was speaking at an economic forum in the black sea resort of sochi meant to garner greater foreign investment in russia .
the state-owned sberbank has teamed up with canadian auto parts maker magna to purchase a joint majority 55-percent stake in opel , while general motors will retain 35 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sberbank is part of the consortium that has purchased a majority stake in opel gref 's comments echo sentiments expressed by russian prime minister vladimir putin , who said that his country needed more foreign technology than foreign investors .
" we have a need not only for money – though this is of course very important – but first of all for the knowledge and experience of the main world players , " putin in a speech on the first day of the economic forum .
when general motors sold its german subsidiary opel to magna , it insisted on restrictions to the transfer of technology .
putin commends opel purchase however , the russian leader praised the opel purchase as an " encouraging example " that he hopes will set a precedent for further fruitful partnerships with foreign companies .
opel chairman hans demant said in an interview with a polish daily this week that under the deal , opel would produce its astra model cars in russia .
gaz , russia 's second-largest car manufacturer , is poised to turn over its sprawling assembly line and distribution network to produce opel cars for the russian market .
the deal comes at a time when russia 's car market , hailed as the world 's fastest growing before the economic crisis , has shrunk by almost half this year .
the downturn has dealt a blow to russian carmakers already struggling to compete with the flood of foreign imports .
talks over job losses meanwhile , talks between european unions and delegates from general motors and magna are set to begin next week over plans to cut 10,500 jobs at opel to save labour costs to the tune of hundreds of millions of euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bochum plant is expected to shed thousands of jobs " in the coming week , works councils and trade unions will begin the negotiations over the future of the european sites and our jobs , " a flyer distributed to opel workers in germany said .
each country that is home to an opel plant is expected to send workers ' representatives to ruesselsheim to meet with negotiating partners from gm and magna .
trade union leaders at opel 's eight western european plants are worried about how much volume they each might have to relinquish to benefit another site .
however , the biggest job losses are expected to be in the bochum factory in germany – which could lose production of the astra compact and transmission production – as well as the unit in antwerp .
opel 's belgian plant is in danger of being closed entirely .

" the point of our participation in the deal is for the import of technology .
if this does n't happen , then we wasted our time , " german gref was quoted by news agency ria novosti as saying .
he was speaking at an economic forum in the black sea resort of sochi meant to garner greater foreign investment in russia .
the state-owned sberbank has teamed up with canadian auto parts maker magna to purchase a joint majority 55-percent stake in opel , while general motors will retain 35 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sberbank is part of the consortium that has purchased a majority stake in opel gref 's comments echo sentiments expressed by russian prime minister vladimir putin , who said that his country needed more foreign technology than foreign investors .
" we have a need not only for money – though this is of course very important – but first of all for the knowledge and experience of the main world players , " putin in a speech on the first day of the economic forum .
when general motors sold its german subsidiary opel to magna , it insisted on restrictions to the transfer of technology .
putin commends opel purchase however , the russian leader praised the opel purchase as an " encouraging example " that he hopes will set a precedent for further fruitful partnerships with foreign companies .
opel chairman hans demant said in an interview with a polish daily this week that under the deal , opel would produce its astra model cars in russia .
gaz , russia 's second-largest car manufacturer , is poised to turn over its sprawling assembly line and distribution network to produce opel cars for the russian market .
the deal comes at a time when russia 's car market , hailed as the world 's fastest growing before the economic crisis , has shrunk by almost half this year .
the downturn has dealt a blow to russian carmakers already struggling to compete with the flood of foreign imports .
talks over job losses meanwhile , talks between european unions and delegates from general motors and magna are set to begin next week over plans to cut 10,500 jobs at opel to save labour costs to the tune of hundreds of millions of euros .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 19.09.2009 russians demand technology transfer as part of opel deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm insisted on restrictions to the transfer of technology when it sold opel to magna the russian partner of magna , the canadian company that has bought german carmaker opel , says without a transfer of technology to russia the deal would be worthless . the head of russian lender sberbank said on friday that russian automakers avtovaz and gaz were interested in joining the new opel venture for the technology .
" the point of our participation in the deal is for the import of technology .
if this does n't happen , then we wasted our time , " german gref was quoted by news agency ria novosti as saying .
he was speaking at an economic forum in the black sea resort of sochi meant to garner greater foreign investment in russia .
the state-owned sberbank has teamed up with canadian auto parts maker magna to purchase a joint majority 55-percent stake in opel , while general motors will retain 35 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sberbank is part of the consortium that has purchased a majority stake in opel gref 's comments echo sentiments expressed by russian prime minister vladimir putin , who said that his country needed more foreign technology than foreign investors .
" we have a need not only for money – though this is of course very important – but first of all for the knowledge and experience of the main world players , " putin in a speech on the first day of the economic forum .
when general motors sold its german subsidiary opel to magna , it insisted on restrictions to the transfer of technology .
putin commends opel purchase however , the russian leader praised the opel purchase as an " encouraging example " that he hopes will set a precedent for further fruitful partnerships with foreign companies .
opel chairman hans demant said in an interview with a polish daily this week that under the deal , opel would produce its astra model cars in russia .
gaz , russia 's second-largest car manufacturer , is poised to turn over its sprawling assembly line and distribution network to produce opel cars for the russian market .
the deal comes at a time when russia 's car market , hailed as the world 's fastest growing before the economic crisis , has shrunk by almost half this year .
the downturn has dealt a blow to russian carmakers already struggling to compete with the flood of foreign imports .
talks over job losses meanwhile , talks between european unions and delegates from general motors and magna are set to begin next week over plans to cut 10,500 jobs at opel to save labour costs to the tune of hundreds of millions of euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bochum plant is expected to shed thousands of jobs " in the coming week , works councils and trade unions will begin the negotiations over the future of the european sites and our jobs , " a flyer distributed to opel workers in germany said .
each country that is home to an opel plant is expected to send workers ' representatives to ruesselsheim to meet with negotiating partners from gm and magna .
trade union leaders at opel 's eight western european plants are worried about how much volume they each might have to relinquish to benefit another site .
however , the biggest job losses are expected to be in the bochum factory in germany – which could lose production of the astra compact and transmission production – as well as the unit in antwerp .
opel 's belgian plant is in danger of being closed entirely .

"
sarkozy , whose government is to introduce a carbon levy on domestic fuel emissions in 2010 , has repeatedly argued for a european union carbon tax on imports from regions with poor environmental standards .
germany had yet to come out in favor of a carbon tax on imports , which a german minister has warned could be perceived by developing nations as a form of " eco-imperialism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy will meet with world leaders at the un on tuesday before heading off to the g20 summit in pittsburgh in addition , the letter also stated that efforts for an international agreement to fight global warming have to start at next week 's un conference on climate change in new york .
in order to reach a " global and ambitious treaty " at december 's climate summit in copenhagen , the negotiators have to receive " a clear mandate . "
it was only in this way that global warming would be limited to two degrees celsius over the pre-industrial level , the statement said .
us and india consider their own climate tax france and germany are n't the only nations considering a climate tax .
across the atlantic the us house of representatives has included a carbon tariff in its climate change bill to address concerns the nation 's steel , cement and other big energy-consuming industries would be adversely affected by any deal to reduce carbon emissions .
however , many of the country 's experts have warned that the proposal could backfire on the united states by causing other nations to pose their own tariffs on us goods .
both china and india , the world 's largest and fourth largest emitters of greenhouse gases respectively , have criticized the move , calling it an unfair attack on their trade , and have already proposed measures to counteract it .
india , for example , has suggested taxing imports based on the carbon emissions of the exporting country , which would have a large impact on the us , as its per capita emissions are higher than most countries . mrm / dpa / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the washington-based institution said the decision was a core element of a new income model to make it less dependent on its lending revenue . the sale amounts to one-eighth of the current holdings of the imf , which is the third-largest holder of gold after the united states and germany . last year the imf announced it was going to diversify its income by selling part of its gold reserves to create an endowment .
the money will help to fund a major increase in the imf 's lending over the past year to help countries suffering from the global financial downturn . the g20 at their april summit in london agreed the gold sales should allow the imf to offer favorable conditions on loans to the poorest countries .

the current number of troops " can not achieve the immediate and wide-reaching improvement of the circumstances in the greater kunduz region , " vollmer is quoted as saying .
equipment shortages additionally , the bild newspaper reports that vollmer advises for more armored vehicles for german troops in the area .
he says that of 38 armored vehicles that have been taken out of service between january and june , none have been replaced .
vollmer adds that some of the equipment that is already available does not fulfil the needs of the troops .

the 155-point list addresses problems from bullets to air conditioning . the outgoing commander of the german bundeswehr in afghanistan has outlined troop and equipment shortcomings hampering german efforts to stabilize the region .
parts of his report were quoted in the german magazine focus and the bild newspaper .
according to statements in focus , general joerg vollmer says at least one additional infantry company is necessary in the kunduz region .
the current number of troops " can not achieve the immediate and wide-reaching improvement of the circumstances in the greater kunduz region , " vollmer is quoted as saying .
equipment shortages additionally , the bild newspaper reports that vollmer advises for more armored vehicles for german troops in the area .
he says that of 38 armored vehicles that have been taken out of service between january and june , none have been replaced .
vollmer adds that some of the equipment that is already available does not fulfil the needs of the troops .
for example , the helicopters in service are " effectively limited only to support operations , " vollmer told focus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier met vollmer in afghanistan last april according to the commander , the lack of air conditioning in the german marder tanks leads to blistering internal temperatures of 80 degrees celcius -lrb- 176 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , and the type of munitions supplied for certain machine guns are not appropriate for the tasks the soldiers are doing .
in a separate article published in focus , foreign minister and candidate for chancellor frank-walter steinmeier however insisted that german forces in northern afghanistan are in good shape , and also spoke against spreading german troops into other regions of the country .
" the civilian organizations and the bundeswehr troops are networked really well , they know the political figures and the tribal structure , " steinmeier said in focus .
" it would be absurd to give up this position and spread into other regions . "
mistakes by german officer in tanker bombing ?
german magazine spiegel meanwhile on saturday alleged that serious mistakes were made by a german officer regarding the controversial tanker bombing earlier in the month in afghanistan .
taliban militants had hijacked the tankers from nato forces .
estimates by afghan officials claim 99 dead in the attack , including 30 civilians .
according to the spiegel article , german colonel georg klein opted against a fly-by of f-15 airplanes before the actual bombing began .
had a fly-by been ordered , it could have given civilians near the tanker the chance to flee before the bombing began. mz / afp / reuters / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

vollmer adds that some of the equipment that is already available does not fulfil the needs of the troops .
for example , the helicopters in service are " effectively limited only to support operations , " vollmer told focus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier met vollmer in afghanistan last april according to the commander , the lack of air conditioning in the german marder tanks leads to blistering internal temperatures of 80 degrees celcius -lrb- 176 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , and the type of munitions supplied for certain machine guns are not appropriate for the tasks the soldiers are doing .
in a separate article published in focus , foreign minister and candidate for chancellor frank-walter steinmeier however insisted that german forces in northern afghanistan are in good shape , and also spoke against spreading german troops into other regions of the country .
" the civilian organizations and the bundeswehr troops are networked really well , they know the political figures and the tribal structure , " steinmeier said in focus .
" it would be absurd to give up this position and spread into other regions . "
mistakes by german officer in tanker bombing ?
german magazine spiegel meanwhile on saturday alleged that serious mistakes were made by a german officer regarding the controversial tanker bombing earlier in the month in afghanistan .
taliban militants had hijacked the tankers from nato forces .
estimates by afghan officials claim 99 dead in the attack , including 30 civilians .
according to the spiegel article , german colonel georg klein opted against a fly-by of f-15 airplanes before the actual bombing began .
had a fly-by been ordered , it could have given civilians near the tanker the chance to flee before the bombing began. mz / afp / reuters / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the point of our participation in the deal is for the import of technology .
if this does n't happen , then we wasted our time , " german gref was quoted by news agency ria novosti as saying .
he was speaking at an economic forum in the black sea resort of sochi meant to garner greater foreign investment in russia .
the state-owned sberbank has teamed up with canadian auto parts maker magna to purchase a joint majority 55-percent stake in opel , while general motors will retain 35 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sberbank is part of the consortium that has purchased a majority stake in opel gref 's comments echo sentiments expressed by russian prime minister vladimir putin , who said that his country needed more foreign technology than foreign investors .
" we have a need not only for money – though this is of course very important – but first of all for the knowledge and experience of the main world players , " putin in a speech on the first day of the economic forum .
when general motors sold its german subsidiary opel to magna , it insisted on restrictions to the transfer of technology .

the deal comes at a time when russia 's car market , hailed as the world 's fastest growing before the economic crisis , has shrunk by almost half this year .
the downturn has dealt a blow to russian carmakers already struggling to compete with the flood of foreign imports .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 19.09.2009 literature festivals in germany are drawing record crowds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : book festivals are catching on in almost every city in germany there 've never been so many opportunities to hear literature read aloud in germany .
as berlin 's international literature festival draws to a close , deutsche welle takes a look at why book festivals are catching on . the days of simply buying a book and enjoying it for the text between its covers are over .
germany has become the land of literature festivals . three hundred separate events are listed on the program for berlin 's international literature festival this year . the festival – the city 's ninth – has drawn around 30,000 book lovers . meanwhile , in the city of hamburg , many authors are taking the stage at the harbor front literature festival . return to the spoken word bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some visitors cherish hearing their favorite authors speak to an audience every city that prizes culture in germany naturally holds books and authors in high regard .
if it 's a nice summer night , visitors to these literature events will sit outside for hours on hard wooden stools just to hear the voices of their favorite authors reading on stage . these days most books are translated into multiple languages .
so even if the author reads his work in another language , which may not even be one that the visitor understands , many say the experience can still be a powerful one .
for some visitors , all that matters is that the author himself is reading his work . regina dyck leads one of the oldest literature festivals in germany : " poetry on the road , " which is held in the northern port city of bremen . " meeting an author and listening to him read his own work is an intimate experience , which makes the pleasure of literature more sensual .
for some , the paperback alone can not offer such an experience , " she says , trying to offer some insight into what draws the readers to such events . " perhaps these spoken word events awaken something primal in the visitor , something that responds to the spoken narrative .
before the printing press was invented , of course , stories were told verbally and people relied on the spoken word much more . " sweating , stuttering and extroverted berlin literature researcher christina foerner also believes there is another reason for the literature festivals ' popularity : they demystify the author . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literature expert christina foerner " the only thing most people often know about these authors is their work , " she says . " the author to them is usually a great mystery .
when people come to these events , many questions regarding the author and his work get answered .
some of the mystery is taken out , which many find pleasing . " some authors are shy ; some are extroverted .
some sweat or stutter .
some are gray and balding .
" the public is able to connect with the authors more easily when they see that the authors are only human , and the book was not created by some divine force but by a regular hardworking person , " foerner says . most importantly , the audience wants to see the authors , for all their imperfections .
sometimes the literature event can even turn into a spectacle .
such was the case in 1983 , when the german author rainald goetz made an appearance on tv for a literature debate . when a critic made a comment goetz did n't like , the writer pulled out a razorblade and slashed his own forehead , letting the blood run down his face . the german writer harry rowohlts , whose readings are enormously popular , describes his spoken word events as a place to get drunk and maybe talk about literature . catering and fun for the kids the act of seeking contact with an author is an old tradition .
earlier , this was restricted to people who belonged to the author 's " literary circle . "
nowadays , writers are more available to the general public .
it also helps that publishing houses sometimes push authors to do the readings .
literature festivals , after all , are places where books are marketed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich schreiber , head of the berlin festival says the event is good for readers and industry " everyone goes home happy , both the readers and the industry , " says ulrich schreiber , host of berlin 's international literature festival . and the events are all-inclusive affairs : some are fully catered while others provide activities for children . although not all authors enjoy taking part in such literature festivals , there are many that are still willing to discuss their hard work and the creative process with an audience . foerner , however , believes that the festivals are directing too much attention away from the actual product .
" unfortunately , " she says , " in today 's day and age , it 's not longer sufficient to be a very good writer .
you also have to learn how to deliver your product effectively . " love for books nothing new although spoken word events seem to be the latest manifestation of germany 's love for literature , the country has long held the genre in high esteem and therefore done much to foster the book industry . in fact , the frankfurt book fair , which is held every year in the city , is considered one of the most important trade fairs for the publishing industry .
representatives from thousands of publishing houses across the world come to the fair to negotiate international publishing rights and licensing fees . this year the fair runs from october 14 to 18 . author : heiner kiesel -lrb- cs -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as berlin 's international literature festival draws to a close , deutsche welle takes a look at why book festivals are catching on . the days of simply buying a book and enjoying it for the text between its covers are over .
germany has become the land of literature festivals . three hundred separate events are listed on the program for berlin 's international literature festival this year . the festival – the city 's ninth – has drawn around 30,000 book lovers . meanwhile , in the city of hamburg , many authors are taking the stage at the harbor front literature festival . return to the spoken word bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some visitors cherish hearing their favorite authors speak to an audience every city that prizes culture in germany naturally holds books and authors in high regard .
if it 's a nice summer night , visitors to these literature events will sit outside for hours on hard wooden stools just to hear the voices of their favorite authors reading on stage . these days most books are translated into multiple languages .
so even if the author reads his work in another language , which may not even be one that the visitor understands , many say the experience can still be a powerful one .
for some visitors , all that matters is that the author himself is reading his work . regina dyck leads one of the oldest literature festivals in germany : " poetry on the road , " which is held in the northern port city of bremen . " meeting an author and listening to him read his own work is an intimate experience , which makes the pleasure of literature more sensual .
for some , the paperback alone can not offer such an experience , " she says , trying to offer some insight into what draws the readers to such events . " perhaps these spoken word events awaken something primal in the visitor , something that responds to the spoken narrative .
before the printing press was invented , of course , stories were told verbally and people relied on the spoken word much more . " sweating , stuttering and extroverted berlin literature researcher christina foerner also believes there is another reason for the literature festivals ' popularity : they demystify the author . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literature expert christina foerner " the only thing most people often know about these authors is their work , " she says . " the author to them is usually a great mystery .
when people come to these events , many questions regarding the author and his work get answered .
some of the mystery is taken out , which many find pleasing . " some authors are shy ; some are extroverted .
some sweat or stutter .
some are gray and balding .
" the public is able to connect with the authors more easily when they see that the authors are only human , and the book was not created by some divine force but by a regular hardworking person , " foerner says . most importantly , the audience wants to see the authors , for all their imperfections .
sometimes the literature event can even turn into a spectacle .
such was the case in 1983 , when the german author rainald goetz made an appearance on tv for a literature debate . when a critic made a comment goetz did n't like , the writer pulled out a razorblade and slashed his own forehead , letting the blood run down his face . the german writer harry rowohlts , whose readings are enormously popular , describes his spoken word events as a place to get drunk and maybe talk about literature . catering and fun for the kids the act of seeking contact with an author is an old tradition .
earlier , this was restricted to people who belonged to the author 's " literary circle . "
nowadays , writers are more available to the general public .
it also helps that publishing houses sometimes push authors to do the readings .
literature festivals , after all , are places where books are marketed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich schreiber , head of the berlin festival says the event is good for readers and industry " everyone goes home happy , both the readers and the industry , " says ulrich schreiber , host of berlin 's international literature festival . and the events are all-inclusive affairs : some are fully catered while others provide activities for children . although not all authors enjoy taking part in such literature festivals , there are many that are still willing to discuss their hard work and the creative process with an audience . foerner , however , believes that the festivals are directing too much attention away from the actual product .
" unfortunately , " she says , " in today 's day and age , it 's not longer sufficient to be a very good writer .
you also have to learn how to deliver your product effectively . " love for books nothing new although spoken word events seem to be the latest manifestation of germany 's love for literature , the country has long held the genre in high esteem and therefore done much to foster the book industry . in fact , the frankfurt book fair , which is held every year in the city , is considered one of the most important trade fairs for the publishing industry .

as berlin 's international literature festival draws to a close , deutsche welle takes a look at why book festivals are catching on . the days of simply buying a book and enjoying it for the text between its covers are over .
germany has become the land of literature festivals . three hundred separate events are listed on the program for berlin 's international literature festival this year . the festival – the city 's ninth – has drawn around 30,000 book lovers . meanwhile , in the city of hamburg , many authors are taking the stage at the harbor front literature festival . return to the spoken word bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some visitors cherish hearing their favorite authors speak to an audience every city that prizes culture in germany naturally holds books and authors in high regard .
if it 's a nice summer night , visitors to these literature events will sit outside for hours on hard wooden stools just to hear the voices of their favorite authors reading on stage . these days most books are translated into multiple languages .
so even if the author reads his work in another language , which may not even be one that the visitor understands , many say the experience can still be a powerful one .
for some visitors , all that matters is that the author himself is reading his work . regina dyck leads one of the oldest literature festivals in germany : " poetry on the road , " which is held in the northern port city of bremen . " meeting an author and listening to him read his own work is an intimate experience , which makes the pleasure of literature more sensual .
for some , the paperback alone can not offer such an experience , " she says , trying to offer some insight into what draws the readers to such events . " perhaps these spoken word events awaken something primal in the visitor , something that responds to the spoken narrative .
before the printing press was invented , of course , stories were told verbally and people relied on the spoken word much more . " sweating , stuttering and extroverted berlin literature researcher christina foerner also believes there is another reason for the literature festivals ' popularity : they demystify the author . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literature expert christina foerner " the only thing most people often know about these authors is their work , " she says . " the author to them is usually a great mystery .
when people come to these events , many questions regarding the author and his work get answered .
some of the mystery is taken out , which many find pleasing . " some authors are shy ; some are extroverted .
some sweat or stutter .
some are gray and balding .
" the public is able to connect with the authors more easily when they see that the authors are only human , and the book was not created by some divine force but by a regular hardworking person , " foerner says . most importantly , the audience wants to see the authors , for all their imperfections .
sometimes the literature event can even turn into a spectacle .
such was the case in 1983 , when the german author rainald goetz made an appearance on tv for a literature debate . when a critic made a comment goetz did n't like , the writer pulled out a razorblade and slashed his own forehead , letting the blood run down his face . the german writer harry rowohlts , whose readings are enormously popular , describes his spoken word events as a place to get drunk and maybe talk about literature . catering and fun for the kids the act of seeking contact with an author is an old tradition .
earlier , this was restricted to people who belonged to the author 's " literary circle . "
nowadays , writers are more available to the general public .
it also helps that publishing houses sometimes push authors to do the readings .
literature festivals , after all , are places where books are marketed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich schreiber , head of the berlin festival says the event is good for readers and industry " everyone goes home happy , both the readers and the industry , " says ulrich schreiber , host of berlin 's international literature festival . and the events are all-inclusive affairs : some are fully catered while others provide activities for children . although not all authors enjoy taking part in such literature festivals , there are many that are still willing to discuss their hard work and the creative process with an audience . foerner , however , believes that the festivals are directing too much attention away from the actual product .
" unfortunately , " she says , " in today 's day and age , it 's not longer sufficient to be a very good writer .
you also have to learn how to deliver your product effectively . " love for books nothing new although spoken word events seem to be the latest manifestation of germany 's love for literature , the country has long held the genre in high esteem and therefore done much to foster the book industry . in fact , the frankfurt book fair , which is held every year in the city , is considered one of the most important trade fairs for the publishing industry .

as berlin 's international literature festival draws to a close , deutsche welle takes a look at why book festivals are catching on . the days of simply buying a book and enjoying it for the text between its covers are over .
germany has become the land of literature festivals . three hundred separate events are listed on the program for berlin 's international literature festival this year . the festival – the city 's ninth – has drawn around 30,000 book lovers . meanwhile , in the city of hamburg , many authors are taking the stage at the harbor front literature festival . return to the spoken word bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some visitors cherish hearing their favorite authors speak to an audience every city that prizes culture in germany naturally holds books and authors in high regard .
if it 's a nice summer night , visitors to these literature events will sit outside for hours on hard wooden stools just to hear the voices of their favorite authors reading on stage . these days most books are translated into multiple languages .
so even if the author reads his work in another language , which may not even be one that the visitor understands , many say the experience can still be a powerful one .
for some visitors , all that matters is that the author himself is reading his work . regina dyck leads one of the oldest literature festivals in germany : " poetry on the road , " which is held in the northern port city of bremen . " meeting an author and listening to him read his own work is an intimate experience , which makes the pleasure of literature more sensual .
for some , the paperback alone can not offer such an experience , " she says , trying to offer some insight into what draws the readers to such events . " perhaps these spoken word events awaken something primal in the visitor , something that responds to the spoken narrative .
before the printing press was invented , of course , stories were told verbally and people relied on the spoken word much more . " sweating , stuttering and extroverted berlin literature researcher christina foerner also believes there is another reason for the literature festivals ' popularity : they demystify the author . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literature expert christina foerner " the only thing most people often know about these authors is their work , " she says . " the author to them is usually a great mystery .
when people come to these events , many questions regarding the author and his work get answered .
some of the mystery is taken out , which many find pleasing . " some authors are shy ; some are extroverted .
some sweat or stutter .
some are gray and balding .
" the public is able to connect with the authors more easily when they see that the authors are only human , and the book was not created by some divine force but by a regular hardworking person , " foerner says . most importantly , the audience wants to see the authors , for all their imperfections .
sometimes the literature event can even turn into a spectacle .
such was the case in 1983 , when the german author rainald goetz made an appearance on tv for a literature debate . when a critic made a comment goetz did n't like , the writer pulled out a razorblade and slashed his own forehead , letting the blood run down his face . the german writer harry rowohlts , whose readings are enormously popular , describes his spoken word events as a place to get drunk and maybe talk about literature . catering and fun for the kids the act of seeking contact with an author is an old tradition .
earlier , this was restricted to people who belonged to the author 's " literary circle . "
nowadays , writers are more available to the general public .
it also helps that publishing houses sometimes push authors to do the readings .
literature festivals , after all , are places where books are marketed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich schreiber , head of the berlin festival says the event is good for readers and industry " everyone goes home happy , both the readers and the industry , " says ulrich schreiber , host of berlin 's international literature festival . and the events are all-inclusive affairs : some are fully catered while others provide activities for children . although not all authors enjoy taking part in such literature festivals , there are many that are still willing to discuss their hard work and the creative process with an audience . foerner , however , believes that the festivals are directing too much attention away from the actual product .
" unfortunately , " she says , " in today 's day and age , it 's not longer sufficient to be a very good writer .
you also have to learn how to deliver your product effectively .

as berlin 's international literature festival draws to a close , deutsche welle takes a look at why book festivals are catching on . the days of simply buying a book and enjoying it for the text between its covers are over .
germany has become the land of literature festivals . three hundred separate events are listed on the program for berlin 's international literature festival this year . the festival – the city 's ninth – has drawn around 30,000 book lovers . meanwhile , in the city of hamburg , many authors are taking the stage at the harbor front literature festival . return to the spoken word bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some visitors cherish hearing their favorite authors speak to an audience every city that prizes culture in germany naturally holds books and authors in high regard .
if it 's a nice summer night , visitors to these literature events will sit outside for hours on hard wooden stools just to hear the voices of their favorite authors reading on stage . these days most books are translated into multiple languages .
so even if the author reads his work in another language , which may not even be one that the visitor understands , many say the experience can still be a powerful one .
for some visitors , all that matters is that the author himself is reading his work . regina dyck leads one of the oldest literature festivals in germany : " poetry on the road , " which is held in the northern port city of bremen . " meeting an author and listening to him read his own work is an intimate experience , which makes the pleasure of literature more sensual .
for some , the paperback alone can not offer such an experience , " she says , trying to offer some insight into what draws the readers to such events . " perhaps these spoken word events awaken something primal in the visitor , something that responds to the spoken narrative .
before the printing press was invented , of course , stories were told verbally and people relied on the spoken word much more . " sweating , stuttering and extroverted berlin literature researcher christina foerner also believes there is another reason for the literature festivals ' popularity : they demystify the author . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literature expert christina foerner " the only thing most people often know about these authors is their work , " she says . " the author to them is usually a great mystery .
when people come to these events , many questions regarding the author and his work get answered .
some of the mystery is taken out , which many find pleasing . " some authors are shy ; some are extroverted .
some sweat or stutter .
some are gray and balding .
" the public is able to connect with the authors more easily when they see that the authors are only human , and the book was not created by some divine force but by a regular hardworking person , " foerner says . most importantly , the audience wants to see the authors , for all their imperfections .
sometimes the literature event can even turn into a spectacle .
such was the case in 1983 , when the german author rainald goetz made an appearance on tv for a literature debate . when a critic made a comment goetz did n't like , the writer pulled out a razorblade and slashed his own forehead , letting the blood run down his face . the german writer harry rowohlts , whose readings are enormously popular , describes his spoken word events as a place to get drunk and maybe talk about literature . catering and fun for the kids the act of seeking contact with an author is an old tradition .
earlier , this was restricted to people who belonged to the author 's " literary circle . "
nowadays , writers are more available to the general public .
it also helps that publishing houses sometimes push authors to do the readings .
literature festivals , after all , are places where books are marketed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich schreiber , head of the berlin festival says the event is good for readers and industry " everyone goes home happy , both the readers and the industry , " says ulrich schreiber , host of berlin 's international literature festival . and the events are all-inclusive affairs : some are fully catered while others provide activities for children . although not all authors enjoy taking part in such literature festivals , there are many that are still willing to discuss their hard work and the creative process with an audience . foerner , however , believes that the festivals are directing too much attention away from the actual product .
" unfortunately , " she says , " in today 's day and age , it 's not longer sufficient to be a very good writer .
you also have to learn how to deliver your product effectively . " love for books nothing new although spoken word events seem to be the latest manifestation of germany 's love for literature , the country has long held the genre in high esteem and therefore done much to foster the book industry . in fact , the frankfurt book fair , which is held every year in the city , is considered one of the most important trade fairs for the publishing industry .
representatives from thousands of publishing houses across the world come to the fair to negotiate international publishing rights and licensing fees . this year the fair runs from october 14 to 18 . author : heiner kiesel -lrb- cs -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the point of our participation in the deal is for the import of technology .

he was speaking at an economic forum in the black sea resort of sochi meant to garner greater foreign investment in russia .
the state-owned sberbank has teamed up with canadian auto parts maker magna to purchase a joint majority 55-percent stake in opel , while general motors will retain 35 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sberbank is part of the consortium that has purchased a majority stake in opel gref 's comments echo sentiments expressed by russian prime minister vladimir putin , who said that his country needed more foreign technology than foreign investors .

putin commends opel purchase however , the russian leader praised the opel purchase as an " encouraging example " that he hopes will set a precedent for further fruitful partnerships with foreign companies .
opel chairman hans demant said in an interview with a polish daily this week that under the deal , opel would produce its astra model cars in russia .
gaz , russia 's second-largest car manufacturer , is poised to turn over its sprawling assembly line and distribution network to produce opel cars for the russian market .
the deal comes at a time when russia 's car market , hailed as the world 's fastest growing before the economic crisis , has shrunk by almost half this year .
the downturn has dealt a blow to russian carmakers already struggling to compete with the flood of foreign imports .
talks over job losses meanwhile , talks between european unions and delegates from general motors and magna are set to begin next week over plans to cut 10,500 jobs at opel to save labour costs to the tune of hundreds of millions of euros .

" the point of our participation in the deal is for the import of technology .
if this does n't happen , then we wasted our time , " german gref was quoted by news agency ria novosti as saying .
he was speaking at an economic forum in the black sea resort of sochi meant to garner greater foreign investment in russia .
the state-owned sberbank has teamed up with canadian auto parts maker magna to purchase a joint majority 55-percent stake in opel , while general motors will retain 35 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sberbank is part of the consortium that has purchased a majority stake in opel gref 's comments echo sentiments expressed by russian prime minister vladimir putin , who said that his country needed more foreign technology than foreign investors .
" we have a need not only for money – though this is of course very important – but first of all for the knowledge and experience of the main world players , " putin in a speech on the first day of the economic forum .
when general motors sold its german subsidiary opel to magna , it insisted on restrictions to the transfer of technology .
putin commends opel purchase however , the russian leader praised the opel purchase as an " encouraging example " that he hopes will set a precedent for further fruitful partnerships with foreign companies .
opel chairman hans demant said in an interview with a polish daily this week that under the deal , opel would produce its astra model cars in russia .
gaz , russia 's second-largest car manufacturer , is poised to turn over its sprawling assembly line and distribution network to produce opel cars for the russian market .
the deal comes at a time when russia 's car market , hailed as the world 's fastest growing before the economic crisis , has shrunk by almost half this year .
the downturn has dealt a blow to russian carmakers already struggling to compete with the flood of foreign imports .
talks over job losses meanwhile , talks between european unions and delegates from general motors and magna are set to begin next week over plans to cut 10,500 jobs at opel to save labour costs to the tune of hundreds of millions of euros .

each country that is home to an opel plant is expected to send workers ' representatives to ruesselsheim to meet with negotiating partners from gm and magna .
trade union leaders at opel 's eight western european plants are worried about how much volume they each might have to relinquish to benefit another site .
however , the biggest job losses are expected to be in the bochum factory in germany – which could lose production of the astra compact and transmission production – as well as the unit in antwerp .

"
sarkozy , whose government is to introduce a carbon levy on domestic fuel emissions in 2010 , has repeatedly argued for a european union carbon tax on imports from regions with poor environmental standards .
germany had yet to come out in favor of a carbon tax on imports , which a german minister has warned could be perceived by developing nations as a form of " eco-imperialism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy will meet with world leaders at the un on tuesday before heading off to the g20 summit in pittsburgh in addition , the letter also stated that efforts for an international agreement to fight global warming have to start at next week 's un conference on climate change in new york .
in order to reach a " global and ambitious treaty " at december 's climate summit in copenhagen , the negotiators have to receive " a clear mandate . "
it was only in this way that global warming would be limited to two degrees celsius over the pre-industrial level , the statement said .
us and india consider their own climate tax france and germany are n't the only nations considering a climate tax .
across the atlantic the us house of representatives has included a carbon tariff in its climate change bill to address concerns the nation 's steel , cement and other big energy-consuming industries would be adversely affected by any deal to reduce carbon emissions .
however , many of the country 's experts have warned that the proposal could backfire on the united states by causing other nations to pose their own tariffs on us goods .
both china and india , the world 's largest and fourth largest emitters of greenhouse gases respectively , have criticized the move , calling it an unfair attack on their trade , and have already proposed measures to counteract it .
india , for example , has suggested taxing imports based on the carbon emissions of the exporting country , which would have a large impact on the us , as its per capita emissions are higher than most countries . mrm / dpa / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 155-point list addresses problems from bullets to air conditioning . the outgoing commander of the german bundeswehr in afghanistan has outlined troop and equipment shortcomings hampering german efforts to stabilize the region .
parts of his report were quoted in the german magazine focus and the bild newspaper .
according to statements in focus , general joerg vollmer says at least one additional infantry company is necessary in the kunduz region .
the current number of troops " can not achieve the immediate and wide-reaching improvement of the circumstances in the greater kunduz region , " vollmer is quoted as saying .
equipment shortages additionally , the bild newspaper reports that vollmer advises for more armored vehicles for german troops in the area .
he says that of 38 armored vehicles that have been taken out of service between january and june , none have been replaced .
vollmer adds that some of the equipment that is already available does not fulfil the needs of the troops .
for example , the helicopters in service are " effectively limited only to support operations , " vollmer told focus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier met vollmer in afghanistan last april according to the commander , the lack of air conditioning in the german marder tanks leads to blistering internal temperatures of 80 degrees celcius -lrb- 176 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , and the type of munitions supplied for certain machine guns are not appropriate for the tasks the soldiers are doing .
in a separate article published in focus , foreign minister and candidate for chancellor frank-walter steinmeier however insisted that german forces in northern afghanistan are in good shape , and also spoke against spreading german troops into other regions of the country .
" the civilian organizations and the bundeswehr troops are networked really well , they know the political figures and the tribal structure , " steinmeier said in focus .
" it would be absurd to give up this position and spread into other regions . "
mistakes by german officer in tanker bombing ?
german magazine spiegel meanwhile on saturday alleged that serious mistakes were made by a german officer regarding the controversial tanker bombing earlier in the month in afghanistan .
taliban militants had hijacked the tankers from nato forces .
estimates by afghan officials claim 99 dead in the attack , including 30 civilians .
according to the spiegel article , german colonel georg klein opted against a fly-by of f-15 airplanes before the actual bombing began .
had a fly-by been ordered , it could have given civilians near the tanker the chance to flee before the bombing began. mz / afp / reuters / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 155-point list addresses problems from bullets to air conditioning . the outgoing commander of the german bundeswehr in afghanistan has outlined troop and equipment shortcomings hampering german efforts to stabilize the region .
parts of his report were quoted in the german magazine focus and the bild newspaper .
according to statements in focus , general joerg vollmer says at least one additional infantry company is necessary in the kunduz region .
the current number of troops " can not achieve the immediate and wide-reaching improvement of the circumstances in the greater kunduz region , " vollmer is quoted as saying .
equipment shortages additionally , the bild newspaper reports that vollmer advises for more armored vehicles for german troops in the area .
he says that of 38 armored vehicles that have been taken out of service between january and june , none have been replaced .
vollmer adds that some of the equipment that is already available does not fulfil the needs of the troops .
for example , the helicopters in service are " effectively limited only to support operations , " vollmer told focus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier met vollmer in afghanistan last april according to the commander , the lack of air conditioning in the german marder tanks leads to blistering internal temperatures of 80 degrees celcius -lrb- 176 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , and the type of munitions supplied for certain machine guns are not appropriate for the tasks the soldiers are doing .
in a separate article published in focus , foreign minister and candidate for chancellor frank-walter steinmeier however insisted that german forces in northern afghanistan are in good shape , and also spoke against spreading german troops into other regions of the country .
" the civilian organizations and the bundeswehr troops are networked really well , they know the political figures and the tribal structure , " steinmeier said in focus .
" it would be absurd to give up this position and spread into other regions . "
mistakes by german officer in tanker bombing ?
german magazine spiegel meanwhile on saturday alleged that serious mistakes were made by a german officer regarding the controversial tanker bombing earlier in the month in afghanistan .
taliban militants had hijacked the tankers from nato forces .
estimates by afghan officials claim 99 dead in the attack , including 30 civilians .
according to the spiegel article , german colonel georg klein opted against a fly-by of f-15 airplanes before the actual bombing began .
had a fly-by been ordered , it could have given civilians near the tanker the chance to flee before the bombing began. mz / afp / reuters / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
sarkozy , whose government is to introduce a carbon levy on domestic fuel emissions in 2010 , has repeatedly argued for a european union carbon tax on imports from regions with poor environmental standards .
germany had yet to come out in favor of a carbon tax on imports , which a german minister has warned could be perceived by developing nations as a form of " eco-imperialism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy will meet with world leaders at the un on tuesday before heading off to the g20 summit in pittsburgh in addition , the letter also stated that efforts for an international agreement to fight global warming have to start at next week 's un conference on climate change in new york .
in order to reach a " global and ambitious treaty " at december 's climate summit in copenhagen , the negotiators have to receive " a clear mandate . "
it was only in this way that global warming would be limited to two degrees celsius over the pre-industrial level , the statement said .
us and india consider their own climate tax france and germany are n't the only nations considering a climate tax .
across the atlantic the us house of representatives has included a carbon tariff in its climate change bill to address concerns the nation 's steel , cement and other big energy-consuming industries would be adversely affected by any deal to reduce carbon emissions .
however , many of the country 's experts have warned that the proposal could backfire on the united states by causing other nations to pose their own tariffs on us goods .
both china and india , the world 's largest and fourth largest emitters of greenhouse gases respectively , have criticized the move , calling it an unfair attack on their trade , and have already proposed measures to counteract it .
india , for example , has suggested taxing imports based on the carbon emissions of the exporting country , which would have a large impact on the us , as its per capita emissions are higher than most countries . mrm / dpa / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bbc 's rayhan demytrie took advantage of a silk road car rally to see the country .
the silk road rally went from russia to kazakhstan and turkmenistan welcome to turkmenistan : " passports , please .
put your bags on the scales , " said a bossy customs officer at ashgabad 's airport .
this was our fourth passport check since arriving at what is officially called saparmurat turkmenbashi international airport .
but his expression soon changed .
" oh ... journalists , here for the rally ?
welcome to turkmenistan ! " he said with a broad smile .
turkmenistan is central asia 's most isolated country .
but it has been hosting an event the government wanted to publicise .
the silk way rally was a week-long car race of professionals and amateurs beginning in kazan in russia , winding its way through the kazakh steppe and into the deserts of turkmenistan .
it was an opportunity for natural gas-rich turkmenistan to show how well it is doing - and for journalists it was a rare chance to visit a state that has been largely closed to the outside world .
white city every morning an army of street cleaners sweeps , scrapes and washes the central squares and avenues of ashgabad , turkmenistan 's capital .
the city looks spotless .
smoking is banned outdoors and the penalty if you 're caught is a steep $ 50 -lrb- £ 30 -rrb- .
there are enough policemen in the streets to ensure citizens obey the rules .
turkmenistan is a great country - look at our capital tursun , ashgabad street cleaner in fact , there is one policeman every 100m , even in the quietest of places .
" i am kind of used to it , and i think it is not that bad , " said one resident who did not want to be named .
" at least we always feel safe . "
ashgabad has been under redevelopment for years .
the building was begun under its former leader , the authoritarian saparmurat niyazov .
nothing has stood in the way of turkmenistan 's construction boom .
dubbed the white city , ashgabad is full of high buildings with white marble facades .
all major public buildings , including government ministries , palaces , museums and schools , have been given the marble treatment .
many residents are proud of their new city .
gas pride " turkmenistan is a great country - look at our capital , " says a street cleaner named tursun .
" if you work hard , you earn money and live well .
i work six days a week , clean the tiles of these fountains and trim rose bushes .
i get paid about $ 100 a month .
we are happy , thank you to our president , he says . "
the country 's leadership claims the country has not been affected by the global financial crisis .
turkmenistan has had little contact with global markets there is some truth to this , as turkmenistan has had little contact with international markets .
an independent audit carried out in 2008 claimed the country has the fifth-largest proven gas reserves in the world .
unsurprisingly , the international community has been courting the country , hoping for a stake in turkmenistan 's hydrocarbon wealth .
only recently president kurbanguly berdymukhamedov announced his intention to join the nabucco pipeline , the eu-backed project that would deliver caspian gas to europe , bypassing russia .
wind of change ?
but rights groups have long warned that , seduced by gas , the international community has not put enough pressure on the country regarding political and social freedoms .
" it is much better now , we can travel from one region to another without special permission , " says a woman in turkmenistan 's largest market , tolkuchka , in the outskirts of ashgabad .
there are signs the new president is building a cult of personality many here inevitably compare the recent past under mr niyazov - who pursued a cult of personality - to his successor , president berdymukhamedov .
he has made a number of reforms , adopting a new constitution , restoring the country 's parliament and reintroducing traditional names for days of the week and months .
he even restored the opera and circus - both pronounced alien to turkmen culture under mr niyazov .
today mr niyazov 's pervasive legacy is fading away .
the statues to him remain , but the golden paint is slowly peeling .
repeating history but three years into president berdymukhamedov 's rule , his portraits are increasingly replacing mr niyazov 's .

the bbc 's rayhan demytrie took advantage of a silk road car rally to see the country .
the silk road rally went from russia to kazakhstan and turkmenistan welcome to turkmenistan : " passports , please .
put your bags on the scales , " said a bossy customs officer at ashgabad 's airport .
this was our fourth passport check since arriving at what is officially called saparmurat turkmenbashi international airport .
but his expression soon changed .
" oh ... journalists , here for the rally ?
welcome to turkmenistan ! " he said with a broad smile .
turkmenistan is central asia 's most isolated country .
but it has been hosting an event the government wanted to publicise .
the silk way rally was a week-long car race of professionals and amateurs beginning in kazan in russia , winding its way through the kazakh steppe and into the deserts of turkmenistan .
it was an opportunity for natural gas-rich turkmenistan to show how well it is doing - and for journalists it was a rare chance to visit a state that has been largely closed to the outside world .
white city every morning an army of street cleaners sweeps , scrapes and washes the central squares and avenues of ashgabad , turkmenistan 's capital .
the city looks spotless .
smoking is banned outdoors and the penalty if you 're caught is a steep $ 50 -lrb- £ 30 -rrb- .
there are enough policemen in the streets to ensure citizens obey the rules .
turkmenistan is a great country - look at our capital tursun , ashgabad street cleaner in fact , there is one policeman every 100m , even in the quietest of places .
" i am kind of used to it , and i think it is not that bad , " said one resident who did not want to be named .
" at least we always feel safe . "
ashgabad has been under redevelopment for years .
the building was begun under its former leader , the authoritarian saparmurat niyazov .
nothing has stood in the way of turkmenistan 's construction boom .
dubbed the white city , ashgabad is full of high buildings with white marble facades .
all major public buildings , including government ministries , palaces , museums and schools , have been given the marble treatment .
many residents are proud of their new city .
gas pride " turkmenistan is a great country - look at our capital , " says a street cleaner named tursun .
" if you work hard , you earn money and live well .
i work six days a week , clean the tiles of these fountains and trim rose bushes .
i get paid about $ 100 a month .
we are happy , thank you to our president , he says . "
the country 's leadership claims the country has not been affected by the global financial crisis .
turkmenistan has had little contact with global markets there is some truth to this , as turkmenistan has had little contact with international markets .
an independent audit carried out in 2008 claimed the country has the fifth-largest proven gas reserves in the world .
unsurprisingly , the international community has been courting the country , hoping for a stake in turkmenistan 's hydrocarbon wealth .
only recently president kurbanguly berdymukhamedov announced his intention to join the nabucco pipeline , the eu-backed project that would deliver caspian gas to europe , bypassing russia .
wind of change ?
but rights groups have long warned that , seduced by gas , the international community has not put enough pressure on the country regarding political and social freedoms .
" it is much better now , we can travel from one region to another without special permission , " says a woman in turkmenistan 's largest market , tolkuchka , in the outskirts of ashgabad .
there are signs the new president is building a cult of personality many here inevitably compare the recent past under mr niyazov - who pursued a cult of personality - to his successor , president berdymukhamedov .
he has made a number of reforms , adopting a new constitution , restoring the country 's parliament and reintroducing traditional names for days of the week and months .
he even restored the opera and circus - both pronounced alien to turkmen culture under mr niyazov .
today mr niyazov 's pervasive legacy is fading away .
the statues to him remain , but the golden paint is slowly peeling .
repeating history but three years into president berdymukhamedov 's rule , his portraits are increasingly replacing mr niyazov 's .
