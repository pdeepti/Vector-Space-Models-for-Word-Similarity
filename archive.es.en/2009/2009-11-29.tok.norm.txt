but if europe is not to lose ground , the opinion of experts in europe and china is that the eu should at least try and match us offers of cooperation and trump them with actual concrete action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china wants the eu to get its act together as a partner " during a high level meeting in beijing last week , we got a very clear signal from the chinese leadership , " holslag told deutsche welle .
" premier wen jiabao and state counselor dai bingguo explained that china attaches a lot of importance to cooperation with europe and that it should not worry about a g2 .
but for the chinese , the ball is in our court now .
they want us to prove that we can get our act together and come up with a pragmatic agenda for cooperation .
if the eu can add no value to china 's essentially commercial relations with individual member states , there will not be a strategic partnership . " paul lim , a senior academic adviser at the european institute for asian studies in brussels , said that china would pick up on any concern within europe in relation to its position as a partner and could possibly play the eu and us off against each other .
but he also said china needs both powers for very different reasons . " the us , with its history of relations with asia , its presence in asia makes it a more important partner than the eu , " lim told deutsche welle .
" the eu with its soft power which it can use to great influence is still young , and is new in the game .
it all boils down to how much of a common voice the eu projects .
china will want an ally on certain issues with the eu in relation to the us and the eu will want an ally in the us on certain issues with china .
i do not see the eu losing any influence with china and i 'm sure that the us and eu will not allow china to play them against each other . "
obama 's pragmatism could bode ill for eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has opened the path to greater dialogue with beijing president obama 's visit was the first example of the current administration 's desire to engage with china and the importance it attached to china and the wider asian region as a key strategic partner .
while there were few breakthroughs to make the europeans nervous , obama came away from beijing with the paths to dialog firmly open and as such , moved the us into a position which could undermine europe 's influence in future . " chinese aid is much needed to keep the american economy afloat and to stabilize afghanistan , " holslag said .
" this has cautioned obama during his visit .
if the united states continues to opt for more pragmatism , this would certainly weaken europe 's bargaining position when it comes to human rights , economic liberalization and other challenges . "
to lag behind in relations and cooperation with the chinese could be damaging to the eu .
china 's new global influence through investment in africa and elsewhere , its growing economic muscle and its position as a major player in global issues such as iran and north korea , as well as climate change , makes the people 's republic a partner to neglect at peril . lack of action damaging eu reputation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen jinbao wants to see more action from barrosso 's eu what could prove damaging is china 's concern that the eu can talk a good partnership but is showing a lack of commitment when it comes to putting these words into practice in areas where eu-sino relations have been traditionally strong . " while trade has always been the main driver of sino-european cooperation , this has now become one of the main sources of friction , " holslag said .
" it is clear that europe 's failure to innovate its industries is leading to more sensitivity of competition from countries like china . " on the international scene we both have a joint interest in stabilizing africa , securing central asia and promoting multilateral cooperation , " he added .
" but joint interests do not automatically lead to cooperation .
growing assertiveness makes beijing more eager to promote its own values , while the eu is not proving itself as a strong player . " calls for reform turning opinion against europe where the eu continues to hold a strong hand is in its dedication to democracy and human rights .
the european union has long been a strong advocate of reform in china and has never missed an opportunity to make its feelings known .
in most cases china has responded respectfully but has given few concrete indicators that eu pressure alone is enough to force through radical change .
as a result , europe continues to press beijing in the hope that persistence will win out in the end . in fact , the eu 's regular advocating of democratic and social reform in china is beginning to turn opinion within the people 's republic , leading some within the chinese government to suggest that europe should put its own house in order fist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's constant calls for reform start to annoy china " traditionally the chinese are concerned about ' saving their face ' , " holslag said .
" but let us not forget that the pro-europe camp in beijing is losing ground .
leaders like premier wen have come under quite a lot of pressure from political hardliners and the public opinion .
china has become less tolerant of european lecturing .
as a result , we might even expect more chinese criticism on the eu 's weak performance in the combat against climate change , its deplorable economic situation or its lack of political coherence . " despite the uncertain climate between europe and china , paul lim believes that the current level of financial commitment and strategic cooperation between the two powers is enough to look towards the future with guarded optimism . " the future of eu-china cooperation depends on maturity of relations , of respect , of being able to accept criticisms , and an understanding of each other 's culture . " said lim .
" however , right now , there has to be a certain degree of closeness , of trust and confidence for the eu to put its money into china .
the two powers are also coming closer on climate change as its effects are felt in china and we can not deny that china is doing something about it even if we think it is not enough .

but for the saami in russia 's north , the mild winters already pose a threat to their traditional way of life . all around the arctic , the effects of a temperature rise are visible , and native inhabitants of the tundras in europa , asia and north america are struggling with the new reality .
that 's also true for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula , an area bordering on norway and finnish lapland .
but , in russia , climate change is not a hot-button issue , nor is much attention being paid to the upcoming climate summit in copenhagen .
russian scientists say they have no evidence that global warming is a long-term trend , and doubt whether it is a man-made phenomenon . a little ice age ?
in the country 's northern port in the town of murmansk , the marine biological institute of the russian academy of sciences monitors life in and around the barents sea .
the institute has amassed an impressive database concerning temperature and salinity of the sea over the course of the 20th century .
referring to the statistics , biologist pavel makarevich says there are clear cycles during which both temperature and salinity rise and fall . these cycles , he says , are related to solar activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murmansk is russia 's gateway to the arctic waters " in my opinion and that of our institute , the problems connected to the current stage of warming are being exaggerated , " he says .
" what we are dealing with is not a global warming of the atmosphere or of the oceans . "
makarevich expects a normalization of arctic temperatures in the coming years .
this view appears to have the support of a growing number of russian scientists .
some even predict a temporary cooling of temperatures towards the middle of this century , a phenomenon known as a " little ice age . "
shorter winters but for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula between the barents and the white sea , a drop in temperature is urgently needed .
over the last few years , the winters have become milder and milder , threatening the traditional lifestyle of the saami .
this year again , the onset of winter was late in northern russia .
normally , the tundra would already be covered by a deep layer of snow , and the numerous lakes would have a thick layer of ice .
but snow cover is minimal and some of the lakes are not even frozen yet .
for native reindeer herders , that 's a problem , because the traditional slaughter season has to be postponed .
" the slaughter used to start in early november , " says herder nikolai filippov .
" at that time , the ice is usually strong enough to carry the reindeer .
but over the past few years , the ice has been weak and sparse , so we can not travel , and the slaughter has to be postponed until just before the new year .
this year , yields will be minimal . "
each fall , the big reindeer herds are somewhere on the vast expanses of the kola peninsula .
at the onset of winter , they have to be found and driven to lovozero , the center of the russian saami community .
but that can only happen under true winter conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indigenous saami people depend on reindeer for their living " last year it was exactly the same .
this year we do not know yet how the herds are , and what will happen later in the autumn , " filippov says .
" sometimes it is still raining around the new year , and you can not go over bare ice with the reindeer .
so then you will have to wait until after the new year .
in fact , the winter only starts in january .
for now it is a mixture of frost and thaw . "
the capricious weather has all kinds of practical consequences for the everyday life of the saami .
nikolai filippov and his wife maria live in a chum , a traditional saami tipi-like tent with a hole in the top to let out the smoke .
maria used to prepare lots of food for the winter .
but now that is out of the question , because the thaw often comes in the middle of winter and the meat can no longer be preserved .
the tundra is no longer a reliable natural refrigerator .
" in the old days it never rained in december , " says maria filippova .
" when it rains in winter , the snow disappears and we ca n't move on with our animals to search for reindeer moss . "
for thousands of years , the saami lived according to an ancient and extremely reliable calendar .
but today , says nikolai filippov , everything seems to be off course .
for him , there is no question that nature is changing .
what is happening in the tundra today is something the 59-year-old has never seen before .
the arctic as a future trading route the city of murmansk , a few hours ' drive to the north , seems a world away .
in the harbor , there 's the lenin - the first soviet nuclear-powered icebreaker built in the 1950s .
today , the heavy vessel is a museum .
andrei smirnov was the lenin 's last captain when the ship was retired in 1989 .
" no other country has boundaries like russia that stretch so far to the north , " smirnov says .
he is convinced that russia will need icebreakers like this one , now and in the future .
" we have been using the northern passage since 1932 .
it is a sea route of national significance , and since 1991 , foreign ships have also been allowed to use it .
this year as well , foreigners have used the passage , and we have successfully guided them through with our icebreakers . "
smirnov is referring to ships belonging to the german company beluga .
earlier this year , they made an impressive voyage from south korea to rotterdam , via the arctic seas north of russia .
bildunterschrift : this year , two ships from the german company , beluga , completed the trip around russia 's north .
the northern passage could become an alternative to existing routes the trip was meant to prove that the north pole ice is retreating as a result of global warming , and that the northern passage could become an attractive , much shorter alternative for existing routes like the one via the suez canal .
it sounds great , but longtime members of russia 's northern fleet , such as nikolai babich , can only laugh at the thought ..
" saying that one could navigate in the polar seas without the help of icebreakers , or even reach the north pole unhindered , no , that is not serious , " says babich .
babich feels at home in the russian arctic .
he has visited almost every corner of it during the last 40 years , and he claims there is no-one like him who has studied the area in such detail .
the recent rise in global temperature has surprised neither him nor his colleagues .
it has happened in the past , he says , and it will happen again .
" the natural processes we have seen during the past decade are mainly the result of the sun 's activity .
they show a slight increase in temperature , and as a result , arctic ice has receded , " he says .
but according to babich , the situation is changing .
the arctic , he says , is already cooling , not warming .
and the russian government is attentively listening to those scientists who , like babich , are predicting a cold spell .

referring to the statistics , biologist pavel makarevich says there are clear cycles during which both temperature and salinity rise and fall . these cycles , he says , are related to solar activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murmansk is russia 's gateway to the arctic waters " in my opinion and that of our institute , the problems connected to the current stage of warming are being exaggerated , " he says .
" what we are dealing with is not a global warming of the atmosphere or of the oceans . "
makarevich expects a normalization of arctic temperatures in the coming years .
this view appears to have the support of a growing number of russian scientists .
some even predict a temporary cooling of temperatures towards the middle of this century , a phenomenon known as a " little ice age . "
shorter winters but for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula between the barents and the white sea , a drop in temperature is urgently needed .
over the last few years , the winters have become milder and milder , threatening the traditional lifestyle of the saami .
this year again , the onset of winter was late in northern russia .
normally , the tundra would already be covered by a deep layer of snow , and the numerous lakes would have a thick layer of ice .
but snow cover is minimal and some of the lakes are not even frozen yet .
for native reindeer herders , that 's a problem , because the traditional slaughter season has to be postponed .
" the slaughter used to start in early november , " says herder nikolai filippov .
" at that time , the ice is usually strong enough to carry the reindeer .
but over the past few years , the ice has been weak and sparse , so we can not travel , and the slaughter has to be postponed until just before the new year .
this year , yields will be minimal . "
each fall , the big reindeer herds are somewhere on the vast expanses of the kola peninsula .
at the onset of winter , they have to be found and driven to lovozero , the center of the russian saami community .
but that can only happen under true winter conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indigenous saami people depend on reindeer for their living " last year it was exactly the same .
this year we do not know yet how the herds are , and what will happen later in the autumn , " filippov says .
" sometimes it is still raining around the new year , and you can not go over bare ice with the reindeer .
so then you will have to wait until after the new year .
in fact , the winter only starts in january .
for now it is a mixture of frost and thaw . "
the capricious weather has all kinds of practical consequences for the everyday life of the saami .
nikolai filippov and his wife maria live in a chum , a traditional saami tipi-like tent with a hole in the top to let out the smoke .
maria used to prepare lots of food for the winter .
but now that is out of the question , because the thaw often comes in the middle of winter and the meat can no longer be preserved .
the tundra is no longer a reliable natural refrigerator .
" in the old days it never rained in december , " says maria filippova .
" when it rains in winter , the snow disappears and we ca n't move on with our animals to search for reindeer moss . "
for thousands of years , the saami lived according to an ancient and extremely reliable calendar .
but today , says nikolai filippov , everything seems to be off course .
for him , there is no question that nature is changing .
what is happening in the tundra today is something the 59-year-old has never seen before .
the arctic as a future trading route the city of murmansk , a few hours ' drive to the north , seems a world away .
in the harbor , there 's the lenin - the first soviet nuclear-powered icebreaker built in the 1950s .
today , the heavy vessel is a museum .
andrei smirnov was the lenin 's last captain when the ship was retired in 1989 .
" no other country has boundaries like russia that stretch so far to the north , " smirnov says .
he is convinced that russia will need icebreakers like this one , now and in the future .
" we have been using the northern passage since 1932 .
it is a sea route of national significance , and since 1991 , foreign ships have also been allowed to use it .
this year as well , foreigners have used the passage , and we have successfully guided them through with our icebreakers . "
smirnov is referring to ships belonging to the german company beluga .
earlier this year , they made an impressive voyage from south korea to rotterdam , via the arctic seas north of russia .
bildunterschrift : this year , two ships from the german company , beluga , completed the trip around russia 's north .
the northern passage could become an alternative to existing routes the trip was meant to prove that the north pole ice is retreating as a result of global warming , and that the northern passage could become an attractive , much shorter alternative for existing routes like the one via the suez canal .
it sounds great , but longtime members of russia 's northern fleet , such as nikolai babich , can only laugh at the thought ..
" saying that one could navigate in the polar seas without the help of icebreakers , or even reach the north pole unhindered , no , that is not serious , " says babich .
babich feels at home in the russian arctic .
he has visited almost every corner of it during the last 40 years , and he claims there is no-one like him who has studied the area in such detail .
the recent rise in global temperature has surprised neither him nor his colleagues .
it has happened in the past , he says , and it will happen again .
" the natural processes we have seen during the past decade are mainly the result of the sun 's activity .
they show a slight increase in temperature , and as a result , arctic ice has receded , " he says .
but according to babich , the situation is changing .
the arctic , he says , is already cooling , not warming .
and the russian government is attentively listening to those scientists who , like babich , are predicting a cold spell .

for native reindeer herders , that 's a problem , because the traditional slaughter season has to be postponed .
" the slaughter used to start in early november , " says herder nikolai filippov .
" at that time , the ice is usually strong enough to carry the reindeer .
but over the past few years , the ice has been weak and sparse , so we can not travel , and the slaughter has to be postponed until just before the new year .
this year , yields will be minimal . "
each fall , the big reindeer herds are somewhere on the vast expanses of the kola peninsula .
at the onset of winter , they have to be found and driven to lovozero , the center of the russian saami community .
but that can only happen under true winter conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indigenous saami people depend on reindeer for their living " last year it was exactly the same .
this year we do not know yet how the herds are , and what will happen later in the autumn , " filippov says .
" sometimes it is still raining around the new year , and you can not go over bare ice with the reindeer .
so then you will have to wait until after the new year .
in fact , the winter only starts in january .
for now it is a mixture of frost and thaw . "
the capricious weather has all kinds of practical consequences for the everyday life of the saami .
nikolai filippov and his wife maria live in a chum , a traditional saami tipi-like tent with a hole in the top to let out the smoke .
maria used to prepare lots of food for the winter .
but now that is out of the question , because the thaw often comes in the middle of winter and the meat can no longer be preserved .
the tundra is no longer a reliable natural refrigerator .
" in the old days it never rained in december , " says maria filippova .
" when it rains in winter , the snow disappears and we ca n't move on with our animals to search for reindeer moss . "
for thousands of years , the saami lived according to an ancient and extremely reliable calendar .
but today , says nikolai filippov , everything seems to be off course .
for him , there is no question that nature is changing .
what is happening in the tundra today is something the 59-year-old has never seen before .
the arctic as a future trading route the city of murmansk , a few hours ' drive to the north , seems a world away .
in the harbor , there 's the lenin - the first soviet nuclear-powered icebreaker built in the 1950s .
today , the heavy vessel is a museum .
andrei smirnov was the lenin 's last captain when the ship was retired in 1989 .
" no other country has boundaries like russia that stretch so far to the north , " smirnov says .
he is convinced that russia will need icebreakers like this one , now and in the future .
" we have been using the northern passage since 1932 .
it is a sea route of national significance , and since 1991 , foreign ships have also been allowed to use it .
this year as well , foreigners have used the passage , and we have successfully guided them through with our icebreakers . "
smirnov is referring to ships belonging to the german company beluga .
earlier this year , they made an impressive voyage from south korea to rotterdam , via the arctic seas north of russia .
bildunterschrift : this year , two ships from the german company , beluga , completed the trip around russia 's north .
the northern passage could become an alternative to existing routes the trip was meant to prove that the north pole ice is retreating as a result of global warming , and that the northern passage could become an attractive , much shorter alternative for existing routes like the one via the suez canal .
it sounds great , but longtime members of russia 's northern fleet , such as nikolai babich , can only laugh at the thought ..
" saying that one could navigate in the polar seas without the help of icebreakers , or even reach the north pole unhindered , no , that is not serious , " says babich .
babich feels at home in the russian arctic .
he has visited almost every corner of it during the last 40 years , and he claims there is no-one like him who has studied the area in such detail .
the recent rise in global temperature has surprised neither him nor his colleagues .
it has happened in the past , he says , and it will happen again .
" the natural processes we have seen during the past decade are mainly the result of the sun 's activity .
they show a slight increase in temperature , and as a result , arctic ice has receded , " he says .
but according to babich , the situation is changing .
the arctic , he says , is already cooling , not warming .
and the russian government is attentively listening to those scientists who , like babich , are predicting a cold spell .

but for the saami in russia 's north , the mild winters already pose a threat to their traditional way of life . all around the arctic , the effects of a temperature rise are visible , and native inhabitants of the tundras in europa , asia and north america are struggling with the new reality .
that 's also true for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula , an area bordering on norway and finnish lapland .
but , in russia , climate change is not a hot-button issue , nor is much attention being paid to the upcoming climate summit in copenhagen .
russian scientists say they have no evidence that global warming is a long-term trend , and doubt whether it is a man-made phenomenon . a little ice age ?
in the country 's northern port in the town of murmansk , the marine biological institute of the russian academy of sciences monitors life in and around the barents sea .
the institute has amassed an impressive database concerning temperature and salinity of the sea over the course of the 20th century .
referring to the statistics , biologist pavel makarevich says there are clear cycles during which both temperature and salinity rise and fall . these cycles , he says , are related to solar activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murmansk is russia 's gateway to the arctic waters " in my opinion and that of our institute , the problems connected to the current stage of warming are being exaggerated , " he says .
" what we are dealing with is not a global warming of the atmosphere or of the oceans . "
makarevich expects a normalization of arctic temperatures in the coming years .
this view appears to have the support of a growing number of russian scientists .
some even predict a temporary cooling of temperatures towards the middle of this century , a phenomenon known as a " little ice age . "
shorter winters but for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula between the barents and the white sea , a drop in temperature is urgently needed .
over the last few years , the winters have become milder and milder , threatening the traditional lifestyle of the saami .
this year again , the onset of winter was late in northern russia .
normally , the tundra would already be covered by a deep layer of snow , and the numerous lakes would have a thick layer of ice .
but snow cover is minimal and some of the lakes are not even frozen yet .
for native reindeer herders , that 's a problem , because the traditional slaughter season has to be postponed .

but if europe is not to lose ground , the opinion of experts in europe and china is that the eu should at least try and match us offers of cooperation and trump them with actual concrete action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china wants the eu to get its act together as a partner " during a high level meeting in beijing last week , we got a very clear signal from the chinese leadership , " holslag told deutsche welle .
" premier wen jiabao and state counselor dai bingguo explained that china attaches a lot of importance to cooperation with europe and that it should not worry about a g2 .
but for the chinese , the ball is in our court now .
they want us to prove that we can get our act together and come up with a pragmatic agenda for cooperation .
if the eu can add no value to china 's essentially commercial relations with individual member states , there will not be a strategic partnership . " paul lim , a senior academic adviser at the european institute for asian studies in brussels , said that china would pick up on any concern within europe in relation to its position as a partner and could possibly play the eu and us off against each other .
but he also said china needs both powers for very different reasons . " the us , with its history of relations with asia , its presence in asia makes it a more important partner than the eu , " lim told deutsche welle .
" the eu with its soft power which it can use to great influence is still young , and is new in the game .
it all boils down to how much of a common voice the eu projects .
china will want an ally on certain issues with the eu in relation to the us and the eu will want an ally in the us on certain issues with china .
i do not see the eu losing any influence with china and i 'm sure that the us and eu will not allow china to play them against each other . "
obama 's pragmatism could bode ill for eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has opened the path to greater dialogue with beijing president obama 's visit was the first example of the current administration 's desire to engage with china and the importance it attached to china and the wider asian region as a key strategic partner .
while there were few breakthroughs to make the europeans nervous , obama came away from beijing with the paths to dialog firmly open and as such , moved the us into a position which could undermine europe 's influence in future . " chinese aid is much needed to keep the american economy afloat and to stabilize afghanistan , " holslag said .
" this has cautioned obama during his visit .
if the united states continues to opt for more pragmatism , this would certainly weaken europe 's bargaining position when it comes to human rights , economic liberalization and other challenges . "
to lag behind in relations and cooperation with the chinese could be damaging to the eu .
china 's new global influence through investment in africa and elsewhere , its growing economic muscle and its position as a major player in global issues such as iran and north korea , as well as climate change , makes the people 's republic a partner to neglect at peril . lack of action damaging eu reputation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen jinbao wants to see more action from barrosso 's eu what could prove damaging is china 's concern that the eu can talk a good partnership but is showing a lack of commitment when it comes to putting these words into practice in areas where eu-sino relations have been traditionally strong . " while trade has always been the main driver of sino-european cooperation , this has now become one of the main sources of friction , " holslag said .
" it is clear that europe 's failure to innovate its industries is leading to more sensitivity of competition from countries like china . " on the international scene we both have a joint interest in stabilizing africa , securing central asia and promoting multilateral cooperation , " he added .
" but joint interests do not automatically lead to cooperation .
growing assertiveness makes beijing more eager to promote its own values , while the eu is not proving itself as a strong player . " calls for reform turning opinion against europe where the eu continues to hold a strong hand is in its dedication to democracy and human rights .
the european union has long been a strong advocate of reform in china and has never missed an opportunity to make its feelings known .
in most cases china has responded respectfully but has given few concrete indicators that eu pressure alone is enough to force through radical change .
as a result , europe continues to press beijing in the hope that persistence will win out in the end . in fact , the eu 's regular advocating of democratic and social reform in china is beginning to turn opinion within the people 's republic , leading some within the chinese government to suggest that europe should put its own house in order fist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's constant calls for reform start to annoy china " traditionally the chinese are concerned about ' saving their face ' , " holslag said .
" but let us not forget that the pro-europe camp in beijing is losing ground .
leaders like premier wen have come under quite a lot of pressure from political hardliners and the public opinion .
china has become less tolerant of european lecturing .
as a result , we might even expect more chinese criticism on the eu 's weak performance in the combat against climate change , its deplorable economic situation or its lack of political coherence . " despite the uncertain climate between europe and china , paul lim believes that the current level of financial commitment and strategic cooperation between the two powers is enough to look towards the future with guarded optimism . " the future of eu-china cooperation depends on maturity of relations , of respect , of being able to accept criticisms , and an understanding of each other 's culture . " said lim .
" however , right now , there has to be a certain degree of closeness , of trust and confidence for the eu to put its money into china .
the two powers are also coming closer on climate change as its effects are felt in china and we can not deny that china is doing something about it even if we think it is not enough .
but the big question is how mature the relationship is .
this is another matter . " author : nick amies editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 29.11.2009 in russian arctic , global warming threatens traditional way of life großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 'll soon get colder again , some russian scientists say russian scientists have doubts over whether global warming is here to stay and whether it 's man made .
but for the saami in russia 's north , the mild winters already pose a threat to their traditional way of life . all around the arctic , the effects of a temperature rise are visible , and native inhabitants of the tundras in europa , asia and north america are struggling with the new reality .
that 's also true for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula , an area bordering on norway and finnish lapland .
but , in russia , climate change is not a hot-button issue , nor is much attention being paid to the upcoming climate summit in copenhagen .
russian scientists say they have no evidence that global warming is a long-term trend , and doubt whether it is a man-made phenomenon . a little ice age ?
in the country 's northern port in the town of murmansk , the marine biological institute of the russian academy of sciences monitors life in and around the barents sea .
the institute has amassed an impressive database concerning temperature and salinity of the sea over the course of the 20th century .
referring to the statistics , biologist pavel makarevich says there are clear cycles during which both temperature and salinity rise and fall . these cycles , he says , are related to solar activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murmansk is russia 's gateway to the arctic waters " in my opinion and that of our institute , the problems connected to the current stage of warming are being exaggerated , " he says .
" what we are dealing with is not a global warming of the atmosphere or of the oceans . "
makarevich expects a normalization of arctic temperatures in the coming years .
this view appears to have the support of a growing number of russian scientists .
some even predict a temporary cooling of temperatures towards the middle of this century , a phenomenon known as a " little ice age . "
shorter winters but for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula between the barents and the white sea , a drop in temperature is urgently needed .
over the last few years , the winters have become milder and milder , threatening the traditional lifestyle of the saami .
this year again , the onset of winter was late in northern russia .
normally , the tundra would already be covered by a deep layer of snow , and the numerous lakes would have a thick layer of ice .
but snow cover is minimal and some of the lakes are not even frozen yet .
for native reindeer herders , that 's a problem , because the traditional slaughter season has to be postponed .
" the slaughter used to start in early november , " says herder nikolai filippov .
" at that time , the ice is usually strong enough to carry the reindeer .
but over the past few years , the ice has been weak and sparse , so we can not travel , and the slaughter has to be postponed until just before the new year .
this year , yields will be minimal . "
each fall , the big reindeer herds are somewhere on the vast expanses of the kola peninsula .
at the onset of winter , they have to be found and driven to lovozero , the center of the russian saami community .
but that can only happen under true winter conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indigenous saami people depend on reindeer for their living " last year it was exactly the same .
this year we do not know yet how the herds are , and what will happen later in the autumn , " filippov says .
" sometimes it is still raining around the new year , and you can not go over bare ice with the reindeer .
so then you will have to wait until after the new year .
in fact , the winter only starts in january .
for now it is a mixture of frost and thaw . "
the capricious weather has all kinds of practical consequences for the everyday life of the saami .
nikolai filippov and his wife maria live in a chum , a traditional saami tipi-like tent with a hole in the top to let out the smoke .
maria used to prepare lots of food for the winter .
but now that is out of the question , because the thaw often comes in the middle of winter and the meat can no longer be preserved .
the tundra is no longer a reliable natural refrigerator .
" in the old days it never rained in december , " says maria filippova .
" when it rains in winter , the snow disappears and we ca n't move on with our animals to search for reindeer moss . "
for thousands of years , the saami lived according to an ancient and extremely reliable calendar .
but today , says nikolai filippov , everything seems to be off course .
for him , there is no question that nature is changing .
what is happening in the tundra today is something the 59-year-old has never seen before .
the arctic as a future trading route the city of murmansk , a few hours ' drive to the north , seems a world away .
in the harbor , there 's the lenin - the first soviet nuclear-powered icebreaker built in the 1950s .
today , the heavy vessel is a museum .
andrei smirnov was the lenin 's last captain when the ship was retired in 1989 .
" no other country has boundaries like russia that stretch so far to the north , " smirnov says .
he is convinced that russia will need icebreakers like this one , now and in the future .
" we have been using the northern passage since 1932 .
it is a sea route of national significance , and since 1991 , foreign ships have also been allowed to use it .
this year as well , foreigners have used the passage , and we have successfully guided them through with our icebreakers . "
smirnov is referring to ships belonging to the german company beluga .
earlier this year , they made an impressive voyage from south korea to rotterdam , via the arctic seas north of russia .
bildunterschrift : this year , two ships from the german company , beluga , completed the trip around russia 's north .
the northern passage could become an alternative to existing routes the trip was meant to prove that the north pole ice is retreating as a result of global warming , and that the northern passage could become an attractive , much shorter alternative for existing routes like the one via the suez canal .
it sounds great , but longtime members of russia 's northern fleet , such as nikolai babich , can only laugh at the thought ..
" saying that one could navigate in the polar seas without the help of icebreakers , or even reach the north pole unhindered , no , that is not serious , " says babich .
babich feels at home in the russian arctic .
he has visited almost every corner of it during the last 40 years , and he claims there is no-one like him who has studied the area in such detail .
the recent rise in global temperature has surprised neither him nor his colleagues .
it has happened in the past , he says , and it will happen again .
" the natural processes we have seen during the past decade are mainly the result of the sun 's activity .
they show a slight increase in temperature , and as a result , arctic ice has receded , " he says .
but according to babich , the situation is changing .
the arctic , he says , is already cooling , not warming .
and the russian government is attentively listening to those scientists who , like babich , are predicting a cold spell .

but for the saami in russia 's north , the mild winters already pose a threat to their traditional way of life . all around the arctic , the effects of a temperature rise are visible , and native inhabitants of the tundras in europa , asia and north america are struggling with the new reality .
that 's also true for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula , an area bordering on norway and finnish lapland .
but , in russia , climate change is not a hot-button issue , nor is much attention being paid to the upcoming climate summit in copenhagen .
russian scientists say they have no evidence that global warming is a long-term trend , and doubt whether it is a man-made phenomenon . a little ice age ?
in the country 's northern port in the town of murmansk , the marine biological institute of the russian academy of sciences monitors life in and around the barents sea .
the institute has amassed an impressive database concerning temperature and salinity of the sea over the course of the 20th century .
referring to the statistics , biologist pavel makarevich says there are clear cycles during which both temperature and salinity rise and fall . these cycles , he says , are related to solar activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murmansk is russia 's gateway to the arctic waters " in my opinion and that of our institute , the problems connected to the current stage of warming are being exaggerated , " he says .
" what we are dealing with is not a global warming of the atmosphere or of the oceans . "
makarevich expects a normalization of arctic temperatures in the coming years .
this view appears to have the support of a growing number of russian scientists .
some even predict a temporary cooling of temperatures towards the middle of this century , a phenomenon known as a " little ice age . "
shorter winters but for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula between the barents and the white sea , a drop in temperature is urgently needed .
over the last few years , the winters have become milder and milder , threatening the traditional lifestyle of the saami .
this year again , the onset of winter was late in northern russia .
normally , the tundra would already be covered by a deep layer of snow , and the numerous lakes would have a thick layer of ice .
but snow cover is minimal and some of the lakes are not even frozen yet .
for native reindeer herders , that 's a problem , because the traditional slaughter season has to be postponed .
" the slaughter used to start in early november , " says herder nikolai filippov .
" at that time , the ice is usually strong enough to carry the reindeer .
but over the past few years , the ice has been weak and sparse , so we can not travel , and the slaughter has to be postponed until just before the new year .
this year , yields will be minimal . "
each fall , the big reindeer herds are somewhere on the vast expanses of the kola peninsula .
at the onset of winter , they have to be found and driven to lovozero , the center of the russian saami community .
but that can only happen under true winter conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indigenous saami people depend on reindeer for their living " last year it was exactly the same .
this year we do not know yet how the herds are , and what will happen later in the autumn , " filippov says .
" sometimes it is still raining around the new year , and you can not go over bare ice with the reindeer .
so then you will have to wait until after the new year .
in fact , the winter only starts in january .
for now it is a mixture of frost and thaw . "
the capricious weather has all kinds of practical consequences for the everyday life of the saami .
nikolai filippov and his wife maria live in a chum , a traditional saami tipi-like tent with a hole in the top to let out the smoke .
maria used to prepare lots of food for the winter .
but now that is out of the question , because the thaw often comes in the middle of winter and the meat can no longer be preserved .
the tundra is no longer a reliable natural refrigerator .

this year as well , foreigners have used the passage , and we have successfully guided them through with our icebreakers . "
smirnov is referring to ships belonging to the german company beluga .
earlier this year , they made an impressive voyage from south korea to rotterdam , via the arctic seas north of russia .
bildunterschrift : this year , two ships from the german company , beluga , completed the trip around russia 's north .
the northern passage could become an alternative to existing routes the trip was meant to prove that the north pole ice is retreating as a result of global warming , and that the northern passage could become an attractive , much shorter alternative for existing routes like the one via the suez canal .
it sounds great , but longtime members of russia 's northern fleet , such as nikolai babich , can only laugh at the thought ..
" saying that one could navigate in the polar seas without the help of icebreakers , or even reach the north pole unhindered , no , that is not serious , " says babich .
babich feels at home in the russian arctic .
he has visited almost every corner of it during the last 40 years , and he claims there is no-one like him who has studied the area in such detail .
the recent rise in global temperature has surprised neither him nor his colleagues .
it has happened in the past , he says , and it will happen again .
" the natural processes we have seen during the past decade are mainly the result of the sun 's activity .
they show a slight increase in temperature , and as a result , arctic ice has receded , " he says .
but according to babich , the situation is changing .
the arctic , he says , is already cooling , not warming .
and the russian government is attentively listening to those scientists who , like babich , are predicting a cold spell .

but for the saami in russia 's north , the mild winters already pose a threat to their traditional way of life . all around the arctic , the effects of a temperature rise are visible , and native inhabitants of the tundras in europa , asia and north america are struggling with the new reality .
that 's also true for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula , an area bordering on norway and finnish lapland .
but , in russia , climate change is not a hot-button issue , nor is much attention being paid to the upcoming climate summit in copenhagen .
russian scientists say they have no evidence that global warming is a long-term trend , and doubt whether it is a man-made phenomenon . a little ice age ?
in the country 's northern port in the town of murmansk , the marine biological institute of the russian academy of sciences monitors life in and around the barents sea .
the institute has amassed an impressive database concerning temperature and salinity of the sea over the course of the 20th century .
referring to the statistics , biologist pavel makarevich says there are clear cycles during which both temperature and salinity rise and fall . these cycles , he says , are related to solar activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murmansk is russia 's gateway to the arctic waters " in my opinion and that of our institute , the problems connected to the current stage of warming are being exaggerated , " he says .
" what we are dealing with is not a global warming of the atmosphere or of the oceans . "
makarevich expects a normalization of arctic temperatures in the coming years .
this view appears to have the support of a growing number of russian scientists .
some even predict a temporary cooling of temperatures towards the middle of this century , a phenomenon known as a " little ice age . "
shorter winters but for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula between the barents and the white sea , a drop in temperature is urgently needed .
over the last few years , the winters have become milder and milder , threatening the traditional lifestyle of the saami .
this year again , the onset of winter was late in northern russia .
normally , the tundra would already be covered by a deep layer of snow , and the numerous lakes would have a thick layer of ice .
but snow cover is minimal and some of the lakes are not even frozen yet .
for native reindeer herders , that 's a problem , because the traditional slaughter season has to be postponed .
" the slaughter used to start in early november , " says herder nikolai filippov .
" at that time , the ice is usually strong enough to carry the reindeer .
but over the past few years , the ice has been weak and sparse , so we can not travel , and the slaughter has to be postponed until just before the new year .
this year , yields will be minimal . "
each fall , the big reindeer herds are somewhere on the vast expanses of the kola peninsula .
at the onset of winter , they have to be found and driven to lovozero , the center of the russian saami community .
but that can only happen under true winter conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indigenous saami people depend on reindeer for their living " last year it was exactly the same .
this year we do not know yet how the herds are , and what will happen later in the autumn , " filippov says .
" sometimes it is still raining around the new year , and you can not go over bare ice with the reindeer .
so then you will have to wait until after the new year .
in fact , the winter only starts in january .
for now it is a mixture of frost and thaw . "
the capricious weather has all kinds of practical consequences for the everyday life of the saami .
nikolai filippov and his wife maria live in a chum , a traditional saami tipi-like tent with a hole in the top to let out the smoke .
maria used to prepare lots of food for the winter .
but now that is out of the question , because the thaw often comes in the middle of winter and the meat can no longer be preserved .
the tundra is no longer a reliable natural refrigerator .
" in the old days it never rained in december , " says maria filippova .
" when it rains in winter , the snow disappears and we ca n't move on with our animals to search for reindeer moss . "
for thousands of years , the saami lived according to an ancient and extremely reliable calendar .
but today , says nikolai filippov , everything seems to be off course .
for him , there is no question that nature is changing .
what is happening in the tundra today is something the 59-year-old has never seen before .
the arctic as a future trading route the city of murmansk , a few hours ' drive to the north , seems a world away .
in the harbor , there 's the lenin - the first soviet nuclear-powered icebreaker built in the 1950s .
today , the heavy vessel is a museum .
andrei smirnov was the lenin 's last captain when the ship was retired in 1989 .
" no other country has boundaries like russia that stretch so far to the north , " smirnov says .
he is convinced that russia will need icebreakers like this one , now and in the future .
" we have been using the northern passage since 1932 .
it is a sea route of national significance , and since 1991 , foreign ships have also been allowed to use it .

but for the saami in russia 's north , the mild winters already pose a threat to their traditional way of life . all around the arctic , the effects of a temperature rise are visible , and native inhabitants of the tundras in europa , asia and north america are struggling with the new reality .
that 's also true for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula , an area bordering on norway and finnish lapland .
but , in russia , climate change is not a hot-button issue , nor is much attention being paid to the upcoming climate summit in copenhagen .
russian scientists say they have no evidence that global warming is a long-term trend , and doubt whether it is a man-made phenomenon . a little ice age ?
in the country 's northern port in the town of murmansk , the marine biological institute of the russian academy of sciences monitors life in and around the barents sea .
the institute has amassed an impressive database concerning temperature and salinity of the sea over the course of the 20th century .
referring to the statistics , biologist pavel makarevich says there are clear cycles during which both temperature and salinity rise and fall . these cycles , he says , are related to solar activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murmansk is russia 's gateway to the arctic waters " in my opinion and that of our institute , the problems connected to the current stage of warming are being exaggerated , " he says .
" what we are dealing with is not a global warming of the atmosphere or of the oceans . "
makarevich expects a normalization of arctic temperatures in the coming years .
this view appears to have the support of a growing number of russian scientists .
some even predict a temporary cooling of temperatures towards the middle of this century , a phenomenon known as a " little ice age . "
shorter winters but for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula between the barents and the white sea , a drop in temperature is urgently needed .
over the last few years , the winters have become milder and milder , threatening the traditional lifestyle of the saami .
this year again , the onset of winter was late in northern russia .
normally , the tundra would already be covered by a deep layer of snow , and the numerous lakes would have a thick layer of ice .
but snow cover is minimal and some of the lakes are not even frozen yet .
for native reindeer herders , that 's a problem , because the traditional slaughter season has to be postponed .
" the slaughter used to start in early november , " says herder nikolai filippov .
" at that time , the ice is usually strong enough to carry the reindeer .
but over the past few years , the ice has been weak and sparse , so we can not travel , and the slaughter has to be postponed until just before the new year .
this year , yields will be minimal . "
each fall , the big reindeer herds are somewhere on the vast expanses of the kola peninsula .
at the onset of winter , they have to be found and driven to lovozero , the center of the russian saami community .
but that can only happen under true winter conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indigenous saami people depend on reindeer for their living " last year it was exactly the same .
this year we do not know yet how the herds are , and what will happen later in the autumn , " filippov says .
" sometimes it is still raining around the new year , and you can not go over bare ice with the reindeer .
so then you will have to wait until after the new year .
in fact , the winter only starts in january .
for now it is a mixture of frost and thaw . "
the capricious weather has all kinds of practical consequences for the everyday life of the saami .
nikolai filippov and his wife maria live in a chum , a traditional saami tipi-like tent with a hole in the top to let out the smoke .
maria used to prepare lots of food for the winter .
but now that is out of the question , because the thaw often comes in the middle of winter and the meat can no longer be preserved .
the tundra is no longer a reliable natural refrigerator .
" in the old days it never rained in december , " says maria filippova .
" when it rains in winter , the snow disappears and we ca n't move on with our animals to search for reindeer moss . "
for thousands of years , the saami lived according to an ancient and extremely reliable calendar .
but today , says nikolai filippov , everything seems to be off course .
for him , there is no question that nature is changing .
what is happening in the tundra today is something the 59-year-old has never seen before .
the arctic as a future trading route the city of murmansk , a few hours ' drive to the north , seems a world away .
in the harbor , there 's the lenin - the first soviet nuclear-powered icebreaker built in the 1950s .
today , the heavy vessel is a museum .
andrei smirnov was the lenin 's last captain when the ship was retired in 1989 .
" no other country has boundaries like russia that stretch so far to the north , " smirnov says .
he is convinced that russia will need icebreakers like this one , now and in the future .
" we have been using the northern passage since 1932 .
it is a sea route of national significance , and since 1991 , foreign ships have also been allowed to use it .
this year as well , foreigners have used the passage , and we have successfully guided them through with our icebreakers . "
smirnov is referring to ships belonging to the german company beluga .
earlier this year , they made an impressive voyage from south korea to rotterdam , via the arctic seas north of russia .
bildunterschrift : this year , two ships from the german company , beluga , completed the trip around russia 's north .
the northern passage could become an alternative to existing routes the trip was meant to prove that the north pole ice is retreating as a result of global warming , and that the northern passage could become an attractive , much shorter alternative for existing routes like the one via the suez canal .
it sounds great , but longtime members of russia 's northern fleet , such as nikolai babich , can only laugh at the thought ..
" saying that one could navigate in the polar seas without the help of icebreakers , or even reach the north pole unhindered , no , that is not serious , " says babich .
babich feels at home in the russian arctic .
he has visited almost every corner of it during the last 40 years , and he claims there is no-one like him who has studied the area in such detail .
the recent rise in global temperature has surprised neither him nor his colleagues .
it has happened in the past , he says , and it will happen again .
" the natural processes we have seen during the past decade are mainly the result of the sun 's activity .
they show a slight increase in temperature , and as a result , arctic ice has receded , " he says .
but according to babich , the situation is changing .
the arctic , he says , is already cooling , not warming .
and the russian government is attentively listening to those scientists who , like babich , are predicting a cold spell .

but for the saami in russia 's north , the mild winters already pose a threat to their traditional way of life . all around the arctic , the effects of a temperature rise are visible , and native inhabitants of the tundras in europa , asia and north america are struggling with the new reality .
that 's also true for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula , an area bordering on norway and finnish lapland .
but , in russia , climate change is not a hot-button issue , nor is much attention being paid to the upcoming climate summit in copenhagen .
russian scientists say they have no evidence that global warming is a long-term trend , and doubt whether it is a man-made phenomenon . a little ice age ?
in the country 's northern port in the town of murmansk , the marine biological institute of the russian academy of sciences monitors life in and around the barents sea .
the institute has amassed an impressive database concerning temperature and salinity of the sea over the course of the 20th century .
referring to the statistics , biologist pavel makarevich says there are clear cycles during which both temperature and salinity rise and fall . these cycles , he says , are related to solar activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murmansk is russia 's gateway to the arctic waters " in my opinion and that of our institute , the problems connected to the current stage of warming are being exaggerated , " he says .
" what we are dealing with is not a global warming of the atmosphere or of the oceans . "
makarevich expects a normalization of arctic temperatures in the coming years .
this view appears to have the support of a growing number of russian scientists .
some even predict a temporary cooling of temperatures towards the middle of this century , a phenomenon known as a " little ice age . "
shorter winters but for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula between the barents and the white sea , a drop in temperature is urgently needed .
over the last few years , the winters have become milder and milder , threatening the traditional lifestyle of the saami .
this year again , the onset of winter was late in northern russia .
normally , the tundra would already be covered by a deep layer of snow , and the numerous lakes would have a thick layer of ice .
but snow cover is minimal and some of the lakes are not even frozen yet .
for native reindeer herders , that 's a problem , because the traditional slaughter season has to be postponed .
" the slaughter used to start in early november , " says herder nikolai filippov .
" at that time , the ice is usually strong enough to carry the reindeer .
but over the past few years , the ice has been weak and sparse , so we can not travel , and the slaughter has to be postponed until just before the new year .
this year , yields will be minimal . "
each fall , the big reindeer herds are somewhere on the vast expanses of the kola peninsula .
at the onset of winter , they have to be found and driven to lovozero , the center of the russian saami community .
but that can only happen under true winter conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indigenous saami people depend on reindeer for their living " last year it was exactly the same .
this year we do not know yet how the herds are , and what will happen later in the autumn , " filippov says .
" sometimes it is still raining around the new year , and you can not go over bare ice with the reindeer .
so then you will have to wait until after the new year .
in fact , the winter only starts in january .
for now it is a mixture of frost and thaw . "
the capricious weather has all kinds of practical consequences for the everyday life of the saami .
nikolai filippov and his wife maria live in a chum , a traditional saami tipi-like tent with a hole in the top to let out the smoke .
maria used to prepare lots of food for the winter .
but now that is out of the question , because the thaw often comes in the middle of winter and the meat can no longer be preserved .
the tundra is no longer a reliable natural refrigerator .
" in the old days it never rained in december , " says maria filippova .
" when it rains in winter , the snow disappears and we ca n't move on with our animals to search for reindeer moss . "
for thousands of years , the saami lived according to an ancient and extremely reliable calendar .
but today , says nikolai filippov , everything seems to be off course .
for him , there is no question that nature is changing .
what is happening in the tundra today is something the 59-year-old has never seen before .
the arctic as a future trading route the city of murmansk , a few hours ' drive to the north , seems a world away .
in the harbor , there 's the lenin - the first soviet nuclear-powered icebreaker built in the 1950s .
today , the heavy vessel is a museum .
andrei smirnov was the lenin 's last captain when the ship was retired in 1989 .
" no other country has boundaries like russia that stretch so far to the north , " smirnov says .
he is convinced that russia will need icebreakers like this one , now and in the future .
" we have been using the northern passage since 1932 .
it is a sea route of national significance , and since 1991 , foreign ships have also been allowed to use it .
this year as well , foreigners have used the passage , and we have successfully guided them through with our icebreakers . "
smirnov is referring to ships belonging to the german company beluga .
earlier this year , they made an impressive voyage from south korea to rotterdam , via the arctic seas north of russia .
bildunterschrift : this year , two ships from the german company , beluga , completed the trip around russia 's north .
the northern passage could become an alternative to existing routes the trip was meant to prove that the north pole ice is retreating as a result of global warming , and that the northern passage could become an attractive , much shorter alternative for existing routes like the one via the suez canal .
it sounds great , but longtime members of russia 's northern fleet , such as nikolai babich , can only laugh at the thought ..
" saying that one could navigate in the polar seas without the help of icebreakers , or even reach the north pole unhindered , no , that is not serious , " says babich .
babich feels at home in the russian arctic .
he has visited almost every corner of it during the last 40 years , and he claims there is no-one like him who has studied the area in such detail .
the recent rise in global temperature has surprised neither him nor his colleagues .
it has happened in the past , he says , and it will happen again .
" the natural processes we have seen during the past decade are mainly the result of the sun 's activity .
they show a slight increase in temperature , and as a result , arctic ice has receded , " he says .
but according to babich , the situation is changing .
the arctic , he says , is already cooling , not warming .
and the russian government is attentively listening to those scientists who , like babich , are predicting a cold spell .

but for the saami in russia 's north , the mild winters already pose a threat to their traditional way of life . all around the arctic , the effects of a temperature rise are visible , and native inhabitants of the tundras in europa , asia and north america are struggling with the new reality .
that 's also true for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula , an area bordering on norway and finnish lapland .
but , in russia , climate change is not a hot-button issue , nor is much attention being paid to the upcoming climate summit in copenhagen .
russian scientists say they have no evidence that global warming is a long-term trend , and doubt whether it is a man-made phenomenon . a little ice age ?
in the country 's northern port in the town of murmansk , the marine biological institute of the russian academy of sciences monitors life in and around the barents sea .
the institute has amassed an impressive database concerning temperature and salinity of the sea over the course of the 20th century .
referring to the statistics , biologist pavel makarevich says there are clear cycles during which both temperature and salinity rise and fall . these cycles , he says , are related to solar activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murmansk is russia 's gateway to the arctic waters " in my opinion and that of our institute , the problems connected to the current stage of warming are being exaggerated , " he says .
" what we are dealing with is not a global warming of the atmosphere or of the oceans . "
makarevich expects a normalization of arctic temperatures in the coming years .
this view appears to have the support of a growing number of russian scientists .
some even predict a temporary cooling of temperatures towards the middle of this century , a phenomenon known as a " little ice age . "
shorter winters but for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula between the barents and the white sea , a drop in temperature is urgently needed .
over the last few years , the winters have become milder and milder , threatening the traditional lifestyle of the saami .
this year again , the onset of winter was late in northern russia .
normally , the tundra would already be covered by a deep layer of snow , and the numerous lakes would have a thick layer of ice .
but snow cover is minimal and some of the lakes are not even frozen yet .
for native reindeer herders , that 's a problem , because the traditional slaughter season has to be postponed .
" the slaughter used to start in early november , " says herder nikolai filippov .
" at that time , the ice is usually strong enough to carry the reindeer .
but over the past few years , the ice has been weak and sparse , so we can not travel , and the slaughter has to be postponed until just before the new year .
this year , yields will be minimal . "
each fall , the big reindeer herds are somewhere on the vast expanses of the kola peninsula .
at the onset of winter , they have to be found and driven to lovozero , the center of the russian saami community .
but that can only happen under true winter conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indigenous saami people depend on reindeer for their living " last year it was exactly the same .
this year we do not know yet how the herds are , and what will happen later in the autumn , " filippov says .
" sometimes it is still raining around the new year , and you can not go over bare ice with the reindeer .
so then you will have to wait until after the new year .
in fact , the winter only starts in january .
for now it is a mixture of frost and thaw . "
the capricious weather has all kinds of practical consequences for the everyday life of the saami .
nikolai filippov and his wife maria live in a chum , a traditional saami tipi-like tent with a hole in the top to let out the smoke .
maria used to prepare lots of food for the winter .
but now that is out of the question , because the thaw often comes in the middle of winter and the meat can no longer be preserved .
the tundra is no longer a reliable natural refrigerator .
" in the old days it never rained in december , " says maria filippova .
" when it rains in winter , the snow disappears and we ca n't move on with our animals to search for reindeer moss . "
for thousands of years , the saami lived according to an ancient and extremely reliable calendar .
but today , says nikolai filippov , everything seems to be off course .
for him , there is no question that nature is changing .
what is happening in the tundra today is something the 59-year-old has never seen before .
the arctic as a future trading route the city of murmansk , a few hours ' drive to the north , seems a world away .
in the harbor , there 's the lenin - the first soviet nuclear-powered icebreaker built in the 1950s .
today , the heavy vessel is a museum .
andrei smirnov was the lenin 's last captain when the ship was retired in 1989 .
" no other country has boundaries like russia that stretch so far to the north , " smirnov says .
he is convinced that russia will need icebreakers like this one , now and in the future .
" we have been using the northern passage since 1932 .
it is a sea route of national significance , and since 1991 , foreign ships have also been allowed to use it .
this year as well , foreigners have used the passage , and we have successfully guided them through with our icebreakers . "
smirnov is referring to ships belonging to the german company beluga .
earlier this year , they made an impressive voyage from south korea to rotterdam , via the arctic seas north of russia .
bildunterschrift : this year , two ships from the german company , beluga , completed the trip around russia 's north .
the northern passage could become an alternative to existing routes the trip was meant to prove that the north pole ice is retreating as a result of global warming , and that the northern passage could become an attractive , much shorter alternative for existing routes like the one via the suez canal .
it sounds great , but longtime members of russia 's northern fleet , such as nikolai babich , can only laugh at the thought ..
" saying that one could navigate in the polar seas without the help of icebreakers , or even reach the north pole unhindered , no , that is not serious , " says babich .
babich feels at home in the russian arctic .
he has visited almost every corner of it during the last 40 years , and he claims there is no-one like him who has studied the area in such detail .
the recent rise in global temperature has surprised neither him nor his colleagues .
it has happened in the past , he says , and it will happen again .
" the natural processes we have seen during the past decade are mainly the result of the sun 's activity .
they show a slight increase in temperature , and as a result , arctic ice has receded , " he says .
but according to babich , the situation is changing .
the arctic , he says , is already cooling , not warming .
and the russian government is attentively listening to those scientists who , like babich , are predicting a cold spell .

kristina koehler is a fresh face in german cabinet , and not just because she 's getting her first portfolio .
at 32 , she 's germany 's youngest cabinet minister and probably the only one who can use facebook without an aide . kristina koehler , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , was chosen as family minister on friday as part of a cabinet reshuffle .
koehler 's nomination is also no doubt aimed at improving the christian democrat 's profile among younger voters .
true to her generation , she can be found on the social networking site facebook and also posts on twitter .
tweeting on sunday , she said she was surprised by the focus on whether she would continue to use the internet application .
" i 'm not going to give up letter writing , either , " she wrote .
in her first interview since taking office , koehler told the bild am sonntag newspaper via email that she was n't about to abandon applications like twitter and facebook just because she had been promoted to cabinet .
she said although it was " absurd " to consider all of her 600 facebook contacts as friends , she found the site useful for spreading her political message .
career move until now , koehler , a member of the bundestag 's internal affairs committee , was mostly known for speaking out on topics such as extremism and the integration of foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen , koehler 's predecessor she takes over the family ministry from ursula von der leyen , who is moving into the labor ministry .
koehler is expected to continue her predecessor 's policies that aim to make child-rearing less expensive in germany .
but in other respects , koehler could n't be more different from von der leyen , a 51-year-old working mother of seven .
koehler joined the youth wing of the christian democrats at the age of 14 , already clear in her mind that she was destined for a career in politics .
now she is one of three relatively young ministers alongside fellow christian democrat defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , 38 , and health minister philipp roessler , 36 , from the pro-business free democrats. nw / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but if europe is not to lose ground , the opinion of experts in europe and china is that the eu should at least try and match us offers of cooperation and trump them with actual concrete action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china wants the eu to get its act together as a partner " during a high level meeting in beijing last week , we got a very clear signal from the chinese leadership , " holslag told deutsche welle .
" premier wen jiabao and state counselor dai bingguo explained that china attaches a lot of importance to cooperation with europe and that it should not worry about a g2 .
but for the chinese , the ball is in our court now .
they want us to prove that we can get our act together and come up with a pragmatic agenda for cooperation .
if the eu can add no value to china 's essentially commercial relations with individual member states , there will not be a strategic partnership . " paul lim , a senior academic adviser at the european institute for asian studies in brussels , said that china would pick up on any concern within europe in relation to its position as a partner and could possibly play the eu and us off against each other .
but he also said china needs both powers for very different reasons . " the us , with its history of relations with asia , its presence in asia makes it a more important partner than the eu , " lim told deutsche welle .
" the eu with its soft power which it can use to great influence is still young , and is new in the game .
it all boils down to how much of a common voice the eu projects .
china will want an ally on certain issues with the eu in relation to the us and the eu will want an ally in the us on certain issues with china .
i do not see the eu losing any influence with china and i 'm sure that the us and eu will not allow china to play them against each other . "
obama 's pragmatism could bode ill for eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has opened the path to greater dialogue with beijing president obama 's visit was the first example of the current administration 's desire to engage with china and the importance it attached to china and the wider asian region as a key strategic partner .
while there were few breakthroughs to make the europeans nervous , obama came away from beijing with the paths to dialog firmly open and as such , moved the us into a position which could undermine europe 's influence in future . " chinese aid is much needed to keep the american economy afloat and to stabilize afghanistan , " holslag said .
" this has cautioned obama during his visit .
if the united states continues to opt for more pragmatism , this would certainly weaken europe 's bargaining position when it comes to human rights , economic liberalization and other challenges . "
to lag behind in relations and cooperation with the chinese could be damaging to the eu .
china 's new global influence through investment in africa and elsewhere , its growing economic muscle and its position as a major player in global issues such as iran and north korea , as well as climate change , makes the people 's republic a partner to neglect at peril . lack of action damaging eu reputation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen jinbao wants to see more action from barrosso 's eu what could prove damaging is china 's concern that the eu can talk a good partnership but is showing a lack of commitment when it comes to putting these words into practice in areas where eu-sino relations have been traditionally strong . " while trade has always been the main driver of sino-european cooperation , this has now become one of the main sources of friction , " holslag said .
" it is clear that europe 's failure to innovate its industries is leading to more sensitivity of competition from countries like china . " on the international scene we both have a joint interest in stabilizing africa , securing central asia and promoting multilateral cooperation , " he added .
" but joint interests do not automatically lead to cooperation .
growing assertiveness makes beijing more eager to promote its own values , while the eu is not proving itself as a strong player . " calls for reform turning opinion against europe where the eu continues to hold a strong hand is in its dedication to democracy and human rights .
the european union has long been a strong advocate of reform in china and has never missed an opportunity to make its feelings known .
in most cases china has responded respectfully but has given few concrete indicators that eu pressure alone is enough to force through radical change .
as a result , europe continues to press beijing in the hope that persistence will win out in the end . in fact , the eu 's regular advocating of democratic and social reform in china is beginning to turn opinion within the people 's republic , leading some within the chinese government to suggest that europe should put its own house in order fist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's constant calls for reform start to annoy china " traditionally the chinese are concerned about ' saving their face ' , " holslag said .
" but let us not forget that the pro-europe camp in beijing is losing ground .
leaders like premier wen have come under quite a lot of pressure from political hardliners and the public opinion .
china has become less tolerant of european lecturing .
as a result , we might even expect more chinese criticism on the eu 's weak performance in the combat against climate change , its deplorable economic situation or its lack of political coherence . " despite the uncertain climate between europe and china , paul lim believes that the current level of financial commitment and strategic cooperation between the two powers is enough to look towards the future with guarded optimism . " the future of eu-china cooperation depends on maturity of relations , of respect , of being able to accept criticisms , and an understanding of each other 's culture . " said lim .
" however , right now , there has to be a certain degree of closeness , of trust and confidence for the eu to put its money into china .
the two powers are also coming closer on climate change as its effects are felt in china and we can not deny that china is doing something about it even if we think it is not enough .
but the big question is how mature the relationship is .

but if europe is not to lose ground , the opinion of experts in europe and china is that the eu should at least try and match us offers of cooperation and trump them with actual concrete action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china wants the eu to get its act together as a partner " during a high level meeting in beijing last week , we got a very clear signal from the chinese leadership , " holslag told deutsche welle .
" premier wen jiabao and state counselor dai bingguo explained that china attaches a lot of importance to cooperation with europe and that it should not worry about a g2 .
but for the chinese , the ball is in our court now .
they want us to prove that we can get our act together and come up with a pragmatic agenda for cooperation .
if the eu can add no value to china 's essentially commercial relations with individual member states , there will not be a strategic partnership . " paul lim , a senior academic adviser at the european institute for asian studies in brussels , said that china would pick up on any concern within europe in relation to its position as a partner and could possibly play the eu and us off against each other .
but he also said china needs both powers for very different reasons . " the us , with its history of relations with asia , its presence in asia makes it a more important partner than the eu , " lim told deutsche welle .
" the eu with its soft power which it can use to great influence is still young , and is new in the game .
it all boils down to how much of a common voice the eu projects .
china will want an ally on certain issues with the eu in relation to the us and the eu will want an ally in the us on certain issues with china .
i do not see the eu losing any influence with china and i 'm sure that the us and eu will not allow china to play them against each other . "
obama 's pragmatism could bode ill for eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has opened the path to greater dialogue with beijing president obama 's visit was the first example of the current administration 's desire to engage with china and the importance it attached to china and the wider asian region as a key strategic partner .
while there were few breakthroughs to make the europeans nervous , obama came away from beijing with the paths to dialog firmly open and as such , moved the us into a position which could undermine europe 's influence in future . " chinese aid is much needed to keep the american economy afloat and to stabilize afghanistan , " holslag said .
" this has cautioned obama during his visit .
if the united states continues to opt for more pragmatism , this would certainly weaken europe 's bargaining position when it comes to human rights , economic liberalization and other challenges . "
to lag behind in relations and cooperation with the chinese could be damaging to the eu .
china 's new global influence through investment in africa and elsewhere , its growing economic muscle and its position as a major player in global issues such as iran and north korea , as well as climate change , makes the people 's republic a partner to neglect at peril . lack of action damaging eu reputation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen jinbao wants to see more action from barrosso 's eu what could prove damaging is china 's concern that the eu can talk a good partnership but is showing a lack of commitment when it comes to putting these words into practice in areas where eu-sino relations have been traditionally strong . " while trade has always been the main driver of sino-european cooperation , this has now become one of the main sources of friction , " holslag said .
" it is clear that europe 's failure to innovate its industries is leading to more sensitivity of competition from countries like china . " on the international scene we both have a joint interest in stabilizing africa , securing central asia and promoting multilateral cooperation , " he added .
" but joint interests do not automatically lead to cooperation .
growing assertiveness makes beijing more eager to promote its own values , while the eu is not proving itself as a strong player . " calls for reform turning opinion against europe where the eu continues to hold a strong hand is in its dedication to democracy and human rights .
the european union has long been a strong advocate of reform in china and has never missed an opportunity to make its feelings known .
in most cases china has responded respectfully but has given few concrete indicators that eu pressure alone is enough to force through radical change .
as a result , europe continues to press beijing in the hope that persistence will win out in the end . in fact , the eu 's regular advocating of democratic and social reform in china is beginning to turn opinion within the people 's republic , leading some within the chinese government to suggest that europe should put its own house in order fist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's constant calls for reform start to annoy china " traditionally the chinese are concerned about ' saving their face ' , " holslag said .
" but let us not forget that the pro-europe camp in beijing is losing ground .
leaders like premier wen have come under quite a lot of pressure from political hardliners and the public opinion .
china has become less tolerant of european lecturing .
as a result , we might even expect more chinese criticism on the eu 's weak performance in the combat against climate change , its deplorable economic situation or its lack of political coherence . " despite the uncertain climate between europe and china , paul lim believes that the current level of financial commitment and strategic cooperation between the two powers is enough to look towards the future with guarded optimism . " the future of eu-china cooperation depends on maturity of relations , of respect , of being able to accept criticisms , and an understanding of each other 's culture . " said lim .

the surprise result is certain to embarrass the government and dismay the country 's muslim minority . the swiss news agency ats and other media outlets report that a clear majority , 57.5 percent of voters and all but four of switzerland 's 26 cantons approved the proposal in this nationwide referendum .
of eligible voters , 53 percent turned out to vote . the government has said it will respect the decision of the people and would no longer permit the construction of new minarets in switzerland , but tried to assure the muslim minority that the ban was " not a rejection of the muslim community , religion or culture . " " muslims in switzerland are able to practice their religion alone or in community with others and live according to their beliefs just as before , " it said in a statement . the right-wing swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- , switzerland 's biggest party , was the driving force behind the referendum , along with the conservative federal democratic union .
they succeeded in gathering 100,000 signatures within 18 months , which is needed to call a referendum under swiss law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban supporters say that minarets - like this one in geneva - represent claims to power the svp said switzerland 's four existing minarets are not mere architectural features on religious buildings but represent a " political-religious claim to power , which challenges fundamental rights . " " we 're enormously happy , " said walter wobmann , president of the initiative committee .
" it is a victory for this people , this switzerland , this freedom and those who want a democratic society . " earlier , he had told reuters that the goal was to stop " further islamization in switzerland . " " people may practice their religion , that is no problem , " he said . muslim dismay some 400,000 muslims live in switzerland , making them the nation 's second largest religious group . " the most painful for us is not the minaret ban , but the symbol sent by this vote , " said farhad afshar , head of the coordination of islamic organizations in switzerland .
" muslims do not feel accepted as a religious community . " nadia karmous , president of the cultural association of muslim women in switzerland , told le temps newspaper : " i feel sad for switzerland .
imagine the impact abroad .
the image of the -lrb- country -rrb- is already that of a racist country . " the conference of swiss bishops also criticized the result , saying that it " heightens the problems of cohabitation between religions and cultures . " direct democracy the referendum was held using switzerland 's system of " direct democracy , " which allows individuals and groups to propose laws which are then put to a public ballot , bypassing parliament . bildunterschrift : the svp 's referendum poster has been criticized as " sinister " and " racist " the collective executive branch of the government - the swiss federal council - criticized the vote , saying it could damage switzerland 's image in the arab world , and make the country appear intolerant of religious diversity . the government had encouraged swiss people to vote against the ban . " muslims should be able to practice their religion and have access to minarets in switzerland , too , " president hans-rudolf merz said in a last-minute video broadcast to the nation .
" but the call of the muezzin will not sound here . " foreign minister micheline calmy-rey said she was " shocked " and " deeply regretted " the outcome , which she said had to be seen in the context of globalization and the economic crisis . " fears and anxieties were played on , " she told reporters . rb / msh / afp / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" an active investigative and operational effort is underway to identify and find the individuals involved in the crime , " vladimir markin , a spokesman for the investigators , told russian state television on sunday , november 29 .
the 14-carriage passenger train carrying nearly 700 people was jolted off the rails on the main line between moscow and russia 's second largest city , st. petersburg in what the authorities suspect was a bomb attack .
according to russia 's emergency situations ministry , the attack killed 25 and injured 104 , while 26 people remain missing .
markin said forensic experts had returned sunday morning to the scene of the explosion - a wooded area about 400 kilometers -lrb- 250 miles -rrb- northwest of the capital moscow - to continue their search for clues .
the question of responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extremists from conflict zones have been blamed for a string of attacks on civilian targets it remains unclear what motivated the attackers to strike the train , which is popular with well-off russians and foreign tourists .
a police spokesman expressed doubts about a message posted on the internet by a radical right-wing group claiming responsibility .
the chief of russia 's fsb security service had said earlier that the blast which derailed the train was caused by an improvised explosive device with the force of seven kilograms -lrb- 15 lbs . -rrb- of tnt .
interior minister rashid nurgaliyev had said police had evidence suggesting that several persons took part in the attack , and even gave a description of one of the suspects .
a second explosion occurred during rescue operations on saturday , but no one was injured .
grim task of identifying bodies meanwhile , the process of formally identifying bodies began on sunday in tver , a city between moscow and st. petersburg , and the regional capital of the area in which the train was attacked .
interfax news agency quoted a spokeswoman for the regional government as saying that 65 relatives of the train disaster victims were in tver to examine the corpses at a local morgue .
a government commission specially formed by prime minister vladimir putin to deal with the aftermath of the disaster was expected to meet later on sunday .
russian railways , the state company that oversees the country 's railroads , said in a statement that the movement of trains between moscow and st. petersburg had been " fully restored " as of sunday morning .
bildunterschrift : this is no the first bombing attack that has happened in russia past attacks against civilian targets the nevsky express was hit by a similar bomb attack in august 2007 , when 60 people were injured in an incident that continues to remain cloaked in mystery although it has been inconclusively linked to chechen separatists and russian ultranationalists .
forty-six people were killed and 160 injured as an explosion tore through a morning commuter train in russia 's southern fringe in december 2003 and , just months later , in february 2004 , a suicide bombing claimed 39 lives on an underground train in moscow .

the 14-carriage passenger train carrying nearly 700 people was jolted off the rails on the main line between moscow and russia 's second largest city , st. petersburg in what the authorities suspect was a bomb attack .

he was appointed to the post by former un secretary-general kofi annan in 2006 .
one of his department 's tasks is to provide support to the compliance regime of the kyoto protocol , the landmark pact for tackling greenhouse-gas emissions .
the un climate conference in copenhagen from december 7 - 18 will focus on an agreement to take effect after kyoto expires in 2012 .
deutsche welle : for a long time the un climate summit has been viewed as an all-or-nothing event .
is that what it still is ? de boer : i think so .
i think it is an all-or-nothing event in the sense that we need to see a number of things come together .
we need rich country emission reduction targets , individual targets for rich countries , secondly we need to know what china , india , brazil , major development countries , will do to lower the growth in emissions , thirdly we need prompt start financing to help developing countries engage .
fourthly we need a set of decisions that will make immediate action operational .
that all sounds very concrete .
in the press in the run-up to the conference there are all sorts of terms like outlines , pledges , frameworks , meaningful bids .
that does n't sound like what you are talking about .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvo de boer no , it does n't , but if i listen to what the danish prime minister is saying , he is the one who will be inviting heads of state and governments for the closing .
then if i listen to what connie hedegaard , the minister who will chair the conference , is saying and if i listen to myself , then at least the three of us are saying exactly the same thing .
the chinese appear to have seen the light regarding the need to de-carbonize their economy as much as possible so as not to despoil their environment .
but both the chinese and the indians have been arguing in recent years that they should have room for carbon-based industrial growth so they can provide their huge populations better living standards .
is there room for that any more ?
there has to be room for that .
china is changing its approach not only because of love of the environment and the fear of climate change , but also because i believe you can not continue to grow the chinese economy at the current pace in the current way .
there has to be a fundamental change .
and yes , to have to leave space for developing countries to grow .
in india , there are 400 million people that do n't even have access to electricity .
the goal of copenhagen should not be to keep people living under those circumstances .
so we will see growth in emissions in some countries .

of eligible voters , 53 percent turned out to vote . the government has said it will respect the decision of the people and would no longer permit the construction of new minarets in switzerland , but tried to assure the muslim minority that the ban was " not a rejection of the muslim community , religion or culture . " " muslims in switzerland are able to practice their religion alone or in community with others and live according to their beliefs just as before , " it said in a statement . the right-wing swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- , switzerland 's biggest party , was the driving force behind the referendum , along with the conservative federal democratic union .

imagine the impact abroad .

" the conference of swiss bishops also criticized the result , saying that it " heightens the problems of cohabitation between religions and cultures . " direct democracy the referendum was held using switzerland 's system of " direct democracy , " which allows individuals and groups to propose laws which are then put to a public ballot , bypassing parliament . bildunterschrift : the svp 's referendum poster has been criticized as " sinister " and " racist " the collective executive branch of the government - the swiss federal council - criticized the vote , saying it could damage switzerland 's image in the arab world , and make the country appear intolerant of religious diversity . the government had encouraged swiss people to vote against the ban . " muslims should be able to practice their religion and have access to minarets in switzerland , too , " president hans-rudolf merz said in a last-minute video broadcast to the nation .
" but the call of the muezzin will not sound here . " foreign minister micheline calmy-rey said she was " shocked " and " deeply regretted " the outcome , which she said had to be seen in the context of globalization and the economic crisis .

kristina koehler is a fresh face in german cabinet , and not just because she 's getting her first portfolio .
at 32 , she 's germany 's youngest cabinet minister and probably the only one who can use facebook without an aide . kristina koehler , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , was chosen as family minister on friday as part of a cabinet reshuffle .
koehler 's nomination is also no doubt aimed at improving the christian democrat 's profile among younger voters .
true to her generation , she can be found on the social networking site facebook and also posts on twitter .
tweeting on sunday , she said she was surprised by the focus on whether she would continue to use the internet application .
" i 'm not going to give up letter writing , either , " she wrote .
in her first interview since taking office , koehler told the bild am sonntag newspaper via email that she was n't about to abandon applications like twitter and facebook just because she had been promoted to cabinet .
she said although it was " absurd " to consider all of her 600 facebook contacts as friends , she found the site useful for spreading her political message .

but if europe is not to lose ground , the opinion of experts in europe and china is that the eu should at least try and match us offers of cooperation and trump them with actual concrete action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china wants the eu to get its act together as a partner " during a high level meeting in beijing last week , we got a very clear signal from the chinese leadership , " holslag told deutsche welle .
" premier wen jiabao and state counselor dai bingguo explained that china attaches a lot of importance to cooperation with europe and that it should not worry about a g2 .
but for the chinese , the ball is in our court now .
they want us to prove that we can get our act together and come up with a pragmatic agenda for cooperation .
if the eu can add no value to china 's essentially commercial relations with individual member states , there will not be a strategic partnership . " paul lim , a senior academic adviser at the european institute for asian studies in brussels , said that china would pick up on any concern within europe in relation to its position as a partner and could possibly play the eu and us off against each other .
but he also said china needs both powers for very different reasons . " the us , with its history of relations with asia , its presence in asia makes it a more important partner than the eu , " lim told deutsche welle .
" the eu with its soft power which it can use to great influence is still young , and is new in the game .
it all boils down to how much of a common voice the eu projects .
china will want an ally on certain issues with the eu in relation to the us and the eu will want an ally in the us on certain issues with china .
i do not see the eu losing any influence with china and i 'm sure that the us and eu will not allow china to play them against each other . "
obama 's pragmatism could bode ill for eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has opened the path to greater dialogue with beijing president obama 's visit was the first example of the current administration 's desire to engage with china and the importance it attached to china and the wider asian region as a key strategic partner .
while there were few breakthroughs to make the europeans nervous , obama came away from beijing with the paths to dialog firmly open and as such , moved the us into a position which could undermine europe 's influence in future . " chinese aid is much needed to keep the american economy afloat and to stabilize afghanistan , " holslag said .
" this has cautioned obama during his visit .
if the united states continues to opt for more pragmatism , this would certainly weaken europe 's bargaining position when it comes to human rights , economic liberalization and other challenges . "
to lag behind in relations and cooperation with the chinese could be damaging to the eu .
china 's new global influence through investment in africa and elsewhere , its growing economic muscle and its position as a major player in global issues such as iran and north korea , as well as climate change , makes the people 's republic a partner to neglect at peril . lack of action damaging eu reputation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen jinbao wants to see more action from barrosso 's eu what could prove damaging is china 's concern that the eu can talk a good partnership but is showing a lack of commitment when it comes to putting these words into practice in areas where eu-sino relations have been traditionally strong . " while trade has always been the main driver of sino-european cooperation , this has now become one of the main sources of friction , " holslag said .
" it is clear that europe 's failure to innovate its industries is leading to more sensitivity of competition from countries like china . " on the international scene we both have a joint interest in stabilizing africa , securing central asia and promoting multilateral cooperation , " he added .
" but joint interests do not automatically lead to cooperation .
growing assertiveness makes beijing more eager to promote its own values , while the eu is not proving itself as a strong player . " calls for reform turning opinion against europe where the eu continues to hold a strong hand is in its dedication to democracy and human rights .
the european union has long been a strong advocate of reform in china and has never missed an opportunity to make its feelings known .
in most cases china has responded respectfully but has given few concrete indicators that eu pressure alone is enough to force through radical change .
as a result , europe continues to press beijing in the hope that persistence will win out in the end . in fact , the eu 's regular advocating of democratic and social reform in china is beginning to turn opinion within the people 's republic , leading some within the chinese government to suggest that europe should put its own house in order fist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's constant calls for reform start to annoy china " traditionally the chinese are concerned about ' saving their face ' , " holslag said .
" but let us not forget that the pro-europe camp in beijing is losing ground .
leaders like premier wen have come under quite a lot of pressure from political hardliners and the public opinion .
china has become less tolerant of european lecturing .
as a result , we might even expect more chinese criticism on the eu 's weak performance in the combat against climate change , its deplorable economic situation or its lack of political coherence . " despite the uncertain climate between europe and china , paul lim believes that the current level of financial commitment and strategic cooperation between the two powers is enough to look towards the future with guarded optimism . " the future of eu-china cooperation depends on maturity of relations , of respect , of being able to accept criticisms , and an understanding of each other 's culture . " said lim .
" however , right now , there has to be a certain degree of closeness , of trust and confidence for the eu to put its money into china .
the two powers are also coming closer on climate change as its effects are felt in china and we can not deny that china is doing something about it even if we think it is not enough .
but the big question is how mature the relationship is .
this is another matter . " author : nick amies editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle : for a long time the un climate summit has been viewed as an all-or-nothing event .
is that what it still is ? de boer : i think so .
i think it is an all-or-nothing event in the sense that we need to see a number of things come together .
we need rich country emission reduction targets , individual targets for rich countries , secondly we need to know what china , india , brazil , major development countries , will do to lower the growth in emissions , thirdly we need prompt start financing to help developing countries engage .
fourthly we need a set of decisions that will make immediate action operational .
that all sounds very concrete .

the chinese appear to have seen the light regarding the need to de-carbonize their economy as much as possible so as not to despoil their environment .

there has to be room for that .
china is changing its approach not only because of love of the environment and the fear of climate change , but also because i believe you can not continue to grow the chinese economy at the current pace in the current way .
there has to be a fundamental change .

the surprise result is certain to embarrass the government and dismay the country 's muslim minority . the swiss news agency ats and other media outlets report that a clear majority , 57.5 percent of voters and all but four of switzerland 's 26 cantons approved the proposal in this nationwide referendum .
of eligible voters , 53 percent turned out to vote . the government has said it will respect the decision of the people and would no longer permit the construction of new minarets in switzerland , but tried to assure the muslim minority that the ban was " not a rejection of the muslim community , religion or culture . " " muslims in switzerland are able to practice their religion alone or in community with others and live according to their beliefs just as before , " it said in a statement . the right-wing swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- , switzerland 's biggest party , was the driving force behind the referendum , along with the conservative federal democratic union .
they succeeded in gathering 100,000 signatures within 18 months , which is needed to call a referendum under swiss law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban supporters say that minarets - like this one in geneva - represent claims to power the svp said switzerland 's four existing minarets are not mere architectural features on religious buildings but represent a " political-religious claim to power , which challenges fundamental rights . " " we 're enormously happy , " said walter wobmann , president of the initiative committee .
" it is a victory for this people , this switzerland , this freedom and those who want a democratic society . " earlier , he had told reuters that the goal was to stop " further islamization in switzerland . " " people may practice their religion , that is no problem , " he said . muslim dismay some 400,000 muslims live in switzerland , making them the nation 's second largest religious group . " the most painful for us is not the minaret ban , but the symbol sent by this vote , " said farhad afshar , head of the coordination of islamic organizations in switzerland .
" muslims do not feel accepted as a religious community . " nadia karmous , president of the cultural association of muslim women in switzerland , told le temps newspaper : " i feel sad for switzerland .
imagine the impact abroad .
the image of the -lrb- country -rrb- is already that of a racist country . " the conference of swiss bishops also criticized the result , saying that it " heightens the problems of cohabitation between religions and cultures . " direct democracy the referendum was held using switzerland 's system of " direct democracy , " which allows individuals and groups to propose laws which are then put to a public ballot , bypassing parliament . bildunterschrift : the svp 's referendum poster has been criticized as " sinister " and " racist " the collective executive branch of the government - the swiss federal council - criticized the vote , saying it could damage switzerland 's image in the arab world , and make the country appear intolerant of religious diversity . the government had encouraged swiss people to vote against the ban . " muslims should be able to practice their religion and have access to minarets in switzerland , too , " president hans-rudolf merz said in a last-minute video broadcast to the nation .
" but the call of the muezzin will not sound here . " foreign minister micheline calmy-rey said she was " shocked " and " deeply regretted " the outcome , which she said had to be seen in the context of globalization and the economic crisis . " fears and anxieties were played on , " she told reporters . rb / msh / afp / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 29.11.2009 in russian arctic , global warming threatens traditional way of life großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 'll soon get colder again , some russian scientists say russian scientists have doubts over whether global warming is here to stay and whether it 's man made .
but for the saami in russia 's north , the mild winters already pose a threat to their traditional way of life . all around the arctic , the effects of a temperature rise are visible , and native inhabitants of the tundras in europa , asia and north america are struggling with the new reality .
that 's also true for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula , an area bordering on norway and finnish lapland .
but , in russia , climate change is not a hot-button issue , nor is much attention being paid to the upcoming climate summit in copenhagen .
russian scientists say they have no evidence that global warming is a long-term trend , and doubt whether it is a man-made phenomenon . a little ice age ?
in the country 's northern port in the town of murmansk , the marine biological institute of the russian academy of sciences monitors life in and around the barents sea .
the institute has amassed an impressive database concerning temperature and salinity of the sea over the course of the 20th century .
referring to the statistics , biologist pavel makarevich says there are clear cycles during which both temperature and salinity rise and fall . these cycles , he says , are related to solar activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murmansk is russia 's gateway to the arctic waters " in my opinion and that of our institute , the problems connected to the current stage of warming are being exaggerated , " he says .
" what we are dealing with is not a global warming of the atmosphere or of the oceans . "
makarevich expects a normalization of arctic temperatures in the coming years .
this view appears to have the support of a growing number of russian scientists .
some even predict a temporary cooling of temperatures towards the middle of this century , a phenomenon known as a " little ice age . "
shorter winters but for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula between the barents and the white sea , a drop in temperature is urgently needed .
over the last few years , the winters have become milder and milder , threatening the traditional lifestyle of the saami .
this year again , the onset of winter was late in northern russia .
normally , the tundra would already be covered by a deep layer of snow , and the numerous lakes would have a thick layer of ice .
but snow cover is minimal and some of the lakes are not even frozen yet .
for native reindeer herders , that 's a problem , because the traditional slaughter season has to be postponed .
" the slaughter used to start in early november , " says herder nikolai filippov .
" at that time , the ice is usually strong enough to carry the reindeer .
but over the past few years , the ice has been weak and sparse , so we can not travel , and the slaughter has to be postponed until just before the new year .
this year , yields will be minimal . "
each fall , the big reindeer herds are somewhere on the vast expanses of the kola peninsula .
at the onset of winter , they have to be found and driven to lovozero , the center of the russian saami community .
but that can only happen under true winter conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indigenous saami people depend on reindeer for their living " last year it was exactly the same .
this year we do not know yet how the herds are , and what will happen later in the autumn , " filippov says .
" sometimes it is still raining around the new year , and you can not go over bare ice with the reindeer .
so then you will have to wait until after the new year .
in fact , the winter only starts in january .
for now it is a mixture of frost and thaw . "
the capricious weather has all kinds of practical consequences for the everyday life of the saami .
nikolai filippov and his wife maria live in a chum , a traditional saami tipi-like tent with a hole in the top to let out the smoke .
maria used to prepare lots of food for the winter .
but now that is out of the question , because the thaw often comes in the middle of winter and the meat can no longer be preserved .
the tundra is no longer a reliable natural refrigerator .
" in the old days it never rained in december , " says maria filippova .
" when it rains in winter , the snow disappears and we ca n't move on with our animals to search for reindeer moss . "
for thousands of years , the saami lived according to an ancient and extremely reliable calendar .
but today , says nikolai filippov , everything seems to be off course .
for him , there is no question that nature is changing .
what is happening in the tundra today is something the 59-year-old has never seen before .
the arctic as a future trading route the city of murmansk , a few hours ' drive to the north , seems a world away .
in the harbor , there 's the lenin - the first soviet nuclear-powered icebreaker built in the 1950s .
today , the heavy vessel is a museum .
andrei smirnov was the lenin 's last captain when the ship was retired in 1989 .
" no other country has boundaries like russia that stretch so far to the north , " smirnov says .
he is convinced that russia will need icebreakers like this one , now and in the future .
" we have been using the northern passage since 1932 .
it is a sea route of national significance , and since 1991 , foreign ships have also been allowed to use it .
this year as well , foreigners have used the passage , and we have successfully guided them through with our icebreakers . "
smirnov is referring to ships belonging to the german company beluga .
earlier this year , they made an impressive voyage from south korea to rotterdam , via the arctic seas north of russia .
bildunterschrift : this year , two ships from the german company , beluga , completed the trip around russia 's north .
the northern passage could become an alternative to existing routes the trip was meant to prove that the north pole ice is retreating as a result of global warming , and that the northern passage could become an attractive , much shorter alternative for existing routes like the one via the suez canal .
it sounds great , but longtime members of russia 's northern fleet , such as nikolai babich , can only laugh at the thought ..
" saying that one could navigate in the polar seas without the help of icebreakers , or even reach the north pole unhindered , no , that is not serious , " says babich .
babich feels at home in the russian arctic .
he has visited almost every corner of it during the last 40 years , and he claims there is no-one like him who has studied the area in such detail .
the recent rise in global temperature has surprised neither him nor his colleagues .
it has happened in the past , he says , and it will happen again .
" the natural processes we have seen during the past decade are mainly the result of the sun 's activity .
they show a slight increase in temperature , and as a result , arctic ice has receded , " he says .
but according to babich , the situation is changing .
the arctic , he says , is already cooling , not warming .
and the russian government is attentively listening to those scientists who , like babich , are predicting a cold spell .

but for the saami in russia 's north , the mild winters already pose a threat to their traditional way of life . all around the arctic , the effects of a temperature rise are visible , and native inhabitants of the tundras in europa , asia and north america are struggling with the new reality .
that 's also true for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula , an area bordering on norway and finnish lapland .
but , in russia , climate change is not a hot-button issue , nor is much attention being paid to the upcoming climate summit in copenhagen .
russian scientists say they have no evidence that global warming is a long-term trend , and doubt whether it is a man-made phenomenon . a little ice age ?
in the country 's northern port in the town of murmansk , the marine biological institute of the russian academy of sciences monitors life in and around the barents sea .
the institute has amassed an impressive database concerning temperature and salinity of the sea over the course of the 20th century .
referring to the statistics , biologist pavel makarevich says there are clear cycles during which both temperature and salinity rise and fall . these cycles , he says , are related to solar activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murmansk is russia 's gateway to the arctic waters " in my opinion and that of our institute , the problems connected to the current stage of warming are being exaggerated , " he says .
" what we are dealing with is not a global warming of the atmosphere or of the oceans . "
makarevich expects a normalization of arctic temperatures in the coming years .
this view appears to have the support of a growing number of russian scientists .
some even predict a temporary cooling of temperatures towards the middle of this century , a phenomenon known as a " little ice age . "
shorter winters but for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula between the barents and the white sea , a drop in temperature is urgently needed .
over the last few years , the winters have become milder and milder , threatening the traditional lifestyle of the saami .
this year again , the onset of winter was late in northern russia .
normally , the tundra would already be covered by a deep layer of snow , and the numerous lakes would have a thick layer of ice .
but snow cover is minimal and some of the lakes are not even frozen yet .
for native reindeer herders , that 's a problem , because the traditional slaughter season has to be postponed .
" the slaughter used to start in early november , " says herder nikolai filippov .
" at that time , the ice is usually strong enough to carry the reindeer .
but over the past few years , the ice has been weak and sparse , so we can not travel , and the slaughter has to be postponed until just before the new year .
this year , yields will be minimal . "
each fall , the big reindeer herds are somewhere on the vast expanses of the kola peninsula .
at the onset of winter , they have to be found and driven to lovozero , the center of the russian saami community .
but that can only happen under true winter conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indigenous saami people depend on reindeer for their living " last year it was exactly the same .
this year we do not know yet how the herds are , and what will happen later in the autumn , " filippov says .
" sometimes it is still raining around the new year , and you can not go over bare ice with the reindeer .
so then you will have to wait until after the new year .
in fact , the winter only starts in january .
for now it is a mixture of frost and thaw . "
the capricious weather has all kinds of practical consequences for the everyday life of the saami .
nikolai filippov and his wife maria live in a chum , a traditional saami tipi-like tent with a hole in the top to let out the smoke .
maria used to prepare lots of food for the winter .
but now that is out of the question , because the thaw often comes in the middle of winter and the meat can no longer be preserved .
the tundra is no longer a reliable natural refrigerator .
" in the old days it never rained in december , " says maria filippova .
" when it rains in winter , the snow disappears and we ca n't move on with our animals to search for reindeer moss . "
for thousands of years , the saami lived according to an ancient and extremely reliable calendar .
but today , says nikolai filippov , everything seems to be off course .
for him , there is no question that nature is changing .
what is happening in the tundra today is something the 59-year-old has never seen before .
the arctic as a future trading route the city of murmansk , a few hours ' drive to the north , seems a world away .
in the harbor , there 's the lenin - the first soviet nuclear-powered icebreaker built in the 1950s .
today , the heavy vessel is a museum .
andrei smirnov was the lenin 's last captain when the ship was retired in 1989 .
" no other country has boundaries like russia that stretch so far to the north , " smirnov says .
he is convinced that russia will need icebreakers like this one , now and in the future .
" we have been using the northern passage since 1932 .
it is a sea route of national significance , and since 1991 , foreign ships have also been allowed to use it .
this year as well , foreigners have used the passage , and we have successfully guided them through with our icebreakers . "
smirnov is referring to ships belonging to the german company beluga .
earlier this year , they made an impressive voyage from south korea to rotterdam , via the arctic seas north of russia .
bildunterschrift : this year , two ships from the german company , beluga , completed the trip around russia 's north .
the northern passage could become an alternative to existing routes the trip was meant to prove that the north pole ice is retreating as a result of global warming , and that the northern passage could become an attractive , much shorter alternative for existing routes like the one via the suez canal .
it sounds great , but longtime members of russia 's northern fleet , such as nikolai babich , can only laugh at the thought ..
" saying that one could navigate in the polar seas without the help of icebreakers , or even reach the north pole unhindered , no , that is not serious , " says babich .
babich feels at home in the russian arctic .
he has visited almost every corner of it during the last 40 years , and he claims there is no-one like him who has studied the area in such detail .
the recent rise in global temperature has surprised neither him nor his colleagues .
it has happened in the past , he says , and it will happen again .
" the natural processes we have seen during the past decade are mainly the result of the sun 's activity .
they show a slight increase in temperature , and as a result , arctic ice has receded , " he says .
but according to babich , the situation is changing .
the arctic , he says , is already cooling , not warming .
and the russian government is attentively listening to those scientists who , like babich , are predicting a cold spell .

but if europe is not to lose ground , the opinion of experts in europe and china is that the eu should at least try and match us offers of cooperation and trump them with actual concrete action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china wants the eu to get its act together as a partner " during a high level meeting in beijing last week , we got a very clear signal from the chinese leadership , " holslag told deutsche welle .
" premier wen jiabao and state counselor dai bingguo explained that china attaches a lot of importance to cooperation with europe and that it should not worry about a g2 .
but for the chinese , the ball is in our court now .
they want us to prove that we can get our act together and come up with a pragmatic agenda for cooperation .
if the eu can add no value to china 's essentially commercial relations with individual member states , there will not be a strategic partnership . " paul lim , a senior academic adviser at the european institute for asian studies in brussels , said that china would pick up on any concern within europe in relation to its position as a partner and could possibly play the eu and us off against each other .
but he also said china needs both powers for very different reasons . " the us , with its history of relations with asia , its presence in asia makes it a more important partner than the eu , " lim told deutsche welle .
" the eu with its soft power which it can use to great influence is still young , and is new in the game .
it all boils down to how much of a common voice the eu projects .
china will want an ally on certain issues with the eu in relation to the us and the eu will want an ally in the us on certain issues with china .
i do not see the eu losing any influence with china and i 'm sure that the us and eu will not allow china to play them against each other . "
obama 's pragmatism could bode ill for eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has opened the path to greater dialogue with beijing president obama 's visit was the first example of the current administration 's desire to engage with china and the importance it attached to china and the wider asian region as a key strategic partner .
while there were few breakthroughs to make the europeans nervous , obama came away from beijing with the paths to dialog firmly open and as such , moved the us into a position which could undermine europe 's influence in future . " chinese aid is much needed to keep the american economy afloat and to stabilize afghanistan , " holslag said .
" this has cautioned obama during his visit .
if the united states continues to opt for more pragmatism , this would certainly weaken europe 's bargaining position when it comes to human rights , economic liberalization and other challenges . "
to lag behind in relations and cooperation with the chinese could be damaging to the eu .
china 's new global influence through investment in africa and elsewhere , its growing economic muscle and its position as a major player in global issues such as iran and north korea , as well as climate change , makes the people 's republic a partner to neglect at peril . lack of action damaging eu reputation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen jinbao wants to see more action from barrosso 's eu what could prove damaging is china 's concern that the eu can talk a good partnership but is showing a lack of commitment when it comes to putting these words into practice in areas where eu-sino relations have been traditionally strong . " while trade has always been the main driver of sino-european cooperation , this has now become one of the main sources of friction , " holslag said .
" it is clear that europe 's failure to innovate its industries is leading to more sensitivity of competition from countries like china . " on the international scene we both have a joint interest in stabilizing africa , securing central asia and promoting multilateral cooperation , " he added .
" but joint interests do not automatically lead to cooperation .
growing assertiveness makes beijing more eager to promote its own values , while the eu is not proving itself as a strong player . " calls for reform turning opinion against europe where the eu continues to hold a strong hand is in its dedication to democracy and human rights .
the european union has long been a strong advocate of reform in china and has never missed an opportunity to make its feelings known .
in most cases china has responded respectfully but has given few concrete indicators that eu pressure alone is enough to force through radical change .
as a result , europe continues to press beijing in the hope that persistence will win out in the end . in fact , the eu 's regular advocating of democratic and social reform in china is beginning to turn opinion within the people 's republic , leading some within the chinese government to suggest that europe should put its own house in order fist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's constant calls for reform start to annoy china " traditionally the chinese are concerned about ' saving their face ' , " holslag said .
" but let us not forget that the pro-europe camp in beijing is losing ground .
leaders like premier wen have come under quite a lot of pressure from political hardliners and the public opinion .
china has become less tolerant of european lecturing .
as a result , we might even expect more chinese criticism on the eu 's weak performance in the combat against climate change , its deplorable economic situation or its lack of political coherence . " despite the uncertain climate between europe and china , paul lim believes that the current level of financial commitment and strategic cooperation between the two powers is enough to look towards the future with guarded optimism . " the future of eu-china cooperation depends on maturity of relations , of respect , of being able to accept criticisms , and an understanding of each other 's culture . " said lim .
" however , right now , there has to be a certain degree of closeness , of trust and confidence for the eu to put its money into china .
the two powers are also coming closer on climate change as its effects are felt in china and we can not deny that china is doing something about it even if we think it is not enough .
but the big question is how mature the relationship is .
this is another matter . " author : nick amies editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but if europe is not to lose ground , the opinion of experts in europe and china is that the eu should at least try and match us offers of cooperation and trump them with actual concrete action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china wants the eu to get its act together as a partner " during a high level meeting in beijing last week , we got a very clear signal from the chinese leadership , " holslag told deutsche welle .
" premier wen jiabao and state counselor dai bingguo explained that china attaches a lot of importance to cooperation with europe and that it should not worry about a g2 .
but for the chinese , the ball is in our court now .
they want us to prove that we can get our act together and come up with a pragmatic agenda for cooperation .
if the eu can add no value to china 's essentially commercial relations with individual member states , there will not be a strategic partnership . " paul lim , a senior academic adviser at the european institute for asian studies in brussels , said that china would pick up on any concern within europe in relation to its position as a partner and could possibly play the eu and us off against each other .
but he also said china needs both powers for very different reasons . " the us , with its history of relations with asia , its presence in asia makes it a more important partner than the eu , " lim told deutsche welle .
" the eu with its soft power which it can use to great influence is still young , and is new in the game .
it all boils down to how much of a common voice the eu projects .
china will want an ally on certain issues with the eu in relation to the us and the eu will want an ally in the us on certain issues with china .
i do not see the eu losing any influence with china and i 'm sure that the us and eu will not allow china to play them against each other . "
obama 's pragmatism could bode ill for eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has opened the path to greater dialogue with beijing president obama 's visit was the first example of the current administration 's desire to engage with china and the importance it attached to china and the wider asian region as a key strategic partner .
while there were few breakthroughs to make the europeans nervous , obama came away from beijing with the paths to dialog firmly open and as such , moved the us into a position which could undermine europe 's influence in future . " chinese aid is much needed to keep the american economy afloat and to stabilize afghanistan , " holslag said .
" this has cautioned obama during his visit .
if the united states continues to opt for more pragmatism , this would certainly weaken europe 's bargaining position when it comes to human rights , economic liberalization and other challenges . "
to lag behind in relations and cooperation with the chinese could be damaging to the eu .
china 's new global influence through investment in africa and elsewhere , its growing economic muscle and its position as a major player in global issues such as iran and north korea , as well as climate change , makes the people 's republic a partner to neglect at peril . lack of action damaging eu reputation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen jinbao wants to see more action from barrosso 's eu what could prove damaging is china 's concern that the eu can talk a good partnership but is showing a lack of commitment when it comes to putting these words into practice in areas where eu-sino relations have been traditionally strong . " while trade has always been the main driver of sino-european cooperation , this has now become one of the main sources of friction , " holslag said .
" it is clear that europe 's failure to innovate its industries is leading to more sensitivity of competition from countries like china . " on the international scene we both have a joint interest in stabilizing africa , securing central asia and promoting multilateral cooperation , " he added .
" but joint interests do not automatically lead to cooperation .
growing assertiveness makes beijing more eager to promote its own values , while the eu is not proving itself as a strong player . " calls for reform turning opinion against europe where the eu continues to hold a strong hand is in its dedication to democracy and human rights .
the european union has long been a strong advocate of reform in china and has never missed an opportunity to make its feelings known .
in most cases china has responded respectfully but has given few concrete indicators that eu pressure alone is enough to force through radical change .
as a result , europe continues to press beijing in the hope that persistence will win out in the end . in fact , the eu 's regular advocating of democratic and social reform in china is beginning to turn opinion within the people 's republic , leading some within the chinese government to suggest that europe should put its own house in order fist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's constant calls for reform start to annoy china " traditionally the chinese are concerned about ' saving their face ' , " holslag said .
" but let us not forget that the pro-europe camp in beijing is losing ground .
leaders like premier wen have come under quite a lot of pressure from political hardliners and the public opinion .
china has become less tolerant of european lecturing .
as a result , we might even expect more chinese criticism on the eu 's weak performance in the combat against climate change , its deplorable economic situation or its lack of political coherence . " despite the uncertain climate between europe and china , paul lim believes that the current level of financial commitment and strategic cooperation between the two powers is enough to look towards the future with guarded optimism . " the future of eu-china cooperation depends on maturity of relations , of respect , of being able to accept criticisms , and an understanding of each other 's culture . " said lim .
" however , right now , there has to be a certain degree of closeness , of trust and confidence for the eu to put its money into china .
the two powers are also coming closer on climate change as its effects are felt in china and we can not deny that china is doing something about it even if we think it is not enough .
but the big question is how mature the relationship is .
this is another matter . " author : nick amies editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 29.11.2009 ukraine struggles to meet uefa deadline ahead of euro 2012 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is getting ready for its moment in the spotlight ukraine 's golden opportunity to host euro 2012 comes with great expectations and high pressure from uefa .
but will the country be able to meet uefa 's looming deadline ? ukraine has until november 30 to convince uefa that it is ready to host the 2012 european soccer championships .
with a projected figure of 1.3 million soccer fans expected to attend the championship , ukraine 's leadership has been scrambling to upgrade the infrastructure in its four host cities .
uefa president michael platini has said that there are huge infrastructure problems – stadiums need to be built or renovated and roads need to be repaired – which wstill need to be resolved in ukraine .
uefa earlier threatened to strip ukraine of its co-hosting rights with poland after it experienced difficulties in building infrastructure in preparation for the championship .
however michael platini has insisted " we will go to ukraine . "
but he has stressed that it is still unclear how many cities in the country will be deemed fit to host games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heavy construction is underway in ukraine 's major cities to build new stadiums for the soccer championship ukraine 's government is fervently pulling out all the stops to prepare for their hosting debut and has ordered entire cities be restored .
around the country , roads , stadiums , sports grounds and hotels are getting a facelift .
anticipation and excitement about the upcoming championship has unified ukraine 's government and its people .
the country has not sponsored a major sporting event since 1980 when ukraine co-hosted the olympic games as a part of the soviet union .
markian lubkivsky , chairman of ukraine 's euro 2012 organizing committee , has noted the effect that the opportunity to host euro 2012 has had on his country .
" for ukraine , the championship has helped us overcome identity problems , integrate better into the european community and deepen our relations with poland , " he said .
financing difficulties one factor which has complicated ukraine 's push to prepare for euro 2012 has been the strain caused by the international financial crisis .
state revenues are down 30 percent and ukraine ’ s leaders have traded accusations of breaking promises on financing for euro 2012 .
ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko said the government had only provided five percent of the $ 945 million it pledged to spend on the games in 2009 .
" the financing program for euro 2012 is under threat , " said the president .
" together with the central bank and finance ministry , we must find financial resources . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko has been severely critical of the financing initiatives for euro 2012 preparations the president was nonetheless also unhappy with an alternative , which was recently approved by ukraine 's parliament , to finance preparations for the championship , .
the new government financing bill stipulates that the country ’ s national bank must send the majority of its profits , about $ 800 million us , into a fund to finance euro 2012 .
president yushchenko has called that move " fiscally irresponsible " and has unsuccessfully tried to veto it .
many in ukraine 's government are , however , convinced that even in times as tough as these , the euro 2012 is a worthy investment .
ukraine 's sports minister yurii pavlenko has said that the championship will surely pay for itself . " i am sure that no matter how much money we put into the infrastructure , in the end we will be in the black , " said pavlenko .
" but the infrastructure ; the roads , stadiums , sports grounds and restored cities will be in good repair .
and that ’ s something we will have for much longer after the championship ... and i think that will take our culture to a new level . "
whether or not ukraine 's earnest preparations for euro 2012 will hit the mark and win uefa 's approval remains to be seen .
all eyes are on ukraine to see if the country will succeed in holding on to its winning bid to host euro 2012 .

but will the country be able to meet uefa 's looming deadline ? ukraine has until november 30 to convince uefa that it is ready to host the 2012 european soccer championships .
with a projected figure of 1.3 million soccer fans expected to attend the championship , ukraine 's leadership has been scrambling to upgrade the infrastructure in its four host cities .
uefa president michael platini has said that there are huge infrastructure problems – stadiums need to be built or renovated and roads need to be repaired – which wstill need to be resolved in ukraine .
uefa earlier threatened to strip ukraine of its co-hosting rights with poland after it experienced difficulties in building infrastructure in preparation for the championship .
however michael platini has insisted " we will go to ukraine . "
but he has stressed that it is still unclear how many cities in the country will be deemed fit to host games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heavy construction is underway in ukraine 's major cities to build new stadiums for the soccer championship ukraine 's government is fervently pulling out all the stops to prepare for their hosting debut and has ordered entire cities be restored .
around the country , roads , stadiums , sports grounds and hotels are getting a facelift .
anticipation and excitement about the upcoming championship has unified ukraine 's government and its people .
the country has not sponsored a major sporting event since 1980 when ukraine co-hosted the olympic games as a part of the soviet union .
markian lubkivsky , chairman of ukraine 's euro 2012 organizing committee , has noted the effect that the opportunity to host euro 2012 has had on his country .
" for ukraine , the championship has helped us overcome identity problems , integrate better into the european community and deepen our relations with poland , " he said .
financing difficulties one factor which has complicated ukraine 's push to prepare for euro 2012 has been the strain caused by the international financial crisis .
state revenues are down 30 percent and ukraine ’ s leaders have traded accusations of breaking promises on financing for euro 2012 .
ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko said the government had only provided five percent of the $ 945 million it pledged to spend on the games in 2009 .
" the financing program for euro 2012 is under threat , " said the president .
" together with the central bank and finance ministry , we must find financial resources . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko has been severely critical of the financing initiatives for euro 2012 preparations the president was nonetheless also unhappy with an alternative , which was recently approved by ukraine 's parliament , to finance preparations for the championship , .
the new government financing bill stipulates that the country ’ s national bank must send the majority of its profits , about $ 800 million us , into a fund to finance euro 2012 .
president yushchenko has called that move " fiscally irresponsible " and has unsuccessfully tried to veto it .
many in ukraine 's government are , however , convinced that even in times as tough as these , the euro 2012 is a worthy investment .
ukraine 's sports minister yurii pavlenko has said that the championship will surely pay for itself . " i am sure that no matter how much money we put into the infrastructure , in the end we will be in the black , " said pavlenko .
" but the infrastructure ; the roads , stadiums , sports grounds and restored cities will be in good repair .
and that ’ s something we will have for much longer after the championship ... and i think that will take our culture to a new level . "
whether or not ukraine 's earnest preparations for euro 2012 will hit the mark and win uefa 's approval remains to be seen .
all eyes are on ukraine to see if the country will succeed in holding on to its winning bid to host euro 2012 .

financing difficulties one factor which has complicated ukraine 's push to prepare for euro 2012 has been the strain caused by the international financial crisis .
state revenues are down 30 percent and ukraine ’ s leaders have traded accusations of breaking promises on financing for euro 2012 .
ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko said the government had only provided five percent of the $ 945 million it pledged to spend on the games in 2009 .

the new government financing bill stipulates that the country ’ s national bank must send the majority of its profits , about $ 800 million us , into a fund to finance euro 2012 .
president yushchenko has called that move " fiscally irresponsible " and has unsuccessfully tried to veto it .
many in ukraine 's government are , however , convinced that even in times as tough as these , the euro 2012 is a worthy investment .
ukraine 's sports minister yurii pavlenko has said that the championship will surely pay for itself . " i am sure that no matter how much money we put into the infrastructure , in the end we will be in the black , " said pavlenko .

the surprise result is certain to embarrass the government and dismay the country 's muslim minority . the swiss news agency ats and other media outlets report that a clear majority , 57.5 percent of voters and all but four of switzerland 's 26 cantons approved the proposal in this nationwide referendum .
of eligible voters , 53 percent turned out to vote . the government has said it will respect the decision of the people and would no longer permit the construction of new minarets in switzerland , but tried to assure the muslim minority that the ban was " not a rejection of the muslim community , religion or culture . " " muslims in switzerland are able to practice their religion alone or in community with others and live according to their beliefs just as before , " it said in a statement . the right-wing swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- , switzerland 's biggest party , was the driving force behind the referendum , along with the conservative federal democratic union .
they succeeded in gathering 100,000 signatures within 18 months , which is needed to call a referendum under swiss law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban supporters say that minarets - like this one in geneva - represent claims to power the svp said switzerland 's four existing minarets are not mere architectural features on religious buildings but represent a " political-religious claim to power , which challenges fundamental rights . " " we 're enormously happy , " said walter wobmann , president of the initiative committee .
" it is a victory for this people , this switzerland , this freedom and those who want a democratic society . " earlier , he had told reuters that the goal was to stop " further islamization in switzerland . " " people may practice their religion , that is no problem , " he said . muslim dismay some 400,000 muslims live in switzerland , making them the nation 's second largest religious group . " the most painful for us is not the minaret ban , but the symbol sent by this vote , " said farhad afshar , head of the coordination of islamic organizations in switzerland .
" muslims do not feel accepted as a religious community . " nadia karmous , president of the cultural association of muslim women in switzerland , told le temps newspaper : " i feel sad for switzerland .
imagine the impact abroad .
the image of the -lrb- country -rrb- is already that of a racist country . " the conference of swiss bishops also criticized the result , saying that it " heightens the problems of cohabitation between religions and cultures . " direct democracy the referendum was held using switzerland 's system of " direct democracy , " which allows individuals and groups to propose laws which are then put to a public ballot , bypassing parliament . bildunterschrift : the svp 's referendum poster has been criticized as " sinister " and " racist " the collective executive branch of the government - the swiss federal council - criticized the vote , saying it could damage switzerland 's image in the arab world , and make the country appear intolerant of religious diversity . the government had encouraged swiss people to vote against the ban . " muslims should be able to practice their religion and have access to minarets in switzerland , too , " president hans-rudolf merz said in a last-minute video broadcast to the nation .
" but the call of the muezzin will not sound here . " foreign minister micheline calmy-rey said she was " shocked " and " deeply regretted " the outcome , which she said had to be seen in the context of globalization and the economic crisis .

but if europe is not to lose ground , the opinion of experts in europe and china is that the eu should at least try and match us offers of cooperation and trump them with actual concrete action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china wants the eu to get its act together as a partner " during a high level meeting in beijing last week , we got a very clear signal from the chinese leadership , " holslag told deutsche welle .
" premier wen jiabao and state counselor dai bingguo explained that china attaches a lot of importance to cooperation with europe and that it should not worry about a g2 .
but for the chinese , the ball is in our court now .
they want us to prove that we can get our act together and come up with a pragmatic agenda for cooperation .
if the eu can add no value to china 's essentially commercial relations with individual member states , there will not be a strategic partnership . " paul lim , a senior academic adviser at the european institute for asian studies in brussels , said that china would pick up on any concern within europe in relation to its position as a partner and could possibly play the eu and us off against each other .
but he also said china needs both powers for very different reasons . " the us , with its history of relations with asia , its presence in asia makes it a more important partner than the eu , " lim told deutsche welle .
" the eu with its soft power which it can use to great influence is still young , and is new in the game .
it all boils down to how much of a common voice the eu projects .
china will want an ally on certain issues with the eu in relation to the us and the eu will want an ally in the us on certain issues with china .
i do not see the eu losing any influence with china and i 'm sure that the us and eu will not allow china to play them against each other . "
obama 's pragmatism could bode ill for eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has opened the path to greater dialogue with beijing president obama 's visit was the first example of the current administration 's desire to engage with china and the importance it attached to china and the wider asian region as a key strategic partner .
while there were few breakthroughs to make the europeans nervous , obama came away from beijing with the paths to dialog firmly open and as such , moved the us into a position which could undermine europe 's influence in future . " chinese aid is much needed to keep the american economy afloat and to stabilize afghanistan , " holslag said .
" this has cautioned obama during his visit .
if the united states continues to opt for more pragmatism , this would certainly weaken europe 's bargaining position when it comes to human rights , economic liberalization and other challenges . "
to lag behind in relations and cooperation with the chinese could be damaging to the eu .
china 's new global influence through investment in africa and elsewhere , its growing economic muscle and its position as a major player in global issues such as iran and north korea , as well as climate change , makes the people 's republic a partner to neglect at peril . lack of action damaging eu reputation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen jinbao wants to see more action from barrosso 's eu what could prove damaging is china 's concern that the eu can talk a good partnership but is showing a lack of commitment when it comes to putting these words into practice in areas where eu-sino relations have been traditionally strong . " while trade has always been the main driver of sino-european cooperation , this has now become one of the main sources of friction , " holslag said .
" it is clear that europe 's failure to innovate its industries is leading to more sensitivity of competition from countries like china . " on the international scene we both have a joint interest in stabilizing africa , securing central asia and promoting multilateral cooperation , " he added .
" but joint interests do not automatically lead to cooperation .
growing assertiveness makes beijing more eager to promote its own values , while the eu is not proving itself as a strong player . " calls for reform turning opinion against europe where the eu continues to hold a strong hand is in its dedication to democracy and human rights .
the european union has long been a strong advocate of reform in china and has never missed an opportunity to make its feelings known .
in most cases china has responded respectfully but has given few concrete indicators that eu pressure alone is enough to force through radical change .
as a result , europe continues to press beijing in the hope that persistence will win out in the end . in fact , the eu 's regular advocating of democratic and social reform in china is beginning to turn opinion within the people 's republic , leading some within the chinese government to suggest that europe should put its own house in order fist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's constant calls for reform start to annoy china " traditionally the chinese are concerned about ' saving their face ' , " holslag said .
" but let us not forget that the pro-europe camp in beijing is losing ground .
leaders like premier wen have come under quite a lot of pressure from political hardliners and the public opinion .
china has become less tolerant of european lecturing .
as a result , we might even expect more chinese criticism on the eu 's weak performance in the combat against climate change , its deplorable economic situation or its lack of political coherence . " despite the uncertain climate between europe and china , paul lim believes that the current level of financial commitment and strategic cooperation between the two powers is enough to look towards the future with guarded optimism . " the future of eu-china cooperation depends on maturity of relations , of respect , of being able to accept criticisms , and an understanding of each other 's culture . " said lim .
" however , right now , there has to be a certain degree of closeness , of trust and confidence for the eu to put its money into china .
the two powers are also coming closer on climate change as its effects are felt in china and we can not deny that china is doing something about it even if we think it is not enough .
but the big question is how mature the relationship is .
this is another matter . " author : nick amies editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko has been severely critical of the financing initiatives for euro 2012 preparations the president was nonetheless also unhappy with an alternative , which was recently approved by ukraine 's parliament , to finance preparations for the championship , .
the new government financing bill stipulates that the country ’ s national bank must send the majority of its profits , about $ 800 million us , into a fund to finance euro 2012 .
president yushchenko has called that move " fiscally irresponsible " and has unsuccessfully tried to veto it .
many in ukraine 's government are , however , convinced that even in times as tough as these , the euro 2012 is a worthy investment .
ukraine 's sports minister yurii pavlenko has said that the championship will surely pay for itself . " i am sure that no matter how much money we put into the infrastructure , in the end we will be in the black , " said pavlenko .
" but the infrastructure ; the roads , stadiums , sports grounds and restored cities will be in good repair .
and that ’ s something we will have for much longer after the championship ... and i think that will take our culture to a new level . "
whether or not ukraine 's earnest preparations for euro 2012 will hit the mark and win uefa 's approval remains to be seen .
all eyes are on ukraine to see if the country will succeed in holding on to its winning bid to host euro 2012 .

but will the country be able to meet uefa 's looming deadline ? ukraine has until november 30 to convince uefa that it is ready to host the 2012 european soccer championships .
with a projected figure of 1.3 million soccer fans expected to attend the championship , ukraine 's leadership has been scrambling to upgrade the infrastructure in its four host cities .
uefa president michael platini has said that there are huge infrastructure problems – stadiums need to be built or renovated and roads need to be repaired – which wstill need to be resolved in ukraine .
uefa earlier threatened to strip ukraine of its co-hosting rights with poland after it experienced difficulties in building infrastructure in preparation for the championship .
however michael platini has insisted " we will go to ukraine . "
but he has stressed that it is still unclear how many cities in the country will be deemed fit to host games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heavy construction is underway in ukraine 's major cities to build new stadiums for the soccer championship ukraine 's government is fervently pulling out all the stops to prepare for their hosting debut and has ordered entire cities be restored .
around the country , roads , stadiums , sports grounds and hotels are getting a facelift .
anticipation and excitement about the upcoming championship has unified ukraine 's government and its people .
the country has not sponsored a major sporting event since 1980 when ukraine co-hosted the olympic games as a part of the soviet union .
markian lubkivsky , chairman of ukraine 's euro 2012 organizing committee , has noted the effect that the opportunity to host euro 2012 has had on his country .
" for ukraine , the championship has helped us overcome identity problems , integrate better into the european community and deepen our relations with poland , " he said .
financing difficulties one factor which has complicated ukraine 's push to prepare for euro 2012 has been the strain caused by the international financial crisis .
state revenues are down 30 percent and ukraine ’ s leaders have traded accusations of breaking promises on financing for euro 2012 .
ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko said the government had only provided five percent of the $ 945 million it pledged to spend on the games in 2009 .
" the financing program for euro 2012 is under threat , " said the president .
" together with the central bank and finance ministry , we must find financial resources . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko has been severely critical of the financing initiatives for euro 2012 preparations the president was nonetheless also unhappy with an alternative , which was recently approved by ukraine 's parliament , to finance preparations for the championship , .
the new government financing bill stipulates that the country ’ s national bank must send the majority of its profits , about $ 800 million us , into a fund to finance euro 2012 .
president yushchenko has called that move " fiscally irresponsible " and has unsuccessfully tried to veto it .
many in ukraine 's government are , however , convinced that even in times as tough as these , the euro 2012 is a worthy investment .
ukraine 's sports minister yurii pavlenko has said that the championship will surely pay for itself . " i am sure that no matter how much money we put into the infrastructure , in the end we will be in the black , " said pavlenko .
" but the infrastructure ; the roads , stadiums , sports grounds and restored cities will be in good repair .
and that ’ s something we will have for much longer after the championship ... and i think that will take our culture to a new level . "
whether or not ukraine 's earnest preparations for euro 2012 will hit the mark and win uefa 's approval remains to be seen .
all eyes are on ukraine to see if the country will succeed in holding on to its winning bid to host euro 2012 .

he was appointed to the post by former un secretary-general kofi annan in 2006 .
one of his department 's tasks is to provide support to the compliance regime of the kyoto protocol , the landmark pact for tackling greenhouse-gas emissions .
the un climate conference in copenhagen from december 7 - 18 will focus on an agreement to take effect after kyoto expires in 2012 .
deutsche welle : for a long time the un climate summit has been viewed as an all-or-nothing event .
is that what it still is ? de boer : i think so .
i think it is an all-or-nothing event in the sense that we need to see a number of things come together .
we need rich country emission reduction targets , individual targets for rich countries , secondly we need to know what china , india , brazil , major development countries , will do to lower the growth in emissions , thirdly we need prompt start financing to help developing countries engage .
fourthly we need a set of decisions that will make immediate action operational .
that all sounds very concrete .
in the press in the run-up to the conference there are all sorts of terms like outlines , pledges , frameworks , meaningful bids .
that does n't sound like what you are talking about .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvo de boer no , it does n't , but if i listen to what the danish prime minister is saying , he is the one who will be inviting heads of state and governments for the closing .
then if i listen to what connie hedegaard , the minister who will chair the conference , is saying and if i listen to myself , then at least the three of us are saying exactly the same thing .
the chinese appear to have seen the light regarding the need to de-carbonize their economy as much as possible so as not to despoil their environment .
but both the chinese and the indians have been arguing in recent years that they should have room for carbon-based industrial growth so they can provide their huge populations better living standards .
is there room for that any more ?
there has to be room for that .
china is changing its approach not only because of love of the environment and the fear of climate change , but also because i believe you can not continue to grow the chinese economy at the current pace in the current way .
there has to be a fundamental change .
and yes , to have to leave space for developing countries to grow .
in india , there are 400 million people that do n't even have access to electricity .
the goal of copenhagen should not be to keep people living under those circumstances .
so we will see growth in emissions in some countries .

kristina koehler is a fresh face in german cabinet , and not just because she 's getting her first portfolio .
at 32 , she 's germany 's youngest cabinet minister and probably the only one who can use facebook without an aide . kristina koehler , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , was chosen as family minister on friday as part of a cabinet reshuffle .
koehler 's nomination is also no doubt aimed at improving the christian democrat 's profile among younger voters .
true to her generation , she can be found on the social networking site facebook and also posts on twitter .
tweeting on sunday , she said she was surprised by the focus on whether she would continue to use the internet application .
" i 'm not going to give up letter writing , either , " she wrote .
in her first interview since taking office , koehler told the bild am sonntag newspaper via email that she was n't about to abandon applications like twitter and facebook just because she had been promoted to cabinet .
she said although it was " absurd " to consider all of her 600 facebook contacts as friends , she found the site useful for spreading her political message .
career move until now , koehler , a member of the bundestag 's internal affairs committee , was mostly known for speaking out on topics such as extremism and the integration of foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen , koehler 's predecessor she takes over the family ministry from ursula von der leyen , who is moving into the labor ministry .
koehler is expected to continue her predecessor 's policies that aim to make child-rearing less expensive in germany .
but in other respects , koehler could n't be more different from von der leyen , a 51-year-old working mother of seven .
koehler joined the youth wing of the christian democrats at the age of 14 , already clear in her mind that she was destined for a career in politics .
now she is one of three relatively young ministers alongside fellow christian democrat defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , 38 , and health minister philipp roessler , 36 , from the pro-business free democrats. nw / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kristina koehler is a fresh face in german cabinet , and not just because she 's getting her first portfolio .
at 32 , she 's germany 's youngest cabinet minister and probably the only one who can use facebook without an aide . kristina koehler , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , was chosen as family minister on friday as part of a cabinet reshuffle .
koehler 's nomination is also no doubt aimed at improving the christian democrat 's profile among younger voters .
true to her generation , she can be found on the social networking site facebook and also posts on twitter .
tweeting on sunday , she said she was surprised by the focus on whether she would continue to use the internet application .
" i 'm not going to give up letter writing , either , " she wrote .
in her first interview since taking office , koehler told the bild am sonntag newspaper via email that she was n't about to abandon applications like twitter and facebook just because she had been promoted to cabinet .
she said although it was " absurd " to consider all of her 600 facebook contacts as friends , she found the site useful for spreading her political message .
career move until now , koehler , a member of the bundestag 's internal affairs committee , was mostly known for speaking out on topics such as extremism and the integration of foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen , koehler 's predecessor she takes over the family ministry from ursula von der leyen , who is moving into the labor ministry .
koehler is expected to continue her predecessor 's policies that aim to make child-rearing less expensive in germany .
but in other respects , koehler could n't be more different from von der leyen , a 51-year-old working mother of seven .
koehler joined the youth wing of the christian democrats at the age of 14 , already clear in her mind that she was destined for a career in politics .
now she is one of three relatively young ministers alongside fellow christian democrat defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , 38 , and health minister philipp roessler , 36 , from the pro-business free democrats. nw / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" an active investigative and operational effort is underway to identify and find the individuals involved in the crime , " vladimir markin , a spokesman for the investigators , told russian state television on sunday , november 29 .
the 14-carriage passenger train carrying nearly 700 people was jolted off the rails on the main line between moscow and russia 's second largest city , st. petersburg in what the authorities suspect was a bomb attack .
according to russia 's emergency situations ministry , the attack killed 25 and injured 104 , while 26 people remain missing .
markin said forensic experts had returned sunday morning to the scene of the explosion - a wooded area about 400 kilometers -lrb- 250 miles -rrb- northwest of the capital moscow - to continue their search for clues .
the question of responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extremists from conflict zones have been blamed for a string of attacks on civilian targets it remains unclear what motivated the attackers to strike the train , which is popular with well-off russians and foreign tourists .
a police spokesman expressed doubts about a message posted on the internet by a radical right-wing group claiming responsibility .
the chief of russia 's fsb security service had said earlier that the blast which derailed the train was caused by an improvised explosive device with the force of seven kilograms -lrb- 15 lbs . -rrb- of tnt .
interior minister rashid nurgaliyev had said police had evidence suggesting that several persons took part in the attack , and even gave a description of one of the suspects .
a second explosion occurred during rescue operations on saturday , but no one was injured .
grim task of identifying bodies meanwhile , the process of formally identifying bodies began on sunday in tver , a city between moscow and st. petersburg , and the regional capital of the area in which the train was attacked .
interfax news agency quoted a spokeswoman for the regional government as saying that 65 relatives of the train disaster victims were in tver to examine the corpses at a local morgue .
a government commission specially formed by prime minister vladimir putin to deal with the aftermath of the disaster was expected to meet later on sunday .
russian railways , the state company that oversees the country 's railroads , said in a statement that the movement of trains between moscow and st. petersburg had been " fully restored " as of sunday morning .
bildunterschrift : this is no the first bombing attack that has happened in russia past attacks against civilian targets the nevsky express was hit by a similar bomb attack in august 2007 , when 60 people were injured in an incident that continues to remain cloaked in mystery although it has been inconclusively linked to chechen separatists and russian ultranationalists .
forty-six people were killed and 160 injured as an explosion tore through a morning commuter train in russia 's southern fringe in december 2003 and , just months later , in february 2004 , a suicide bombing claimed 39 lives on an underground train in moscow .
extremists from conflict regions in the northern caucasus have been blamed for a string of attacks on other civilian targets in russia , including planes and a bus. rb / afpe / dpa / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" an active investigative and operational effort is underway to identify and find the individuals involved in the crime , " vladimir markin , a spokesman for the investigators , told russian state television on sunday , november 29 .
the 14-carriage passenger train carrying nearly 700 people was jolted off the rails on the main line between moscow and russia 's second largest city , st. petersburg in what the authorities suspect was a bomb attack .
according to russia 's emergency situations ministry , the attack killed 25 and injured 104 , while 26 people remain missing .
markin said forensic experts had returned sunday morning to the scene of the explosion - a wooded area about 400 kilometers -lrb- 250 miles -rrb- northwest of the capital moscow - to continue their search for clues .
the question of responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extremists from conflict zones have been blamed for a string of attacks on civilian targets it remains unclear what motivated the attackers to strike the train , which is popular with well-off russians and foreign tourists .
a police spokesman expressed doubts about a message posted on the internet by a radical right-wing group claiming responsibility .
the chief of russia 's fsb security service had said earlier that the blast which derailed the train was caused by an improvised explosive device with the force of seven kilograms -lrb- 15 lbs . -rrb- of tnt .
interior minister rashid nurgaliyev had said police had evidence suggesting that several persons took part in the attack , and even gave a description of one of the suspects .
a second explosion occurred during rescue operations on saturday , but no one was injured .
grim task of identifying bodies meanwhile , the process of formally identifying bodies began on sunday in tver , a city between moscow and st. petersburg , and the regional capital of the area in which the train was attacked .
interfax news agency quoted a spokeswoman for the regional government as saying that 65 relatives of the train disaster victims were in tver to examine the corpses at a local morgue .
a government commission specially formed by prime minister vladimir putin to deal with the aftermath of the disaster was expected to meet later on sunday .
russian railways , the state company that oversees the country 's railroads , said in a statement that the movement of trains between moscow and st. petersburg had been " fully restored " as of sunday morning .
bildunterschrift : this is no the first bombing attack that has happened in russia past attacks against civilian targets the nevsky express was hit by a similar bomb attack in august 2007 , when 60 people were injured in an incident that continues to remain cloaked in mystery although it has been inconclusively linked to chechen separatists and russian ultranationalists .
forty-six people were killed and 160 injured as an explosion tore through a morning commuter train in russia 's southern fringe in december 2003 and , just months later , in february 2004 , a suicide bombing claimed 39 lives on an underground train in moscow .
extremists from conflict regions in the northern caucasus have been blamed for a string of attacks on other civilian targets in russia , including planes and a bus. rb / afpe / dpa / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kristina koehler is a fresh face in german cabinet , and not just because she 's getting her first portfolio .
at 32 , she 's germany 's youngest cabinet minister and probably the only one who can use facebook without an aide . kristina koehler , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , was chosen as family minister on friday as part of a cabinet reshuffle .
koehler 's nomination is also no doubt aimed at improving the christian democrat 's profile among younger voters .
true to her generation , she can be found on the social networking site facebook and also posts on twitter .
tweeting on sunday , she said she was surprised by the focus on whether she would continue to use the internet application .
" i 'm not going to give up letter writing , either , " she wrote .
in her first interview since taking office , koehler told the bild am sonntag newspaper via email that she was n't about to abandon applications like twitter and facebook just because she had been promoted to cabinet .
she said although it was " absurd " to consider all of her 600 facebook contacts as friends , she found the site useful for spreading her political message .
career move until now , koehler , a member of the bundestag 's internal affairs committee , was mostly known for speaking out on topics such as extremism and the integration of foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen , koehler 's predecessor she takes over the family ministry from ursula von der leyen , who is moving into the labor ministry .
koehler is expected to continue her predecessor 's policies that aim to make child-rearing less expensive in germany .
but in other respects , koehler could n't be more different from von der leyen , a 51-year-old working mother of seven .
koehler joined the youth wing of the christian democrats at the age of 14 , already clear in her mind that she was destined for a career in politics .
now she is one of three relatively young ministers alongside fellow christian democrat defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , 38 , and health minister philipp roessler , 36 , from the pro-business free democrats. nw / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 29.11.2009 ukraine struggles to meet uefa deadline ahead of euro 2012 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is getting ready for its moment in the spotlight ukraine 's golden opportunity to host euro 2012 comes with great expectations and high pressure from uefa .
but will the country be able to meet uefa 's looming deadline ? ukraine has until november 30 to convince uefa that it is ready to host the 2012 european soccer championships .
with a projected figure of 1.3 million soccer fans expected to attend the championship , ukraine 's leadership has been scrambling to upgrade the infrastructure in its four host cities .
uefa president michael platini has said that there are huge infrastructure problems – stadiums need to be built or renovated and roads need to be repaired – which wstill need to be resolved in ukraine .
uefa earlier threatened to strip ukraine of its co-hosting rights with poland after it experienced difficulties in building infrastructure in preparation for the championship .
however michael platini has insisted " we will go to ukraine . "
but he has stressed that it is still unclear how many cities in the country will be deemed fit to host games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heavy construction is underway in ukraine 's major cities to build new stadiums for the soccer championship ukraine 's government is fervently pulling out all the stops to prepare for their hosting debut and has ordered entire cities be restored .
around the country , roads , stadiums , sports grounds and hotels are getting a facelift .
anticipation and excitement about the upcoming championship has unified ukraine 's government and its people .
the country has not sponsored a major sporting event since 1980 when ukraine co-hosted the olympic games as a part of the soviet union .
markian lubkivsky , chairman of ukraine 's euro 2012 organizing committee , has noted the effect that the opportunity to host euro 2012 has had on his country .
" for ukraine , the championship has helped us overcome identity problems , integrate better into the european community and deepen our relations with poland , " he said .
financing difficulties one factor which has complicated ukraine 's push to prepare for euro 2012 has been the strain caused by the international financial crisis .
state revenues are down 30 percent and ukraine ’ s leaders have traded accusations of breaking promises on financing for euro 2012 .
ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko said the government had only provided five percent of the $ 945 million it pledged to spend on the games in 2009 .
" the financing program for euro 2012 is under threat , " said the president .
" together with the central bank and finance ministry , we must find financial resources . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko has been severely critical of the financing initiatives for euro 2012 preparations the president was nonetheless also unhappy with an alternative , which was recently approved by ukraine 's parliament , to finance preparations for the championship , .
the new government financing bill stipulates that the country ’ s national bank must send the majority of its profits , about $ 800 million us , into a fund to finance euro 2012 .
president yushchenko has called that move " fiscally irresponsible " and has unsuccessfully tried to veto it .
many in ukraine 's government are , however , convinced that even in times as tough as these , the euro 2012 is a worthy investment .
ukraine 's sports minister yurii pavlenko has said that the championship will surely pay for itself . " i am sure that no matter how much money we put into the infrastructure , in the end we will be in the black , " said pavlenko .
" but the infrastructure ; the roads , stadiums , sports grounds and restored cities will be in good repair .
and that ’ s something we will have for much longer after the championship ... and i think that will take our culture to a new level . "
whether or not ukraine 's earnest preparations for euro 2012 will hit the mark and win uefa 's approval remains to be seen .
all eyes are on ukraine to see if the country will succeed in holding on to its winning bid to host euro 2012 .

but will the country be able to meet uefa 's looming deadline ? ukraine has until november 30 to convince uefa that it is ready to host the 2012 european soccer championships .
with a projected figure of 1.3 million soccer fans expected to attend the championship , ukraine 's leadership has been scrambling to upgrade the infrastructure in its four host cities .
uefa president michael platini has said that there are huge infrastructure problems – stadiums need to be built or renovated and roads need to be repaired – which wstill need to be resolved in ukraine .
uefa earlier threatened to strip ukraine of its co-hosting rights with poland after it experienced difficulties in building infrastructure in preparation for the championship .
however michael platini has insisted " we will go to ukraine . "
but he has stressed that it is still unclear how many cities in the country will be deemed fit to host games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heavy construction is underway in ukraine 's major cities to build new stadiums for the soccer championship ukraine 's government is fervently pulling out all the stops to prepare for their hosting debut and has ordered entire cities be restored .
around the country , roads , stadiums , sports grounds and hotels are getting a facelift .
anticipation and excitement about the upcoming championship has unified ukraine 's government and its people .
the country has not sponsored a major sporting event since 1980 when ukraine co-hosted the olympic games as a part of the soviet union .
markian lubkivsky , chairman of ukraine 's euro 2012 organizing committee , has noted the effect that the opportunity to host euro 2012 has had on his country .
" for ukraine , the championship has helped us overcome identity problems , integrate better into the european community and deepen our relations with poland , " he said .
financing difficulties one factor which has complicated ukraine 's push to prepare for euro 2012 has been the strain caused by the international financial crisis .
state revenues are down 30 percent and ukraine ’ s leaders have traded accusations of breaking promises on financing for euro 2012 .
ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko said the government had only provided five percent of the $ 945 million it pledged to spend on the games in 2009 .
" the financing program for euro 2012 is under threat , " said the president .
" together with the central bank and finance ministry , we must find financial resources . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko has been severely critical of the financing initiatives for euro 2012 preparations the president was nonetheless also unhappy with an alternative , which was recently approved by ukraine 's parliament , to finance preparations for the championship , .
the new government financing bill stipulates that the country ’ s national bank must send the majority of its profits , about $ 800 million us , into a fund to finance euro 2012 .
president yushchenko has called that move " fiscally irresponsible " and has unsuccessfully tried to veto it .
many in ukraine 's government are , however , convinced that even in times as tough as these , the euro 2012 is a worthy investment .
ukraine 's sports minister yurii pavlenko has said that the championship will surely pay for itself . " i am sure that no matter how much money we put into the infrastructure , in the end we will be in the black , " said pavlenko .
" but the infrastructure ; the roads , stadiums , sports grounds and restored cities will be in good repair .
and that ’ s something we will have for much longer after the championship ... and i think that will take our culture to a new level . "
whether or not ukraine 's earnest preparations for euro 2012 will hit the mark and win uefa 's approval remains to be seen .
all eyes are on ukraine to see if the country will succeed in holding on to its winning bid to host euro 2012 .

the new government financing bill stipulates that the country ’ s national bank must send the majority of its profits , about $ 800 million us , into a fund to finance euro 2012 .

but will the country be able to meet uefa 's looming deadline ? ukraine has until november 30 to convince uefa that it is ready to host the 2012 european soccer championships .
with a projected figure of 1.3 million soccer fans expected to attend the championship , ukraine 's leadership has been scrambling to upgrade the infrastructure in its four host cities .
uefa president michael platini has said that there are huge infrastructure problems – stadiums need to be built or renovated and roads need to be repaired – which wstill need to be resolved in ukraine .
uefa earlier threatened to strip ukraine of its co-hosting rights with poland after it experienced difficulties in building infrastructure in preparation for the championship .
however michael platini has insisted " we will go to ukraine . "
but he has stressed that it is still unclear how many cities in the country will be deemed fit to host games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heavy construction is underway in ukraine 's major cities to build new stadiums for the soccer championship ukraine 's government is fervently pulling out all the stops to prepare for their hosting debut and has ordered entire cities be restored .
around the country , roads , stadiums , sports grounds and hotels are getting a facelift .
anticipation and excitement about the upcoming championship has unified ukraine 's government and its people .
the country has not sponsored a major sporting event since 1980 when ukraine co-hosted the olympic games as a part of the soviet union .
markian lubkivsky , chairman of ukraine 's euro 2012 organizing committee , has noted the effect that the opportunity to host euro 2012 has had on his country .
" for ukraine , the championship has helped us overcome identity problems , integrate better into the european community and deepen our relations with poland , " he said .
financing difficulties one factor which has complicated ukraine 's push to prepare for euro 2012 has been the strain caused by the international financial crisis .
state revenues are down 30 percent and ukraine ’ s leaders have traded accusations of breaking promises on financing for euro 2012 .
ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko said the government had only provided five percent of the $ 945 million it pledged to spend on the games in 2009 .
" the financing program for euro 2012 is under threat , " said the president .
" together with the central bank and finance ministry , we must find financial resources . "

kristina koehler is a fresh face in german cabinet , and not just because she 's getting her first portfolio .
at 32 , she 's germany 's youngest cabinet minister and probably the only one who can use facebook without an aide . kristina koehler , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , was chosen as family minister on friday as part of a cabinet reshuffle .
koehler 's nomination is also no doubt aimed at improving the christian democrat 's profile among younger voters .
true to her generation , she can be found on the social networking site facebook and also posts on twitter .
tweeting on sunday , she said she was surprised by the focus on whether she would continue to use the internet application .
" i 'm not going to give up letter writing , either , " she wrote .
in her first interview since taking office , koehler told the bild am sonntag newspaper via email that she was n't about to abandon applications like twitter and facebook just because she had been promoted to cabinet .
she said although it was " absurd " to consider all of her 600 facebook contacts as friends , she found the site useful for spreading her political message .
career move until now , koehler , a member of the bundestag 's internal affairs committee , was mostly known for speaking out on topics such as extremism and the integration of foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen , koehler 's predecessor she takes over the family ministry from ursula von der leyen , who is moving into the labor ministry .
koehler is expected to continue her predecessor 's policies that aim to make child-rearing less expensive in germany .
but in other respects , koehler could n't be more different from von der leyen , a 51-year-old working mother of seven .
koehler joined the youth wing of the christian democrats at the age of 14 , already clear in her mind that she was destined for a career in politics .
now she is one of three relatively young ministers alongside fellow christian democrat defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , 38 , and health minister philipp roessler , 36 , from the pro-business free democrats. nw / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" an active investigative and operational effort is underway to identify and find the individuals involved in the crime , " vladimir markin , a spokesman for the investigators , told russian state television on sunday , november 29 .
the 14-carriage passenger train carrying nearly 700 people was jolted off the rails on the main line between moscow and russia 's second largest city , st. petersburg in what the authorities suspect was a bomb attack .
according to russia 's emergency situations ministry , the attack killed 25 and injured 104 , while 26 people remain missing .
markin said forensic experts had returned sunday morning to the scene of the explosion - a wooded area about 400 kilometers -lrb- 250 miles -rrb- northwest of the capital moscow - to continue their search for clues .
the question of responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extremists from conflict zones have been blamed for a string of attacks on civilian targets it remains unclear what motivated the attackers to strike the train , which is popular with well-off russians and foreign tourists .
a police spokesman expressed doubts about a message posted on the internet by a radical right-wing group claiming responsibility .
the chief of russia 's fsb security service had said earlier that the blast which derailed the train was caused by an improvised explosive device with the force of seven kilograms -lrb- 15 lbs . -rrb- of tnt .
interior minister rashid nurgaliyev had said police had evidence suggesting that several persons took part in the attack , and even gave a description of one of the suspects .
a second explosion occurred during rescue operations on saturday , but no one was injured .
grim task of identifying bodies meanwhile , the process of formally identifying bodies began on sunday in tver , a city between moscow and st. petersburg , and the regional capital of the area in which the train was attacked .
interfax news agency quoted a spokeswoman for the regional government as saying that 65 relatives of the train disaster victims were in tver to examine the corpses at a local morgue .
a government commission specially formed by prime minister vladimir putin to deal with the aftermath of the disaster was expected to meet later on sunday .
russian railways , the state company that oversees the country 's railroads , said in a statement that the movement of trains between moscow and st. petersburg had been " fully restored " as of sunday morning .
bildunterschrift : this is no the first bombing attack that has happened in russia past attacks against civilian targets the nevsky express was hit by a similar bomb attack in august 2007 , when 60 people were injured in an incident that continues to remain cloaked in mystery although it has been inconclusively linked to chechen separatists and russian ultranationalists .
forty-six people were killed and 160 injured as an explosion tore through a morning commuter train in russia 's southern fringe in december 2003 and , just months later , in february 2004 , a suicide bombing claimed 39 lives on an underground train in moscow .
extremists from conflict regions in the northern caucasus have been blamed for a string of attacks on other civilian targets in russia , including planes and a bus. rb / afpe / dpa / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was appointed to the post by former un secretary-general kofi annan in 2006 .
one of his department 's tasks is to provide support to the compliance regime of the kyoto protocol , the landmark pact for tackling greenhouse-gas emissions .
the un climate conference in copenhagen from december 7 - 18 will focus on an agreement to take effect after kyoto expires in 2012 .
deutsche welle : for a long time the un climate summit has been viewed as an all-or-nothing event .
is that what it still is ? de boer : i think so .
i think it is an all-or-nothing event in the sense that we need to see a number of things come together .
we need rich country emission reduction targets , individual targets for rich countries , secondly we need to know what china , india , brazil , major development countries , will do to lower the growth in emissions , thirdly we need prompt start financing to help developing countries engage .
fourthly we need a set of decisions that will make immediate action operational .
that all sounds very concrete .
in the press in the run-up to the conference there are all sorts of terms like outlines , pledges , frameworks , meaningful bids .
that does n't sound like what you are talking about .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvo de boer no , it does n't , but if i listen to what the danish prime minister is saying , he is the one who will be inviting heads of state and governments for the closing .
then if i listen to what connie hedegaard , the minister who will chair the conference , is saying and if i listen to myself , then at least the three of us are saying exactly the same thing .
the chinese appear to have seen the light regarding the need to de-carbonize their economy as much as possible so as not to despoil their environment .
but both the chinese and the indians have been arguing in recent years that they should have room for carbon-based industrial growth so they can provide their huge populations better living standards .
is there room for that any more ?
there has to be room for that .
china is changing its approach not only because of love of the environment and the fear of climate change , but also because i believe you can not continue to grow the chinese economy at the current pace in the current way .
there has to be a fundamental change .
and yes , to have to leave space for developing countries to grow .
in india , there are 400 million people that do n't even have access to electricity .
the goal of copenhagen should not be to keep people living under those circumstances .
so we will see growth in emissions in some countries .

he was appointed to the post by former un secretary-general kofi annan in 2006 .
one of his department 's tasks is to provide support to the compliance regime of the kyoto protocol , the landmark pact for tackling greenhouse-gas emissions .
the un climate conference in copenhagen from december 7 - 18 will focus on an agreement to take effect after kyoto expires in 2012 .
deutsche welle : for a long time the un climate summit has been viewed as an all-or-nothing event .
is that what it still is ? de boer : i think so .
i think it is an all-or-nothing event in the sense that we need to see a number of things come together .
we need rich country emission reduction targets , individual targets for rich countries , secondly we need to know what china , india , brazil , major development countries , will do to lower the growth in emissions , thirdly we need prompt start financing to help developing countries engage .
fourthly we need a set of decisions that will make immediate action operational .
that all sounds very concrete .
in the press in the run-up to the conference there are all sorts of terms like outlines , pledges , frameworks , meaningful bids .
that does n't sound like what you are talking about .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvo de boer no , it does n't , but if i listen to what the danish prime minister is saying , he is the one who will be inviting heads of state and governments for the closing .
then if i listen to what connie hedegaard , the minister who will chair the conference , is saying and if i listen to myself , then at least the three of us are saying exactly the same thing .
the chinese appear to have seen the light regarding the need to de-carbonize their economy as much as possible so as not to despoil their environment .
but both the chinese and the indians have been arguing in recent years that they should have room for carbon-based industrial growth so they can provide their huge populations better living standards .
is there room for that any more ?
there has to be room for that .
china is changing its approach not only because of love of the environment and the fear of climate change , but also because i believe you can not continue to grow the chinese economy at the current pace in the current way .
there has to be a fundamental change .
and yes , to have to leave space for developing countries to grow .
in india , there are 400 million people that do n't even have access to electricity .
the goal of copenhagen should not be to keep people living under those circumstances .
so we will see growth in emissions in some countries .

kristina koehler is a fresh face in german cabinet , and not just because she 's getting her first portfolio .
at 32 , she 's germany 's youngest cabinet minister and probably the only one who can use facebook without an aide . kristina koehler , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , was chosen as family minister on friday as part of a cabinet reshuffle .
koehler 's nomination is also no doubt aimed at improving the christian democrat 's profile among younger voters .
true to her generation , she can be found on the social networking site facebook and also posts on twitter .
tweeting on sunday , she said she was surprised by the focus on whether she would continue to use the internet application .
" i 'm not going to give up letter writing , either , " she wrote .
in her first interview since taking office , koehler told the bild am sonntag newspaper via email that she was n't about to abandon applications like twitter and facebook just because she had been promoted to cabinet .
she said although it was " absurd " to consider all of her 600 facebook contacts as friends , she found the site useful for spreading her political message .
career move until now , koehler , a member of the bundestag 's internal affairs committee , was mostly known for speaking out on topics such as extremism and the integration of foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen , koehler 's predecessor she takes over the family ministry from ursula von der leyen , who is moving into the labor ministry .
koehler is expected to continue her predecessor 's policies that aim to make child-rearing less expensive in germany .
but in other respects , koehler could n't be more different from von der leyen , a 51-year-old working mother of seven .
koehler joined the youth wing of the christian democrats at the age of 14 , already clear in her mind that she was destined for a career in politics .
now she is one of three relatively young ministers alongside fellow christian democrat defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , 38 , and health minister philipp roessler , 36 , from the pro-business free democrats. nw / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was appointed to the post by former un secretary-general kofi annan in 2006 .
one of his department 's tasks is to provide support to the compliance regime of the kyoto protocol , the landmark pact for tackling greenhouse-gas emissions .
the un climate conference in copenhagen from december 7 - 18 will focus on an agreement to take effect after kyoto expires in 2012 .
deutsche welle : for a long time the un climate summit has been viewed as an all-or-nothing event .
is that what it still is ? de boer : i think so .
i think it is an all-or-nothing event in the sense that we need to see a number of things come together .
we need rich country emission reduction targets , individual targets for rich countries , secondly we need to know what china , india , brazil , major development countries , will do to lower the growth in emissions , thirdly we need prompt start financing to help developing countries engage .
fourthly we need a set of decisions that will make immediate action operational .
that all sounds very concrete .

that does n't sound like what you are talking about .

the chinese appear to have seen the light regarding the need to de-carbonize their economy as much as possible so as not to despoil their environment .
but both the chinese and the indians have been arguing in recent years that they should have room for carbon-based industrial growth so they can provide their huge populations better living standards .
is there room for that any more ?
there has to be room for that .
china is changing its approach not only because of love of the environment and the fear of climate change , but also because i believe you can not continue to grow the chinese economy at the current pace in the current way .
there has to be a fundamental change .
and yes , to have to leave space for developing countries to grow .
in india , there are 400 million people that do n't even have access to electricity .
the goal of copenhagen should not be to keep people living under those circumstances .

he was appointed to the post by former un secretary-general kofi annan in 2006 .
one of his department 's tasks is to provide support to the compliance regime of the kyoto protocol , the landmark pact for tackling greenhouse-gas emissions .
the un climate conference in copenhagen from december 7 - 18 will focus on an agreement to take effect after kyoto expires in 2012 .
deutsche welle : for a long time the un climate summit has been viewed as an all-or-nothing event .
is that what it still is ? de boer : i think so .
i think it is an all-or-nothing event in the sense that we need to see a number of things come together .
we need rich country emission reduction targets , individual targets for rich countries , secondly we need to know what china , india , brazil , major development countries , will do to lower the growth in emissions , thirdly we need prompt start financing to help developing countries engage .
fourthly we need a set of decisions that will make immediate action operational .
that all sounds very concrete .
in the press in the run-up to the conference there are all sorts of terms like outlines , pledges , frameworks , meaningful bids .
that does n't sound like what you are talking about .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvo de boer no , it does n't , but if i listen to what the danish prime minister is saying , he is the one who will be inviting heads of state and governments for the closing .
then if i listen to what connie hedegaard , the minister who will chair the conference , is saying and if i listen to myself , then at least the three of us are saying exactly the same thing .
the chinese appear to have seen the light regarding the need to de-carbonize their economy as much as possible so as not to despoil their environment .
but both the chinese and the indians have been arguing in recent years that they should have room for carbon-based industrial growth so they can provide their huge populations better living standards .
is there room for that any more ?
there has to be room for that .
china is changing its approach not only because of love of the environment and the fear of climate change , but also because i believe you can not continue to grow the chinese economy at the current pace in the current way .
there has to be a fundamental change .
and yes , to have to leave space for developing countries to grow .
in india , there are 400 million people that do n't even have access to electricity .
the goal of copenhagen should not be to keep people living under those circumstances .
so we will see growth in emissions in some countries .

kristina koehler is a fresh face in german cabinet , and not just because she 's getting her first portfolio .
at 32 , she 's germany 's youngest cabinet minister and probably the only one who can use facebook without an aide . kristina koehler , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , was chosen as family minister on friday as part of a cabinet reshuffle .
koehler 's nomination is also no doubt aimed at improving the christian democrat 's profile among younger voters .
true to her generation , she can be found on the social networking site facebook and also posts on twitter .
tweeting on sunday , she said she was surprised by the focus on whether she would continue to use the internet application .
" i 'm not going to give up letter writing , either , " she wrote .
in her first interview since taking office , koehler told the bild am sonntag newspaper via email that she was n't about to abandon applications like twitter and facebook just because she had been promoted to cabinet .
she said although it was " absurd " to consider all of her 600 facebook contacts as friends , she found the site useful for spreading her political message .
career move until now , koehler , a member of the bundestag 's internal affairs committee , was mostly known for speaking out on topics such as extremism and the integration of foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen , koehler 's predecessor she takes over the family ministry from ursula von der leyen , who is moving into the labor ministry .
koehler is expected to continue her predecessor 's policies that aim to make child-rearing less expensive in germany .
but in other respects , koehler could n't be more different from von der leyen , a 51-year-old working mother of seven .
koehler joined the youth wing of the christian democrats at the age of 14 , already clear in her mind that she was destined for a career in politics .
now she is one of three relatively young ministers alongside fellow christian democrat defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , 38 , and health minister philipp roessler , 36 , from the pro-business free democrats. nw / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 29.11.2009 ukraine struggles to meet uefa deadline ahead of euro 2012 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is getting ready for its moment in the spotlight ukraine 's golden opportunity to host euro 2012 comes with great expectations and high pressure from uefa .
but will the country be able to meet uefa 's looming deadline ? ukraine has until november 30 to convince uefa that it is ready to host the 2012 european soccer championships .
with a projected figure of 1.3 million soccer fans expected to attend the championship , ukraine 's leadership has been scrambling to upgrade the infrastructure in its four host cities .
uefa president michael platini has said that there are huge infrastructure problems – stadiums need to be built or renovated and roads need to be repaired – which wstill need to be resolved in ukraine .
uefa earlier threatened to strip ukraine of its co-hosting rights with poland after it experienced difficulties in building infrastructure in preparation for the championship .
however michael platini has insisted " we will go to ukraine . "
but he has stressed that it is still unclear how many cities in the country will be deemed fit to host games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heavy construction is underway in ukraine 's major cities to build new stadiums for the soccer championship ukraine 's government is fervently pulling out all the stops to prepare for their hosting debut and has ordered entire cities be restored .
around the country , roads , stadiums , sports grounds and hotels are getting a facelift .
anticipation and excitement about the upcoming championship has unified ukraine 's government and its people .
the country has not sponsored a major sporting event since 1980 when ukraine co-hosted the olympic games as a part of the soviet union .
markian lubkivsky , chairman of ukraine 's euro 2012 organizing committee , has noted the effect that the opportunity to host euro 2012 has had on his country .
" for ukraine , the championship has helped us overcome identity problems , integrate better into the european community and deepen our relations with poland , " he said .
financing difficulties one factor which has complicated ukraine 's push to prepare for euro 2012 has been the strain caused by the international financial crisis .
state revenues are down 30 percent and ukraine ’ s leaders have traded accusations of breaking promises on financing for euro 2012 .
ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko said the government had only provided five percent of the $ 945 million it pledged to spend on the games in 2009 .
" the financing program for euro 2012 is under threat , " said the president .
" together with the central bank and finance ministry , we must find financial resources . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko has been severely critical of the financing initiatives for euro 2012 preparations the president was nonetheless also unhappy with an alternative , which was recently approved by ukraine 's parliament , to finance preparations for the championship , .
the new government financing bill stipulates that the country ’ s national bank must send the majority of its profits , about $ 800 million us , into a fund to finance euro 2012 .
president yushchenko has called that move " fiscally irresponsible " and has unsuccessfully tried to veto it .
many in ukraine 's government are , however , convinced that even in times as tough as these , the euro 2012 is a worthy investment .
ukraine 's sports minister yurii pavlenko has said that the championship will surely pay for itself . " i am sure that no matter how much money we put into the infrastructure , in the end we will be in the black , " said pavlenko .
" but the infrastructure ; the roads , stadiums , sports grounds and restored cities will be in good repair .
and that ’ s something we will have for much longer after the championship ... and i think that will take our culture to a new level . "
whether or not ukraine 's earnest preparations for euro 2012 will hit the mark and win uefa 's approval remains to be seen .
all eyes are on ukraine to see if the country will succeed in holding on to its winning bid to host euro 2012 .

but will the country be able to meet uefa 's looming deadline ? ukraine has until november 30 to convince uefa that it is ready to host the 2012 european soccer championships .
with a projected figure of 1.3 million soccer fans expected to attend the championship , ukraine 's leadership has been scrambling to upgrade the infrastructure in its four host cities .
uefa president michael platini has said that there are huge infrastructure problems – stadiums need to be built or renovated and roads need to be repaired – which wstill need to be resolved in ukraine .
uefa earlier threatened to strip ukraine of its co-hosting rights with poland after it experienced difficulties in building infrastructure in preparation for the championship .
however michael platini has insisted " we will go to ukraine . "
but he has stressed that it is still unclear how many cities in the country will be deemed fit to host games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heavy construction is underway in ukraine 's major cities to build new stadiums for the soccer championship ukraine 's government is fervently pulling out all the stops to prepare for their hosting debut and has ordered entire cities be restored .
around the country , roads , stadiums , sports grounds and hotels are getting a facelift .
anticipation and excitement about the upcoming championship has unified ukraine 's government and its people .
the country has not sponsored a major sporting event since 1980 when ukraine co-hosted the olympic games as a part of the soviet union .
markian lubkivsky , chairman of ukraine 's euro 2012 organizing committee , has noted the effect that the opportunity to host euro 2012 has had on his country .
" for ukraine , the championship has helped us overcome identity problems , integrate better into the european community and deepen our relations with poland , " he said .
financing difficulties one factor which has complicated ukraine 's push to prepare for euro 2012 has been the strain caused by the international financial crisis .
state revenues are down 30 percent and ukraine ’ s leaders have traded accusations of breaking promises on financing for euro 2012 .
ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko said the government had only provided five percent of the $ 945 million it pledged to spend on the games in 2009 .
" the financing program for euro 2012 is under threat , " said the president .
" together with the central bank and finance ministry , we must find financial resources . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko has been severely critical of the financing initiatives for euro 2012 preparations the president was nonetheless also unhappy with an alternative , which was recently approved by ukraine 's parliament , to finance preparations for the championship , .
the new government financing bill stipulates that the country ’ s national bank must send the majority of its profits , about $ 800 million us , into a fund to finance euro 2012 .
president yushchenko has called that move " fiscally irresponsible " and has unsuccessfully tried to veto it .
many in ukraine 's government are , however , convinced that even in times as tough as these , the euro 2012 is a worthy investment .
ukraine 's sports minister yurii pavlenko has said that the championship will surely pay for itself . " i am sure that no matter how much money we put into the infrastructure , in the end we will be in the black , " said pavlenko .
" but the infrastructure ; the roads , stadiums , sports grounds and restored cities will be in good repair .
and that ’ s something we will have for much longer after the championship ... and i think that will take our culture to a new level . "
whether or not ukraine 's earnest preparations for euro 2012 will hit the mark and win uefa 's approval remains to be seen .
all eyes are on ukraine to see if the country will succeed in holding on to its winning bid to host euro 2012 .

markian lubkivsky , chairman of ukraine 's euro 2012 organizing committee , has noted the effect that the opportunity to host euro 2012 has had on his country .
" for ukraine , the championship has helped us overcome identity problems , integrate better into the european community and deepen our relations with poland , " he said .
financing difficulties one factor which has complicated ukraine 's push to prepare for euro 2012 has been the strain caused by the international financial crisis .
state revenues are down 30 percent and ukraine ’ s leaders have traded accusations of breaking promises on financing for euro 2012 .
ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko said the government had only provided five percent of the $ 945 million it pledged to spend on the games in 2009 .
" the financing program for euro 2012 is under threat , " said the president .
" together with the central bank and finance ministry , we must find financial resources . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko has been severely critical of the financing initiatives for euro 2012 preparations the president was nonetheless also unhappy with an alternative , which was recently approved by ukraine 's parliament , to finance preparations for the championship , .
the new government financing bill stipulates that the country ’ s national bank must send the majority of its profits , about $ 800 million us , into a fund to finance euro 2012 .
president yushchenko has called that move " fiscally irresponsible " and has unsuccessfully tried to veto it .
many in ukraine 's government are , however , convinced that even in times as tough as these , the euro 2012 is a worthy investment .
ukraine 's sports minister yurii pavlenko has said that the championship will surely pay for itself . " i am sure that no matter how much money we put into the infrastructure , in the end we will be in the black , " said pavlenko .
" but the infrastructure ; the roads , stadiums , sports grounds and restored cities will be in good repair .
and that ’ s something we will have for much longer after the championship ... and i think that will take our culture to a new level . "
whether or not ukraine 's earnest preparations for euro 2012 will hit the mark and win uefa 's approval remains to be seen .
all eyes are on ukraine to see if the country will succeed in holding on to its winning bid to host euro 2012 .

but will the country be able to meet uefa 's looming deadline ? ukraine has until november 30 to convince uefa that it is ready to host the 2012 european soccer championships .
with a projected figure of 1.3 million soccer fans expected to attend the championship , ukraine 's leadership has been scrambling to upgrade the infrastructure in its four host cities .
uefa president michael platini has said that there are huge infrastructure problems – stadiums need to be built or renovated and roads need to be repaired – which wstill need to be resolved in ukraine .
uefa earlier threatened to strip ukraine of its co-hosting rights with poland after it experienced difficulties in building infrastructure in preparation for the championship .
however michael platini has insisted " we will go to ukraine . "
but he has stressed that it is still unclear how many cities in the country will be deemed fit to host games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heavy construction is underway in ukraine 's major cities to build new stadiums for the soccer championship ukraine 's government is fervently pulling out all the stops to prepare for their hosting debut and has ordered entire cities be restored .
around the country , roads , stadiums , sports grounds and hotels are getting a facelift .
anticipation and excitement about the upcoming championship has unified ukraine 's government and its people .
the country has not sponsored a major sporting event since 1980 when ukraine co-hosted the olympic games as a part of the soviet union .
markian lubkivsky , chairman of ukraine 's euro 2012 organizing committee , has noted the effect that the opportunity to host euro 2012 has had on his country .
" for ukraine , the championship has helped us overcome identity problems , integrate better into the european community and deepen our relations with poland , " he said .
financing difficulties one factor which has complicated ukraine 's push to prepare for euro 2012 has been the strain caused by the international financial crisis .
state revenues are down 30 percent and ukraine ’ s leaders have traded accusations of breaking promises on financing for euro 2012 .
ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko said the government had only provided five percent of the $ 945 million it pledged to spend on the games in 2009 .
" the financing program for euro 2012 is under threat , " said the president .
" together with the central bank and finance ministry , we must find financial resources . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko has been severely critical of the financing initiatives for euro 2012 preparations the president was nonetheless also unhappy with an alternative , which was recently approved by ukraine 's parliament , to finance preparations for the championship , .
the new government financing bill stipulates that the country ’ s national bank must send the majority of its profits , about $ 800 million us , into a fund to finance euro 2012 .
president yushchenko has called that move " fiscally irresponsible " and has unsuccessfully tried to veto it .
many in ukraine 's government are , however , convinced that even in times as tough as these , the euro 2012 is a worthy investment .
ukraine 's sports minister yurii pavlenko has said that the championship will surely pay for itself . " i am sure that no matter how much money we put into the infrastructure , in the end we will be in the black , " said pavlenko .
" but the infrastructure ; the roads , stadiums , sports grounds and restored cities will be in good repair .
and that ’ s something we will have for much longer after the championship ... and i think that will take our culture to a new level . "
whether or not ukraine 's earnest preparations for euro 2012 will hit the mark and win uefa 's approval remains to be seen .
all eyes are on ukraine to see if the country will succeed in holding on to its winning bid to host euro 2012 .

he was appointed to the post by former un secretary-general kofi annan in 2006 .
one of his department 's tasks is to provide support to the compliance regime of the kyoto protocol , the landmark pact for tackling greenhouse-gas emissions .
the un climate conference in copenhagen from december 7 - 18 will focus on an agreement to take effect after kyoto expires in 2012 .
deutsche welle : for a long time the un climate summit has been viewed as an all-or-nothing event .
is that what it still is ? de boer : i think so .

he was appointed to the post by former un secretary-general kofi annan in 2006 .
one of his department 's tasks is to provide support to the compliance regime of the kyoto protocol , the landmark pact for tackling greenhouse-gas emissions .
the un climate conference in copenhagen from december 7 - 18 will focus on an agreement to take effect after kyoto expires in 2012 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 29.11.2009 russia launches manhunt for train bombers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the train wreck has been linked to a terrorist bomb authorities are looking for the perpetrators of a train attack which killed at least 26 people , wounded more than 100 , and brought up fears of a new era of terrorism in the russian heartland . " an active investigative and operational effort is underway to identify and find the individuals involved in the crime , " vladimir markin , a spokesman for the investigators , told russian state television on sunday , november 29 .
the 14-carriage passenger train carrying nearly 700 people was jolted off the rails on the main line between moscow and russia 's second largest city , st. petersburg in what the authorities suspect was a bomb attack .
according to russia 's emergency situations ministry , the attack killed 25 and injured 104 , while 26 people remain missing .
markin said forensic experts had returned sunday morning to the scene of the explosion - a wooded area about 400 kilometers -lrb- 250 miles -rrb- northwest of the capital moscow - to continue their search for clues .
the question of responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extremists from conflict zones have been blamed for a string of attacks on civilian targets it remains unclear what motivated the attackers to strike the train , which is popular with well-off russians and foreign tourists .
a police spokesman expressed doubts about a message posted on the internet by a radical right-wing group claiming responsibility .
the chief of russia 's fsb security service had said earlier that the blast which derailed the train was caused by an improvised explosive device with the force of seven kilograms -lrb- 15 lbs . -rrb- of tnt .
interior minister rashid nurgaliyev had said police had evidence suggesting that several persons took part in the attack , and even gave a description of one of the suspects .
a second explosion occurred during rescue operations on saturday , but no one was injured .
grim task of identifying bodies meanwhile , the process of formally identifying bodies began on sunday in tver , a city between moscow and st. petersburg , and the regional capital of the area in which the train was attacked .
interfax news agency quoted a spokeswoman for the regional government as saying that 65 relatives of the train disaster victims were in tver to examine the corpses at a local morgue .
a government commission specially formed by prime minister vladimir putin to deal with the aftermath of the disaster was expected to meet later on sunday .
russian railways , the state company that oversees the country 's railroads , said in a statement that the movement of trains between moscow and st. petersburg had been " fully restored " as of sunday morning .
bildunterschrift : this is no the first bombing attack that has happened in russia past attacks against civilian targets the nevsky express was hit by a similar bomb attack in august 2007 , when 60 people were injured in an incident that continues to remain cloaked in mystery although it has been inconclusively linked to chechen separatists and russian ultranationalists .
forty-six people were killed and 160 injured as an explosion tore through a morning commuter train in russia 's southern fringe in december 2003 and , just months later , in february 2004 , a suicide bombing claimed 39 lives on an underground train in moscow .
extremists from conflict regions in the northern caucasus have been blamed for a string of attacks on other civilian targets in russia , including planes and a bus. rb / afpe / dpa / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kristina koehler is a fresh face in german cabinet , and not just because she 's getting her first portfolio .
at 32 , she 's germany 's youngest cabinet minister and probably the only one who can use facebook without an aide . kristina koehler , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , was chosen as family minister on friday as part of a cabinet reshuffle .
koehler 's nomination is also no doubt aimed at improving the christian democrat 's profile among younger voters .
true to her generation , she can be found on the social networking site facebook and also posts on twitter .
tweeting on sunday , she said she was surprised by the focus on whether she would continue to use the internet application .
" i 'm not going to give up letter writing , either , " she wrote .
in her first interview since taking office , koehler told the bild am sonntag newspaper via email that she was n't about to abandon applications like twitter and facebook just because she had been promoted to cabinet .
she said although it was " absurd " to consider all of her 600 facebook contacts as friends , she found the site useful for spreading her political message .
career move until now , koehler , a member of the bundestag 's internal affairs committee , was mostly known for speaking out on topics such as extremism and the integration of foreigners .

koehler is expected to continue her predecessor 's policies that aim to make child-rearing less expensive in germany .
but in other respects , koehler could n't be more different from von der leyen , a 51-year-old working mother of seven .
koehler joined the youth wing of the christian democrats at the age of 14 , already clear in her mind that she was destined for a career in politics .
now she is one of three relatively young ministers alongside fellow christian democrat defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , 38 , and health minister philipp roessler , 36 , from the pro-business free democrats. nw / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" an active investigative and operational effort is underway to identify and find the individuals involved in the crime , " vladimir markin , a spokesman for the investigators , told russian state television on sunday , november 29 .
the 14-carriage passenger train carrying nearly 700 people was jolted off the rails on the main line between moscow and russia 's second largest city , st. petersburg in what the authorities suspect was a bomb attack .
according to russia 's emergency situations ministry , the attack killed 25 and injured 104 , while 26 people remain missing .

the chief of russia 's fsb security service had said earlier that the blast which derailed the train was caused by an improvised explosive device with the force of seven kilograms -lrb- 15 lbs . -rrb- of tnt .
interior minister rashid nurgaliyev had said police had evidence suggesting that several persons took part in the attack , and even gave a description of one of the suspects .
a second explosion occurred during rescue operations on saturday , but no one was injured .
grim task of identifying bodies meanwhile , the process of formally identifying bodies began on sunday in tver , a city between moscow and st. petersburg , and the regional capital of the area in which the train was attacked .
interfax news agency quoted a spokeswoman for the regional government as saying that 65 relatives of the train disaster victims were in tver to examine the corpses at a local morgue .
a government commission specially formed by prime minister vladimir putin to deal with the aftermath of the disaster was expected to meet later on sunday .

" an active investigative and operational effort is underway to identify and find the individuals involved in the crime , " vladimir markin , a spokesman for the investigators , told russian state television on sunday , november 29 .
the 14-carriage passenger train carrying nearly 700 people was jolted off the rails on the main line between moscow and russia 's second largest city , st. petersburg in what the authorities suspect was a bomb attack .
according to russia 's emergency situations ministry , the attack killed 25 and injured 104 , while 26 people remain missing .
markin said forensic experts had returned sunday morning to the scene of the explosion - a wooded area about 400 kilometers -lrb- 250 miles -rrb- northwest of the capital moscow - to continue their search for clues .
the question of responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extremists from conflict zones have been blamed for a string of attacks on civilian targets it remains unclear what motivated the attackers to strike the train , which is popular with well-off russians and foreign tourists .
a police spokesman expressed doubts about a message posted on the internet by a radical right-wing group claiming responsibility .
the chief of russia 's fsb security service had said earlier that the blast which derailed the train was caused by an improvised explosive device with the force of seven kilograms -lrb- 15 lbs . -rrb- of tnt .
interior minister rashid nurgaliyev had said police had evidence suggesting that several persons took part in the attack , and even gave a description of one of the suspects .
a second explosion occurred during rescue operations on saturday , but no one was injured .
grim task of identifying bodies meanwhile , the process of formally identifying bodies began on sunday in tver , a city between moscow and st. petersburg , and the regional capital of the area in which the train was attacked .
interfax news agency quoted a spokeswoman for the regional government as saying that 65 relatives of the train disaster victims were in tver to examine the corpses at a local morgue .
a government commission specially formed by prime minister vladimir putin to deal with the aftermath of the disaster was expected to meet later on sunday .
russian railways , the state company that oversees the country 's railroads , said in a statement that the movement of trains between moscow and st. petersburg had been " fully restored " as of sunday morning .
bildunterschrift : this is no the first bombing attack that has happened in russia past attacks against civilian targets the nevsky express was hit by a similar bomb attack in august 2007 , when 60 people were injured in an incident that continues to remain cloaked in mystery although it has been inconclusively linked to chechen separatists and russian ultranationalists .
forty-six people were killed and 160 injured as an explosion tore through a morning commuter train in russia 's southern fringe in december 2003 and , just months later , in february 2004 , a suicide bombing claimed 39 lives on an underground train in moscow .
extremists from conflict regions in the northern caucasus have been blamed for a string of attacks on other civilian targets in russia , including planes and a bus. rb / afpe / dpa / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 29.11.2009 in russian arctic , global warming threatens traditional way of life großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 'll soon get colder again , some russian scientists say russian scientists have doubts over whether global warming is here to stay and whether it 's man made .
but for the saami in russia 's north , the mild winters already pose a threat to their traditional way of life . all around the arctic , the effects of a temperature rise are visible , and native inhabitants of the tundras in europa , asia and north america are struggling with the new reality .
that 's also true for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula , an area bordering on norway and finnish lapland .
but , in russia , climate change is not a hot-button issue , nor is much attention being paid to the upcoming climate summit in copenhagen .
russian scientists say they have no evidence that global warming is a long-term trend , and doubt whether it is a man-made phenomenon . a little ice age ?
in the country 's northern port in the town of murmansk , the marine biological institute of the russian academy of sciences monitors life in and around the barents sea .
the institute has amassed an impressive database concerning temperature and salinity of the sea over the course of the 20th century .
referring to the statistics , biologist pavel makarevich says there are clear cycles during which both temperature and salinity rise and fall . these cycles , he says , are related to solar activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murmansk is russia 's gateway to the arctic waters " in my opinion and that of our institute , the problems connected to the current stage of warming are being exaggerated , " he says .
" what we are dealing with is not a global warming of the atmosphere or of the oceans . "
makarevich expects a normalization of arctic temperatures in the coming years .
this view appears to have the support of a growing number of russian scientists .
some even predict a temporary cooling of temperatures towards the middle of this century , a phenomenon known as a " little ice age . "
shorter winters but for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula between the barents and the white sea , a drop in temperature is urgently needed .
over the last few years , the winters have become milder and milder , threatening the traditional lifestyle of the saami .
this year again , the onset of winter was late in northern russia .
normally , the tundra would already be covered by a deep layer of snow , and the numerous lakes would have a thick layer of ice .
but snow cover is minimal and some of the lakes are not even frozen yet .
for native reindeer herders , that 's a problem , because the traditional slaughter season has to be postponed .
" the slaughter used to start in early november , " says herder nikolai filippov .
" at that time , the ice is usually strong enough to carry the reindeer .
but over the past few years , the ice has been weak and sparse , so we can not travel , and the slaughter has to be postponed until just before the new year .
this year , yields will be minimal . "
each fall , the big reindeer herds are somewhere on the vast expanses of the kola peninsula .
at the onset of winter , they have to be found and driven to lovozero , the center of the russian saami community .
but that can only happen under true winter conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indigenous saami people depend on reindeer for their living " last year it was exactly the same .
this year we do not know yet how the herds are , and what will happen later in the autumn , " filippov says .
" sometimes it is still raining around the new year , and you can not go over bare ice with the reindeer .
so then you will have to wait until after the new year .
in fact , the winter only starts in january .
for now it is a mixture of frost and thaw . "
the capricious weather has all kinds of practical consequences for the everyday life of the saami .
nikolai filippov and his wife maria live in a chum , a traditional saami tipi-like tent with a hole in the top to let out the smoke .
maria used to prepare lots of food for the winter .
but now that is out of the question , because the thaw often comes in the middle of winter and the meat can no longer be preserved .
the tundra is no longer a reliable natural refrigerator .
" in the old days it never rained in december , " says maria filippova .
" when it rains in winter , the snow disappears and we ca n't move on with our animals to search for reindeer moss . "
for thousands of years , the saami lived according to an ancient and extremely reliable calendar .
but today , says nikolai filippov , everything seems to be off course .
for him , there is no question that nature is changing .
what is happening in the tundra today is something the 59-year-old has never seen before .
the arctic as a future trading route the city of murmansk , a few hours ' drive to the north , seems a world away .
in the harbor , there 's the lenin - the first soviet nuclear-powered icebreaker built in the 1950s .
today , the heavy vessel is a museum .
andrei smirnov was the lenin 's last captain when the ship was retired in 1989 .
" no other country has boundaries like russia that stretch so far to the north , " smirnov says .
he is convinced that russia will need icebreakers like this one , now and in the future .
" we have been using the northern passage since 1932 .
it is a sea route of national significance , and since 1991 , foreign ships have also been allowed to use it .
this year as well , foreigners have used the passage , and we have successfully guided them through with our icebreakers . "
smirnov is referring to ships belonging to the german company beluga .
earlier this year , they made an impressive voyage from south korea to rotterdam , via the arctic seas north of russia .
bildunterschrift : this year , two ships from the german company , beluga , completed the trip around russia 's north .
the northern passage could become an alternative to existing routes the trip was meant to prove that the north pole ice is retreating as a result of global warming , and that the northern passage could become an attractive , much shorter alternative for existing routes like the one via the suez canal .
it sounds great , but longtime members of russia 's northern fleet , such as nikolai babich , can only laugh at the thought ..
" saying that one could navigate in the polar seas without the help of icebreakers , or even reach the north pole unhindered , no , that is not serious , " says babich .
babich feels at home in the russian arctic .
he has visited almost every corner of it during the last 40 years , and he claims there is no-one like him who has studied the area in such detail .
the recent rise in global temperature has surprised neither him nor his colleagues .
it has happened in the past , he says , and it will happen again .
" the natural processes we have seen during the past decade are mainly the result of the sun 's activity .
they show a slight increase in temperature , and as a result , arctic ice has receded , " he says .
but according to babich , the situation is changing .
the arctic , he says , is already cooling , not warming .
and the russian government is attentively listening to those scientists who , like babich , are predicting a cold spell .

but if europe is not to lose ground , the opinion of experts in europe and china is that the eu should at least try and match us offers of cooperation and trump them with actual concrete action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china wants the eu to get its act together as a partner " during a high level meeting in beijing last week , we got a very clear signal from the chinese leadership , " holslag told deutsche welle .
" premier wen jiabao and state counselor dai bingguo explained that china attaches a lot of importance to cooperation with europe and that it should not worry about a g2 .
but for the chinese , the ball is in our court now .
they want us to prove that we can get our act together and come up with a pragmatic agenda for cooperation .
if the eu can add no value to china 's essentially commercial relations with individual member states , there will not be a strategic partnership . " paul lim , a senior academic adviser at the european institute for asian studies in brussels , said that china would pick up on any concern within europe in relation to its position as a partner and could possibly play the eu and us off against each other .
but he also said china needs both powers for very different reasons . " the us , with its history of relations with asia , its presence in asia makes it a more important partner than the eu , " lim told deutsche welle .
" the eu with its soft power which it can use to great influence is still young , and is new in the game .
it all boils down to how much of a common voice the eu projects .
china will want an ally on certain issues with the eu in relation to the us and the eu will want an ally in the us on certain issues with china .
i do not see the eu losing any influence with china and i 'm sure that the us and eu will not allow china to play them against each other . "
obama 's pragmatism could bode ill for eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has opened the path to greater dialogue with beijing president obama 's visit was the first example of the current administration 's desire to engage with china and the importance it attached to china and the wider asian region as a key strategic partner .
while there were few breakthroughs to make the europeans nervous , obama came away from beijing with the paths to dialog firmly open and as such , moved the us into a position which could undermine europe 's influence in future . " chinese aid is much needed to keep the american economy afloat and to stabilize afghanistan , " holslag said .
" this has cautioned obama during his visit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 29.11.2009 in russian arctic , global warming threatens traditional way of life großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 'll soon get colder again , some russian scientists say russian scientists have doubts over whether global warming is here to stay and whether it 's man made .
but for the saami in russia 's north , the mild winters already pose a threat to their traditional way of life . all around the arctic , the effects of a temperature rise are visible , and native inhabitants of the tundras in europa , asia and north america are struggling with the new reality .
that 's also true for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula , an area bordering on norway and finnish lapland .
but , in russia , climate change is not a hot-button issue , nor is much attention being paid to the upcoming climate summit in copenhagen .
russian scientists say they have no evidence that global warming is a long-term trend , and doubt whether it is a man-made phenomenon . a little ice age ?
in the country 's northern port in the town of murmansk , the marine biological institute of the russian academy of sciences monitors life in and around the barents sea .
the institute has amassed an impressive database concerning temperature and salinity of the sea over the course of the 20th century .
referring to the statistics , biologist pavel makarevich says there are clear cycles during which both temperature and salinity rise and fall . these cycles , he says , are related to solar activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murmansk is russia 's gateway to the arctic waters " in my opinion and that of our institute , the problems connected to the current stage of warming are being exaggerated , " he says .
" what we are dealing with is not a global warming of the atmosphere or of the oceans . "
makarevich expects a normalization of arctic temperatures in the coming years .
this view appears to have the support of a growing number of russian scientists .
some even predict a temporary cooling of temperatures towards the middle of this century , a phenomenon known as a " little ice age . "
shorter winters but for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula between the barents and the white sea , a drop in temperature is urgently needed .
over the last few years , the winters have become milder and milder , threatening the traditional lifestyle of the saami .
this year again , the onset of winter was late in northern russia .
normally , the tundra would already be covered by a deep layer of snow , and the numerous lakes would have a thick layer of ice .
but snow cover is minimal and some of the lakes are not even frozen yet .
for native reindeer herders , that 's a problem , because the traditional slaughter season has to be postponed .
" the slaughter used to start in early november , " says herder nikolai filippov .
" at that time , the ice is usually strong enough to carry the reindeer .
but over the past few years , the ice has been weak and sparse , so we can not travel , and the slaughter has to be postponed until just before the new year .
this year , yields will be minimal . "
each fall , the big reindeer herds are somewhere on the vast expanses of the kola peninsula .
at the onset of winter , they have to be found and driven to lovozero , the center of the russian saami community .
but that can only happen under true winter conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indigenous saami people depend on reindeer for their living " last year it was exactly the same .
this year we do not know yet how the herds are , and what will happen later in the autumn , " filippov says .
" sometimes it is still raining around the new year , and you can not go over bare ice with the reindeer .
so then you will have to wait until after the new year .
in fact , the winter only starts in january .
for now it is a mixture of frost and thaw . "
the capricious weather has all kinds of practical consequences for the everyday life of the saami .
nikolai filippov and his wife maria live in a chum , a traditional saami tipi-like tent with a hole in the top to let out the smoke .
maria used to prepare lots of food for the winter .
but now that is out of the question , because the thaw often comes in the middle of winter and the meat can no longer be preserved .
the tundra is no longer a reliable natural refrigerator .
" in the old days it never rained in december , " says maria filippova .
" when it rains in winter , the snow disappears and we ca n't move on with our animals to search for reindeer moss . "
for thousands of years , the saami lived according to an ancient and extremely reliable calendar .
but today , says nikolai filippov , everything seems to be off course .
for him , there is no question that nature is changing .
what is happening in the tundra today is something the 59-year-old has never seen before .
the arctic as a future trading route the city of murmansk , a few hours ' drive to the north , seems a world away .
in the harbor , there 's the lenin - the first soviet nuclear-powered icebreaker built in the 1950s .
today , the heavy vessel is a museum .
andrei smirnov was the lenin 's last captain when the ship was retired in 1989 .
" no other country has boundaries like russia that stretch so far to the north , " smirnov says .
he is convinced that russia will need icebreakers like this one , now and in the future .
" we have been using the northern passage since 1932 .
it is a sea route of national significance , and since 1991 , foreign ships have also been allowed to use it .
this year as well , foreigners have used the passage , and we have successfully guided them through with our icebreakers . "
smirnov is referring to ships belonging to the german company beluga .
earlier this year , they made an impressive voyage from south korea to rotterdam , via the arctic seas north of russia .
bildunterschrift : this year , two ships from the german company , beluga , completed the trip around russia 's north .
the northern passage could become an alternative to existing routes the trip was meant to prove that the north pole ice is retreating as a result of global warming , and that the northern passage could become an attractive , much shorter alternative for existing routes like the one via the suez canal .
it sounds great , but longtime members of russia 's northern fleet , such as nikolai babich , can only laugh at the thought ..
" saying that one could navigate in the polar seas without the help of icebreakers , or even reach the north pole unhindered , no , that is not serious , " says babich .
babich feels at home in the russian arctic .
he has visited almost every corner of it during the last 40 years , and he claims there is no-one like him who has studied the area in such detail .
the recent rise in global temperature has surprised neither him nor his colleagues .
it has happened in the past , he says , and it will happen again .
" the natural processes we have seen during the past decade are mainly the result of the sun 's activity .
they show a slight increase in temperature , and as a result , arctic ice has receded , " he says .
but according to babich , the situation is changing .
the arctic , he says , is already cooling , not warming .
and the russian government is attentively listening to those scientists who , like babich , are predicting a cold spell .

but if europe is not to lose ground , the opinion of experts in europe and china is that the eu should at least try and match us offers of cooperation and trump them with actual concrete action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china wants the eu to get its act together as a partner " during a high level meeting in beijing last week , we got a very clear signal from the chinese leadership , " holslag told deutsche welle .
" premier wen jiabao and state counselor dai bingguo explained that china attaches a lot of importance to cooperation with europe and that it should not worry about a g2 .
but for the chinese , the ball is in our court now .
they want us to prove that we can get our act together and come up with a pragmatic agenda for cooperation .
if the eu can add no value to china 's essentially commercial relations with individual member states , there will not be a strategic partnership . " paul lim , a senior academic adviser at the european institute for asian studies in brussels , said that china would pick up on any concern within europe in relation to its position as a partner and could possibly play the eu and us off against each other .
but he also said china needs both powers for very different reasons . " the us , with its history of relations with asia , its presence in asia makes it a more important partner than the eu , " lim told deutsche welle .
" the eu with its soft power which it can use to great influence is still young , and is new in the game .
it all boils down to how much of a common voice the eu projects .
china will want an ally on certain issues with the eu in relation to the us and the eu will want an ally in the us on certain issues with china .
i do not see the eu losing any influence with china and i 'm sure that the us and eu will not allow china to play them against each other . "
obama 's pragmatism could bode ill for eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has opened the path to greater dialogue with beijing president obama 's visit was the first example of the current administration 's desire to engage with china and the importance it attached to china and the wider asian region as a key strategic partner .
while there were few breakthroughs to make the europeans nervous , obama came away from beijing with the paths to dialog firmly open and as such , moved the us into a position which could undermine europe 's influence in future . " chinese aid is much needed to keep the american economy afloat and to stabilize afghanistan , " holslag said .
" this has cautioned obama during his visit .
if the united states continues to opt for more pragmatism , this would certainly weaken europe 's bargaining position when it comes to human rights , economic liberalization and other challenges . "
to lag behind in relations and cooperation with the chinese could be damaging to the eu .
china 's new global influence through investment in africa and elsewhere , its growing economic muscle and its position as a major player in global issues such as iran and north korea , as well as climate change , makes the people 's republic a partner to neglect at peril . lack of action damaging eu reputation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen jinbao wants to see more action from barrosso 's eu what could prove damaging is china 's concern that the eu can talk a good partnership but is showing a lack of commitment when it comes to putting these words into practice in areas where eu-sino relations have been traditionally strong .

" but let us not forget that the pro-europe camp in beijing is losing ground .
leaders like premier wen have come under quite a lot of pressure from political hardliners and the public opinion .
china has become less tolerant of european lecturing .
as a result , we might even expect more chinese criticism on the eu 's weak performance in the combat against climate change , its deplorable economic situation or its lack of political coherence . " despite the uncertain climate between europe and china , paul lim believes that the current level of financial commitment and strategic cooperation between the two powers is enough to look towards the future with guarded optimism . " the future of eu-china cooperation depends on maturity of relations , of respect , of being able to accept criticisms , and an understanding of each other 's culture . " said lim .
" however , right now , there has to be a certain degree of closeness , of trust and confidence for the eu to put its money into china .
the two powers are also coming closer on climate change as its effects are felt in china and we can not deny that china is doing something about it even if we think it is not enough .
but the big question is how mature the relationship is .
this is another matter . " author : nick amies editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but for the saami in russia 's north , the mild winters already pose a threat to their traditional way of life . all around the arctic , the effects of a temperature rise are visible , and native inhabitants of the tundras in europa , asia and north america are struggling with the new reality .
that 's also true for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula , an area bordering on norway and finnish lapland .
but , in russia , climate change is not a hot-button issue , nor is much attention being paid to the upcoming climate summit in copenhagen .
russian scientists say they have no evidence that global warming is a long-term trend , and doubt whether it is a man-made phenomenon . a little ice age ?
in the country 's northern port in the town of murmansk , the marine biological institute of the russian academy of sciences monitors life in and around the barents sea .
the institute has amassed an impressive database concerning temperature and salinity of the sea over the course of the 20th century .
referring to the statistics , biologist pavel makarevich says there are clear cycles during which both temperature and salinity rise and fall . these cycles , he says , are related to solar activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murmansk is russia 's gateway to the arctic waters " in my opinion and that of our institute , the problems connected to the current stage of warming are being exaggerated , " he says .
" what we are dealing with is not a global warming of the atmosphere or of the oceans . "
makarevich expects a normalization of arctic temperatures in the coming years .
this view appears to have the support of a growing number of russian scientists .
some even predict a temporary cooling of temperatures towards the middle of this century , a phenomenon known as a " little ice age . "
shorter winters but for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula between the barents and the white sea , a drop in temperature is urgently needed .
over the last few years , the winters have become milder and milder , threatening the traditional lifestyle of the saami .
this year again , the onset of winter was late in northern russia .
normally , the tundra would already be covered by a deep layer of snow , and the numerous lakes would have a thick layer of ice .
but snow cover is minimal and some of the lakes are not even frozen yet .
for native reindeer herders , that 's a problem , because the traditional slaughter season has to be postponed .
" the slaughter used to start in early november , " says herder nikolai filippov .
" at that time , the ice is usually strong enough to carry the reindeer .
but over the past few years , the ice has been weak and sparse , so we can not travel , and the slaughter has to be postponed until just before the new year .
this year , yields will be minimal . "
each fall , the big reindeer herds are somewhere on the vast expanses of the kola peninsula .
at the onset of winter , they have to be found and driven to lovozero , the center of the russian saami community .
but that can only happen under true winter conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indigenous saami people depend on reindeer for their living " last year it was exactly the same .
this year we do not know yet how the herds are , and what will happen later in the autumn , " filippov says .
" sometimes it is still raining around the new year , and you can not go over bare ice with the reindeer .
so then you will have to wait until after the new year .
in fact , the winter only starts in january .
for now it is a mixture of frost and thaw . "
the capricious weather has all kinds of practical consequences for the everyday life of the saami .
nikolai filippov and his wife maria live in a chum , a traditional saami tipi-like tent with a hole in the top to let out the smoke .
maria used to prepare lots of food for the winter .
but now that is out of the question , because the thaw often comes in the middle of winter and the meat can no longer be preserved .
the tundra is no longer a reliable natural refrigerator .
" in the old days it never rained in december , " says maria filippova .
" when it rains in winter , the snow disappears and we ca n't move on with our animals to search for reindeer moss . "
for thousands of years , the saami lived according to an ancient and extremely reliable calendar .
but today , says nikolai filippov , everything seems to be off course .
for him , there is no question that nature is changing .
what is happening in the tundra today is something the 59-year-old has never seen before .
the arctic as a future trading route the city of murmansk , a few hours ' drive to the north , seems a world away .
in the harbor , there 's the lenin - the first soviet nuclear-powered icebreaker built in the 1950s .
today , the heavy vessel is a museum .
andrei smirnov was the lenin 's last captain when the ship was retired in 1989 .
" no other country has boundaries like russia that stretch so far to the north , " smirnov says .
he is convinced that russia will need icebreakers like this one , now and in the future .
" we have been using the northern passage since 1932 .
it is a sea route of national significance , and since 1991 , foreign ships have also been allowed to use it .
this year as well , foreigners have used the passage , and we have successfully guided them through with our icebreakers . "
smirnov is referring to ships belonging to the german company beluga .
earlier this year , they made an impressive voyage from south korea to rotterdam , via the arctic seas north of russia .
bildunterschrift : this year , two ships from the german company , beluga , completed the trip around russia 's north .
the northern passage could become an alternative to existing routes the trip was meant to prove that the north pole ice is retreating as a result of global warming , and that the northern passage could become an attractive , much shorter alternative for existing routes like the one via the suez canal .
it sounds great , but longtime members of russia 's northern fleet , such as nikolai babich , can only laugh at the thought ..
" saying that one could navigate in the polar seas without the help of icebreakers , or even reach the north pole unhindered , no , that is not serious , " says babich .
babich feels at home in the russian arctic .
he has visited almost every corner of it during the last 40 years , and he claims there is no-one like him who has studied the area in such detail .
the recent rise in global temperature has surprised neither him nor his colleagues .
it has happened in the past , he says , and it will happen again .
" the natural processes we have seen during the past decade are mainly the result of the sun 's activity .
they show a slight increase in temperature , and as a result , arctic ice has receded , " he says .
but according to babich , the situation is changing .
the arctic , he says , is already cooling , not warming .
and the russian government is attentively listening to those scientists who , like babich , are predicting a cold spell .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 29.11.2009 in russian arctic , global warming threatens traditional way of life großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 'll soon get colder again , some russian scientists say russian scientists have doubts over whether global warming is here to stay and whether it 's man made .
but for the saami in russia 's north , the mild winters already pose a threat to their traditional way of life . all around the arctic , the effects of a temperature rise are visible , and native inhabitants of the tundras in europa , asia and north america are struggling with the new reality .
that 's also true for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula , an area bordering on norway and finnish lapland .
but , in russia , climate change is not a hot-button issue , nor is much attention being paid to the upcoming climate summit in copenhagen .
russian scientists say they have no evidence that global warming is a long-term trend , and doubt whether it is a man-made phenomenon . a little ice age ?
in the country 's northern port in the town of murmansk , the marine biological institute of the russian academy of sciences monitors life in and around the barents sea .
the institute has amassed an impressive database concerning temperature and salinity of the sea over the course of the 20th century .
referring to the statistics , biologist pavel makarevich says there are clear cycles during which both temperature and salinity rise and fall . these cycles , he says , are related to solar activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murmansk is russia 's gateway to the arctic waters " in my opinion and that of our institute , the problems connected to the current stage of warming are being exaggerated , " he says .
" what we are dealing with is not a global warming of the atmosphere or of the oceans . "
makarevich expects a normalization of arctic temperatures in the coming years .
this view appears to have the support of a growing number of russian scientists .
some even predict a temporary cooling of temperatures towards the middle of this century , a phenomenon known as a " little ice age . "
shorter winters but for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula between the barents and the white sea , a drop in temperature is urgently needed .
over the last few years , the winters have become milder and milder , threatening the traditional lifestyle of the saami .
this year again , the onset of winter was late in northern russia .
normally , the tundra would already be covered by a deep layer of snow , and the numerous lakes would have a thick layer of ice .
but snow cover is minimal and some of the lakes are not even frozen yet .
for native reindeer herders , that 's a problem , because the traditional slaughter season has to be postponed .
" the slaughter used to start in early november , " says herder nikolai filippov .
" at that time , the ice is usually strong enough to carry the reindeer .
but over the past few years , the ice has been weak and sparse , so we can not travel , and the slaughter has to be postponed until just before the new year .
this year , yields will be minimal . "
each fall , the big reindeer herds are somewhere on the vast expanses of the kola peninsula .
at the onset of winter , they have to be found and driven to lovozero , the center of the russian saami community .
but that can only happen under true winter conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indigenous saami people depend on reindeer for their living " last year it was exactly the same .
this year we do not know yet how the herds are , and what will happen later in the autumn , " filippov says .
" sometimes it is still raining around the new year , and you can not go over bare ice with the reindeer .
so then you will have to wait until after the new year .
in fact , the winter only starts in january .
for now it is a mixture of frost and thaw . "
the capricious weather has all kinds of practical consequences for the everyday life of the saami .
nikolai filippov and his wife maria live in a chum , a traditional saami tipi-like tent with a hole in the top to let out the smoke .
maria used to prepare lots of food for the winter .
but now that is out of the question , because the thaw often comes in the middle of winter and the meat can no longer be preserved .
the tundra is no longer a reliable natural refrigerator .
" in the old days it never rained in december , " says maria filippova .
" when it rains in winter , the snow disappears and we ca n't move on with our animals to search for reindeer moss . "
for thousands of years , the saami lived according to an ancient and extremely reliable calendar .
but today , says nikolai filippov , everything seems to be off course .
for him , there is no question that nature is changing .
what is happening in the tundra today is something the 59-year-old has never seen before .
the arctic as a future trading route the city of murmansk , a few hours ' drive to the north , seems a world away .
in the harbor , there 's the lenin - the first soviet nuclear-powered icebreaker built in the 1950s .
today , the heavy vessel is a museum .
andrei smirnov was the lenin 's last captain when the ship was retired in 1989 .
" no other country has boundaries like russia that stretch so far to the north , " smirnov says .
he is convinced that russia will need icebreakers like this one , now and in the future .
" we have been using the northern passage since 1932 .
it is a sea route of national significance , and since 1991 , foreign ships have also been allowed to use it .
this year as well , foreigners have used the passage , and we have successfully guided them through with our icebreakers . "
smirnov is referring to ships belonging to the german company beluga .
earlier this year , they made an impressive voyage from south korea to rotterdam , via the arctic seas north of russia .
bildunterschrift : this year , two ships from the german company , beluga , completed the trip around russia 's north .
the northern passage could become an alternative to existing routes the trip was meant to prove that the north pole ice is retreating as a result of global warming , and that the northern passage could become an attractive , much shorter alternative for existing routes like the one via the suez canal .
it sounds great , but longtime members of russia 's northern fleet , such as nikolai babich , can only laugh at the thought ..
" saying that one could navigate in the polar seas without the help of icebreakers , or even reach the north pole unhindered , no , that is not serious , " says babich .
babich feels at home in the russian arctic .
he has visited almost every corner of it during the last 40 years , and he claims there is no-one like him who has studied the area in such detail .
the recent rise in global temperature has surprised neither him nor his colleagues .
it has happened in the past , he says , and it will happen again .
" the natural processes we have seen during the past decade are mainly the result of the sun 's activity .
they show a slight increase in temperature , and as a result , arctic ice has receded , " he says .
but according to babich , the situation is changing .
the arctic , he says , is already cooling , not warming .
and the russian government is attentively listening to those scientists who , like babich , are predicting a cold spell .

but if europe is not to lose ground , the opinion of experts in europe and china is that the eu should at least try and match us offers of cooperation and trump them with actual concrete action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china wants the eu to get its act together as a partner " during a high level meeting in beijing last week , we got a very clear signal from the chinese leadership , " holslag told deutsche welle .
" premier wen jiabao and state counselor dai bingguo explained that china attaches a lot of importance to cooperation with europe and that it should not worry about a g2 .
but for the chinese , the ball is in our court now .
they want us to prove that we can get our act together and come up with a pragmatic agenda for cooperation .
if the eu can add no value to china 's essentially commercial relations with individual member states , there will not be a strategic partnership . " paul lim , a senior academic adviser at the european institute for asian studies in brussels , said that china would pick up on any concern within europe in relation to its position as a partner and could possibly play the eu and us off against each other .
but he also said china needs both powers for very different reasons . " the us , with its history of relations with asia , its presence in asia makes it a more important partner than the eu , " lim told deutsche welle .
" the eu with its soft power which it can use to great influence is still young , and is new in the game .
it all boils down to how much of a common voice the eu projects .
china will want an ally on certain issues with the eu in relation to the us and the eu will want an ally in the us on certain issues with china .
i do not see the eu losing any influence with china and i 'm sure that the us and eu will not allow china to play them against each other . "
obama 's pragmatism could bode ill for eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has opened the path to greater dialogue with beijing president obama 's visit was the first example of the current administration 's desire to engage with china and the importance it attached to china and the wider asian region as a key strategic partner .
while there were few breakthroughs to make the europeans nervous , obama came away from beijing with the paths to dialog firmly open and as such , moved the us into a position which could undermine europe 's influence in future . " chinese aid is much needed to keep the american economy afloat and to stabilize afghanistan , " holslag said .
" this has cautioned obama during his visit .
if the united states continues to opt for more pragmatism , this would certainly weaken europe 's bargaining position when it comes to human rights , economic liberalization and other challenges . "
to lag behind in relations and cooperation with the chinese could be damaging to the eu .
china 's new global influence through investment in africa and elsewhere , its growing economic muscle and its position as a major player in global issues such as iran and north korea , as well as climate change , makes the people 's republic a partner to neglect at peril . lack of action damaging eu reputation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen jinbao wants to see more action from barrosso 's eu what could prove damaging is china 's concern that the eu can talk a good partnership but is showing a lack of commitment when it comes to putting these words into practice in areas where eu-sino relations have been traditionally strong . " while trade has always been the main driver of sino-european cooperation , this has now become one of the main sources of friction , " holslag said .
" it is clear that europe 's failure to innovate its industries is leading to more sensitivity of competition from countries like china . " on the international scene we both have a joint interest in stabilizing africa , securing central asia and promoting multilateral cooperation , " he added .
" but joint interests do not automatically lead to cooperation .
growing assertiveness makes beijing more eager to promote its own values , while the eu is not proving itself as a strong player . " calls for reform turning opinion against europe where the eu continues to hold a strong hand is in its dedication to democracy and human rights .
the european union has long been a strong advocate of reform in china and has never missed an opportunity to make its feelings known .
in most cases china has responded respectfully but has given few concrete indicators that eu pressure alone is enough to force through radical change .
as a result , europe continues to press beijing in the hope that persistence will win out in the end . in fact , the eu 's regular advocating of democratic and social reform in china is beginning to turn opinion within the people 's republic , leading some within the chinese government to suggest that europe should put its own house in order fist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's constant calls for reform start to annoy china " traditionally the chinese are concerned about ' saving their face ' , " holslag said .
" but let us not forget that the pro-europe camp in beijing is losing ground .
leaders like premier wen have come under quite a lot of pressure from political hardliners and the public opinion .
china has become less tolerant of european lecturing .
as a result , we might even expect more chinese criticism on the eu 's weak performance in the combat against climate change , its deplorable economic situation or its lack of political coherence . " despite the uncertain climate between europe and china , paul lim believes that the current level of financial commitment and strategic cooperation between the two powers is enough to look towards the future with guarded optimism . " the future of eu-china cooperation depends on maturity of relations , of respect , of being able to accept criticisms , and an understanding of each other 's culture . " said lim .
" however , right now , there has to be a certain degree of closeness , of trust and confidence for the eu to put its money into china .
the two powers are also coming closer on climate change as its effects are felt in china and we can not deny that china is doing something about it even if we think it is not enough .

but if europe is not to lose ground , the opinion of experts in europe and china is that the eu should at least try and match us offers of cooperation and trump them with actual concrete action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china wants the eu to get its act together as a partner " during a high level meeting in beijing last week , we got a very clear signal from the chinese leadership , " holslag told deutsche welle .

if the eu can add no value to china 's essentially commercial relations with individual member states , there will not be a strategic partnership . " paul lim , a senior academic adviser at the european institute for asian studies in brussels , said that china would pick up on any concern within europe in relation to its position as a partner and could possibly play the eu and us off against each other .
but he also said china needs both powers for very different reasons . " the us , with its history of relations with asia , its presence in asia makes it a more important partner than the eu , " lim told deutsche welle .
" the eu with its soft power which it can use to great influence is still young , and is new in the game .
it all boils down to how much of a common voice the eu projects .
china will want an ally on certain issues with the eu in relation to the us and the eu will want an ally in the us on certain issues with china .

while there were few breakthroughs to make the europeans nervous , obama came away from beijing with the paths to dialog firmly open and as such , moved the us into a position which could undermine europe 's influence in future . " chinese aid is much needed to keep the american economy afloat and to stabilize afghanistan , " holslag said .
" this has cautioned obama during his visit .
if the united states continues to opt for more pragmatism , this would certainly weaken europe 's bargaining position when it comes to human rights , economic liberalization and other challenges . "
to lag behind in relations and cooperation with the chinese could be damaging to the eu .
china 's new global influence through investment in africa and elsewhere , its growing economic muscle and its position as a major player in global issues such as iran and north korea , as well as climate change , makes the people 's republic a partner to neglect at peril . lack of action damaging eu reputation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen jinbao wants to see more action from barrosso 's eu what could prove damaging is china 's concern that the eu can talk a good partnership but is showing a lack of commitment when it comes to putting these words into practice in areas where eu-sino relations have been traditionally strong . " while trade has always been the main driver of sino-european cooperation , this has now become one of the main sources of friction , " holslag said .
" it is clear that europe 's failure to innovate its industries is leading to more sensitivity of competition from countries like china . " on the international scene we both have a joint interest in stabilizing africa , securing central asia and promoting multilateral cooperation , " he added .
" but joint interests do not automatically lead to cooperation .
growing assertiveness makes beijing more eager to promote its own values , while the eu is not proving itself as a strong player . " calls for reform turning opinion against europe where the eu continues to hold a strong hand is in its dedication to democracy and human rights .
the european union has long been a strong advocate of reform in china and has never missed an opportunity to make its feelings known .
in most cases china has responded respectfully but has given few concrete indicators that eu pressure alone is enough to force through radical change .
as a result , europe continues to press beijing in the hope that persistence will win out in the end . in fact , the eu 's regular advocating of democratic and social reform in china is beginning to turn opinion within the people 's republic , leading some within the chinese government to suggest that europe should put its own house in order fist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's constant calls for reform start to annoy china " traditionally the chinese are concerned about ' saving their face ' , " holslag said .
" but let us not forget that the pro-europe camp in beijing is losing ground .
leaders like premier wen have come under quite a lot of pressure from political hardliners and the public opinion .
china has become less tolerant of european lecturing .
as a result , we might even expect more chinese criticism on the eu 's weak performance in the combat against climate change , its deplorable economic situation or its lack of political coherence . " despite the uncertain climate between europe and china , paul lim believes that the current level of financial commitment and strategic cooperation between the two powers is enough to look towards the future with guarded optimism . " the future of eu-china cooperation depends on maturity of relations , of respect , of being able to accept criticisms , and an understanding of each other 's culture . " said lim .
" however , right now , there has to be a certain degree of closeness , of trust and confidence for the eu to put its money into china .
the two powers are also coming closer on climate change as its effects are felt in china and we can not deny that china is doing something about it even if we think it is not enough .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 29.11.2009 in russian arctic , global warming threatens traditional way of life großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 'll soon get colder again , some russian scientists say russian scientists have doubts over whether global warming is here to stay and whether it 's man made .
but for the saami in russia 's north , the mild winters already pose a threat to their traditional way of life . all around the arctic , the effects of a temperature rise are visible , and native inhabitants of the tundras in europa , asia and north america are struggling with the new reality .
that 's also true for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula , an area bordering on norway and finnish lapland .
but , in russia , climate change is not a hot-button issue , nor is much attention being paid to the upcoming climate summit in copenhagen .
russian scientists say they have no evidence that global warming is a long-term trend , and doubt whether it is a man-made phenomenon . a little ice age ?
in the country 's northern port in the town of murmansk , the marine biological institute of the russian academy of sciences monitors life in and around the barents sea .
the institute has amassed an impressive database concerning temperature and salinity of the sea over the course of the 20th century .
referring to the statistics , biologist pavel makarevich says there are clear cycles during which both temperature and salinity rise and fall . these cycles , he says , are related to solar activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murmansk is russia 's gateway to the arctic waters " in my opinion and that of our institute , the problems connected to the current stage of warming are being exaggerated , " he says .
" what we are dealing with is not a global warming of the atmosphere or of the oceans . "
makarevich expects a normalization of arctic temperatures in the coming years .
this view appears to have the support of a growing number of russian scientists .
some even predict a temporary cooling of temperatures towards the middle of this century , a phenomenon known as a " little ice age . "
shorter winters but for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula between the barents and the white sea , a drop in temperature is urgently needed .
over the last few years , the winters have become milder and milder , threatening the traditional lifestyle of the saami .
this year again , the onset of winter was late in northern russia .
normally , the tundra would already be covered by a deep layer of snow , and the numerous lakes would have a thick layer of ice .
but snow cover is minimal and some of the lakes are not even frozen yet .
for native reindeer herders , that 's a problem , because the traditional slaughter season has to be postponed .
" the slaughter used to start in early november , " says herder nikolai filippov .
" at that time , the ice is usually strong enough to carry the reindeer .
but over the past few years , the ice has been weak and sparse , so we can not travel , and the slaughter has to be postponed until just before the new year .
this year , yields will be minimal . "
each fall , the big reindeer herds are somewhere on the vast expanses of the kola peninsula .
at the onset of winter , they have to be found and driven to lovozero , the center of the russian saami community .
but that can only happen under true winter conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indigenous saami people depend on reindeer for their living " last year it was exactly the same .
this year we do not know yet how the herds are , and what will happen later in the autumn , " filippov says .
" sometimes it is still raining around the new year , and you can not go over bare ice with the reindeer .
so then you will have to wait until after the new year .
in fact , the winter only starts in january .
for now it is a mixture of frost and thaw . "
the capricious weather has all kinds of practical consequences for the everyday life of the saami .
nikolai filippov and his wife maria live in a chum , a traditional saami tipi-like tent with a hole in the top to let out the smoke .
maria used to prepare lots of food for the winter .
but now that is out of the question , because the thaw often comes in the middle of winter and the meat can no longer be preserved .
the tundra is no longer a reliable natural refrigerator .
" in the old days it never rained in december , " says maria filippova .
" when it rains in winter , the snow disappears and we ca n't move on with our animals to search for reindeer moss . "
for thousands of years , the saami lived according to an ancient and extremely reliable calendar .
but today , says nikolai filippov , everything seems to be off course .
for him , there is no question that nature is changing .
what is happening in the tundra today is something the 59-year-old has never seen before .
the arctic as a future trading route the city of murmansk , a few hours ' drive to the north , seems a world away .
in the harbor , there 's the lenin - the first soviet nuclear-powered icebreaker built in the 1950s .
today , the heavy vessel is a museum .
andrei smirnov was the lenin 's last captain when the ship was retired in 1989 .
" no other country has boundaries like russia that stretch so far to the north , " smirnov says .
he is convinced that russia will need icebreakers like this one , now and in the future .
" we have been using the northern passage since 1932 .
it is a sea route of national significance , and since 1991 , foreign ships have also been allowed to use it .
this year as well , foreigners have used the passage , and we have successfully guided them through with our icebreakers . "
smirnov is referring to ships belonging to the german company beluga .
earlier this year , they made an impressive voyage from south korea to rotterdam , via the arctic seas north of russia .
bildunterschrift : this year , two ships from the german company , beluga , completed the trip around russia 's north .
the northern passage could become an alternative to existing routes the trip was meant to prove that the north pole ice is retreating as a result of global warming , and that the northern passage could become an attractive , much shorter alternative for existing routes like the one via the suez canal .
it sounds great , but longtime members of russia 's northern fleet , such as nikolai babich , can only laugh at the thought ..
" saying that one could navigate in the polar seas without the help of icebreakers , or even reach the north pole unhindered , no , that is not serious , " says babich .
babich feels at home in the russian arctic .
he has visited almost every corner of it during the last 40 years , and he claims there is no-one like him who has studied the area in such detail .
the recent rise in global temperature has surprised neither him nor his colleagues .
it has happened in the past , he says , and it will happen again .
" the natural processes we have seen during the past decade are mainly the result of the sun 's activity .
they show a slight increase in temperature , and as a result , arctic ice has receded , " he says .
but according to babich , the situation is changing .
the arctic , he says , is already cooling , not warming .
and the russian government is attentively listening to those scientists who , like babich , are predicting a cold spell .

but if europe is not to lose ground , the opinion of experts in europe and china is that the eu should at least try and match us offers of cooperation and trump them with actual concrete action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china wants the eu to get its act together as a partner " during a high level meeting in beijing last week , we got a very clear signal from the chinese leadership , " holslag told deutsche welle .
" premier wen jiabao and state counselor dai bingguo explained that china attaches a lot of importance to cooperation with europe and that it should not worry about a g2 .
but for the chinese , the ball is in our court now .
they want us to prove that we can get our act together and come up with a pragmatic agenda for cooperation .
if the eu can add no value to china 's essentially commercial relations with individual member states , there will not be a strategic partnership . " paul lim , a senior academic adviser at the european institute for asian studies in brussels , said that china would pick up on any concern within europe in relation to its position as a partner and could possibly play the eu and us off against each other .
but he also said china needs both powers for very different reasons . " the us , with its history of relations with asia , its presence in asia makes it a more important partner than the eu , " lim told deutsche welle .
" the eu with its soft power which it can use to great influence is still young , and is new in the game .
it all boils down to how much of a common voice the eu projects .
china will want an ally on certain issues with the eu in relation to the us and the eu will want an ally in the us on certain issues with china .
i do not see the eu losing any influence with china and i 'm sure that the us and eu will not allow china to play them against each other . "
obama 's pragmatism could bode ill for eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has opened the path to greater dialogue with beijing president obama 's visit was the first example of the current administration 's desire to engage with china and the importance it attached to china and the wider asian region as a key strategic partner .
while there were few breakthroughs to make the europeans nervous , obama came away from beijing with the paths to dialog firmly open and as such , moved the us into a position which could undermine europe 's influence in future . " chinese aid is much needed to keep the american economy afloat and to stabilize afghanistan , " holslag said .
" this has cautioned obama during his visit .
if the united states continues to opt for more pragmatism , this would certainly weaken europe 's bargaining position when it comes to human rights , economic liberalization and other challenges . "
to lag behind in relations and cooperation with the chinese could be damaging to the eu .
china 's new global influence through investment in africa and elsewhere , its growing economic muscle and its position as a major player in global issues such as iran and north korea , as well as climate change , makes the people 's republic a partner to neglect at peril . lack of action damaging eu reputation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen jinbao wants to see more action from barrosso 's eu what could prove damaging is china 's concern that the eu can talk a good partnership but is showing a lack of commitment when it comes to putting these words into practice in areas where eu-sino relations have been traditionally strong . " while trade has always been the main driver of sino-european cooperation , this has now become one of the main sources of friction , " holslag said .
" it is clear that europe 's failure to innovate its industries is leading to more sensitivity of competition from countries like china . " on the international scene we both have a joint interest in stabilizing africa , securing central asia and promoting multilateral cooperation , " he added .
" but joint interests do not automatically lead to cooperation .
growing assertiveness makes beijing more eager to promote its own values , while the eu is not proving itself as a strong player . " calls for reform turning opinion against europe where the eu continues to hold a strong hand is in its dedication to democracy and human rights .
the european union has long been a strong advocate of reform in china and has never missed an opportunity to make its feelings known .
in most cases china has responded respectfully but has given few concrete indicators that eu pressure alone is enough to force through radical change .
as a result , europe continues to press beijing in the hope that persistence will win out in the end . in fact , the eu 's regular advocating of democratic and social reform in china is beginning to turn opinion within the people 's republic , leading some within the chinese government to suggest that europe should put its own house in order fist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's constant calls for reform start to annoy china " traditionally the chinese are concerned about ' saving their face ' , " holslag said .
" but let us not forget that the pro-europe camp in beijing is losing ground .
leaders like premier wen have come under quite a lot of pressure from political hardliners and the public opinion .
china has become less tolerant of european lecturing .
as a result , we might even expect more chinese criticism on the eu 's weak performance in the combat against climate change , its deplorable economic situation or its lack of political coherence . " despite the uncertain climate between europe and china , paul lim believes that the current level of financial commitment and strategic cooperation between the two powers is enough to look towards the future with guarded optimism . " the future of eu-china cooperation depends on maturity of relations , of respect , of being able to accept criticisms , and an understanding of each other 's culture . " said lim .
" however , right now , there has to be a certain degree of closeness , of trust and confidence for the eu to put its money into china .
the two powers are also coming closer on climate change as its effects are felt in china and we can not deny that china is doing something about it even if we think it is not enough .
but the big question is how mature the relationship is .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 29.11.2009 in russian arctic , global warming threatens traditional way of life großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 'll soon get colder again , some russian scientists say russian scientists have doubts over whether global warming is here to stay and whether it 's man made .
but for the saami in russia 's north , the mild winters already pose a threat to their traditional way of life . all around the arctic , the effects of a temperature rise are visible , and native inhabitants of the tundras in europa , asia and north america are struggling with the new reality .
that 's also true for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula , an area bordering on norway and finnish lapland .
but , in russia , climate change is not a hot-button issue , nor is much attention being paid to the upcoming climate summit in copenhagen .
russian scientists say they have no evidence that global warming is a long-term trend , and doubt whether it is a man-made phenomenon . a little ice age ?
in the country 's northern port in the town of murmansk , the marine biological institute of the russian academy of sciences monitors life in and around the barents sea .
the institute has amassed an impressive database concerning temperature and salinity of the sea over the course of the 20th century .
referring to the statistics , biologist pavel makarevich says there are clear cycles during which both temperature and salinity rise and fall . these cycles , he says , are related to solar activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murmansk is russia 's gateway to the arctic waters " in my opinion and that of our institute , the problems connected to the current stage of warming are being exaggerated , " he says .
" what we are dealing with is not a global warming of the atmosphere or of the oceans . "
makarevich expects a normalization of arctic temperatures in the coming years .
this view appears to have the support of a growing number of russian scientists .
some even predict a temporary cooling of temperatures towards the middle of this century , a phenomenon known as a " little ice age . "
shorter winters but for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula between the barents and the white sea , a drop in temperature is urgently needed .
over the last few years , the winters have become milder and milder , threatening the traditional lifestyle of the saami .
this year again , the onset of winter was late in northern russia .
normally , the tundra would already be covered by a deep layer of snow , and the numerous lakes would have a thick layer of ice .
but snow cover is minimal and some of the lakes are not even frozen yet .
for native reindeer herders , that 's a problem , because the traditional slaughter season has to be postponed .
" the slaughter used to start in early november , " says herder nikolai filippov .
" at that time , the ice is usually strong enough to carry the reindeer .
but over the past few years , the ice has been weak and sparse , so we can not travel , and the slaughter has to be postponed until just before the new year .
this year , yields will be minimal . "
each fall , the big reindeer herds are somewhere on the vast expanses of the kola peninsula .
at the onset of winter , they have to be found and driven to lovozero , the center of the russian saami community .
but that can only happen under true winter conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indigenous saami people depend on reindeer for their living " last year it was exactly the same .
this year we do not know yet how the herds are , and what will happen later in the autumn , " filippov says .
" sometimes it is still raining around the new year , and you can not go over bare ice with the reindeer .
so then you will have to wait until after the new year .
in fact , the winter only starts in january .
for now it is a mixture of frost and thaw . "
the capricious weather has all kinds of practical consequences for the everyday life of the saami .
nikolai filippov and his wife maria live in a chum , a traditional saami tipi-like tent with a hole in the top to let out the smoke .
maria used to prepare lots of food for the winter .
but now that is out of the question , because the thaw often comes in the middle of winter and the meat can no longer be preserved .
the tundra is no longer a reliable natural refrigerator .
" in the old days it never rained in december , " says maria filippova .
" when it rains in winter , the snow disappears and we ca n't move on with our animals to search for reindeer moss . "
for thousands of years , the saami lived according to an ancient and extremely reliable calendar .
but today , says nikolai filippov , everything seems to be off course .
for him , there is no question that nature is changing .
what is happening in the tundra today is something the 59-year-old has never seen before .
the arctic as a future trading route the city of murmansk , a few hours ' drive to the north , seems a world away .
in the harbor , there 's the lenin - the first soviet nuclear-powered icebreaker built in the 1950s .
today , the heavy vessel is a museum .
andrei smirnov was the lenin 's last captain when the ship was retired in 1989 .
" no other country has boundaries like russia that stretch so far to the north , " smirnov says .
he is convinced that russia will need icebreakers like this one , now and in the future .
" we have been using the northern passage since 1932 .
it is a sea route of national significance , and since 1991 , foreign ships have also been allowed to use it .
this year as well , foreigners have used the passage , and we have successfully guided them through with our icebreakers . "
smirnov is referring to ships belonging to the german company beluga .
earlier this year , they made an impressive voyage from south korea to rotterdam , via the arctic seas north of russia .
bildunterschrift : this year , two ships from the german company , beluga , completed the trip around russia 's north .
the northern passage could become an alternative to existing routes the trip was meant to prove that the north pole ice is retreating as a result of global warming , and that the northern passage could become an attractive , much shorter alternative for existing routes like the one via the suez canal .
it sounds great , but longtime members of russia 's northern fleet , such as nikolai babich , can only laugh at the thought ..
" saying that one could navigate in the polar seas without the help of icebreakers , or even reach the north pole unhindered , no , that is not serious , " says babich .
babich feels at home in the russian arctic .
he has visited almost every corner of it during the last 40 years , and he claims there is no-one like him who has studied the area in such detail .
the recent rise in global temperature has surprised neither him nor his colleagues .
it has happened in the past , he says , and it will happen again .
" the natural processes we have seen during the past decade are mainly the result of the sun 's activity .
they show a slight increase in temperature , and as a result , arctic ice has receded , " he says .
but according to babich , the situation is changing .
the arctic , he says , is already cooling , not warming .
and the russian government is attentively listening to those scientists who , like babich , are predicting a cold spell .

but for the saami in russia 's north , the mild winters already pose a threat to their traditional way of life . all around the arctic , the effects of a temperature rise are visible , and native inhabitants of the tundras in europa , asia and north america are struggling with the new reality .
that 's also true for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula , an area bordering on norway and finnish lapland .
but , in russia , climate change is not a hot-button issue , nor is much attention being paid to the upcoming climate summit in copenhagen .
russian scientists say they have no evidence that global warming is a long-term trend , and doubt whether it is a man-made phenomenon . a little ice age ?
in the country 's northern port in the town of murmansk , the marine biological institute of the russian academy of sciences monitors life in and around the barents sea .
the institute has amassed an impressive database concerning temperature and salinity of the sea over the course of the 20th century .
referring to the statistics , biologist pavel makarevich says there are clear cycles during which both temperature and salinity rise and fall . these cycles , he says , are related to solar activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murmansk is russia 's gateway to the arctic waters " in my opinion and that of our institute , the problems connected to the current stage of warming are being exaggerated , " he says .
" what we are dealing with is not a global warming of the atmosphere or of the oceans . "
makarevich expects a normalization of arctic temperatures in the coming years .
this view appears to have the support of a growing number of russian scientists .
some even predict a temporary cooling of temperatures towards the middle of this century , a phenomenon known as a " little ice age . "
shorter winters but for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula between the barents and the white sea , a drop in temperature is urgently needed .
over the last few years , the winters have become milder and milder , threatening the traditional lifestyle of the saami .
this year again , the onset of winter was late in northern russia .
normally , the tundra would already be covered by a deep layer of snow , and the numerous lakes would have a thick layer of ice .
but snow cover is minimal and some of the lakes are not even frozen yet .
for native reindeer herders , that 's a problem , because the traditional slaughter season has to be postponed .
" the slaughter used to start in early november , " says herder nikolai filippov .
" at that time , the ice is usually strong enough to carry the reindeer .
but over the past few years , the ice has been weak and sparse , so we can not travel , and the slaughter has to be postponed until just before the new year .
this year , yields will be minimal . "
each fall , the big reindeer herds are somewhere on the vast expanses of the kola peninsula .
at the onset of winter , they have to be found and driven to lovozero , the center of the russian saami community .
but that can only happen under true winter conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indigenous saami people depend on reindeer for their living " last year it was exactly the same .
this year we do not know yet how the herds are , and what will happen later in the autumn , " filippov says .
" sometimes it is still raining around the new year , and you can not go over bare ice with the reindeer .
so then you will have to wait until after the new year .
in fact , the winter only starts in january .
for now it is a mixture of frost and thaw . "
the capricious weather has all kinds of practical consequences for the everyday life of the saami .
nikolai filippov and his wife maria live in a chum , a traditional saami tipi-like tent with a hole in the top to let out the smoke .
maria used to prepare lots of food for the winter .
but now that is out of the question , because the thaw often comes in the middle of winter and the meat can no longer be preserved .
the tundra is no longer a reliable natural refrigerator .
" in the old days it never rained in december , " says maria filippova .
" when it rains in winter , the snow disappears and we ca n't move on with our animals to search for reindeer moss . "
for thousands of years , the saami lived according to an ancient and extremely reliable calendar .
but today , says nikolai filippov , everything seems to be off course .
for him , there is no question that nature is changing .
what is happening in the tundra today is something the 59-year-old has never seen before .
the arctic as a future trading route the city of murmansk , a few hours ' drive to the north , seems a world away .
in the harbor , there 's the lenin - the first soviet nuclear-powered icebreaker built in the 1950s .
today , the heavy vessel is a museum .
andrei smirnov was the lenin 's last captain when the ship was retired in 1989 .
" no other country has boundaries like russia that stretch so far to the north , " smirnov says .
he is convinced that russia will need icebreakers like this one , now and in the future .
" we have been using the northern passage since 1932 .
it is a sea route of national significance , and since 1991 , foreign ships have also been allowed to use it .
this year as well , foreigners have used the passage , and we have successfully guided them through with our icebreakers . "
smirnov is referring to ships belonging to the german company beluga .
earlier this year , they made an impressive voyage from south korea to rotterdam , via the arctic seas north of russia .
bildunterschrift : this year , two ships from the german company , beluga , completed the trip around russia 's north .
the northern passage could become an alternative to existing routes the trip was meant to prove that the north pole ice is retreating as a result of global warming , and that the northern passage could become an attractive , much shorter alternative for existing routes like the one via the suez canal .
it sounds great , but longtime members of russia 's northern fleet , such as nikolai babich , can only laugh at the thought ..
" saying that one could navigate in the polar seas without the help of icebreakers , or even reach the north pole unhindered , no , that is not serious , " says babich .
babich feels at home in the russian arctic .
he has visited almost every corner of it during the last 40 years , and he claims there is no-one like him who has studied the area in such detail .
the recent rise in global temperature has surprised neither him nor his colleagues .
it has happened in the past , he says , and it will happen again .
" the natural processes we have seen during the past decade are mainly the result of the sun 's activity .
they show a slight increase in temperature , and as a result , arctic ice has receded , " he says .
but according to babich , the situation is changing .
the arctic , he says , is already cooling , not warming .
and the russian government is attentively listening to those scientists who , like babich , are predicting a cold spell .

tweeting on sunday , she said she was surprised by the focus on whether she would continue to use the internet application .
" i 'm not going to give up letter writing , either , " she wrote .
in her first interview since taking office , koehler told the bild am sonntag newspaper via email that she was n't about to abandon applications like twitter and facebook just because she had been promoted to cabinet .
she said although it was " absurd " to consider all of her 600 facebook contacts as friends , she found the site useful for spreading her political message .

the surprise result is certain to embarrass the government and dismay the country 's muslim minority . the swiss news agency ats and other media outlets report that a clear majority , 57.5 percent of voters and all but four of switzerland 's 26 cantons approved the proposal in this nationwide referendum .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 29.11.2009 in russian arctic , global warming threatens traditional way of life großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 'll soon get colder again , some russian scientists say russian scientists have doubts over whether global warming is here to stay and whether it 's man made .
but for the saami in russia 's north , the mild winters already pose a threat to their traditional way of life . all around the arctic , the effects of a temperature rise are visible , and native inhabitants of the tundras in europa , asia and north america are struggling with the new reality .
that 's also true for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula , an area bordering on norway and finnish lapland .
but , in russia , climate change is not a hot-button issue , nor is much attention being paid to the upcoming climate summit in copenhagen .
russian scientists say they have no evidence that global warming is a long-term trend , and doubt whether it is a man-made phenomenon . a little ice age ?
in the country 's northern port in the town of murmansk , the marine biological institute of the russian academy of sciences monitors life in and around the barents sea .
the institute has amassed an impressive database concerning temperature and salinity of the sea over the course of the 20th century .
referring to the statistics , biologist pavel makarevich says there are clear cycles during which both temperature and salinity rise and fall . these cycles , he says , are related to solar activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murmansk is russia 's gateway to the arctic waters " in my opinion and that of our institute , the problems connected to the current stage of warming are being exaggerated , " he says .
" what we are dealing with is not a global warming of the atmosphere or of the oceans . "
makarevich expects a normalization of arctic temperatures in the coming years .
this view appears to have the support of a growing number of russian scientists .
some even predict a temporary cooling of temperatures towards the middle of this century , a phenomenon known as a " little ice age . "
shorter winters but for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula between the barents and the white sea , a drop in temperature is urgently needed .
over the last few years , the winters have become milder and milder , threatening the traditional lifestyle of the saami .
this year again , the onset of winter was late in northern russia .
normally , the tundra would already be covered by a deep layer of snow , and the numerous lakes would have a thick layer of ice .
but snow cover is minimal and some of the lakes are not even frozen yet .
for native reindeer herders , that 's a problem , because the traditional slaughter season has to be postponed .
" the slaughter used to start in early november , " says herder nikolai filippov .
" at that time , the ice is usually strong enough to carry the reindeer .
but over the past few years , the ice has been weak and sparse , so we can not travel , and the slaughter has to be postponed until just before the new year .
this year , yields will be minimal . "
each fall , the big reindeer herds are somewhere on the vast expanses of the kola peninsula .
at the onset of winter , they have to be found and driven to lovozero , the center of the russian saami community .
but that can only happen under true winter conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indigenous saami people depend on reindeer for their living " last year it was exactly the same .
this year we do not know yet how the herds are , and what will happen later in the autumn , " filippov says .
" sometimes it is still raining around the new year , and you can not go over bare ice with the reindeer .
so then you will have to wait until after the new year .
in fact , the winter only starts in january .
for now it is a mixture of frost and thaw . "
the capricious weather has all kinds of practical consequences for the everyday life of the saami .
nikolai filippov and his wife maria live in a chum , a traditional saami tipi-like tent with a hole in the top to let out the smoke .
maria used to prepare lots of food for the winter .
but now that is out of the question , because the thaw often comes in the middle of winter and the meat can no longer be preserved .
the tundra is no longer a reliable natural refrigerator .
" in the old days it never rained in december , " says maria filippova .
" when it rains in winter , the snow disappears and we ca n't move on with our animals to search for reindeer moss . "
for thousands of years , the saami lived according to an ancient and extremely reliable calendar .
but today , says nikolai filippov , everything seems to be off course .
for him , there is no question that nature is changing .
what is happening in the tundra today is something the 59-year-old has never seen before .
the arctic as a future trading route the city of murmansk , a few hours ' drive to the north , seems a world away .
in the harbor , there 's the lenin - the first soviet nuclear-powered icebreaker built in the 1950s .
today , the heavy vessel is a museum .
andrei smirnov was the lenin 's last captain when the ship was retired in 1989 .
" no other country has boundaries like russia that stretch so far to the north , " smirnov says .
he is convinced that russia will need icebreakers like this one , now and in the future .
" we have been using the northern passage since 1932 .
it is a sea route of national significance , and since 1991 , foreign ships have also been allowed to use it .
this year as well , foreigners have used the passage , and we have successfully guided them through with our icebreakers . "
smirnov is referring to ships belonging to the german company beluga .
earlier this year , they made an impressive voyage from south korea to rotterdam , via the arctic seas north of russia .
bildunterschrift : this year , two ships from the german company , beluga , completed the trip around russia 's north .
the northern passage could become an alternative to existing routes the trip was meant to prove that the north pole ice is retreating as a result of global warming , and that the northern passage could become an attractive , much shorter alternative for existing routes like the one via the suez canal .
it sounds great , but longtime members of russia 's northern fleet , such as nikolai babich , can only laugh at the thought ..
" saying that one could navigate in the polar seas without the help of icebreakers , or even reach the north pole unhindered , no , that is not serious , " says babich .
babich feels at home in the russian arctic .
he has visited almost every corner of it during the last 40 years , and he claims there is no-one like him who has studied the area in such detail .
the recent rise in global temperature has surprised neither him nor his colleagues .
it has happened in the past , he says , and it will happen again .
" the natural processes we have seen during the past decade are mainly the result of the sun 's activity .
they show a slight increase in temperature , and as a result , arctic ice has receded , " he says .
but according to babich , the situation is changing .
the arctic , he says , is already cooling , not warming .
and the russian government is attentively listening to those scientists who , like babich , are predicting a cold spell .

he was appointed to the post by former un secretary-general kofi annan in 2006 .
one of his department 's tasks is to provide support to the compliance regime of the kyoto protocol , the landmark pact for tackling greenhouse-gas emissions .
the un climate conference in copenhagen from december 7 - 18 will focus on an agreement to take effect after kyoto expires in 2012 .
deutsche welle : for a long time the un climate summit has been viewed as an all-or-nothing event .
is that what it still is ? de boer : i think so .
i think it is an all-or-nothing event in the sense that we need to see a number of things come together .
we need rich country emission reduction targets , individual targets for rich countries , secondly we need to know what china , india , brazil , major development countries , will do to lower the growth in emissions , thirdly we need prompt start financing to help developing countries engage .
fourthly we need a set of decisions that will make immediate action operational .
that all sounds very concrete .
in the press in the run-up to the conference there are all sorts of terms like outlines , pledges , frameworks , meaningful bids .
that does n't sound like what you are talking about .

the chinese appear to have seen the light regarding the need to de-carbonize their economy as much as possible so as not to despoil their environment .
but both the chinese and the indians have been arguing in recent years that they should have room for carbon-based industrial growth so they can provide their huge populations better living standards .
is there room for that any more ?
there has to be room for that .
china is changing its approach not only because of love of the environment and the fear of climate change , but also because i believe you can not continue to grow the chinese economy at the current pace in the current way .
there has to be a fundamental change .
and yes , to have to leave space for developing countries to grow .
in india , there are 400 million people that do n't even have access to electricity .
the goal of copenhagen should not be to keep people living under those circumstances .
so we will see growth in emissions in some countries .

he was appointed to the post by former un secretary-general kofi annan in 2006 .
one of his department 's tasks is to provide support to the compliance regime of the kyoto protocol , the landmark pact for tackling greenhouse-gas emissions .
the un climate conference in copenhagen from december 7 - 18 will focus on an agreement to take effect after kyoto expires in 2012 .
deutsche welle : for a long time the un climate summit has been viewed as an all-or-nothing event .
is that what it still is ? de boer : i think so .
i think it is an all-or-nothing event in the sense that we need to see a number of things come together .
we need rich country emission reduction targets , individual targets for rich countries , secondly we need to know what china , india , brazil , major development countries , will do to lower the growth in emissions , thirdly we need prompt start financing to help developing countries engage .
fourthly we need a set of decisions that will make immediate action operational .
that all sounds very concrete .

the chinese appear to have seen the light regarding the need to de-carbonize their economy as much as possible so as not to despoil their environment .

is there room for that any more ?
there has to be room for that .
china is changing its approach not only because of love of the environment and the fear of climate change , but also because i believe you can not continue to grow the chinese economy at the current pace in the current way .

kristina koehler is a fresh face in german cabinet , and not just because she 's getting her first portfolio .
at 32 , she 's germany 's youngest cabinet minister and probably the only one who can use facebook without an aide . kristina koehler , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , was chosen as family minister on friday as part of a cabinet reshuffle .
koehler 's nomination is also no doubt aimed at improving the christian democrat 's profile among younger voters .
true to her generation , she can be found on the social networking site facebook and also posts on twitter .
tweeting on sunday , she said she was surprised by the focus on whether she would continue to use the internet application .
" i 'm not going to give up letter writing , either , " she wrote .
in her first interview since taking office , koehler told the bild am sonntag newspaper via email that she was n't about to abandon applications like twitter and facebook just because she had been promoted to cabinet .
she said although it was " absurd " to consider all of her 600 facebook contacts as friends , she found the site useful for spreading her political message .
career move until now , koehler , a member of the bundestag 's internal affairs committee , was mostly known for speaking out on topics such as extremism and the integration of foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen , koehler 's predecessor she takes over the family ministry from ursula von der leyen , who is moving into the labor ministry .
koehler is expected to continue her predecessor 's policies that aim to make child-rearing less expensive in germany .
but in other respects , koehler could n't be more different from von der leyen , a 51-year-old working mother of seven .
koehler joined the youth wing of the christian democrats at the age of 14 , already clear in her mind that she was destined for a career in politics .
now she is one of three relatively young ministers alongside fellow christian democrat defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , 38 , and health minister philipp roessler , 36 , from the pro-business free democrats. nw / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kristina koehler is a fresh face in german cabinet , and not just because she 's getting her first portfolio .
at 32 , she 's germany 's youngest cabinet minister and probably the only one who can use facebook without an aide . kristina koehler , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , was chosen as family minister on friday as part of a cabinet reshuffle .
koehler 's nomination is also no doubt aimed at improving the christian democrat 's profile among younger voters .
true to her generation , she can be found on the social networking site facebook and also posts on twitter .
tweeting on sunday , she said she was surprised by the focus on whether she would continue to use the internet application .
" i 'm not going to give up letter writing , either , " she wrote .
in her first interview since taking office , koehler told the bild am sonntag newspaper via email that she was n't about to abandon applications like twitter and facebook just because she had been promoted to cabinet .
she said although it was " absurd " to consider all of her 600 facebook contacts as friends , she found the site useful for spreading her political message .
career move until now , koehler , a member of the bundestag 's internal affairs committee , was mostly known for speaking out on topics such as extremism and the integration of foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen , koehler 's predecessor she takes over the family ministry from ursula von der leyen , who is moving into the labor ministry .
koehler is expected to continue her predecessor 's policies that aim to make child-rearing less expensive in germany .
but in other respects , koehler could n't be more different from von der leyen , a 51-year-old working mother of seven .
koehler joined the youth wing of the christian democrats at the age of 14 , already clear in her mind that she was destined for a career in politics .
now she is one of three relatively young ministers alongside fellow christian democrat defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , 38 , and health minister philipp roessler , 36 , from the pro-business free democrats. nw / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" an active investigative and operational effort is underway to identify and find the individuals involved in the crime , " vladimir markin , a spokesman for the investigators , told russian state television on sunday , november 29 .
the 14-carriage passenger train carrying nearly 700 people was jolted off the rails on the main line between moscow and russia 's second largest city , st. petersburg in what the authorities suspect was a bomb attack .
according to russia 's emergency situations ministry , the attack killed 25 and injured 104 , while 26 people remain missing .
markin said forensic experts had returned sunday morning to the scene of the explosion - a wooded area about 400 kilometers -lrb- 250 miles -rrb- northwest of the capital moscow - to continue their search for clues .
the question of responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extremists from conflict zones have been blamed for a string of attacks on civilian targets it remains unclear what motivated the attackers to strike the train , which is popular with well-off russians and foreign tourists .
a police spokesman expressed doubts about a message posted on the internet by a radical right-wing group claiming responsibility .
the chief of russia 's fsb security service had said earlier that the blast which derailed the train was caused by an improvised explosive device with the force of seven kilograms -lrb- 15 lbs . -rrb- of tnt .
interior minister rashid nurgaliyev had said police had evidence suggesting that several persons took part in the attack , and even gave a description of one of the suspects .
a second explosion occurred during rescue operations on saturday , but no one was injured .
grim task of identifying bodies meanwhile , the process of formally identifying bodies began on sunday in tver , a city between moscow and st. petersburg , and the regional capital of the area in which the train was attacked .
interfax news agency quoted a spokeswoman for the regional government as saying that 65 relatives of the train disaster victims were in tver to examine the corpses at a local morgue .
a government commission specially formed by prime minister vladimir putin to deal with the aftermath of the disaster was expected to meet later on sunday .
russian railways , the state company that oversees the country 's railroads , said in a statement that the movement of trains between moscow and st. petersburg had been " fully restored " as of sunday morning .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : china transforms into a global player china using currency reserves to retake its place as economic power the gulf region : a challenge for beijing 's foreign policy china ponders what to do with its currency reserves china lets its cash speak in the balkans international relations -pipe- 29.11.2009 europe in danger of losing ground to us in relations with china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to remain an important partner with china two weeks after us president barack obama travelled to beijing , eu officials head to china in the hope that the leader of the free world has left room for an expansion in eu-china relations . european commission president jose manuel barroso and swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , will head an eu delegation to the eastern city of nanking on monday to meet with chinese premier wen jiabao and his ministers . while the talks are expected to concentrate on trade , protectionism , climate change and macroeconomic policy , it is assumed that the eu delegation will also attempt to gauge what impact obama 's visit to china may have had on europe 's position as a partner to the chinese . at first glance , according to jonathan holslag from the brussels institute of contemporary china studies , obama 's visit is unlikely to have any immediate effect on eu-sino relations , a view supported by statements coming out of the chinese government .
but if europe is not to lose ground , the opinion of experts in europe and china is that the eu should at least try and match us offers of cooperation and trump them with actual concrete action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china wants the eu to get its act together as a partner " during a high level meeting in beijing last week , we got a very clear signal from the chinese leadership , " holslag told deutsche welle .
" premier wen jiabao and state counselor dai bingguo explained that china attaches a lot of importance to cooperation with europe and that it should not worry about a g2 .
but for the chinese , the ball is in our court now .
they want us to prove that we can get our act together and come up with a pragmatic agenda for cooperation .
if the eu can add no value to china 's essentially commercial relations with individual member states , there will not be a strategic partnership . " paul lim , a senior academic adviser at the european institute for asian studies in brussels , said that china would pick up on any concern within europe in relation to its position as a partner and could possibly play the eu and us off against each other .
but he also said china needs both powers for very different reasons . " the us , with its history of relations with asia , its presence in asia makes it a more important partner than the eu , " lim told deutsche welle .
" the eu with its soft power which it can use to great influence is still young , and is new in the game .
it all boils down to how much of a common voice the eu projects .
china will want an ally on certain issues with the eu in relation to the us and the eu will want an ally in the us on certain issues with china .
i do not see the eu losing any influence with china and i 'm sure that the us and eu will not allow china to play them against each other . "
obama 's pragmatism could bode ill for eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has opened the path to greater dialogue with beijing president obama 's visit was the first example of the current administration 's desire to engage with china and the importance it attached to china and the wider asian region as a key strategic partner .
while there were few breakthroughs to make the europeans nervous , obama came away from beijing with the paths to dialog firmly open and as such , moved the us into a position which could undermine europe 's influence in future . " chinese aid is much needed to keep the american economy afloat and to stabilize afghanistan , " holslag said .
" this has cautioned obama during his visit .
if the united states continues to opt for more pragmatism , this would certainly weaken europe 's bargaining position when it comes to human rights , economic liberalization and other challenges . "
to lag behind in relations and cooperation with the chinese could be damaging to the eu .
china 's new global influence through investment in africa and elsewhere , its growing economic muscle and its position as a major player in global issues such as iran and north korea , as well as climate change , makes the people 's republic a partner to neglect at peril . lack of action damaging eu reputation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen jinbao wants to see more action from barrosso 's eu what could prove damaging is china 's concern that the eu can talk a good partnership but is showing a lack of commitment when it comes to putting these words into practice in areas where eu-sino relations have been traditionally strong . " while trade has always been the main driver of sino-european cooperation , this has now become one of the main sources of friction , " holslag said .
" it is clear that europe 's failure to innovate its industries is leading to more sensitivity of competition from countries like china . " on the international scene we both have a joint interest in stabilizing africa , securing central asia and promoting multilateral cooperation , " he added .
" but joint interests do not automatically lead to cooperation .
growing assertiveness makes beijing more eager to promote its own values , while the eu is not proving itself as a strong player . " calls for reform turning opinion against europe where the eu continues to hold a strong hand is in its dedication to democracy and human rights .
the european union has long been a strong advocate of reform in china and has never missed an opportunity to make its feelings known .
in most cases china has responded respectfully but has given few concrete indicators that eu pressure alone is enough to force through radical change .
as a result , europe continues to press beijing in the hope that persistence will win out in the end . in fact , the eu 's regular advocating of democratic and social reform in china is beginning to turn opinion within the people 's republic , leading some within the chinese government to suggest that europe should put its own house in order fist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's constant calls for reform start to annoy china " traditionally the chinese are concerned about ' saving their face ' , " holslag said .
" but let us not forget that the pro-europe camp in beijing is losing ground .
leaders like premier wen have come under quite a lot of pressure from political hardliners and the public opinion .
china has become less tolerant of european lecturing .
as a result , we might even expect more chinese criticism on the eu 's weak performance in the combat against climate change , its deplorable economic situation or its lack of political coherence . " despite the uncertain climate between europe and china , paul lim believes that the current level of financial commitment and strategic cooperation between the two powers is enough to look towards the future with guarded optimism . " the future of eu-china cooperation depends on maturity of relations , of respect , of being able to accept criticisms , and an understanding of each other 's culture . " said lim .
" however , right now , there has to be a certain degree of closeness , of trust and confidence for the eu to put its money into china .
the two powers are also coming closer on climate change as its effects are felt in china and we can not deny that china is doing something about it even if we think it is not enough .
but the big question is how mature the relationship is .
this is another matter . " author : nick amies editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the surprise result is certain to embarrass the government and dismay the country 's muslim minority . the swiss news agency ats and other media outlets report that a clear majority , 57.5 percent of voters and all but four of switzerland 's 26 cantons approved the proposal in this nationwide referendum .
of eligible voters , 53 percent turned out to vote . the government has said it will respect the decision of the people and would no longer permit the construction of new minarets in switzerland , but tried to assure the muslim minority that the ban was " not a rejection of the muslim community , religion or culture . " " muslims in switzerland are able to practice their religion alone or in community with others and live according to their beliefs just as before , " it said in a statement . the right-wing swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- , switzerland 's biggest party , was the driving force behind the referendum , along with the conservative federal democratic union .
they succeeded in gathering 100,000 signatures within 18 months , which is needed to call a referendum under swiss law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban supporters say that minarets - like this one in geneva - represent claims to power the svp said switzerland 's four existing minarets are not mere architectural features on religious buildings but represent a " political-religious claim to power , which challenges fundamental rights . " " we 're enormously happy , " said walter wobmann , president of the initiative committee .
" it is a victory for this people , this switzerland , this freedom and those who want a democratic society . " earlier , he had told reuters that the goal was to stop " further islamization in switzerland . " " people may practice their religion , that is no problem , " he said . muslim dismay some 400,000 muslims live in switzerland , making them the nation 's second largest religious group . " the most painful for us is not the minaret ban , but the symbol sent by this vote , " said farhad afshar , head of the coordination of islamic organizations in switzerland .
" muslims do not feel accepted as a religious community . " nadia karmous , president of the cultural association of muslim women in switzerland , told le temps newspaper : " i feel sad for switzerland .

but if europe is not to lose ground , the opinion of experts in europe and china is that the eu should at least try and match us offers of cooperation and trump them with actual concrete action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china wants the eu to get its act together as a partner " during a high level meeting in beijing last week , we got a very clear signal from the chinese leadership , " holslag told deutsche welle .
" premier wen jiabao and state counselor dai bingguo explained that china attaches a lot of importance to cooperation with europe and that it should not worry about a g2 .
but for the chinese , the ball is in our court now .
they want us to prove that we can get our act together and come up with a pragmatic agenda for cooperation .
if the eu can add no value to china 's essentially commercial relations with individual member states , there will not be a strategic partnership . " paul lim , a senior academic adviser at the european institute for asian studies in brussels , said that china would pick up on any concern within europe in relation to its position as a partner and could possibly play the eu and us off against each other .
but he also said china needs both powers for very different reasons . " the us , with its history of relations with asia , its presence in asia makes it a more important partner than the eu , " lim told deutsche welle .
" the eu with its soft power which it can use to great influence is still young , and is new in the game .
it all boils down to how much of a common voice the eu projects .
china will want an ally on certain issues with the eu in relation to the us and the eu will want an ally in the us on certain issues with china .
i do not see the eu losing any influence with china and i 'm sure that the us and eu will not allow china to play them against each other . "
obama 's pragmatism could bode ill for eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has opened the path to greater dialogue with beijing president obama 's visit was the first example of the current administration 's desire to engage with china and the importance it attached to china and the wider asian region as a key strategic partner .
while there were few breakthroughs to make the europeans nervous , obama came away from beijing with the paths to dialog firmly open and as such , moved the us into a position which could undermine europe 's influence in future . " chinese aid is much needed to keep the american economy afloat and to stabilize afghanistan , " holslag said .
" this has cautioned obama during his visit .
if the united states continues to opt for more pragmatism , this would certainly weaken europe 's bargaining position when it comes to human rights , economic liberalization and other challenges . "
to lag behind in relations and cooperation with the chinese could be damaging to the eu .
china 's new global influence through investment in africa and elsewhere , its growing economic muscle and its position as a major player in global issues such as iran and north korea , as well as climate change , makes the people 's republic a partner to neglect at peril . lack of action damaging eu reputation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen jinbao wants to see more action from barrosso 's eu what could prove damaging is china 's concern that the eu can talk a good partnership but is showing a lack of commitment when it comes to putting these words into practice in areas where eu-sino relations have been traditionally strong . " while trade has always been the main driver of sino-european cooperation , this has now become one of the main sources of friction , " holslag said .
" it is clear that europe 's failure to innovate its industries is leading to more sensitivity of competition from countries like china . " on the international scene we both have a joint interest in stabilizing africa , securing central asia and promoting multilateral cooperation , " he added .
" but joint interests do not automatically lead to cooperation .
growing assertiveness makes beijing more eager to promote its own values , while the eu is not proving itself as a strong player . " calls for reform turning opinion against europe where the eu continues to hold a strong hand is in its dedication to democracy and human rights .
the european union has long been a strong advocate of reform in china and has never missed an opportunity to make its feelings known .
in most cases china has responded respectfully but has given few concrete indicators that eu pressure alone is enough to force through radical change .
as a result , europe continues to press beijing in the hope that persistence will win out in the end . in fact , the eu 's regular advocating of democratic and social reform in china is beginning to turn opinion within the people 's republic , leading some within the chinese government to suggest that europe should put its own house in order fist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's constant calls for reform start to annoy china " traditionally the chinese are concerned about ' saving their face ' , " holslag said .
" but let us not forget that the pro-europe camp in beijing is losing ground .
leaders like premier wen have come under quite a lot of pressure from political hardliners and the public opinion .
china has become less tolerant of european lecturing .
as a result , we might even expect more chinese criticism on the eu 's weak performance in the combat against climate change , its deplorable economic situation or its lack of political coherence . " despite the uncertain climate between europe and china , paul lim believes that the current level of financial commitment and strategic cooperation between the two powers is enough to look towards the future with guarded optimism . " the future of eu-china cooperation depends on maturity of relations , of respect , of being able to accept criticisms , and an understanding of each other 's culture . " said lim .
" however , right now , there has to be a certain degree of closeness , of trust and confidence for the eu to put its money into china .
the two powers are also coming closer on climate change as its effects are felt in china and we can not deny that china is doing something about it even if we think it is not enough .
but the big question is how mature the relationship is .

but if europe is not to lose ground , the opinion of experts in europe and china is that the eu should at least try and match us offers of cooperation and trump them with actual concrete action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china wants the eu to get its act together as a partner " during a high level meeting in beijing last week , we got a very clear signal from the chinese leadership , " holslag told deutsche welle .
" premier wen jiabao and state counselor dai bingguo explained that china attaches a lot of importance to cooperation with europe and that it should not worry about a g2 .
but for the chinese , the ball is in our court now .
they want us to prove that we can get our act together and come up with a pragmatic agenda for cooperation .
if the eu can add no value to china 's essentially commercial relations with individual member states , there will not be a strategic partnership . " paul lim , a senior academic adviser at the european institute for asian studies in brussels , said that china would pick up on any concern within europe in relation to its position as a partner and could possibly play the eu and us off against each other .
but he also said china needs both powers for very different reasons . " the us , with its history of relations with asia , its presence in asia makes it a more important partner than the eu , " lim told deutsche welle .
" the eu with its soft power which it can use to great influence is still young , and is new in the game .
it all boils down to how much of a common voice the eu projects .
china will want an ally on certain issues with the eu in relation to the us and the eu will want an ally in the us on certain issues with china .
i do not see the eu losing any influence with china and i 'm sure that the us and eu will not allow china to play them against each other . "
obama 's pragmatism could bode ill for eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has opened the path to greater dialogue with beijing president obama 's visit was the first example of the current administration 's desire to engage with china and the importance it attached to china and the wider asian region as a key strategic partner .
while there were few breakthroughs to make the europeans nervous , obama came away from beijing with the paths to dialog firmly open and as such , moved the us into a position which could undermine europe 's influence in future . " chinese aid is much needed to keep the american economy afloat and to stabilize afghanistan , " holslag said .
" this has cautioned obama during his visit .
if the united states continues to opt for more pragmatism , this would certainly weaken europe 's bargaining position when it comes to human rights , economic liberalization and other challenges . "
to lag behind in relations and cooperation with the chinese could be damaging to the eu .
china 's new global influence through investment in africa and elsewhere , its growing economic muscle and its position as a major player in global issues such as iran and north korea , as well as climate change , makes the people 's republic a partner to neglect at peril . lack of action damaging eu reputation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen jinbao wants to see more action from barrosso 's eu what could prove damaging is china 's concern that the eu can talk a good partnership but is showing a lack of commitment when it comes to putting these words into practice in areas where eu-sino relations have been traditionally strong . " while trade has always been the main driver of sino-european cooperation , this has now become one of the main sources of friction , " holslag said .
" it is clear that europe 's failure to innovate its industries is leading to more sensitivity of competition from countries like china . " on the international scene we both have a joint interest in stabilizing africa , securing central asia and promoting multilateral cooperation , " he added .
" but joint interests do not automatically lead to cooperation .
growing assertiveness makes beijing more eager to promote its own values , while the eu is not proving itself as a strong player . " calls for reform turning opinion against europe where the eu continues to hold a strong hand is in its dedication to democracy and human rights .
the european union has long been a strong advocate of reform in china and has never missed an opportunity to make its feelings known .
in most cases china has responded respectfully but has given few concrete indicators that eu pressure alone is enough to force through radical change .
as a result , europe continues to press beijing in the hope that persistence will win out in the end . in fact , the eu 's regular advocating of democratic and social reform in china is beginning to turn opinion within the people 's republic , leading some within the chinese government to suggest that europe should put its own house in order fist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's constant calls for reform start to annoy china " traditionally the chinese are concerned about ' saving their face ' , " holslag said .
" but let us not forget that the pro-europe camp in beijing is losing ground .
leaders like premier wen have come under quite a lot of pressure from political hardliners and the public opinion .
china has become less tolerant of european lecturing .
as a result , we might even expect more chinese criticism on the eu 's weak performance in the combat against climate change , its deplorable economic situation or its lack of political coherence . " despite the uncertain climate between europe and china , paul lim believes that the current level of financial commitment and strategic cooperation between the two powers is enough to look towards the future with guarded optimism . " the future of eu-china cooperation depends on maturity of relations , of respect , of being able to accept criticisms , and an understanding of each other 's culture . " said lim .
" however , right now , there has to be a certain degree of closeness , of trust and confidence for the eu to put its money into china .
the two powers are also coming closer on climate change as its effects are felt in china and we can not deny that china is doing something about it even if we think it is not enough .
but the big question is how mature the relationship is .

but if europe is not to lose ground , the opinion of experts in europe and china is that the eu should at least try and match us offers of cooperation and trump them with actual concrete action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china wants the eu to get its act together as a partner " during a high level meeting in beijing last week , we got a very clear signal from the chinese leadership , " holslag told deutsche welle .
" premier wen jiabao and state counselor dai bingguo explained that china attaches a lot of importance to cooperation with europe and that it should not worry about a g2 .
but for the chinese , the ball is in our court now .
they want us to prove that we can get our act together and come up with a pragmatic agenda for cooperation .
if the eu can add no value to china 's essentially commercial relations with individual member states , there will not be a strategic partnership . " paul lim , a senior academic adviser at the european institute for asian studies in brussels , said that china would pick up on any concern within europe in relation to its position as a partner and could possibly play the eu and us off against each other .
but he also said china needs both powers for very different reasons . " the us , with its history of relations with asia , its presence in asia makes it a more important partner than the eu , " lim told deutsche welle .
" the eu with its soft power which it can use to great influence is still young , and is new in the game .
it all boils down to how much of a common voice the eu projects .
china will want an ally on certain issues with the eu in relation to the us and the eu will want an ally in the us on certain issues with china .
i do not see the eu losing any influence with china and i 'm sure that the us and eu will not allow china to play them against each other . "
obama 's pragmatism could bode ill for eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has opened the path to greater dialogue with beijing president obama 's visit was the first example of the current administration 's desire to engage with china and the importance it attached to china and the wider asian region as a key strategic partner .
while there were few breakthroughs to make the europeans nervous , obama came away from beijing with the paths to dialog firmly open and as such , moved the us into a position which could undermine europe 's influence in future . " chinese aid is much needed to keep the american economy afloat and to stabilize afghanistan , " holslag said .
" this has cautioned obama during his visit .
if the united states continues to opt for more pragmatism , this would certainly weaken europe 's bargaining position when it comes to human rights , economic liberalization and other challenges . "
to lag behind in relations and cooperation with the chinese could be damaging to the eu .
china 's new global influence through investment in africa and elsewhere , its growing economic muscle and its position as a major player in global issues such as iran and north korea , as well as climate change , makes the people 's republic a partner to neglect at peril . lack of action damaging eu reputation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen jinbao wants to see more action from barrosso 's eu what could prove damaging is china 's concern that the eu can talk a good partnership but is showing a lack of commitment when it comes to putting these words into practice in areas where eu-sino relations have been traditionally strong . " while trade has always been the main driver of sino-european cooperation , this has now become one of the main sources of friction , " holslag said .
" it is clear that europe 's failure to innovate its industries is leading to more sensitivity of competition from countries like china . " on the international scene we both have a joint interest in stabilizing africa , securing central asia and promoting multilateral cooperation , " he added .
" but joint interests do not automatically lead to cooperation .
growing assertiveness makes beijing more eager to promote its own values , while the eu is not proving itself as a strong player . " calls for reform turning opinion against europe where the eu continues to hold a strong hand is in its dedication to democracy and human rights .
the european union has long been a strong advocate of reform in china and has never missed an opportunity to make its feelings known .
in most cases china has responded respectfully but has given few concrete indicators that eu pressure alone is enough to force through radical change .
as a result , europe continues to press beijing in the hope that persistence will win out in the end . in fact , the eu 's regular advocating of democratic and social reform in china is beginning to turn opinion within the people 's republic , leading some within the chinese government to suggest that europe should put its own house in order fist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's constant calls for reform start to annoy china " traditionally the chinese are concerned about ' saving their face ' , " holslag said .
" but let us not forget that the pro-europe camp in beijing is losing ground .
leaders like premier wen have come under quite a lot of pressure from political hardliners and the public opinion .
china has become less tolerant of european lecturing .
as a result , we might even expect more chinese criticism on the eu 's weak performance in the combat against climate change , its deplorable economic situation or its lack of political coherence . " despite the uncertain climate between europe and china , paul lim believes that the current level of financial commitment and strategic cooperation between the two powers is enough to look towards the future with guarded optimism . " the future of eu-china cooperation depends on maturity of relations , of respect , of being able to accept criticisms , and an understanding of each other 's culture . " said lim .
" however , right now , there has to be a certain degree of closeness , of trust and confidence for the eu to put its money into china .
the two powers are also coming closer on climate change as its effects are felt in china and we can not deny that china is doing something about it even if we think it is not enough .
but the big question is how mature the relationship is .
this is another matter . " author : nick amies editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the surprise result is certain to embarrass the government and dismay the country 's muslim minority . the swiss news agency ats and other media outlets report that a clear majority , 57.5 percent of voters and all but four of switzerland 's 26 cantons approved the proposal in this nationwide referendum .
of eligible voters , 53 percent turned out to vote . the government has said it will respect the decision of the people and would no longer permit the construction of new minarets in switzerland , but tried to assure the muslim minority that the ban was " not a rejection of the muslim community , religion or culture . " " muslims in switzerland are able to practice their religion alone or in community with others and live according to their beliefs just as before , " it said in a statement . the right-wing swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- , switzerland 's biggest party , was the driving force behind the referendum , along with the conservative federal democratic union .
they succeeded in gathering 100,000 signatures within 18 months , which is needed to call a referendum under swiss law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban supporters say that minarets - like this one in geneva - represent claims to power the svp said switzerland 's four existing minarets are not mere architectural features on religious buildings but represent a " political-religious claim to power , which challenges fundamental rights . " " we 're enormously happy , " said walter wobmann , president of the initiative committee .
" it is a victory for this people , this switzerland , this freedom and those who want a democratic society . " earlier , he had told reuters that the goal was to stop " further islamization in switzerland . " " people may practice their religion , that is no problem , " he said . muslim dismay some 400,000 muslims live in switzerland , making them the nation 's second largest religious group . " the most painful for us is not the minaret ban , but the symbol sent by this vote , " said farhad afshar , head of the coordination of islamic organizations in switzerland .
" muslims do not feel accepted as a religious community . " nadia karmous , president of the cultural association of muslim women in switzerland , told le temps newspaper : " i feel sad for switzerland .
imagine the impact abroad .
the image of the -lrb- country -rrb- is already that of a racist country . " the conference of swiss bishops also criticized the result , saying that it " heightens the problems of cohabitation between religions and cultures . " direct democracy the referendum was held using switzerland 's system of " direct democracy , " which allows individuals and groups to propose laws which are then put to a public ballot , bypassing parliament . bildunterschrift : the svp 's referendum poster has been criticized as " sinister " and " racist " the collective executive branch of the government - the swiss federal council - criticized the vote , saying it could damage switzerland 's image in the arab world , and make the country appear intolerant of religious diversity . the government had encouraged swiss people to vote against the ban . " muslims should be able to practice their religion and have access to minarets in switzerland , too , " president hans-rudolf merz said in a last-minute video broadcast to the nation .
" but the call of the muezzin will not sound here . " foreign minister micheline calmy-rey said she was " shocked " and " deeply regretted " the outcome , which she said had to be seen in the context of globalization and the economic crisis .

china 's new global influence through investment in africa and elsewhere , its growing economic muscle and its position as a major player in global issues such as iran and north korea , as well as climate change , makes the people 's republic a partner to neglect at peril . lack of action damaging eu reputation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen jinbao wants to see more action from barrosso 's eu what could prove damaging is china 's concern that the eu can talk a good partnership but is showing a lack of commitment when it comes to putting these words into practice in areas where eu-sino relations have been traditionally strong . " while trade has always been the main driver of sino-european cooperation , this has now become one of the main sources of friction , " holslag said .
" it is clear that europe 's failure to innovate its industries is leading to more sensitivity of competition from countries like china . " on the international scene we both have a joint interest in stabilizing africa , securing central asia and promoting multilateral cooperation , " he added .
" but joint interests do not automatically lead to cooperation .
growing assertiveness makes beijing more eager to promote its own values , while the eu is not proving itself as a strong player . " calls for reform turning opinion against europe where the eu continues to hold a strong hand is in its dedication to democracy and human rights .
the european union has long been a strong advocate of reform in china and has never missed an opportunity to make its feelings known .
in most cases china has responded respectfully but has given few concrete indicators that eu pressure alone is enough to force through radical change .
as a result , europe continues to press beijing in the hope that persistence will win out in the end . in fact , the eu 's regular advocating of democratic and social reform in china is beginning to turn opinion within the people 's republic , leading some within the chinese government to suggest that europe should put its own house in order fist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's constant calls for reform start to annoy china " traditionally the chinese are concerned about ' saving their face ' , " holslag said .
" but let us not forget that the pro-europe camp in beijing is losing ground .
leaders like premier wen have come under quite a lot of pressure from political hardliners and the public opinion .
china has become less tolerant of european lecturing .
as a result , we might even expect more chinese criticism on the eu 's weak performance in the combat against climate change , its deplorable economic situation or its lack of political coherence . " despite the uncertain climate between europe and china , paul lim believes that the current level of financial commitment and strategic cooperation between the two powers is enough to look towards the future with guarded optimism . " the future of eu-china cooperation depends on maturity of relations , of respect , of being able to accept criticisms , and an understanding of each other 's culture . " said lim .
" however , right now , there has to be a certain degree of closeness , of trust and confidence for the eu to put its money into china .
the two powers are also coming closer on climate change as its effects are felt in china and we can not deny that china is doing something about it even if we think it is not enough .
but the big question is how mature the relationship is .
this is another matter . " author : nick amies editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the surprise result is certain to embarrass the government and dismay the country 's muslim minority . the swiss news agency ats and other media outlets report that a clear majority , 57.5 percent of voters and all but four of switzerland 's 26 cantons approved the proposal in this nationwide referendum .
of eligible voters , 53 percent turned out to vote . the government has said it will respect the decision of the people and would no longer permit the construction of new minarets in switzerland , but tried to assure the muslim minority that the ban was " not a rejection of the muslim community , religion or culture . " " muslims in switzerland are able to practice their religion alone or in community with others and live according to their beliefs just as before , " it said in a statement . the right-wing swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- , switzerland 's biggest party , was the driving force behind the referendum , along with the conservative federal democratic union .
they succeeded in gathering 100,000 signatures within 18 months , which is needed to call a referendum under swiss law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban supporters say that minarets - like this one in geneva - represent claims to power the svp said switzerland 's four existing minarets are not mere architectural features on religious buildings but represent a " political-religious claim to power , which challenges fundamental rights . " " we 're enormously happy , " said walter wobmann , president of the initiative committee .
" it is a victory for this people , this switzerland , this freedom and those who want a democratic society . " earlier , he had told reuters that the goal was to stop " further islamization in switzerland . " " people may practice their religion , that is no problem , " he said . muslim dismay some 400,000 muslims live in switzerland , making them the nation 's second largest religious group . " the most painful for us is not the minaret ban , but the symbol sent by this vote , " said farhad afshar , head of the coordination of islamic organizations in switzerland .
" muslims do not feel accepted as a religious community . " nadia karmous , president of the cultural association of muslim women in switzerland , told le temps newspaper : " i feel sad for switzerland .
imagine the impact abroad .
the image of the -lrb- country -rrb- is already that of a racist country . " the conference of swiss bishops also criticized the result , saying that it " heightens the problems of cohabitation between religions and cultures . " direct democracy the referendum was held using switzerland 's system of " direct democracy , " which allows individuals and groups to propose laws which are then put to a public ballot , bypassing parliament . bildunterschrift : the svp 's referendum poster has been criticized as " sinister " and " racist " the collective executive branch of the government - the swiss federal council - criticized the vote , saying it could damage switzerland 's image in the arab world , and make the country appear intolerant of religious diversity . the government had encouraged swiss people to vote against the ban . " muslims should be able to practice their religion and have access to minarets in switzerland , too , " president hans-rudolf merz said in a last-minute video broadcast to the nation .
" but the call of the muezzin will not sound here . " foreign minister micheline calmy-rey said she was " shocked " and " deeply regretted " the outcome , which she said had to be seen in the context of globalization and the economic crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 29.11.2009 in russian arctic , global warming threatens traditional way of life großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 'll soon get colder again , some russian scientists say russian scientists have doubts over whether global warming is here to stay and whether it 's man made .
but for the saami in russia 's north , the mild winters already pose a threat to their traditional way of life . all around the arctic , the effects of a temperature rise are visible , and native inhabitants of the tundras in europa , asia and north america are struggling with the new reality .
that 's also true for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula , an area bordering on norway and finnish lapland .
but , in russia , climate change is not a hot-button issue , nor is much attention being paid to the upcoming climate summit in copenhagen .
russian scientists say they have no evidence that global warming is a long-term trend , and doubt whether it is a man-made phenomenon . a little ice age ?
in the country 's northern port in the town of murmansk , the marine biological institute of the russian academy of sciences monitors life in and around the barents sea .
the institute has amassed an impressive database concerning temperature and salinity of the sea over the course of the 20th century .
referring to the statistics , biologist pavel makarevich says there are clear cycles during which both temperature and salinity rise and fall . these cycles , he says , are related to solar activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murmansk is russia 's gateway to the arctic waters " in my opinion and that of our institute , the problems connected to the current stage of warming are being exaggerated , " he says .
" what we are dealing with is not a global warming of the atmosphere or of the oceans . "
makarevich expects a normalization of arctic temperatures in the coming years .
this view appears to have the support of a growing number of russian scientists .
some even predict a temporary cooling of temperatures towards the middle of this century , a phenomenon known as a " little ice age . "
shorter winters but for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula between the barents and the white sea , a drop in temperature is urgently needed .
over the last few years , the winters have become milder and milder , threatening the traditional lifestyle of the saami .
this year again , the onset of winter was late in northern russia .
normally , the tundra would already be covered by a deep layer of snow , and the numerous lakes would have a thick layer of ice .
but snow cover is minimal and some of the lakes are not even frozen yet .
for native reindeer herders , that 's a problem , because the traditional slaughter season has to be postponed .
" the slaughter used to start in early november , " says herder nikolai filippov .
" at that time , the ice is usually strong enough to carry the reindeer .
but over the past few years , the ice has been weak and sparse , so we can not travel , and the slaughter has to be postponed until just before the new year .
this year , yields will be minimal . "
each fall , the big reindeer herds are somewhere on the vast expanses of the kola peninsula .
at the onset of winter , they have to be found and driven to lovozero , the center of the russian saami community .
but that can only happen under true winter conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indigenous saami people depend on reindeer for their living " last year it was exactly the same .
this year we do not know yet how the herds are , and what will happen later in the autumn , " filippov says .
" sometimes it is still raining around the new year , and you can not go over bare ice with the reindeer .
so then you will have to wait until after the new year .
in fact , the winter only starts in january .
for now it is a mixture of frost and thaw . "
the capricious weather has all kinds of practical consequences for the everyday life of the saami .
nikolai filippov and his wife maria live in a chum , a traditional saami tipi-like tent with a hole in the top to let out the smoke .
maria used to prepare lots of food for the winter .
but now that is out of the question , because the thaw often comes in the middle of winter and the meat can no longer be preserved .
the tundra is no longer a reliable natural refrigerator .
" in the old days it never rained in december , " says maria filippova .
" when it rains in winter , the snow disappears and we ca n't move on with our animals to search for reindeer moss . "
for thousands of years , the saami lived according to an ancient and extremely reliable calendar .
but today , says nikolai filippov , everything seems to be off course .
for him , there is no question that nature is changing .
what is happening in the tundra today is something the 59-year-old has never seen before .
the arctic as a future trading route the city of murmansk , a few hours ' drive to the north , seems a world away .
in the harbor , there 's the lenin - the first soviet nuclear-powered icebreaker built in the 1950s .
today , the heavy vessel is a museum .
andrei smirnov was the lenin 's last captain when the ship was retired in 1989 .
" no other country has boundaries like russia that stretch so far to the north , " smirnov says .
he is convinced that russia will need icebreakers like this one , now and in the future .
" we have been using the northern passage since 1932 .
it is a sea route of national significance , and since 1991 , foreign ships have also been allowed to use it .
this year as well , foreigners have used the passage , and we have successfully guided them through with our icebreakers . "
smirnov is referring to ships belonging to the german company beluga .
earlier this year , they made an impressive voyage from south korea to rotterdam , via the arctic seas north of russia .
bildunterschrift : this year , two ships from the german company , beluga , completed the trip around russia 's north .
the northern passage could become an alternative to existing routes the trip was meant to prove that the north pole ice is retreating as a result of global warming , and that the northern passage could become an attractive , much shorter alternative for existing routes like the one via the suez canal .
it sounds great , but longtime members of russia 's northern fleet , such as nikolai babich , can only laugh at the thought ..
" saying that one could navigate in the polar seas without the help of icebreakers , or even reach the north pole unhindered , no , that is not serious , " says babich .
babich feels at home in the russian arctic .
he has visited almost every corner of it during the last 40 years , and he claims there is no-one like him who has studied the area in such detail .
the recent rise in global temperature has surprised neither him nor his colleagues .
it has happened in the past , he says , and it will happen again .
" the natural processes we have seen during the past decade are mainly the result of the sun 's activity .
they show a slight increase in temperature , and as a result , arctic ice has receded , " he says .
but according to babich , the situation is changing .
the arctic , he says , is already cooling , not warming .
and the russian government is attentively listening to those scientists who , like babich , are predicting a cold spell .

at the onset of winter , they have to be found and driven to lovozero , the center of the russian saami community .
but that can only happen under true winter conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indigenous saami people depend on reindeer for their living " last year it was exactly the same .
this year we do not know yet how the herds are , and what will happen later in the autumn , " filippov says .
" sometimes it is still raining around the new year , and you can not go over bare ice with the reindeer .
so then you will have to wait until after the new year .
in fact , the winter only starts in january .
for now it is a mixture of frost and thaw . "
the capricious weather has all kinds of practical consequences for the everyday life of the saami .
nikolai filippov and his wife maria live in a chum , a traditional saami tipi-like tent with a hole in the top to let out the smoke .
maria used to prepare lots of food for the winter .
but now that is out of the question , because the thaw often comes in the middle of winter and the meat can no longer be preserved .
the tundra is no longer a reliable natural refrigerator .
" in the old days it never rained in december , " says maria filippova .
" when it rains in winter , the snow disappears and we ca n't move on with our animals to search for reindeer moss . "
for thousands of years , the saami lived according to an ancient and extremely reliable calendar .
but today , says nikolai filippov , everything seems to be off course .
for him , there is no question that nature is changing .
what is happening in the tundra today is something the 59-year-old has never seen before .
the arctic as a future trading route the city of murmansk , a few hours ' drive to the north , seems a world away .
in the harbor , there 's the lenin - the first soviet nuclear-powered icebreaker built in the 1950s .
today , the heavy vessel is a museum .
andrei smirnov was the lenin 's last captain when the ship was retired in 1989 .
" no other country has boundaries like russia that stretch so far to the north , " smirnov says .
he is convinced that russia will need icebreakers like this one , now and in the future .
" we have been using the northern passage since 1932 .
it is a sea route of national significance , and since 1991 , foreign ships have also been allowed to use it .
this year as well , foreigners have used the passage , and we have successfully guided them through with our icebreakers . "
smirnov is referring to ships belonging to the german company beluga .
earlier this year , they made an impressive voyage from south korea to rotterdam , via the arctic seas north of russia .
bildunterschrift : this year , two ships from the german company , beluga , completed the trip around russia 's north .
the northern passage could become an alternative to existing routes the trip was meant to prove that the north pole ice is retreating as a result of global warming , and that the northern passage could become an attractive , much shorter alternative for existing routes like the one via the suez canal .
it sounds great , but longtime members of russia 's northern fleet , such as nikolai babich , can only laugh at the thought ..
" saying that one could navigate in the polar seas without the help of icebreakers , or even reach the north pole unhindered , no , that is not serious , " says babich .
babich feels at home in the russian arctic .
he has visited almost every corner of it during the last 40 years , and he claims there is no-one like him who has studied the area in such detail .
the recent rise in global temperature has surprised neither him nor his colleagues .
it has happened in the past , he says , and it will happen again .
" the natural processes we have seen during the past decade are mainly the result of the sun 's activity .
they show a slight increase in temperature , and as a result , arctic ice has receded , " he says .
but according to babich , the situation is changing .
the arctic , he says , is already cooling , not warming .
and the russian government is attentively listening to those scientists who , like babich , are predicting a cold spell .

but for the saami in russia 's north , the mild winters already pose a threat to their traditional way of life . all around the arctic , the effects of a temperature rise are visible , and native inhabitants of the tundras in europa , asia and north america are struggling with the new reality .
that 's also true for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula , an area bordering on norway and finnish lapland .
but , in russia , climate change is not a hot-button issue , nor is much attention being paid to the upcoming climate summit in copenhagen .
russian scientists say they have no evidence that global warming is a long-term trend , and doubt whether it is a man-made phenomenon . a little ice age ?
in the country 's northern port in the town of murmansk , the marine biological institute of the russian academy of sciences monitors life in and around the barents sea .
the institute has amassed an impressive database concerning temperature and salinity of the sea over the course of the 20th century .
referring to the statistics , biologist pavel makarevich says there are clear cycles during which both temperature and salinity rise and fall . these cycles , he says , are related to solar activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murmansk is russia 's gateway to the arctic waters " in my opinion and that of our institute , the problems connected to the current stage of warming are being exaggerated , " he says .
" what we are dealing with is not a global warming of the atmosphere or of the oceans . "
makarevich expects a normalization of arctic temperatures in the coming years .
this view appears to have the support of a growing number of russian scientists .
some even predict a temporary cooling of temperatures towards the middle of this century , a phenomenon known as a " little ice age . "
shorter winters but for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula between the barents and the white sea , a drop in temperature is urgently needed .
over the last few years , the winters have become milder and milder , threatening the traditional lifestyle of the saami .
this year again , the onset of winter was late in northern russia .
normally , the tundra would already be covered by a deep layer of snow , and the numerous lakes would have a thick layer of ice .
but snow cover is minimal and some of the lakes are not even frozen yet .
for native reindeer herders , that 's a problem , because the traditional slaughter season has to be postponed .
" the slaughter used to start in early november , " says herder nikolai filippov .
" at that time , the ice is usually strong enough to carry the reindeer .
but over the past few years , the ice has been weak and sparse , so we can not travel , and the slaughter has to be postponed until just before the new year .
this year , yields will be minimal . "
each fall , the big reindeer herds are somewhere on the vast expanses of the kola peninsula .
at the onset of winter , they have to be found and driven to lovozero , the center of the russian saami community .

but today , says nikolai filippov , everything seems to be off course .
for him , there is no question that nature is changing .
what is happening in the tundra today is something the 59-year-old has never seen before .
the arctic as a future trading route the city of murmansk , a few hours ' drive to the north , seems a world away .
in the harbor , there 's the lenin - the first soviet nuclear-powered icebreaker built in the 1950s .
today , the heavy vessel is a museum .
andrei smirnov was the lenin 's last captain when the ship was retired in 1989 .
" no other country has boundaries like russia that stretch so far to the north , " smirnov says .
he is convinced that russia will need icebreakers like this one , now and in the future .
" we have been using the northern passage since 1932 .
it is a sea route of national significance , and since 1991 , foreign ships have also been allowed to use it .
this year as well , foreigners have used the passage , and we have successfully guided them through with our icebreakers . "
smirnov is referring to ships belonging to the german company beluga .
earlier this year , they made an impressive voyage from south korea to rotterdam , via the arctic seas north of russia .
bildunterschrift : this year , two ships from the german company , beluga , completed the trip around russia 's north .
the northern passage could become an alternative to existing routes the trip was meant to prove that the north pole ice is retreating as a result of global warming , and that the northern passage could become an attractive , much shorter alternative for existing routes like the one via the suez canal .
it sounds great , but longtime members of russia 's northern fleet , such as nikolai babich , can only laugh at the thought ..
" saying that one could navigate in the polar seas without the help of icebreakers , or even reach the north pole unhindered , no , that is not serious , " says babich .
babich feels at home in the russian arctic .
he has visited almost every corner of it during the last 40 years , and he claims there is no-one like him who has studied the area in such detail .
the recent rise in global temperature has surprised neither him nor his colleagues .
it has happened in the past , he says , and it will happen again .
" the natural processes we have seen during the past decade are mainly the result of the sun 's activity .
they show a slight increase in temperature , and as a result , arctic ice has receded , " he says .
but according to babich , the situation is changing .
the arctic , he says , is already cooling , not warming .
and the russian government is attentively listening to those scientists who , like babich , are predicting a cold spell .

but for the saami in russia 's north , the mild winters already pose a threat to their traditional way of life . all around the arctic , the effects of a temperature rise are visible , and native inhabitants of the tundras in europa , asia and north america are struggling with the new reality .
that 's also true for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula , an area bordering on norway and finnish lapland .
but , in russia , climate change is not a hot-button issue , nor is much attention being paid to the upcoming climate summit in copenhagen .
russian scientists say they have no evidence that global warming is a long-term trend , and doubt whether it is a man-made phenomenon . a little ice age ?
in the country 's northern port in the town of murmansk , the marine biological institute of the russian academy of sciences monitors life in and around the barents sea .
the institute has amassed an impressive database concerning temperature and salinity of the sea over the course of the 20th century .
referring to the statistics , biologist pavel makarevich says there are clear cycles during which both temperature and salinity rise and fall . these cycles , he says , are related to solar activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murmansk is russia 's gateway to the arctic waters " in my opinion and that of our institute , the problems connected to the current stage of warming are being exaggerated , " he says .
" what we are dealing with is not a global warming of the atmosphere or of the oceans . "
makarevich expects a normalization of arctic temperatures in the coming years .
this view appears to have the support of a growing number of russian scientists .
some even predict a temporary cooling of temperatures towards the middle of this century , a phenomenon known as a " little ice age . "
shorter winters but for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula between the barents and the white sea , a drop in temperature is urgently needed .
over the last few years , the winters have become milder and milder , threatening the traditional lifestyle of the saami .
this year again , the onset of winter was late in northern russia .
normally , the tundra would already be covered by a deep layer of snow , and the numerous lakes would have a thick layer of ice .
but snow cover is minimal and some of the lakes are not even frozen yet .
for native reindeer herders , that 's a problem , because the traditional slaughter season has to be postponed .
" the slaughter used to start in early november , " says herder nikolai filippov .
" at that time , the ice is usually strong enough to carry the reindeer .
but over the past few years , the ice has been weak and sparse , so we can not travel , and the slaughter has to be postponed until just before the new year .
this year , yields will be minimal . "
each fall , the big reindeer herds are somewhere on the vast expanses of the kola peninsula .
at the onset of winter , they have to be found and driven to lovozero , the center of the russian saami community .
but that can only happen under true winter conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indigenous saami people depend on reindeer for their living " last year it was exactly the same .
this year we do not know yet how the herds are , and what will happen later in the autumn , " filippov says .
" sometimes it is still raining around the new year , and you can not go over bare ice with the reindeer .
so then you will have to wait until after the new year .
in fact , the winter only starts in january .
for now it is a mixture of frost and thaw . "
the capricious weather has all kinds of practical consequences for the everyday life of the saami .
nikolai filippov and his wife maria live in a chum , a traditional saami tipi-like tent with a hole in the top to let out the smoke .
maria used to prepare lots of food for the winter .
but now that is out of the question , because the thaw often comes in the middle of winter and the meat can no longer be preserved .
the tundra is no longer a reliable natural refrigerator .
" in the old days it never rained in december , " says maria filippova .
" when it rains in winter , the snow disappears and we ca n't move on with our animals to search for reindeer moss . "
for thousands of years , the saami lived according to an ancient and extremely reliable calendar .

the surprise result is certain to embarrass the government and dismay the country 's muslim minority . the swiss news agency ats and other media outlets report that a clear majority , 57.5 percent of voters and all but four of switzerland 's 26 cantons approved the proposal in this nationwide referendum .
of eligible voters , 53 percent turned out to vote . the government has said it will respect the decision of the people and would no longer permit the construction of new minarets in switzerland , but tried to assure the muslim minority that the ban was " not a rejection of the muslim community , religion or culture . " " muslims in switzerland are able to practice their religion alone or in community with others and live according to their beliefs just as before , " it said in a statement . the right-wing swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- , switzerland 's biggest party , was the driving force behind the referendum , along with the conservative federal democratic union .
they succeeded in gathering 100,000 signatures within 18 months , which is needed to call a referendum under swiss law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban supporters say that minarets - like this one in geneva - represent claims to power the svp said switzerland 's four existing minarets are not mere architectural features on religious buildings but represent a " political-religious claim to power , which challenges fundamental rights .

" it is a victory for this people , this switzerland , this freedom and those who want a democratic society . " earlier , he had told reuters that the goal was to stop " further islamization in switzerland . " " people may practice their religion , that is no problem , " he said . muslim dismay some 400,000 muslims live in switzerland , making them the nation 's second largest religious group . " the most painful for us is not the minaret ban , but the symbol sent by this vote , " said farhad afshar , head of the coordination of islamic organizations in switzerland .
" muslims do not feel accepted as a religious community . " nadia karmous , president of the cultural association of muslim women in switzerland , told le temps newspaper : " i feel sad for switzerland .
imagine the impact abroad .
the image of the -lrb- country -rrb- is already that of a racist country . " the conference of swiss bishops also criticized the result , saying that it " heightens the problems of cohabitation between religions and cultures . " direct democracy the referendum was held using switzerland 's system of " direct democracy , " which allows individuals and groups to propose laws which are then put to a public ballot , bypassing parliament . bildunterschrift : the svp 's referendum poster has been criticized as " sinister " and " racist " the collective executive branch of the government - the swiss federal council - criticized the vote , saying it could damage switzerland 's image in the arab world , and make the country appear intolerant of religious diversity . the government had encouraged swiss people to vote against the ban . " muslims should be able to practice their religion and have access to minarets in switzerland , too , " president hans-rudolf merz said in a last-minute video broadcast to the nation .
" but the call of the muezzin will not sound here . " foreign minister micheline calmy-rey said she was " shocked " and " deeply regretted " the outcome , which she said had to be seen in the context of globalization and the economic crisis .

kristina koehler is a fresh face in german cabinet , and not just because she 's getting her first portfolio .
at 32 , she 's germany 's youngest cabinet minister and probably the only one who can use facebook without an aide . kristina koehler , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , was chosen as family minister on friday as part of a cabinet reshuffle .
koehler 's nomination is also no doubt aimed at improving the christian democrat 's profile among younger voters .
true to her generation , she can be found on the social networking site facebook and also posts on twitter .
tweeting on sunday , she said she was surprised by the focus on whether she would continue to use the internet application .
" i 'm not going to give up letter writing , either , " she wrote .
in her first interview since taking office , koehler told the bild am sonntag newspaper via email that she was n't about to abandon applications like twitter and facebook just because she had been promoted to cabinet .
she said although it was " absurd " to consider all of her 600 facebook contacts as friends , she found the site useful for spreading her political message .
career move until now , koehler , a member of the bundestag 's internal affairs committee , was mostly known for speaking out on topics such as extremism and the integration of foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen , koehler 's predecessor she takes over the family ministry from ursula von der leyen , who is moving into the labor ministry .
koehler is expected to continue her predecessor 's policies that aim to make child-rearing less expensive in germany .
but in other respects , koehler could n't be more different from von der leyen , a 51-year-old working mother of seven .
koehler joined the youth wing of the christian democrats at the age of 14 , already clear in her mind that she was destined for a career in politics .
now she is one of three relatively young ministers alongside fellow christian democrat defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , 38 , and health minister philipp roessler , 36 , from the pro-business free democrats. nw / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" an active investigative and operational effort is underway to identify and find the individuals involved in the crime , " vladimir markin , a spokesman for the investigators , told russian state television on sunday , november 29 .
the 14-carriage passenger train carrying nearly 700 people was jolted off the rails on the main line between moscow and russia 's second largest city , st. petersburg in what the authorities suspect was a bomb attack .
according to russia 's emergency situations ministry , the attack killed 25 and injured 104 , while 26 people remain missing .
markin said forensic experts had returned sunday morning to the scene of the explosion - a wooded area about 400 kilometers -lrb- 250 miles -rrb- northwest of the capital moscow - to continue their search for clues .
the question of responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extremists from conflict zones have been blamed for a string of attacks on civilian targets it remains unclear what motivated the attackers to strike the train , which is popular with well-off russians and foreign tourists .
a police spokesman expressed doubts about a message posted on the internet by a radical right-wing group claiming responsibility .
the chief of russia 's fsb security service had said earlier that the blast which derailed the train was caused by an improvised explosive device with the force of seven kilograms -lrb- 15 lbs . -rrb- of tnt .
interior minister rashid nurgaliyev had said police had evidence suggesting that several persons took part in the attack , and even gave a description of one of the suspects .
a second explosion occurred during rescue operations on saturday , but no one was injured .
grim task of identifying bodies meanwhile , the process of formally identifying bodies began on sunday in tver , a city between moscow and st. petersburg , and the regional capital of the area in which the train was attacked .
interfax news agency quoted a spokeswoman for the regional government as saying that 65 relatives of the train disaster victims were in tver to examine the corpses at a local morgue .
a government commission specially formed by prime minister vladimir putin to deal with the aftermath of the disaster was expected to meet later on sunday .
russian railways , the state company that oversees the country 's railroads , said in a statement that the movement of trains between moscow and st. petersburg had been " fully restored " as of sunday morning .
bildunterschrift : this is no the first bombing attack that has happened in russia past attacks against civilian targets the nevsky express was hit by a similar bomb attack in august 2007 , when 60 people were injured in an incident that continues to remain cloaked in mystery although it has been inconclusively linked to chechen separatists and russian ultranationalists .
forty-six people were killed and 160 injured as an explosion tore through a morning commuter train in russia 's southern fringe in december 2003 and , just months later , in february 2004 , a suicide bombing claimed 39 lives on an underground train in moscow .
extremists from conflict regions in the northern caucasus have been blamed for a string of attacks on other civilian targets in russia , including planes and a bus. rb / afpe / dpa / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" an active investigative and operational effort is underway to identify and find the individuals involved in the crime , " vladimir markin , a spokesman for the investigators , told russian state television on sunday , november 29 .
the 14-carriage passenger train carrying nearly 700 people was jolted off the rails on the main line between moscow and russia 's second largest city , st. petersburg in what the authorities suspect was a bomb attack .
according to russia 's emergency situations ministry , the attack killed 25 and injured 104 , while 26 people remain missing .
markin said forensic experts had returned sunday morning to the scene of the explosion - a wooded area about 400 kilometers -lrb- 250 miles -rrb- northwest of the capital moscow - to continue their search for clues .
the question of responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extremists from conflict zones have been blamed for a string of attacks on civilian targets it remains unclear what motivated the attackers to strike the train , which is popular with well-off russians and foreign tourists .
a police spokesman expressed doubts about a message posted on the internet by a radical right-wing group claiming responsibility .
the chief of russia 's fsb security service had said earlier that the blast which derailed the train was caused by an improvised explosive device with the force of seven kilograms -lrb- 15 lbs . -rrb- of tnt .
interior minister rashid nurgaliyev had said police had evidence suggesting that several persons took part in the attack , and even gave a description of one of the suspects .
a second explosion occurred during rescue operations on saturday , but no one was injured .
grim task of identifying bodies meanwhile , the process of formally identifying bodies began on sunday in tver , a city between moscow and st. petersburg , and the regional capital of the area in which the train was attacked .
interfax news agency quoted a spokeswoman for the regional government as saying that 65 relatives of the train disaster victims were in tver to examine the corpses at a local morgue .
a government commission specially formed by prime minister vladimir putin to deal with the aftermath of the disaster was expected to meet later on sunday .
russian railways , the state company that oversees the country 's railroads , said in a statement that the movement of trains between moscow and st. petersburg had been " fully restored " as of sunday morning .
bildunterschrift : this is no the first bombing attack that has happened in russia past attacks against civilian targets the nevsky express was hit by a similar bomb attack in august 2007 , when 60 people were injured in an incident that continues to remain cloaked in mystery although it has been inconclusively linked to chechen separatists and russian ultranationalists .
forty-six people were killed and 160 injured as an explosion tore through a morning commuter train in russia 's southern fringe in december 2003 and , just months later , in february 2004 , a suicide bombing claimed 39 lives on an underground train in moscow .

he was appointed to the post by former un secretary-general kofi annan in 2006 .
one of his department 's tasks is to provide support to the compliance regime of the kyoto protocol , the landmark pact for tackling greenhouse-gas emissions .
the un climate conference in copenhagen from december 7 - 18 will focus on an agreement to take effect after kyoto expires in 2012 .
deutsche welle : for a long time the un climate summit has been viewed as an all-or-nothing event .
is that what it still is ? de boer : i think so .
i think it is an all-or-nothing event in the sense that we need to see a number of things come together .
we need rich country emission reduction targets , individual targets for rich countries , secondly we need to know what china , india , brazil , major development countries , will do to lower the growth in emissions , thirdly we need prompt start financing to help developing countries engage .
fourthly we need a set of decisions that will make immediate action operational .
that all sounds very concrete .
in the press in the run-up to the conference there are all sorts of terms like outlines , pledges , frameworks , meaningful bids .
that does n't sound like what you are talking about .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvo de boer no , it does n't , but if i listen to what the danish prime minister is saying , he is the one who will be inviting heads of state and governments for the closing .
then if i listen to what connie hedegaard , the minister who will chair the conference , is saying and if i listen to myself , then at least the three of us are saying exactly the same thing .
the chinese appear to have seen the light regarding the need to de-carbonize their economy as much as possible so as not to despoil their environment .
but both the chinese and the indians have been arguing in recent years that they should have room for carbon-based industrial growth so they can provide their huge populations better living standards .
is there room for that any more ?
there has to be room for that .
china is changing its approach not only because of love of the environment and the fear of climate change , but also because i believe you can not continue to grow the chinese economy at the current pace in the current way .
there has to be a fundamental change .
and yes , to have to leave space for developing countries to grow .
in india , there are 400 million people that do n't even have access to electricity .
the goal of copenhagen should not be to keep people living under those circumstances .
so we will see growth in emissions in some countries .

kristina koehler is a fresh face in german cabinet , and not just because she 's getting her first portfolio .
at 32 , she 's germany 's youngest cabinet minister and probably the only one who can use facebook without an aide . kristina koehler , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , was chosen as family minister on friday as part of a cabinet reshuffle .
koehler 's nomination is also no doubt aimed at improving the christian democrat 's profile among younger voters .
true to her generation , she can be found on the social networking site facebook and also posts on twitter .
tweeting on sunday , she said she was surprised by the focus on whether she would continue to use the internet application .
" i 'm not going to give up letter writing , either , " she wrote .
in her first interview since taking office , koehler told the bild am sonntag newspaper via email that she was n't about to abandon applications like twitter and facebook just because she had been promoted to cabinet .
she said although it was " absurd " to consider all of her 600 facebook contacts as friends , she found the site useful for spreading her political message .

koehler joined the youth wing of the christian democrats at the age of 14 , already clear in her mind that she was destined for a career in politics .

now she is one of three relatively young ministers alongside fellow christian democrat defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , 38 , and health minister philipp roessler , 36 , from the pro-business free democrats. nw / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but if europe is not to lose ground , the opinion of experts in europe and china is that the eu should at least try and match us offers of cooperation and trump them with actual concrete action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china wants the eu to get its act together as a partner " during a high level meeting in beijing last week , we got a very clear signal from the chinese leadership , " holslag told deutsche welle .
" premier wen jiabao and state counselor dai bingguo explained that china attaches a lot of importance to cooperation with europe and that it should not worry about a g2 .
but for the chinese , the ball is in our court now .
they want us to prove that we can get our act together and come up with a pragmatic agenda for cooperation .
if the eu can add no value to china 's essentially commercial relations with individual member states , there will not be a strategic partnership . " paul lim , a senior academic adviser at the european institute for asian studies in brussels , said that china would pick up on any concern within europe in relation to its position as a partner and could possibly play the eu and us off against each other .
but he also said china needs both powers for very different reasons . " the us , with its history of relations with asia , its presence in asia makes it a more important partner than the eu , " lim told deutsche welle .
" the eu with its soft power which it can use to great influence is still young , and is new in the game .
it all boils down to how much of a common voice the eu projects .
china will want an ally on certain issues with the eu in relation to the us and the eu will want an ally in the us on certain issues with china .
i do not see the eu losing any influence with china and i 'm sure that the us and eu will not allow china to play them against each other . "
obama 's pragmatism could bode ill for eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has opened the path to greater dialogue with beijing president obama 's visit was the first example of the current administration 's desire to engage with china and the importance it attached to china and the wider asian region as a key strategic partner .
while there were few breakthroughs to make the europeans nervous , obama came away from beijing with the paths to dialog firmly open and as such , moved the us into a position which could undermine europe 's influence in future . " chinese aid is much needed to keep the american economy afloat and to stabilize afghanistan , " holslag said .
" this has cautioned obama during his visit .
if the united states continues to opt for more pragmatism , this would certainly weaken europe 's bargaining position when it comes to human rights , economic liberalization and other challenges . "
to lag behind in relations and cooperation with the chinese could be damaging to the eu .
china 's new global influence through investment in africa and elsewhere , its growing economic muscle and its position as a major player in global issues such as iran and north korea , as well as climate change , makes the people 's republic a partner to neglect at peril . lack of action damaging eu reputation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen jinbao wants to see more action from barrosso 's eu what could prove damaging is china 's concern that the eu can talk a good partnership but is showing a lack of commitment when it comes to putting these words into practice in areas where eu-sino relations have been traditionally strong . " while trade has always been the main driver of sino-european cooperation , this has now become one of the main sources of friction , " holslag said .
" it is clear that europe 's failure to innovate its industries is leading to more sensitivity of competition from countries like china . " on the international scene we both have a joint interest in stabilizing africa , securing central asia and promoting multilateral cooperation , " he added .
" but joint interests do not automatically lead to cooperation .
growing assertiveness makes beijing more eager to promote its own values , while the eu is not proving itself as a strong player . " calls for reform turning opinion against europe where the eu continues to hold a strong hand is in its dedication to democracy and human rights .
the european union has long been a strong advocate of reform in china and has never missed an opportunity to make its feelings known .
in most cases china has responded respectfully but has given few concrete indicators that eu pressure alone is enough to force through radical change .
as a result , europe continues to press beijing in the hope that persistence will win out in the end . in fact , the eu 's regular advocating of democratic and social reform in china is beginning to turn opinion within the people 's republic , leading some within the chinese government to suggest that europe should put its own house in order fist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's constant calls for reform start to annoy china " traditionally the chinese are concerned about ' saving their face ' , " holslag said .
" but let us not forget that the pro-europe camp in beijing is losing ground .
leaders like premier wen have come under quite a lot of pressure from political hardliners and the public opinion .
china has become less tolerant of european lecturing .
as a result , we might even expect more chinese criticism on the eu 's weak performance in the combat against climate change , its deplorable economic situation or its lack of political coherence . " despite the uncertain climate between europe and china , paul lim believes that the current level of financial commitment and strategic cooperation between the two powers is enough to look towards the future with guarded optimism . " the future of eu-china cooperation depends on maturity of relations , of respect , of being able to accept criticisms , and an understanding of each other 's culture . " said lim .
" however , right now , there has to be a certain degree of closeness , of trust and confidence for the eu to put its money into china .
the two powers are also coming closer on climate change as its effects are felt in china and we can not deny that china is doing something about it even if we think it is not enough .

but if europe is not to lose ground , the opinion of experts in europe and china is that the eu should at least try and match us offers of cooperation and trump them with actual concrete action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china wants the eu to get its act together as a partner " during a high level meeting in beijing last week , we got a very clear signal from the chinese leadership , " holslag told deutsche welle .
" premier wen jiabao and state counselor dai bingguo explained that china attaches a lot of importance to cooperation with europe and that it should not worry about a g2 .
but for the chinese , the ball is in our court now .
they want us to prove that we can get our act together and come up with a pragmatic agenda for cooperation .
if the eu can add no value to china 's essentially commercial relations with individual member states , there will not be a strategic partnership . " paul lim , a senior academic adviser at the european institute for asian studies in brussels , said that china would pick up on any concern within europe in relation to its position as a partner and could possibly play the eu and us off against each other .
but he also said china needs both powers for very different reasons . " the us , with its history of relations with asia , its presence in asia makes it a more important partner than the eu , " lim told deutsche welle .
" the eu with its soft power which it can use to great influence is still young , and is new in the game .
it all boils down to how much of a common voice the eu projects .
china will want an ally on certain issues with the eu in relation to the us and the eu will want an ally in the us on certain issues with china .
i do not see the eu losing any influence with china and i 'm sure that the us and eu will not allow china to play them against each other . "
obama 's pragmatism could bode ill for eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has opened the path to greater dialogue with beijing president obama 's visit was the first example of the current administration 's desire to engage with china and the importance it attached to china and the wider asian region as a key strategic partner .
while there were few breakthroughs to make the europeans nervous , obama came away from beijing with the paths to dialog firmly open and as such , moved the us into a position which could undermine europe 's influence in future . " chinese aid is much needed to keep the american economy afloat and to stabilize afghanistan , " holslag said .
" this has cautioned obama during his visit .
if the united states continues to opt for more pragmatism , this would certainly weaken europe 's bargaining position when it comes to human rights , economic liberalization and other challenges . "
to lag behind in relations and cooperation with the chinese could be damaging to the eu .
china 's new global influence through investment in africa and elsewhere , its growing economic muscle and its position as a major player in global issues such as iran and north korea , as well as climate change , makes the people 's republic a partner to neglect at peril . lack of action damaging eu reputation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen jinbao wants to see more action from barrosso 's eu what could prove damaging is china 's concern that the eu can talk a good partnership but is showing a lack of commitment when it comes to putting these words into practice in areas where eu-sino relations have been traditionally strong . " while trade has always been the main driver of sino-european cooperation , this has now become one of the main sources of friction , " holslag said .
" it is clear that europe 's failure to innovate its industries is leading to more sensitivity of competition from countries like china . " on the international scene we both have a joint interest in stabilizing africa , securing central asia and promoting multilateral cooperation , " he added .
" but joint interests do not automatically lead to cooperation .
growing assertiveness makes beijing more eager to promote its own values , while the eu is not proving itself as a strong player . " calls for reform turning opinion against europe where the eu continues to hold a strong hand is in its dedication to democracy and human rights .
the european union has long been a strong advocate of reform in china and has never missed an opportunity to make its feelings known .
in most cases china has responded respectfully but has given few concrete indicators that eu pressure alone is enough to force through radical change .
as a result , europe continues to press beijing in the hope that persistence will win out in the end . in fact , the eu 's regular advocating of democratic and social reform in china is beginning to turn opinion within the people 's republic , leading some within the chinese government to suggest that europe should put its own house in order fist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's constant calls for reform start to annoy china " traditionally the chinese are concerned about ' saving their face ' , " holslag said .
" but let us not forget that the pro-europe camp in beijing is losing ground .
leaders like premier wen have come under quite a lot of pressure from political hardliners and the public opinion .
china has become less tolerant of european lecturing .
as a result , we might even expect more chinese criticism on the eu 's weak performance in the combat against climate change , its deplorable economic situation or its lack of political coherence . " despite the uncertain climate between europe and china , paul lim believes that the current level of financial commitment and strategic cooperation between the two powers is enough to look towards the future with guarded optimism . " the future of eu-china cooperation depends on maturity of relations , of respect , of being able to accept criticisms , and an understanding of each other 's culture . " said lim .
" however , right now , there has to be a certain degree of closeness , of trust and confidence for the eu to put its money into china .
the two powers are also coming closer on climate change as its effects are felt in china and we can not deny that china is doing something about it even if we think it is not enough .

kristina koehler is a fresh face in german cabinet , and not just because she 's getting her first portfolio .
at 32 , she 's germany 's youngest cabinet minister and probably the only one who can use facebook without an aide . kristina koehler , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , was chosen as family minister on friday as part of a cabinet reshuffle .
koehler 's nomination is also no doubt aimed at improving the christian democrat 's profile among younger voters .
true to her generation , she can be found on the social networking site facebook and also posts on twitter .
tweeting on sunday , she said she was surprised by the focus on whether she would continue to use the internet application .
" i 'm not going to give up letter writing , either , " she wrote .
in her first interview since taking office , koehler told the bild am sonntag newspaper via email that she was n't about to abandon applications like twitter and facebook just because she had been promoted to cabinet .
she said although it was " absurd " to consider all of her 600 facebook contacts as friends , she found the site useful for spreading her political message .
career move until now , koehler , a member of the bundestag 's internal affairs committee , was mostly known for speaking out on topics such as extremism and the integration of foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen , koehler 's predecessor she takes over the family ministry from ursula von der leyen , who is moving into the labor ministry .
koehler is expected to continue her predecessor 's policies that aim to make child-rearing less expensive in germany .
but in other respects , koehler could n't be more different from von der leyen , a 51-year-old working mother of seven .
koehler joined the youth wing of the christian democrats at the age of 14 , already clear in her mind that she was destined for a career in politics .
now she is one of three relatively young ministers alongside fellow christian democrat defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , 38 , and health minister philipp roessler , 36 , from the pro-business free democrats. nw / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but will the country be able to meet uefa 's looming deadline ? ukraine has until november 30 to convince uefa that it is ready to host the 2012 european soccer championships .
with a projected figure of 1.3 million soccer fans expected to attend the championship , ukraine 's leadership has been scrambling to upgrade the infrastructure in its four host cities .
uefa president michael platini has said that there are huge infrastructure problems – stadiums need to be built or renovated and roads need to be repaired – which wstill need to be resolved in ukraine .
uefa earlier threatened to strip ukraine of its co-hosting rights with poland after it experienced difficulties in building infrastructure in preparation for the championship .
however michael platini has insisted " we will go to ukraine . "
but he has stressed that it is still unclear how many cities in the country will be deemed fit to host games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heavy construction is underway in ukraine 's major cities to build new stadiums for the soccer championship ukraine 's government is fervently pulling out all the stops to prepare for their hosting debut and has ordered entire cities be restored .
around the country , roads , stadiums , sports grounds and hotels are getting a facelift .
anticipation and excitement about the upcoming championship has unified ukraine 's government and its people .
the country has not sponsored a major sporting event since 1980 when ukraine co-hosted the olympic games as a part of the soviet union .
markian lubkivsky , chairman of ukraine 's euro 2012 organizing committee , has noted the effect that the opportunity to host euro 2012 has had on his country .
" for ukraine , the championship has helped us overcome identity problems , integrate better into the european community and deepen our relations with poland , " he said .
financing difficulties one factor which has complicated ukraine 's push to prepare for euro 2012 has been the strain caused by the international financial crisis .
state revenues are down 30 percent and ukraine ’ s leaders have traded accusations of breaking promises on financing for euro 2012 .
ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko said the government had only provided five percent of the $ 945 million it pledged to spend on the games in 2009 .
" the financing program for euro 2012 is under threat , " said the president .
" together with the central bank and finance ministry , we must find financial resources . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko has been severely critical of the financing initiatives for euro 2012 preparations the president was nonetheless also unhappy with an alternative , which was recently approved by ukraine 's parliament , to finance preparations for the championship , .
the new government financing bill stipulates that the country ’ s national bank must send the majority of its profits , about $ 800 million us , into a fund to finance euro 2012 .
president yushchenko has called that move " fiscally irresponsible " and has unsuccessfully tried to veto it .
many in ukraine 's government are , however , convinced that even in times as tough as these , the euro 2012 is a worthy investment .
ukraine 's sports minister yurii pavlenko has said that the championship will surely pay for itself . " i am sure that no matter how much money we put into the infrastructure , in the end we will be in the black , " said pavlenko .
" but the infrastructure ; the roads , stadiums , sports grounds and restored cities will be in good repair .
and that ’ s something we will have for much longer after the championship ... and i think that will take our culture to a new level . "
whether or not ukraine 's earnest preparations for euro 2012 will hit the mark and win uefa 's approval remains to be seen .
all eyes are on ukraine to see if the country will succeed in holding on to its winning bid to host euro 2012 .

" together with the central bank and finance ministry , we must find financial resources . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko has been severely critical of the financing initiatives for euro 2012 preparations the president was nonetheless also unhappy with an alternative , which was recently approved by ukraine 's parliament , to finance preparations for the championship , .
the new government financing bill stipulates that the country ’ s national bank must send the majority of its profits , about $ 800 million us , into a fund to finance euro 2012 .
president yushchenko has called that move " fiscally irresponsible " and has unsuccessfully tried to veto it .
many in ukraine 's government are , however , convinced that even in times as tough as these , the euro 2012 is a worthy investment .
ukraine 's sports minister yurii pavlenko has said that the championship will surely pay for itself . " i am sure that no matter how much money we put into the infrastructure , in the end we will be in the black , " said pavlenko .
" but the infrastructure ; the roads , stadiums , sports grounds and restored cities will be in good repair .
and that ’ s something we will have for much longer after the championship ... and i think that will take our culture to a new level . "
whether or not ukraine 's earnest preparations for euro 2012 will hit the mark and win uefa 's approval remains to be seen .
all eyes are on ukraine to see if the country will succeed in holding on to its winning bid to host euro 2012 .

but if europe is not to lose ground , the opinion of experts in europe and china is that the eu should at least try and match us offers of cooperation and trump them with actual concrete action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china wants the eu to get its act together as a partner " during a high level meeting in beijing last week , we got a very clear signal from the chinese leadership , " holslag told deutsche welle .
" premier wen jiabao and state counselor dai bingguo explained that china attaches a lot of importance to cooperation with europe and that it should not worry about a g2 .
but for the chinese , the ball is in our court now .
they want us to prove that we can get our act together and come up with a pragmatic agenda for cooperation .
if the eu can add no value to china 's essentially commercial relations with individual member states , there will not be a strategic partnership . " paul lim , a senior academic adviser at the european institute for asian studies in brussels , said that china would pick up on any concern within europe in relation to its position as a partner and could possibly play the eu and us off against each other .
but he also said china needs both powers for very different reasons . " the us , with its history of relations with asia , its presence in asia makes it a more important partner than the eu , " lim told deutsche welle .
" the eu with its soft power which it can use to great influence is still young , and is new in the game .
it all boils down to how much of a common voice the eu projects .
china will want an ally on certain issues with the eu in relation to the us and the eu will want an ally in the us on certain issues with china .
i do not see the eu losing any influence with china and i 'm sure that the us and eu will not allow china to play them against each other . "
obama 's pragmatism could bode ill for eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has opened the path to greater dialogue with beijing president obama 's visit was the first example of the current administration 's desire to engage with china and the importance it attached to china and the wider asian region as a key strategic partner .
while there were few breakthroughs to make the europeans nervous , obama came away from beijing with the paths to dialog firmly open and as such , moved the us into a position which could undermine europe 's influence in future . " chinese aid is much needed to keep the american economy afloat and to stabilize afghanistan , " holslag said .
" this has cautioned obama during his visit .
if the united states continues to opt for more pragmatism , this would certainly weaken europe 's bargaining position when it comes to human rights , economic liberalization and other challenges . "
to lag behind in relations and cooperation with the chinese could be damaging to the eu .
china 's new global influence through investment in africa and elsewhere , its growing economic muscle and its position as a major player in global issues such as iran and north korea , as well as climate change , makes the people 's republic a partner to neglect at peril . lack of action damaging eu reputation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen jinbao wants to see more action from barrosso 's eu what could prove damaging is china 's concern that the eu can talk a good partnership but is showing a lack of commitment when it comes to putting these words into practice in areas where eu-sino relations have been traditionally strong . " while trade has always been the main driver of sino-european cooperation , this has now become one of the main sources of friction , " holslag said .
" it is clear that europe 's failure to innovate its industries is leading to more sensitivity of competition from countries like china . " on the international scene we both have a joint interest in stabilizing africa , securing central asia and promoting multilateral cooperation , " he added .
" but joint interests do not automatically lead to cooperation .
growing assertiveness makes beijing more eager to promote its own values , while the eu is not proving itself as a strong player . " calls for reform turning opinion against europe where the eu continues to hold a strong hand is in its dedication to democracy and human rights .
the european union has long been a strong advocate of reform in china and has never missed an opportunity to make its feelings known .
in most cases china has responded respectfully but has given few concrete indicators that eu pressure alone is enough to force through radical change .
as a result , europe continues to press beijing in the hope that persistence will win out in the end . in fact , the eu 's regular advocating of democratic and social reform in china is beginning to turn opinion within the people 's republic , leading some within the chinese government to suggest that europe should put its own house in order fist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's constant calls for reform start to annoy china " traditionally the chinese are concerned about ' saving their face ' , " holslag said .
" but let us not forget that the pro-europe camp in beijing is losing ground .
leaders like premier wen have come under quite a lot of pressure from political hardliners and the public opinion .
china has become less tolerant of european lecturing .
as a result , we might even expect more chinese criticism on the eu 's weak performance in the combat against climate change , its deplorable economic situation or its lack of political coherence . " despite the uncertain climate between europe and china , paul lim believes that the current level of financial commitment and strategic cooperation between the two powers is enough to look towards the future with guarded optimism . " the future of eu-china cooperation depends on maturity of relations , of respect , of being able to accept criticisms , and an understanding of each other 's culture . " said lim .
" however , right now , there has to be a certain degree of closeness , of trust and confidence for the eu to put its money into china .
the two powers are also coming closer on climate change as its effects are felt in china and we can not deny that china is doing something about it even if we think it is not enough .
but the big question is how mature the relationship is .
this is another matter . " author : nick amies editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 29.11.2009 in russian arctic , global warming threatens traditional way of life großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 'll soon get colder again , some russian scientists say russian scientists have doubts over whether global warming is here to stay and whether it 's man made .
but for the saami in russia 's north , the mild winters already pose a threat to their traditional way of life . all around the arctic , the effects of a temperature rise are visible , and native inhabitants of the tundras in europa , asia and north america are struggling with the new reality .
that 's also true for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula , an area bordering on norway and finnish lapland .
but , in russia , climate change is not a hot-button issue , nor is much attention being paid to the upcoming climate summit in copenhagen .
russian scientists say they have no evidence that global warming is a long-term trend , and doubt whether it is a man-made phenomenon . a little ice age ?
in the country 's northern port in the town of murmansk , the marine biological institute of the russian academy of sciences monitors life in and around the barents sea .
the institute has amassed an impressive database concerning temperature and salinity of the sea over the course of the 20th century .
referring to the statistics , biologist pavel makarevich says there are clear cycles during which both temperature and salinity rise and fall . these cycles , he says , are related to solar activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murmansk is russia 's gateway to the arctic waters " in my opinion and that of our institute , the problems connected to the current stage of warming are being exaggerated , " he says .
" what we are dealing with is not a global warming of the atmosphere or of the oceans . "
makarevich expects a normalization of arctic temperatures in the coming years .
this view appears to have the support of a growing number of russian scientists .
some even predict a temporary cooling of temperatures towards the middle of this century , a phenomenon known as a " little ice age . "
shorter winters but for the saami reindeer herders on russia 's kola peninsula between the barents and the white sea , a drop in temperature is urgently needed .
over the last few years , the winters have become milder and milder , threatening the traditional lifestyle of the saami .
this year again , the onset of winter was late in northern russia .
normally , the tundra would already be covered by a deep layer of snow , and the numerous lakes would have a thick layer of ice .
but snow cover is minimal and some of the lakes are not even frozen yet .
for native reindeer herders , that 's a problem , because the traditional slaughter season has to be postponed .
" the slaughter used to start in early november , " says herder nikolai filippov .
" at that time , the ice is usually strong enough to carry the reindeer .
but over the past few years , the ice has been weak and sparse , so we can not travel , and the slaughter has to be postponed until just before the new year .
this year , yields will be minimal . "
each fall , the big reindeer herds are somewhere on the vast expanses of the kola peninsula .
at the onset of winter , they have to be found and driven to lovozero , the center of the russian saami community .
but that can only happen under true winter conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indigenous saami people depend on reindeer for their living " last year it was exactly the same .
this year we do not know yet how the herds are , and what will happen later in the autumn , " filippov says .
" sometimes it is still raining around the new year , and you can not go over bare ice with the reindeer .
so then you will have to wait until after the new year .
in fact , the winter only starts in january .
for now it is a mixture of frost and thaw . "
the capricious weather has all kinds of practical consequences for the everyday life of the saami .
nikolai filippov and his wife maria live in a chum , a traditional saami tipi-like tent with a hole in the top to let out the smoke .
maria used to prepare lots of food for the winter .
but now that is out of the question , because the thaw often comes in the middle of winter and the meat can no longer be preserved .
the tundra is no longer a reliable natural refrigerator .
" in the old days it never rained in december , " says maria filippova .
" when it rains in winter , the snow disappears and we ca n't move on with our animals to search for reindeer moss . "
for thousands of years , the saami lived according to an ancient and extremely reliable calendar .
but today , says nikolai filippov , everything seems to be off course .
for him , there is no question that nature is changing .
what is happening in the tundra today is something the 59-year-old has never seen before .
the arctic as a future trading route the city of murmansk , a few hours ' drive to the north , seems a world away .
in the harbor , there 's the lenin - the first soviet nuclear-powered icebreaker built in the 1950s .
today , the heavy vessel is a museum .
andrei smirnov was the lenin 's last captain when the ship was retired in 1989 .
" no other country has boundaries like russia that stretch so far to the north , " smirnov says .
he is convinced that russia will need icebreakers like this one , now and in the future .
" we have been using the northern passage since 1932 .
it is a sea route of national significance , and since 1991 , foreign ships have also been allowed to use it .
this year as well , foreigners have used the passage , and we have successfully guided them through with our icebreakers . "
smirnov is referring to ships belonging to the german company beluga .
earlier this year , they made an impressive voyage from south korea to rotterdam , via the arctic seas north of russia .
bildunterschrift : this year , two ships from the german company , beluga , completed the trip around russia 's north .
the northern passage could become an alternative to existing routes the trip was meant to prove that the north pole ice is retreating as a result of global warming , and that the northern passage could become an attractive , much shorter alternative for existing routes like the one via the suez canal .
it sounds great , but longtime members of russia 's northern fleet , such as nikolai babich , can only laugh at the thought ..
" saying that one could navigate in the polar seas without the help of icebreakers , or even reach the north pole unhindered , no , that is not serious , " says babich .
babich feels at home in the russian arctic .
he has visited almost every corner of it during the last 40 years , and he claims there is no-one like him who has studied the area in such detail .
the recent rise in global temperature has surprised neither him nor his colleagues .
it has happened in the past , he says , and it will happen again .
" the natural processes we have seen during the past decade are mainly the result of the sun 's activity .
they show a slight increase in temperature , and as a result , arctic ice has receded , " he says .
but according to babich , the situation is changing .
the arctic , he says , is already cooling , not warming .
and the russian government is attentively listening to those scientists who , like babich , are predicting a cold spell .

the surprise result is certain to embarrass the government and dismay the country 's muslim minority . the swiss news agency ats and other media outlets report that a clear majority , 57.5 percent of voters and all but four of switzerland 's 26 cantons approved the proposal in this nationwide referendum .
of eligible voters , 53 percent turned out to vote . the government has said it will respect the decision of the people and would no longer permit the construction of new minarets in switzerland , but tried to assure the muslim minority that the ban was " not a rejection of the muslim community , religion or culture . " " muslims in switzerland are able to practice their religion alone or in community with others and live according to their beliefs just as before , " it said in a statement . the right-wing swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- , switzerland 's biggest party , was the driving force behind the referendum , along with the conservative federal democratic union .
they succeeded in gathering 100,000 signatures within 18 months , which is needed to call a referendum under swiss law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban supporters say that minarets - like this one in geneva - represent claims to power the svp said switzerland 's four existing minarets are not mere architectural features on religious buildings but represent a " political-religious claim to power , which challenges fundamental rights .

" muslims do not feel accepted as a religious community . " nadia karmous , president of the cultural association of muslim women in switzerland , told le temps newspaper : " i feel sad for switzerland .
imagine the impact abroad .
the image of the -lrb- country -rrb- is already that of a racist country . " the conference of swiss bishops also criticized the result , saying that it " heightens the problems of cohabitation between religions and cultures . " direct democracy the referendum was held using switzerland 's system of " direct democracy , " which allows individuals and groups to propose laws which are then put to a public ballot , bypassing parliament . bildunterschrift : the svp 's referendum poster has been criticized as " sinister " and " racist " the collective executive branch of the government - the swiss federal council - criticized the vote , saying it could damage switzerland 's image in the arab world , and make the country appear intolerant of religious diversity . the government had encouraged swiss people to vote against the ban . " muslims should be able to practice their religion and have access to minarets in switzerland , too , " president hans-rudolf merz said in a last-minute video broadcast to the nation .

kristina koehler is a fresh face in german cabinet , and not just because she 's getting her first portfolio .
at 32 , she 's germany 's youngest cabinet minister and probably the only one who can use facebook without an aide . kristina koehler , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , was chosen as family minister on friday as part of a cabinet reshuffle .
koehler 's nomination is also no doubt aimed at improving the christian democrat 's profile among younger voters .
true to her generation , she can be found on the social networking site facebook and also posts on twitter .
tweeting on sunday , she said she was surprised by the focus on whether she would continue to use the internet application .
" i 'm not going to give up letter writing , either , " she wrote .
in her first interview since taking office , koehler told the bild am sonntag newspaper via email that she was n't about to abandon applications like twitter and facebook just because she had been promoted to cabinet .
she said although it was " absurd " to consider all of her 600 facebook contacts as friends , she found the site useful for spreading her political message .
career move until now , koehler , a member of the bundestag 's internal affairs committee , was mostly known for speaking out on topics such as extremism and the integration of foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen , koehler 's predecessor she takes over the family ministry from ursula von der leyen , who is moving into the labor ministry .
koehler is expected to continue her predecessor 's policies that aim to make child-rearing less expensive in germany .
but in other respects , koehler could n't be more different from von der leyen , a 51-year-old working mother of seven .
koehler joined the youth wing of the christian democrats at the age of 14 , already clear in her mind that she was destined for a career in politics .
now she is one of three relatively young ministers alongside fellow christian democrat defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , 38 , and health minister philipp roessler , 36 , from the pro-business free democrats. nw / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was appointed to the post by former un secretary-general kofi annan in 2006 .
one of his department 's tasks is to provide support to the compliance regime of the kyoto protocol , the landmark pact for tackling greenhouse-gas emissions .
the un climate conference in copenhagen from december 7 - 18 will focus on an agreement to take effect after kyoto expires in 2012 .
deutsche welle : for a long time the un climate summit has been viewed as an all-or-nothing event .
is that what it still is ? de boer : i think so .
i think it is an all-or-nothing event in the sense that we need to see a number of things come together .
we need rich country emission reduction targets , individual targets for rich countries , secondly we need to know what china , india , brazil , major development countries , will do to lower the growth in emissions , thirdly we need prompt start financing to help developing countries engage .
fourthly we need a set of decisions that will make immediate action operational .
that all sounds very concrete .
in the press in the run-up to the conference there are all sorts of terms like outlines , pledges , frameworks , meaningful bids .
that does n't sound like what you are talking about .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvo de boer no , it does n't , but if i listen to what the danish prime minister is saying , he is the one who will be inviting heads of state and governments for the closing .
then if i listen to what connie hedegaard , the minister who will chair the conference , is saying and if i listen to myself , then at least the three of us are saying exactly the same thing .
the chinese appear to have seen the light regarding the need to de-carbonize their economy as much as possible so as not to despoil their environment .
but both the chinese and the indians have been arguing in recent years that they should have room for carbon-based industrial growth so they can provide their huge populations better living standards .
is there room for that any more ?
there has to be room for that .
china is changing its approach not only because of love of the environment and the fear of climate change , but also because i believe you can not continue to grow the chinese economy at the current pace in the current way .
there has to be a fundamental change .
and yes , to have to leave space for developing countries to grow .
in india , there are 400 million people that do n't even have access to electricity .
the goal of copenhagen should not be to keep people living under those circumstances .
so we will see growth in emissions in some countries .

" an active investigative and operational effort is underway to identify and find the individuals involved in the crime , " vladimir markin , a spokesman for the investigators , told russian state television on sunday , november 29 .
the 14-carriage passenger train carrying nearly 700 people was jolted off the rails on the main line between moscow and russia 's second largest city , st. petersburg in what the authorities suspect was a bomb attack .
according to russia 's emergency situations ministry , the attack killed 25 and injured 104 , while 26 people remain missing .
markin said forensic experts had returned sunday morning to the scene of the explosion - a wooded area about 400 kilometers -lrb- 250 miles -rrb- northwest of the capital moscow - to continue their search for clues .
the question of responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extremists from conflict zones have been blamed for a string of attacks on civilian targets it remains unclear what motivated the attackers to strike the train , which is popular with well-off russians and foreign tourists .
a police spokesman expressed doubts about a message posted on the internet by a radical right-wing group claiming responsibility .
the chief of russia 's fsb security service had said earlier that the blast which derailed the train was caused by an improvised explosive device with the force of seven kilograms -lrb- 15 lbs . -rrb- of tnt .
interior minister rashid nurgaliyev had said police had evidence suggesting that several persons took part in the attack , and even gave a description of one of the suspects .
a second explosion occurred during rescue operations on saturday , but no one was injured .
grim task of identifying bodies meanwhile , the process of formally identifying bodies began on sunday in tver , a city between moscow and st. petersburg , and the regional capital of the area in which the train was attacked .
interfax news agency quoted a spokeswoman for the regional government as saying that 65 relatives of the train disaster victims were in tver to examine the corpses at a local morgue .
a government commission specially formed by prime minister vladimir putin to deal with the aftermath of the disaster was expected to meet later on sunday .
russian railways , the state company that oversees the country 's railroads , said in a statement that the movement of trains between moscow and st. petersburg had been " fully restored " as of sunday morning .
bildunterschrift : this is no the first bombing attack that has happened in russia past attacks against civilian targets the nevsky express was hit by a similar bomb attack in august 2007 , when 60 people were injured in an incident that continues to remain cloaked in mystery although it has been inconclusively linked to chechen separatists and russian ultranationalists .
forty-six people were killed and 160 injured as an explosion tore through a morning commuter train in russia 's southern fringe in december 2003 and , just months later , in february 2004 , a suicide bombing claimed 39 lives on an underground train in moscow .
extremists from conflict regions in the northern caucasus have been blamed for a string of attacks on other civilian targets in russia , including planes and a bus. rb / afpe / dpa / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
