" this is such an insult to all those in our country who work hard , pay their taxes and stick to the rules , " said spd general secretary hubertus heil .

" the financing of zumwinkel 's pension claims is completed , " she said .
however , skogstad declined to comment on the 20 million euro sum cited by faz .
the outrage even reached the ranks of some free democrats , the german political party that favors market liberalization .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 16.03.2009 austria 's fritzl admits incest , denies murder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritzl hid behind a binder folder during the first day of his trial austrian josef fritzl , accused of locking his daughter in a basement for 24 years and fathering her seven children , pleaded guilty to incest , but said he is innocent of murder and enslavement charges as his trial opened . in a sankt poelten court on monday , fritzl faced the the opening of the 11 hours of videotaped testimony against him given by his daughter elisabeth , who was spared a court appearance as allowed under austrian law .
the testimony will continue to be shown in the coming days of the closed-door trial .
the main charge against the 73-year-old austrian relates to the murder of a newborn boy who died in a secret cellar under his house in 1996 . fritzl also faces charges of rape , coercion and enslavement of his daughter , as well as incest and deprivation of her liberty and that of three of her children .
as the trial opened , prosecutors accused fritzl of repeatedly having raped elisabeth in front of her young children .
fritzl , who was deemed fit for trial following a psychiatric assessment in october , could face a sentence of 10 to 15 years or life in prison if the eight-member jury finds him guilty of murder .
under austrian law , sentences are not cumulative , so he will serve only the longest of the sentences he receives for the crimes he is deemed to have committed .
lawyer to contest murder charge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the austrian says one of his secret cellar children was stillborn , not murdered fritzl 's lawyer said that the charge of enslavement was inappropriate and that he would contest the murder charge by maintaining that the baby was still-born .
prosecutors say fritzl is responsible for the twin baby 's death because he failed to seek medical help for the infant .
neither elisabeth nor her children are expected to appear at the trial , which will be presided over by three judges .
they are now living in a secret location under new identities .
fritzl 's appearance at the court on monday morning was the first time he had been seen in public since his arrest on april 26 last year .
he attempted to cover his face with a blue binder .
due to the personal nature of the testimony , no journalists will be allowed inside the court .
instead , there will be daily press briefings with updates on the proceedings .
the media will be admitted into the court for the verdict , which is expected friday .
a case that shocked the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritzl 's victims thanked the public for their support via this poster the shocking case came to light in april last year when elisabeth 's oldest child , 19-year-old kerstin , who had lived her entire life underground with two brothers and her mother , fell ill and had to be hospitalized .
three of elisabeth 's other children had at an early age been brought to live upstairs with fritzl and his wife , rosemarie .
they had no knowledge of their mother and siblings living in the soundproofed cellar below the family home .
fritzl told his wife that the children had been abandoned by elisabeth , who he said had run off to join a sect .
police say rosemarie was unaware of her husband 's second life in the windowless basement complex .

the company said in a statement that it would adapt output in germany , romania and spain to the " unprecedented decline in the european new car market and the continuing negative economic outlook . "
ford 's plant in valencia , spain will operate on two shifts instead of three , and a plant in saarlouis , germany will follow through on a previously announced 20-day production pause .
but its plant in cologne , western germany will continue full production to meet demand sparked by the german government 's subsidy that offers people willing to scrap their old cars a cash rebate of 2,500 euros on a more environmentally-friendly new car .
the subsidy has boosted sales of smaller cars such as the fiesta and fusion models .
the statement said that the cologne plant would " share with ford 's craiova -lrb- romania -rrb- engine plant the production of a new , small-displacement ecoboost advanced petrol engine . "
more action could follow the us carmaker employs some 70,000 people in europe , where it has 22 factories .
in germany , the company is bound by a union agreement to maintain jobs at their current level .
last month , ford 's european sales dropped by almost 12 percent from the same period last year to just under 89,000 cars , according to statistics from the european automovile manufacturers ' association -lrb- acea -rrb- .
" ford europe must return to sustainable profitability as soon as possible , " said john fleming , ford 's head of the region , in a statement .

bayern beat vfl bochum 3-0 , while wolfsburg enjoyed a 4-3 victory over schalke 04 on friday .
petric out " that was a routine victory but it was pretty important , " said jol .
" we lacked pace in the second half , but i am happy . "
trochowski replaced mladen petric after just half an hour after the croatian forward pulled a muscle .

though it is still a question of money , " the boss of bundesliga club bayer leverkusen said in a television interview . " i have to contradict him entirely on this point , " voeller said .
" i think we are comparable to the leagues in england , spain and italy , which operate under different financial conditions . " of course we can not keep up with the top four english clubs , which are in the quarterfinals of the champions league .

fritzl , who was deemed fit for trial following a psychiatric assessment in october , could face a sentence of 10 to 15 years or life in prison if the eight-member jury finds him guilty of murder .
under austrian law , sentences are not cumulative , so he will serve only the longest of the sentences he receives for the crimes he is deemed to have committed .
lawyer to contest murder charge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the austrian says one of his secret cellar children was stillborn , not murdered fritzl 's lawyer said that the charge of enslavement was inappropriate and that he would contest the murder charge by maintaining that the baby was still-born .
prosecutors say fritzl is responsible for the twin baby 's death because he failed to seek medical help for the infant .
neither elisabeth nor her children are expected to appear at the trial , which will be presided over by three judges .
they are now living in a secret location under new identities .
fritzl 's appearance at the court on monday morning was the first time he had been seen in public since his arrest on april 26 last year .
he attempted to cover his face with a blue binder .
due to the personal nature of the testimony , no journalists will be allowed inside the court .
instead , there will be daily press briefings with updates on the proceedings .
the media will be admitted into the court for the verdict , which is expected friday .
a case that shocked the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritzl 's victims thanked the public for their support via this poster the shocking case came to light in april last year when elisabeth 's oldest child , 19-year-old kerstin , who had lived her entire life underground with two brothers and her mother , fell ill and had to be hospitalized .
three of elisabeth 's other children had at an early age been brought to live upstairs with fritzl and his wife , rosemarie .
they had no knowledge of their mother and siblings living in the soundproofed cellar below the family home .
fritzl told his wife that the children had been abandoned by elisabeth , who he said had run off to join a sect .
police say rosemarie was unaware of her husband 's second life in the windowless basement complex .
shortly after his arrest , fritzl confessed to raping and holding his daughter for 24 years with no sunlight , fresh air , heating or hot water .

the company said in a statement that it would adapt output in germany , romania and spain to the " unprecedented decline in the european new car market and the continuing negative economic outlook . "
ford 's plant in valencia , spain will operate on two shifts instead of three , and a plant in saarlouis , germany will follow through on a previously announced 20-day production pause .
but its plant in cologne , western germany will continue full production to meet demand sparked by the german government 's subsidy that offers people willing to scrap their old cars a cash rebate of 2,500 euros on a more environmentally-friendly new car .
the subsidy has boosted sales of smaller cars such as the fiesta and fusion models .
the statement said that the cologne plant would " share with ford 's craiova -lrb- romania -rrb- engine plant the production of a new , small-displacement ecoboost advanced petrol engine . "
more action could follow the us carmaker employs some 70,000 people in europe , where it has 22 factories .
in germany , the company is bound by a union agreement to maintain jobs at their current level .
last month , ford 's european sales dropped by almost 12 percent from the same period last year to just under 89,000 cars , according to statistics from the european automovile manufacturers ' association -lrb- acea -rrb- .
" ford europe must return to sustainable profitability as soon as possible , " said john fleming , ford 's head of the region , in a statement .
" we will do whatever it takes to ensure the continuing viability of our business , and further actions can be expected . " dc / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was due to launch from the plesetsk cosmodrome in the northwest of russia on monday afternoon .
but a spokesman at the esa centre for earth observation in frascati , italy , near rome , said the countdown was suspended when the service tower protecting the rocket failed to move clear of the pad and allow the satellite to lift off .

the reasons are being checked .
it is due to technical reasons connected to the ground services , " a spokesman for the russian space center said .

" this is such an insult to all those in our country who work hard , pay their taxes and stick to the rules , " said spd general secretary hubertus heil .

berlin , however , is concerned bailout money it provides could end up flowing across the atlantic to gm rather than to secure production in germany . one of the main issues guttenberg will address is the ownership of patents and other intellectual property opel requires to continue producing cars .
he will also explore gm and the us government 's willingness to let go of opel . chancellor angela merkel told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk that guttenberg needed to " clarify how general motors would be able to back away in order to give opel more room to move . " no easy answers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is guttenberg 's first us trip as a german minister guttenberg is not expected to bring back a final answer on the opel issue , however .
berlin has made it clear it wants to know exactly what the us administration has planned with gm before it makes a decision about offering state aid to opel . " i have been told that the us government will decide what it will do in regard to gm within the next 14 days , " german finance minister peer steinbrueck said . gm has been hard hit by the global downturn in car sales .
auditors have raised " substantial doubts " over the iconic us manufacturer 's ability to survive the storm . the firm has said that it could cut up to 47,000 jobs worldwide , raising serious concerns for its european subsidiaries opel , vauxhall and saab - all of whose futures are now in doubt . even if gm does decide it would sell its german-based subsidiary , the company would have to find a buyer .
merkel has said the government may be willing to provide loan guarantees to the company but would not buy a direct stake in the automaker . independent investor needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nation fears for thousands of opel jobs signaling that a possible opel bailout could become a central theme to campaigning ahead of september 's parliamentary elections , franz muentefering , head of the social democratic party , which currently shares power with merkel 's christian democratic union , did not rule out the state coming to opel 's aid . " i can imagine the state taking a stake -lrb- in an independent opel -rrb- if it is a temporary measure to ensure the stability of a company that for the most part can survive on its own , " he told the super illu magazine . leaders in the four german states with opel factories are keen to find ways of preserving up to 50,000 jobs that could be at stake , should opel - and the suppliers it depends on - crumble . hesse premier roland koch also said he would consider providing aid to an independent investor interested in buying opel , which has its headquarters in his state . " my conception would be the creation of a new , european opel in which a private investor takes a stake in addition to its current parent company , general motors , " koch told german newsmagazine der spiegel . he added that the state and federal governments could step in with guarantees for two to three years if the investor had difficulty receiving credit . guttenberg 's schedule calls for additional talks with us president barack obama 's economic advisor larry summers ; us treasury secretary timothy geithner ; the heads the imf and world bank ; as well as several us banks on tuesday . sms / jen / dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 16.03.2009 german politicians outraged over payout to deutsche post 's ex-ceo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel 's $ 26 million payoff was called ' scandalous ' in spite of a conviction for tax evasion , the ex-ceo of one of the world 's leading logistic giants is legally entitled to his $ 26 million pension - a revelation that has german politicians seething . one of the world 's leading postal and logistics companies paid 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26 million -rrb- in pension claims to its disgraced former chief executive klaus zumwinkel , reported the german national newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- in its analysis of deutsche post 's 2008 annual report .
the news about zumwinkel , who is currently living in a chateau in italy 's lake garda , unleashed cries of outrage from a panoply of german politicians and commentators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german 's deutsche post is one of the world 's largest logistics firms zumwinkel , 65 - who was forced to resign as deutsche post 's ceo in february of 2008 , was convicted in january , 2009 , of evading nearly one million euros in taxes by hiding the sum in a secret trust in the alpine tax haven of liechtenstein .
a german court penalized zumwinkel with a one million euro fine and two-year prison sentence , which he has yet to serve .
but at a time when the global financial crisis has led to germany 's worst recession since world war ii , the news of the payout has sparked public outrage .
politicians of all stripes have jumped on the bandwagon to denounce business leaders who continue to rake in high salaries and bonuses despite falling profits and management failures that have run their companies to the ground .
' scandalous ' payout on sunday , bavaria 's premier and csu party chief horst seehofer told german newspapers the 20 million payout was " scandalous . "
" these are the kind of people who destroy our social market economy , " said seehofer , whose conservative csu is the bavarian sister party to german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats . " the average person is worried about his job , and mr. zumwinkel is stuffing his pockets full of cash , " he said .
since the german state is a big stakeholder in deutsche post , which was formerly a government monopoly , seehofer even called for an investigation into the justification for such a huge pension payout .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in merkel 's governing coalition were just as scathing .
" this is such an insult to all those in our country who work hard , pay their taxes and stick to the rules , " said spd general secretary hubertus heil .
the huge pension payout comes at a time deutsche post had been hit by losses totalling nearly 1.7 million euros for 2008 .
zumwinkel legally entitled to huge pension payout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel hid nearly one million euros in liechtenstein .
the company 's spokeswoman silje skogstad however told the business news website bloomberg that zumwinkel was entitled to his full pension payout according to the terms of his executive compensation package .
" the financing of zumwinkel 's pension claims is completed , " she said .
however , skogstad declined to comment on the 20 million euro sum cited by faz .
the outrage even reached the ranks of some free democrats , the german political party that favors market liberalization .

“ the united states and germany will develop innovative research projects that contribute to the protection of our free , open and cross-linked transatlantic societies . ”
" strengthening transatlantic cooperation " the accord , which is said to cost between 10 million euros and 20 million euros by 2012 , is the first such agreement between the two countries .

this includes passenger rights when body searches are conducted at airports .

the company said in a statement that it would adapt output in germany , romania and spain to the " unprecedented decline in the european new car market and the continuing negative economic outlook . "
ford 's plant in valencia , spain will operate on two shifts instead of three , and a plant in saarlouis , germany will follow through on a previously announced 20-day production pause .
but its plant in cologne , western germany will continue full production to meet demand sparked by the german government 's subsidy that offers people willing to scrap their old cars a cash rebate of 2,500 euros on a more environmentally-friendly new car .
the subsidy has boosted sales of smaller cars such as the fiesta and fusion models .
the statement said that the cologne plant would " share with ford 's craiova -lrb- romania -rrb- engine plant the production of a new , small-displacement ecoboost advanced petrol engine . "
more action could follow the us carmaker employs some 70,000 people in europe , where it has 22 factories .
in germany , the company is bound by a union agreement to maintain jobs at their current level .
last month , ford 's european sales dropped by almost 12 percent from the same period last year to just under 89,000 cars , according to statistics from the european automovile manufacturers ' association -lrb- acea -rrb- .
" ford europe must return to sustainable profitability as soon as possible , " said john fleming , ford 's head of the region , in a statement .

us homeland security secretary janet napolitano was in berlin on monday to sign the agreement with her german counterpart annette schavan , who is germany 's education and research minister .
the agreement is meant to develop better protection from terrorist attacks , natural disasters , large-scale accidents and organized crime .
“ we want to use the benefits of research cooperation to mobilize the best ideas for optimal risk protection in our countries , ” schavan said in an official statement .
“ the united states and germany will develop innovative research projects that contribute to the protection of our free , open and cross-linked transatlantic societies . ”
" strengthening transatlantic cooperation " the accord , which is said to cost between 10 million euros and 20 million euros by 2012 , is the first such agreement between the two countries . " it is a considerable contribution to strengthening transatlantic cooperation with the new us government , " schavan told der spiegel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : napolitano emphasized cooperation with us allies speaking in berlin , napolitano said that it was important to work with us allies in improving security without infringing on civil liberties .

napolitano also met top security officials from other major european union countries as well as german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble in berlin over the weekend .
discussions on guantanamo inmates still " premature " prior to the sunday talks , napolitano told german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung -lrb- fas -rrb- that discussions on how many guantanamo inmates would be transferred to europe were still " premature . "

napolitano told the fas newspaper that the us administration is currently evaluating individual cases . asked about the rights of prisoners detained at the bagram military internment facility in afghanistan , she declined to comment on the situation there .
napolitano did n't comment on questions of possible compensation in cases of terror suspects who might have been wrongly detained .

the company said in a statement that it would adapt output in germany , romania and spain to the " unprecedented decline in the european new car market and the continuing negative economic outlook . "
ford 's plant in valencia , spain will operate on two shifts instead of three , and a plant in saarlouis , germany will follow through on a previously announced 20-day production pause .
but its plant in cologne , western germany will continue full production to meet demand sparked by the german government 's subsidy that offers people willing to scrap their old cars a cash rebate of 2,500 euros on a more environmentally-friendly new car .
the subsidy has boosted sales of smaller cars such as the fiesta and fusion models .
the statement said that the cologne plant would " share with ford 's craiova -lrb- romania -rrb- engine plant the production of a new , small-displacement ecoboost advanced petrol engine . "
more action could follow the us carmaker employs some 70,000 people in europe , where it has 22 factories .

the company said in a statement that it would adapt output in germany , romania and spain to the " unprecedented decline in the european new car market and the continuing negative economic outlook . "
ford 's plant in valencia , spain will operate on two shifts instead of three , and a plant in saarlouis , germany will follow through on a previously announced 20-day production pause .

the subsidy has boosted sales of smaller cars such as the fiesta and fusion models .
the statement said that the cologne plant would " share with ford 's craiova -lrb- romania -rrb- engine plant the production of a new , small-displacement ecoboost advanced petrol engine . "

" based on this , there is reason to suspect this may be a case of involuntary manslaughter . "

all the weapons except one , a 9mm beretta pistol , were said to be locked in a safe at the residence . the teenage gunman tim k is believed to have stolen the unsecured pistol from his father 's bedroom and used it to shoot dead 12 students and teachers at the albertville secondary school on march 11 .
prosecutors could charge the man , whose name has not been released , with involuntary manslaughter for leaving the murder weapons unlocked in his bedroom despite knowing his son was depressed .
police have said that tim k was treated for depression between april and september of last year , before breaking off his treatment .
" there are concrete signs that the parents knew of their son 's health problems , " the prosecutors and local police said in a joint statement .
" based on this , there is reason to suspect this may be a case of involuntary manslaughter . "
motives remain a mystery the teenager , a former pupil at the school where he went on a shooting rampage , killed three other people as he fled the town , before police stopped him and he turned the gun on himself .
a funeral was due to be held monday for one of the female pupils killed in the attack .
further funerals are to take place during the week .

all the weapons except one , a 9mm beretta pistol , were said to be locked in a safe at the residence . the teenage gunman tim k is believed to have stolen the unsecured pistol from his father 's bedroom and used it to shoot dead 12 students and teachers at the albertville secondary school on march 11 .

" there are concrete signs that the parents knew of their son 's health problems , " the prosecutors and local police said in a joint statement .
" based on this , there is reason to suspect this may be a case of involuntary manslaughter . "

now , a study has concluded that thousands of german high school students are gaming addicts . some 14,000 ninth graders in germany are considered to be addicted to computer games , according to a new study carried out by the criminological research institute -lrb- cri -rrb- of lower saxony .
the results of the study are being presented on monday , march 16 , in hanover .
a further 23,000 students in this age group are considered to be in danger of becoming gaming addicts , the study said .
researchers interviewed 44,610 ninth-graders nationwide on their gaming habits . they found that ninth graders devote an average of 130 minutes to computer video games on school days , and an average of 167 minutes a day on weekends .
the rates of addiction are strongly correlated to gender .
researchers concluded that nationally , some 3 percent of 15-year-old boys are gaming addicts , while only 0.3 percent of ninth-grade girls were said to have an addiction .
the study also found that teens increasingly spend time playing games in front of their computers .
on average , young people now spend 40 more minutes gaming each day than they did in 2005 .
stricter age limits needed , expert says the head of the cri , christian pfeiffer , singled out one online role-playing game , " world of warcraft " as being particularly addictive and suggested upping the age at which people are permitted to play from 12 to 18 years .

a further 23,000 students in this age group are considered to be in danger of becoming gaming addicts , the study said .
researchers interviewed 44,610 ninth-graders nationwide on their gaming habits . they found that ninth graders devote an average of 130 minutes to computer video games on school days , and an average of 167 minutes a day on weekends .
the rates of addiction are strongly correlated to gender .
researchers concluded that nationally , some 3 percent of 15-year-old boys are gaming addicts , while only 0.3 percent of ninth-grade girls were said to have an addiction .

the news about zumwinkel , who is currently living in a chateau in italy 's lake garda , unleashed cries of outrage from a panoply of german politicians and commentators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german 's deutsche post is one of the world 's largest logistics firms zumwinkel , 65 - who was forced to resign as deutsche post 's ceo in february of 2008 , was convicted in january , 2009 , of evading nearly one million euros in taxes by hiding the sum in a secret trust in the alpine tax haven of liechtenstein .
a german court penalized zumwinkel with a one million euro fine and two-year prison sentence , which he has yet to serve .
but at a time when the global financial crisis has led to germany 's worst recession since world war ii , the news of the payout has sparked public outrage .
politicians of all stripes have jumped on the bandwagon to denounce business leaders who continue to rake in high salaries and bonuses despite falling profits and management failures that have run their companies to the ground .
' scandalous ' payout on sunday , bavaria 's premier and csu party chief horst seehofer told german newspapers the 20 million payout was " scandalous . "
" these are the kind of people who destroy our social market economy , " said seehofer , whose conservative csu is the bavarian sister party to german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats . " the average person is worried about his job , and mr. zumwinkel is stuffing his pockets full of cash , " he said .
since the german state is a big stakeholder in deutsche post , which was formerly a government monopoly , seehofer even called for an investigation into the justification for such a huge pension payout .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in merkel 's governing coalition were just as scathing .
" this is such an insult to all those in our country who work hard , pay their taxes and stick to the rules , " said spd general secretary hubertus heil .
the huge pension payout comes at a time deutsche post had been hit by losses totalling nearly 1.7 million euros for 2008 .
zumwinkel legally entitled to huge pension payout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel hid nearly one million euros in liechtenstein .
the company 's spokeswoman silje skogstad however told the business news website bloomberg that zumwinkel was entitled to his full pension payout according to the terms of his executive compensation package .
" the financing of zumwinkel 's pension claims is completed , " she said .
however , skogstad declined to comment on the 20 million euro sum cited by faz .
the outrage even reached the ranks of some free democrats , the german political party that favors market liberalization .
leading fdp politician dirk niebel told the faz : " not everything that is legal is legitimate . "
police raid zumwinkel 's chateau in another scandal possibly implicating the former deutsche post boss , police raided his chateau in italy 's scenic lake garda last week , said german prosecutors on friday .
zumwinkel 's other homes - an old villa in cologne and a home in switzerland - had also been raided by the police .
the raid was linked to an investigation into an alleged eavesdropping scandal among employees at deutsche telekom .
telekom workers were said to have leaked company information to journalists in 2005-2006 , where zumwinkel had served as supervisory board chairman at the same time he was post chief . df / jen / faz / bloomberg / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" these are the kind of people who destroy our social market economy , " said seehofer , whose conservative csu is the bavarian sister party to german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats . " the average person is worried about his job , and mr. zumwinkel is stuffing his pockets full of cash , " he said .
since the german state is a big stakeholder in deutsche post , which was formerly a government monopoly , seehofer even called for an investigation into the justification for such a huge pension payout .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in merkel 's governing coalition were just as scathing .
" this is such an insult to all those in our country who work hard , pay their taxes and stick to the rules , " said spd general secretary hubertus heil .
the huge pension payout comes at a time deutsche post had been hit by losses totalling nearly 1.7 million euros for 2008 .

the outrage even reached the ranks of some free democrats , the german political party that favors market liberalization .
leading fdp politician dirk niebel told the faz : " not everything that is legal is legitimate . "

the news about zumwinkel , who is currently living in a chateau in italy 's lake garda , unleashed cries of outrage from a panoply of german politicians and commentators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german 's deutsche post is one of the world 's largest logistics firms zumwinkel , 65 - who was forced to resign as deutsche post 's ceo in february of 2008 , was convicted in january , 2009 , of evading nearly one million euros in taxes by hiding the sum in a secret trust in the alpine tax haven of liechtenstein .
a german court penalized zumwinkel with a one million euro fine and two-year prison sentence , which he has yet to serve .
but at a time when the global financial crisis has led to germany 's worst recession since world war ii , the news of the payout has sparked public outrage .
politicians of all stripes have jumped on the bandwagon to denounce business leaders who continue to rake in high salaries and bonuses despite falling profits and management failures that have run their companies to the ground .
' scandalous ' payout on sunday , bavaria 's premier and csu party chief horst seehofer told german newspapers the 20 million payout was " scandalous . "
" these are the kind of people who destroy our social market economy , " said seehofer , whose conservative csu is the bavarian sister party to german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats . " the average person is worried about his job , and mr. zumwinkel is stuffing his pockets full of cash , " he said .
since the german state is a big stakeholder in deutsche post , which was formerly a government monopoly , seehofer even called for an investigation into the justification for such a huge pension payout .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in merkel 's governing coalition were just as scathing .
" this is such an insult to all those in our country who work hard , pay their taxes and stick to the rules , " said spd general secretary hubertus heil .
the huge pension payout comes at a time deutsche post had been hit by losses totalling nearly 1.7 million euros for 2008 .
zumwinkel legally entitled to huge pension payout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel hid nearly one million euros in liechtenstein .
the company 's spokeswoman silje skogstad however told the business news website bloomberg that zumwinkel was entitled to his full pension payout according to the terms of his executive compensation package .
" the financing of zumwinkel 's pension claims is completed , " she said .
however , skogstad declined to comment on the 20 million euro sum cited by faz .
the outrage even reached the ranks of some free democrats , the german political party that favors market liberalization .
leading fdp politician dirk niebel told the faz : " not everything that is legal is legitimate . "
police raid zumwinkel 's chateau in another scandal possibly implicating the former deutsche post boss , police raided his chateau in italy 's scenic lake garda last week , said german prosecutors on friday .
zumwinkel 's other homes - an old villa in cologne and a home in switzerland - had also been raided by the police .
the raid was linked to an investigation into an alleged eavesdropping scandal among employees at deutsche telekom .
telekom workers were said to have leaked company information to journalists in 2005-2006 , where zumwinkel had served as supervisory board chairman at the same time he was post chief . df / jen / faz / bloomberg / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the testimony will continue to be shown in the coming days of the closed-door trial .
the main charge against the 73-year-old austrian relates to the murder of a newborn boy who died in a secret cellar under his house in 1996 . fritzl also faces charges of rape , coercion and enslavement of his daughter , as well as incest and deprivation of her liberty and that of three of her children .
as the trial opened , prosecutors accused fritzl of repeatedly having raped elisabeth in front of her young children .
fritzl , who was deemed fit for trial following a psychiatric assessment in october , could face a sentence of 10 to 15 years or life in prison if the eight-member jury finds him guilty of murder .
under austrian law , sentences are not cumulative , so he will serve only the longest of the sentences he receives for the crimes he is deemed to have committed .
lawyer to contest murder charge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the austrian says one of his secret cellar children was stillborn , not murdered fritzl 's lawyer said that the charge of enslavement was inappropriate and that he would contest the murder charge by maintaining that the baby was still-born .

neither elisabeth nor her children are expected to appear at the trial , which will be presided over by three judges .
they are now living in a secret location under new identities .
fritzl 's appearance at the court on monday morning was the first time he had been seen in public since his arrest on april 26 last year .
he attempted to cover his face with a blue binder .
due to the personal nature of the testimony , no journalists will be allowed inside the court .
instead , there will be daily press briefings with updates on the proceedings .
the media will be admitted into the court for the verdict , which is expected friday .
a case that shocked the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritzl 's victims thanked the public for their support via this poster the shocking case came to light in april last year when elisabeth 's oldest child , 19-year-old kerstin , who had lived her entire life underground with two brothers and her mother , fell ill and had to be hospitalized .
three of elisabeth 's other children had at an early age been brought to live upstairs with fritzl and his wife , rosemarie .
they had no knowledge of their mother and siblings living in the soundproofed cellar below the family home .
fritzl told his wife that the children had been abandoned by elisabeth , who he said had run off to join a sect .
police say rosemarie was unaware of her husband 's second life in the windowless basement complex .
shortly after his arrest , fritzl confessed to raping and holding his daughter for 24 years with no sunlight , fresh air , heating or hot water .

under austrian law , sentences are not cumulative , so he will serve only the longest of the sentences he receives for the crimes he is deemed to have committed .
lawyer to contest murder charge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the austrian says one of his secret cellar children was stillborn , not murdered fritzl 's lawyer said that the charge of enslavement was inappropriate and that he would contest the murder charge by maintaining that the baby was still-born .
prosecutors say fritzl is responsible for the twin baby 's death because he failed to seek medical help for the infant .
neither elisabeth nor her children are expected to appear at the trial , which will be presided over by three judges .
they are now living in a secret location under new identities .
fritzl 's appearance at the court on monday morning was the first time he had been seen in public since his arrest on april 26 last year .
he attempted to cover his face with a blue binder .
due to the personal nature of the testimony , no journalists will be allowed inside the court .
instead , there will be daily press briefings with updates on the proceedings .
the media will be admitted into the court for the verdict , which is expected friday .
a case that shocked the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritzl 's victims thanked the public for their support via this poster the shocking case came to light in april last year when elisabeth 's oldest child , 19-year-old kerstin , who had lived her entire life underground with two brothers and her mother , fell ill and had to be hospitalized .
three of elisabeth 's other children had at an early age been brought to live upstairs with fritzl and his wife , rosemarie .
they had no knowledge of their mother and siblings living in the soundproofed cellar below the family home .
fritzl told his wife that the children had been abandoned by elisabeth , who he said had run off to join a sect .
police say rosemarie was unaware of her husband 's second life in the windowless basement complex .
shortly after his arrest , fritzl confessed to raping and holding his daughter for 24 years with no sunlight , fresh air , heating or hot water .

it was due to launch from the plesetsk cosmodrome in the northwest of russia on monday afternoon .
but a spokesman at the esa centre for earth observation in frascati , italy , near rome , said the countdown was suspended when the service tower protecting the rocket failed to move clear of the pad and allow the satellite to lift off .
" the launch was delayed until the back-up date , tomorrow .
the reasons are being checked .
it is due to technical reasons connected to the ground services , " a spokesman for the russian space center said .
the 346-million-euro satellite is to reach orbit strapped to the back of a modified russian ballistic missile .
the orbiting of the goce satellite has been pushed back several times over fears that the launch system was not ready after an earlier esa satellite , designed to map the world 's ice fields , crashed in 2005 .
insights into oceans , gravity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esa hopes to gain insights into the earth 's oceans and gravity esa scientists said goce would map the earth 's gravitational field with unprecedented resolution and accuracy .
scientists believe data obtained by the satellite could also help improve their understanding of ocean circulation and sea-level change , both of which are affected by climate change .
the data could also assist in the study of geo-hazards , such as volcanoes and earthquakes .
goce bears little resemblance to the plain , functional boxes that are usually launched into space .
one of the scientists who worked on the mission , reiner rummel of the technical university of munich , has called it " the most beautiful satellite that has ever been built . "
european technology , design the satellite has fins and a sleek , arrow-like body , which are needed to keep the craft stable as it flies in the outer limits of the atmosphere at an altitude of just under 270 kilometers .
this orbit is much closer to earth than most other planetary observation missions , and is essential if goce is to pick up minute gravitational variations across the planet .
the esa said goce 's design reflects european achievements in both engineering and science .
forty-five companies from 13 european countries worked with the space agency on the satellite , the first of esa 's earth explorers , a series of spacecraft designed to provide answers to important environmental questions .
" precisely in times of climate change , a process that is still a long way from being completely understood , researchers need continuous , new earth observations , " rummel said .
if all goes well on the second launch attempt , goce will transmit data back to earth over a period of eight months . dfm / dc / dpa / afp / esa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

all the weapons except one , a 9mm beretta pistol , were said to be locked in a safe at the residence . the teenage gunman tim k is believed to have stolen the unsecured pistol from his father 's bedroom and used it to shoot dead 12 students and teachers at the albertville secondary school on march 11 .
prosecutors could charge the man , whose name has not been released , with involuntary manslaughter for leaving the murder weapons unlocked in his bedroom despite knowing his son was depressed .
police have said that tim k was treated for depression between april and september of last year , before breaking off his treatment .
" there are concrete signs that the parents knew of their son 's health problems , " the prosecutors and local police said in a joint statement .
" based on this , there is reason to suspect this may be a case of involuntary manslaughter . "
motives remain a mystery the teenager , a former pupil at the school where he went on a shooting rampage , killed three other people as he fled the town , before police stopped him and he turned the gun on himself .
a funeral was due to be held monday for one of the female pupils killed in the attack .

berlin , however , is concerned bailout money it provides could end up flowing across the atlantic to gm rather than to secure production in germany . one of the main issues guttenberg will address is the ownership of patents and other intellectual property opel requires to continue producing cars .
he will also explore gm and the us government 's willingness to let go of opel . chancellor angela merkel told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk that guttenberg needed to " clarify how general motors would be able to back away in order to give opel more room to move . " no easy answers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is guttenberg 's first us trip as a german minister guttenberg is not expected to bring back a final answer on the opel issue , however .
berlin has made it clear it wants to know exactly what the us administration has planned with gm before it makes a decision about offering state aid to opel . " i have been told that the us government will decide what it will do in regard to gm within the next 14 days , " german finance minister peer steinbrueck said . gm has been hard hit by the global downturn in car sales .
auditors have raised " substantial doubts " over the iconic us manufacturer 's ability to survive the storm . the firm has said that it could cut up to 47,000 jobs worldwide , raising serious concerns for its european subsidiaries opel , vauxhall and saab - all of whose futures are now in doubt . even if gm does decide it would sell its german-based subsidiary , the company would have to find a buyer .
merkel has said the government may be willing to provide loan guarantees to the company but would not buy a direct stake in the automaker . independent investor needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nation fears for thousands of opel jobs signaling that a possible opel bailout could become a central theme to campaigning ahead of september 's parliamentary elections , franz muentefering , head of the social democratic party , which currently shares power with merkel 's christian democratic union , did not rule out the state coming to opel 's aid . " i can imagine the state taking a stake -lrb- in an independent opel -rrb- if it is a temporary measure to ensure the stability of a company that for the most part can survive on its own , " he told the super illu magazine . leaders in the four german states with opel factories are keen to find ways of preserving up to 50,000 jobs that could be at stake , should opel - and the suppliers it depends on - crumble . hesse premier roland koch also said he would consider providing aid to an independent investor interested in buying opel , which has its headquarters in his state . " my conception would be the creation of a new , european opel in which a private investor takes a stake in addition to its current parent company , general motors , " koch told german newsmagazine der spiegel . he added that the state and federal governments could step in with guarantees for two to three years if the investor had difficulty receiving credit . guttenberg 's schedule calls for additional talks with us president barack obama 's economic advisor larry summers ; us treasury secretary timothy geithner ; the heads the imf and world bank ; as well as several us banks on tuesday . sms / jen / dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but victory for second-placed bayern munich came at the price of star striker miroslav klose . sv hamburg enjoyed a 2-0 victory over energie cottbus sunday to move up to fourth spot in the bundesliga , while in the day 's other game vfb stuttgart were hammered 4-0 by werder bremen .
an ivica olic header after 32 minutes and a free kick from piotr trochowski seven minutes later were enough to ensure victory for martin jol 's hamburg , moving them to 45 points along with bayern munich and vfl wolfsburg , but in fourth place on goal difference .
the three clubs remain four points adrift of league leaders hertha berlin , which defeated bayer leverkusen 1-0 on saturday .
bayern beat vfl bochum 3-0 , while wolfsburg enjoyed a 4-3 victory over schalke 04 on friday .
petric out " that was a routine victory but it was pretty important , " said jol .
" we lacked pace in the second half , but i am happy . "
trochowski replaced mladen petric after just half an hour after the croatian forward pulled a muscle .
the injury puts petric out of action for at least two weeks , meaning he will miss next thursday 's uefa cup clash with turkish giants galatasaray .
hamburg took the lead shortly after trochowski 's introduction when olic got his head on the end of a mickael taveres cross .
germany international trochowski made it 2-0 with a free kick that left cottbus goalkeeper gerhard tremmel with no chance .
olic , who is to move to bayern in the summer , had a chance to make it 3-0 in the second half but ivica iliev cleared off the line .
bremen dominate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen stayed in tenth place despite smashing stuttgart over the weekend bremen meanwhile put a recent controversy over transfer dealings behind them to easily account for stuttgart .
brazilian playmaker diego opened the scoring from a free kick on 34 minutes before turning provider on 53 minutes , back-heeling the ball into the path of claudio pizarro , who rifled home from the edge of the area .
the midfielder was also involved in the bremen 's third goal on 64 minutes , setting up markus rosenberg , who completed the rout 10 minutes later with a second goal .
european hopes the loss is a blow to stuttgart 's hopes of qualifying for the next european season .
markus babbel 's side stay on 39 points , four points behind fifth-placed hoffenheim .
bremen meanwhile continue to sit in a disappointing 10th .
" we showed nothing today , that was really disappointing , simply too little , " said stuttgart 's thomas hitzlsperger .
cottbus remain firmly mired in the relegation zone after the defeat to hamburg , three points clear of bottom club sc karlsruhe and two behind borussia moenchengladbach , who beat cologne 4-2 on saturday .
also saturday , hanover 96 came from two goals down twice to draw 4-4 with borussia dortmund , and arminia bielefeld won 1-0 at karlsruhe .

the paper quoted hoeness on its web site as saying that klose was due to undergo surgery later monday " and will then miss six to eight weeks . "
klose will not only miss upcoming bundesliga matches but also munich 's european champions league quarterfinals and two world cup qualifiers for germany .
the 30-year-old damaged ligaments in his right ankle in bayern 's defeat of bochum when he stepped into a small hole on the pitch .
the injury added to munich 's attacking woes with italian striker luca toni and french midfielder franck ribery sidelined and landon donovan back in the us after bayern decided against a transfer .
fourth-choice frontman lukas podolski is munich 's only striker at the moment .
but hoeness said that ribery and toni could both return for the weekend 's league match against bottom club sc karlsruhe .
bundesliga defense also over the weekend , former germany coach and national team player rudi voeller rejected criticism of the bundesliga by current national team coach joachim loew . " this statement that all 20 english clubs are better and quicker than bundesliga clubs is not right .
though it is still a question of money , " the boss of bundesliga club bayer leverkusen said in a television interview . " i have to contradict him entirely on this point , " voeller said .
" i think we are comparable to the leagues in england , spain and italy , which operate under different financial conditions . " of course we can not keep up with the top four english clubs , which are in the quarterfinals of the champions league .
over there , soccer is played a little faster than in the bundesliga , " voeller said . dfm / sp / dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin , however , is concerned bailout money it provides could end up flowing across the atlantic to gm rather than to secure production in germany . one of the main issues guttenberg will address is the ownership of patents and other intellectual property opel requires to continue producing cars .
he will also explore gm and the us government 's willingness to let go of opel . chancellor angela merkel told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk that guttenberg needed to " clarify how general motors would be able to back away in order to give opel more room to move . " no easy answers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is guttenberg 's first us trip as a german minister guttenberg is not expected to bring back a final answer on the opel issue , however .
berlin has made it clear it wants to know exactly what the us administration has planned with gm before it makes a decision about offering state aid to opel . " i have been told that the us government will decide what it will do in regard to gm within the next 14 days , " german finance minister peer steinbrueck said . gm has been hard hit by the global downturn in car sales .
auditors have raised " substantial doubts " over the iconic us manufacturer 's ability to survive the storm . the firm has said that it could cut up to 47,000 jobs worldwide , raising serious concerns for its european subsidiaries opel , vauxhall and saab - all of whose futures are now in doubt . even if gm does decide it would sell its german-based subsidiary , the company would have to find a buyer .

" i can imagine the state taking a stake -lrb- in an independent opel -rrb- if it is a temporary measure to ensure the stability of a company that for the most part can survive on its own , " he told the super illu magazine . leaders in the four german states with opel factories are keen to find ways of preserving up to 50,000 jobs that could be at stake , should opel - and the suppliers it depends on - crumble . hesse premier roland koch also said he would consider providing aid to an independent investor interested in buying opel , which has its headquarters in his state . " my conception would be the creation of a new , european opel in which a private investor takes a stake in addition to its current parent company , general motors , " koch told german newsmagazine der spiegel . he added that the state and federal governments could step in with guarantees for two to three years if the investor had difficulty receiving credit . guttenberg 's schedule calls for additional talks with us president barack obama 's economic advisor larry summers ; us treasury secretary timothy geithner ; the heads the imf and world bank ; as well as several us banks on tuesday . sms / jen / dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin , however , is concerned bailout money it provides could end up flowing across the atlantic to gm rather than to secure production in germany . one of the main issues guttenberg will address is the ownership of patents and other intellectual property opel requires to continue producing cars .
he will also explore gm and the us government 's willingness to let go of opel . chancellor angela merkel told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk that guttenberg needed to " clarify how general motors would be able to back away in order to give opel more room to move . " no easy answers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is guttenberg 's first us trip as a german minister guttenberg is not expected to bring back a final answer on the opel issue , however .
berlin has made it clear it wants to know exactly what the us administration has planned with gm before it makes a decision about offering state aid to opel . " i have been told that the us government will decide what it will do in regard to gm within the next 14 days , " german finance minister peer steinbrueck said . gm has been hard hit by the global downturn in car sales .
auditors have raised " substantial doubts " over the iconic us manufacturer 's ability to survive the storm . the firm has said that it could cut up to 47,000 jobs worldwide , raising serious concerns for its european subsidiaries opel , vauxhall and saab - all of whose futures are now in doubt . even if gm does decide it would sell its german-based subsidiary , the company would have to find a buyer .
merkel has said the government may be willing to provide loan guarantees to the company but would not buy a direct stake in the automaker . independent investor needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nation fears for thousands of opel jobs signaling that a possible opel bailout could become a central theme to campaigning ahead of september 's parliamentary elections , franz muentefering , head of the social democratic party , which currently shares power with merkel 's christian democratic union , did not rule out the state coming to opel 's aid . " i can imagine the state taking a stake -lrb- in an independent opel -rrb- if it is a temporary measure to ensure the stability of a company that for the most part can survive on its own , " he told the super illu magazine . leaders in the four german states with opel factories are keen to find ways of preserving up to 50,000 jobs that could be at stake , should opel - and the suppliers it depends on - crumble . hesse premier roland koch also said he would consider providing aid to an independent investor interested in buying opel , which has its headquarters in his state . " my conception would be the creation of a new , european opel in which a private investor takes a stake in addition to its current parent company , general motors , " koch told german newsmagazine der spiegel . he added that the state and federal governments could step in with guarantees for two to three years if the investor had difficulty receiving credit . guttenberg 's schedule calls for additional talks with us president barack obama 's economic advisor larry summers ; us treasury secretary timothy geithner ; the heads the imf and world bank ; as well as several us banks on tuesday . sms / jen / dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

though it is still a question of money , " the boss of bundesliga club bayer leverkusen said in a television interview . " i have to contradict him entirely on this point , " voeller said .
" i think we are comparable to the leagues in england , spain and italy , which operate under different financial conditions . " of course we can not keep up with the top four english clubs , which are in the quarterfinals of the champions league .

the testimony will continue to be shown in the coming days of the closed-door trial .
the main charge against the 73-year-old austrian relates to the murder of a newborn boy who died in a secret cellar under his house in 1996 . fritzl also faces charges of rape , coercion and enslavement of his daughter , as well as incest and deprivation of her liberty and that of three of her children .
as the trial opened , prosecutors accused fritzl of repeatedly having raped elisabeth in front of her young children .
fritzl , who was deemed fit for trial following a psychiatric assessment in october , could face a sentence of 10 to 15 years or life in prison if the eight-member jury finds him guilty of murder .
under austrian law , sentences are not cumulative , so he will serve only the longest of the sentences he receives for the crimes he is deemed to have committed .

prosecutors say fritzl is responsible for the twin baby 's death because he failed to seek medical help for the infant .
neither elisabeth nor her children are expected to appear at the trial , which will be presided over by three judges .
they are now living in a secret location under new identities .
fritzl 's appearance at the court on monday morning was the first time he had been seen in public since his arrest on april 26 last year .
he attempted to cover his face with a blue binder .
due to the personal nature of the testimony , no journalists will be allowed inside the court .
instead , there will be daily press briefings with updates on the proceedings .
the media will be admitted into the court for the verdict , which is expected friday .
a case that shocked the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritzl 's victims thanked the public for their support via this poster the shocking case came to light in april last year when elisabeth 's oldest child , 19-year-old kerstin , who had lived her entire life underground with two brothers and her mother , fell ill and had to be hospitalized .
three of elisabeth 's other children had at an early age been brought to live upstairs with fritzl and his wife , rosemarie .
they had no knowledge of their mother and siblings living in the soundproofed cellar below the family home .
fritzl told his wife that the children had been abandoned by elisabeth , who he said had run off to join a sect .
police say rosemarie was unaware of her husband 's second life in the windowless basement complex .
shortly after his arrest , fritzl confessed to raping and holding his daughter for 24 years with no sunlight , fresh air , heating or hot water .

now , a study has concluded that thousands of german high school students are gaming addicts . some 14,000 ninth graders in germany are considered to be addicted to computer games , according to a new study carried out by the criminological research institute -lrb- cri -rrb- of lower saxony .
the results of the study are being presented on monday , march 16 , in hanover .
a further 23,000 students in this age group are considered to be in danger of becoming gaming addicts , the study said .
researchers interviewed 44,610 ninth-graders nationwide on their gaming habits . they found that ninth graders devote an average of 130 minutes to computer video games on school days , and an average of 167 minutes a day on weekends .
the rates of addiction are strongly correlated to gender .
researchers concluded that nationally , some 3 percent of 15-year-old boys are gaming addicts , while only 0.3 percent of ninth-grade girls were said to have an addiction .
the study also found that teens increasingly spend time playing games in front of their computers .
on average , young people now spend 40 more minutes gaming each day than they did in 2005 .
stricter age limits needed , expert says the head of the cri , christian pfeiffer , singled out one online role-playing game , " world of warcraft " as being particularly addictive and suggested upping the age at which people are permitted to play from 12 to 18 years .

' scandalous ' payout on sunday , bavaria 's premier and csu party chief horst seehofer told german newspapers the 20 million payout was " scandalous . "

the news about zumwinkel , who is currently living in a chateau in italy 's lake garda , unleashed cries of outrage from a panoply of german politicians and commentators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german 's deutsche post is one of the world 's largest logistics firms zumwinkel , 65 - who was forced to resign as deutsche post 's ceo in february of 2008 , was convicted in january , 2009 , of evading nearly one million euros in taxes by hiding the sum in a secret trust in the alpine tax haven of liechtenstein .
a german court penalized zumwinkel with a one million euro fine and two-year prison sentence , which he has yet to serve .
but at a time when the global financial crisis has led to germany 's worst recession since world war ii , the news of the payout has sparked public outrage .
politicians of all stripes have jumped on the bandwagon to denounce business leaders who continue to rake in high salaries and bonuses despite falling profits and management failures that have run their companies to the ground .
' scandalous ' payout on sunday , bavaria 's premier and csu party chief horst seehofer told german newspapers the 20 million payout was " scandalous . "
" these are the kind of people who destroy our social market economy , " said seehofer , whose conservative csu is the bavarian sister party to german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats . " the average person is worried about his job , and mr. zumwinkel is stuffing his pockets full of cash , " he said .
since the german state is a big stakeholder in deutsche post , which was formerly a government monopoly , seehofer even called for an investigation into the justification for such a huge pension payout .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in merkel 's governing coalition were just as scathing .
" this is such an insult to all those in our country who work hard , pay their taxes and stick to the rules , " said spd general secretary hubertus heil .
the huge pension payout comes at a time deutsche post had been hit by losses totalling nearly 1.7 million euros for 2008 .
zumwinkel legally entitled to huge pension payout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel hid nearly one million euros in liechtenstein .
the company 's spokeswoman silje skogstad however told the business news website bloomberg that zumwinkel was entitled to his full pension payout according to the terms of his executive compensation package .
" the financing of zumwinkel 's pension claims is completed , " she said .
however , skogstad declined to comment on the 20 million euro sum cited by faz .
the outrage even reached the ranks of some free democrats , the german political party that favors market liberalization .
leading fdp politician dirk niebel told the faz : " not everything that is legal is legitimate . "
police raid zumwinkel 's chateau in another scandal possibly implicating the former deutsche post boss , police raided his chateau in italy 's scenic lake garda last week , said german prosecutors on friday .
zumwinkel 's other homes - an old villa in cologne and a home in switzerland - had also been raided by the police .
the raid was linked to an investigation into an alleged eavesdropping scandal among employees at deutsche telekom .
telekom workers were said to have leaked company information to journalists in 2005-2006 , where zumwinkel had served as supervisory board chairman at the same time he was post chief . df / jen / faz / bloomberg / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an ivica olic header after 32 minutes and a free kick from piotr trochowski seven minutes later were enough to ensure victory for martin jol 's hamburg , moving them to 45 points along with bayern munich and vfl wolfsburg , but in fourth place on goal difference .
the three clubs remain four points adrift of league leaders hertha berlin , which defeated bayer leverkusen 1-0 on saturday .
bayern beat vfl bochum 3-0 , while wolfsburg enjoyed a 4-3 victory over schalke 04 on friday .
petric out " that was a routine victory but it was pretty important , " said jol .
" we lacked pace in the second half , but i am happy . "
trochowski replaced mladen petric after just half an hour after the croatian forward pulled a muscle .

the midfielder was also involved in the bremen 's third goal on 64 minutes , setting up markus rosenberg , who completed the rout 10 minutes later with a second goal .
european hopes the loss is a blow to stuttgart 's hopes of qualifying for the next european season .
markus babbel 's side stay on 39 points , four points behind fifth-placed hoffenheim .
bremen meanwhile continue to sit in a disappointing 10th .
" we showed nothing today , that was really disappointing , simply too little , " said stuttgart 's thomas hitzlsperger .

bundesliga defense also over the weekend , former germany coach and national team player rudi voeller rejected criticism of the bundesliga by current national team coach joachim loew . " this statement that all 20 english clubs are better and quicker than bundesliga clubs is not right .
though it is still a question of money , " the boss of bundesliga club bayer leverkusen said in a television interview . " i have to contradict him entirely on this point , " voeller said .
" i think we are comparable to the leagues in england , spain and italy , which operate under different financial conditions . " of course we can not keep up with the top four english clubs , which are in the quarterfinals of the champions league .

the news about zumwinkel , who is currently living in a chateau in italy 's lake garda , unleashed cries of outrage from a panoply of german politicians and commentators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german 's deutsche post is one of the world 's largest logistics firms zumwinkel , 65 - who was forced to resign as deutsche post 's ceo in february of 2008 , was convicted in january , 2009 , of evading nearly one million euros in taxes by hiding the sum in a secret trust in the alpine tax haven of liechtenstein .
a german court penalized zumwinkel with a one million euro fine and two-year prison sentence , which he has yet to serve .
but at a time when the global financial crisis has led to germany 's worst recession since world war ii , the news of the payout has sparked public outrage .
politicians of all stripes have jumped on the bandwagon to denounce business leaders who continue to rake in high salaries and bonuses despite falling profits and management failures that have run their companies to the ground .
' scandalous ' payout on sunday , bavaria 's premier and csu party chief horst seehofer told german newspapers the 20 million payout was " scandalous . "
" these are the kind of people who destroy our social market economy , " said seehofer , whose conservative csu is the bavarian sister party to german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats . " the average person is worried about his job , and mr. zumwinkel is stuffing his pockets full of cash , " he said .
since the german state is a big stakeholder in deutsche post , which was formerly a government monopoly , seehofer even called for an investigation into the justification for such a huge pension payout .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in merkel 's governing coalition were just as scathing .
" this is such an insult to all those in our country who work hard , pay their taxes and stick to the rules , " said spd general secretary hubertus heil .

the company 's spokeswoman silje skogstad however told the business news website bloomberg that zumwinkel was entitled to his full pension payout according to the terms of his executive compensation package .
" the financing of zumwinkel 's pension claims is completed , " she said .
however , skogstad declined to comment on the 20 million euro sum cited by faz .
the outrage even reached the ranks of some free democrats , the german political party that favors market liberalization .
leading fdp politician dirk niebel told the faz : " not everything that is legal is legitimate . "
police raid zumwinkel 's chateau in another scandal possibly implicating the former deutsche post boss , police raided his chateau in italy 's scenic lake garda last week , said german prosecutors on friday .
zumwinkel 's other homes - an old villa in cologne and a home in switzerland - had also been raided by the police .
the raid was linked to an investigation into an alleged eavesdropping scandal among employees at deutsche telekom .

the results of the study are being presented on monday , march 16 , in hanover .
a further 23,000 students in this age group are considered to be in danger of becoming gaming addicts , the study said .
researchers interviewed 44,610 ninth-graders nationwide on their gaming habits . they found that ninth graders devote an average of 130 minutes to computer video games on school days , and an average of 167 minutes a day on weekends .
the rates of addiction are strongly correlated to gender .
researchers concluded that nationally , some 3 percent of 15-year-old boys are gaming addicts , while only 0.3 percent of ninth-grade girls were said to have an addiction .

on average , young people now spend 40 more minutes gaming each day than they did in 2005 .

the testimony will continue to be shown in the coming days of the closed-door trial .
the main charge against the 73-year-old austrian relates to the murder of a newborn boy who died in a secret cellar under his house in 1996 . fritzl also faces charges of rape , coercion and enslavement of his daughter , as well as incest and deprivation of her liberty and that of three of her children .
as the trial opened , prosecutors accused fritzl of repeatedly having raped elisabeth in front of her young children .
fritzl , who was deemed fit for trial following a psychiatric assessment in october , could face a sentence of 10 to 15 years or life in prison if the eight-member jury finds him guilty of murder .
under austrian law , sentences are not cumulative , so he will serve only the longest of the sentences he receives for the crimes he is deemed to have committed .
lawyer to contest murder charge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the austrian says one of his secret cellar children was stillborn , not murdered fritzl 's lawyer said that the charge of enslavement was inappropriate and that he would contest the murder charge by maintaining that the baby was still-born .
prosecutors say fritzl is responsible for the twin baby 's death because he failed to seek medical help for the infant .
neither elisabeth nor her children are expected to appear at the trial , which will be presided over by three judges .
they are now living in a secret location under new identities .
fritzl 's appearance at the court on monday morning was the first time he had been seen in public since his arrest on april 26 last year .
he attempted to cover his face with a blue binder .
due to the personal nature of the testimony , no journalists will be allowed inside the court .
instead , there will be daily press briefings with updates on the proceedings .
the media will be admitted into the court for the verdict , which is expected friday .
a case that shocked the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritzl 's victims thanked the public for their support via this poster the shocking case came to light in april last year when elisabeth 's oldest child , 19-year-old kerstin , who had lived her entire life underground with two brothers and her mother , fell ill and had to be hospitalized .
three of elisabeth 's other children had at an early age been brought to live upstairs with fritzl and his wife , rosemarie .
they had no knowledge of their mother and siblings living in the soundproofed cellar below the family home .
fritzl told his wife that the children had been abandoned by elisabeth , who he said had run off to join a sect .
police say rosemarie was unaware of her husband 's second life in the windowless basement complex .
shortly after his arrest , fritzl confessed to raping and holding his daughter for 24 years with no sunlight , fresh air , heating or hot water .
dna tests later confirmed he is the father of her six surviving children . dfm / dc / jen / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the testimony will continue to be shown in the coming days of the closed-door trial .
the main charge against the 73-year-old austrian relates to the murder of a newborn boy who died in a secret cellar under his house in 1996 . fritzl also faces charges of rape , coercion and enslavement of his daughter , as well as incest and deprivation of her liberty and that of three of her children .
as the trial opened , prosecutors accused fritzl of repeatedly having raped elisabeth in front of her young children .
fritzl , who was deemed fit for trial following a psychiatric assessment in october , could face a sentence of 10 to 15 years or life in prison if the eight-member jury finds him guilty of murder .
under austrian law , sentences are not cumulative , so he will serve only the longest of the sentences he receives for the crimes he is deemed to have committed .
lawyer to contest murder charge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the austrian says one of his secret cellar children was stillborn , not murdered fritzl 's lawyer said that the charge of enslavement was inappropriate and that he would contest the murder charge by maintaining that the baby was still-born .
prosecutors say fritzl is responsible for the twin baby 's death because he failed to seek medical help for the infant .
neither elisabeth nor her children are expected to appear at the trial , which will be presided over by three judges .
they are now living in a secret location under new identities .
fritzl 's appearance at the court on monday morning was the first time he had been seen in public since his arrest on april 26 last year .
he attempted to cover his face with a blue binder .
due to the personal nature of the testimony , no journalists will be allowed inside the court .
instead , there will be daily press briefings with updates on the proceedings .
the media will be admitted into the court for the verdict , which is expected friday .
a case that shocked the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritzl 's victims thanked the public for their support via this poster the shocking case came to light in april last year when elisabeth 's oldest child , 19-year-old kerstin , who had lived her entire life underground with two brothers and her mother , fell ill and had to be hospitalized .
three of elisabeth 's other children had at an early age been brought to live upstairs with fritzl and his wife , rosemarie .
they had no knowledge of their mother and siblings living in the soundproofed cellar below the family home .
fritzl told his wife that the children had been abandoned by elisabeth , who he said had run off to join a sect .
police say rosemarie was unaware of her husband 's second life in the windowless basement complex .
shortly after his arrest , fritzl confessed to raping and holding his daughter for 24 years with no sunlight , fresh air , heating or hot water .

“ the united states and germany will develop innovative research projects that contribute to the protection of our free , open and cross-linked transatlantic societies . ”

berlin , however , is concerned bailout money it provides could end up flowing across the atlantic to gm rather than to secure production in germany . one of the main issues guttenberg will address is the ownership of patents and other intellectual property opel requires to continue producing cars .

" i have been told that the us government will decide what it will do in regard to gm within the next 14 days , " german finance minister peer steinbrueck said . gm has been hard hit by the global downturn in car sales .
auditors have raised " substantial doubts " over the iconic us manufacturer 's ability to survive the storm . the firm has said that it could cut up to 47,000 jobs worldwide , raising serious concerns for its european subsidiaries opel , vauxhall and saab - all of whose futures are now in doubt . even if gm does decide it would sell its german-based subsidiary , the company would have to find a buyer .

berlin , however , is concerned bailout money it provides could end up flowing across the atlantic to gm rather than to secure production in germany . one of the main issues guttenberg will address is the ownership of patents and other intellectual property opel requires to continue producing cars .
he will also explore gm and the us government 's willingness to let go of opel . chancellor angela merkel told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk that guttenberg needed to " clarify how general motors would be able to back away in order to give opel more room to move . " no easy answers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is guttenberg 's first us trip as a german minister guttenberg is not expected to bring back a final answer on the opel issue , however .
berlin has made it clear it wants to know exactly what the us administration has planned with gm before it makes a decision about offering state aid to opel . " i have been told that the us government will decide what it will do in regard to gm within the next 14 days , " german finance minister peer steinbrueck said . gm has been hard hit by the global downturn in car sales .
auditors have raised " substantial doubts " over the iconic us manufacturer 's ability to survive the storm . the firm has said that it could cut up to 47,000 jobs worldwide , raising serious concerns for its european subsidiaries opel , vauxhall and saab - all of whose futures are now in doubt . even if gm does decide it would sell its german-based subsidiary , the company would have to find a buyer .
merkel has said the government may be willing to provide loan guarantees to the company but would not buy a direct stake in the automaker . independent investor needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nation fears for thousands of opel jobs signaling that a possible opel bailout could become a central theme to campaigning ahead of september 's parliamentary elections , franz muentefering , head of the social democratic party , which currently shares power with merkel 's christian democratic union , did not rule out the state coming to opel 's aid . " i can imagine the state taking a stake -lrb- in an independent opel -rrb- if it is a temporary measure to ensure the stability of a company that for the most part can survive on its own , " he told the super illu magazine . leaders in the four german states with opel factories are keen to find ways of preserving up to 50,000 jobs that could be at stake , should opel - and the suppliers it depends on - crumble . hesse premier roland koch also said he would consider providing aid to an independent investor interested in buying opel , which has its headquarters in his state . " my conception would be the creation of a new , european opel in which a private investor takes a stake in addition to its current parent company , general motors , " koch told german newsmagazine der spiegel . he added that the state and federal governments could step in with guarantees for two to three years if the investor had difficulty receiving credit . guttenberg 's schedule calls for additional talks with us president barack obama 's economic advisor larry summers ; us treasury secretary timothy geithner ; the heads the imf and world bank ; as well as several us banks on tuesday . sms / jen / dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de europe to put on a united front in dealing with gm the stakes for europe are high .
general motors , the ailing us carmaker , employs some 400,000 people in a dozen european union countries .
those countries agreed to work together to try and protect jobs .
-lrb- 14.03.2009 -rrb- german state aid for opel hangs in balance german chancellor angela merkel said conditions were not yet ripe for offering state aid to troubled carmaker opel as the gm subsidiary reportedly threatened to close three plants in europe and sack 11,000 people .
-lrb- 07.03.2009 -rrb- after inconclusive meeting , still no decision on opel talks on a rescue plan for opel , the german subsidiary of ailing us carmaker general motors , ended with many questions left unanswered .

the testimony will continue to be shown in the coming days of the closed-door trial .
the main charge against the 73-year-old austrian relates to the murder of a newborn boy who died in a secret cellar under his house in 1996 . fritzl also faces charges of rape , coercion and enslavement of his daughter , as well as incest and deprivation of her liberty and that of three of her children .
as the trial opened , prosecutors accused fritzl of repeatedly having raped elisabeth in front of her young children .
fritzl , who was deemed fit for trial following a psychiatric assessment in october , could face a sentence of 10 to 15 years or life in prison if the eight-member jury finds him guilty of murder .
under austrian law , sentences are not cumulative , so he will serve only the longest of the sentences he receives for the crimes he is deemed to have committed .
lawyer to contest murder charge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the austrian says one of his secret cellar children was stillborn , not murdered fritzl 's lawyer said that the charge of enslavement was inappropriate and that he would contest the murder charge by maintaining that the baby was still-born .
prosecutors say fritzl is responsible for the twin baby 's death because he failed to seek medical help for the infant .
neither elisabeth nor her children are expected to appear at the trial , which will be presided over by three judges .
they are now living in a secret location under new identities .
fritzl 's appearance at the court on monday morning was the first time he had been seen in public since his arrest on april 26 last year .
he attempted to cover his face with a blue binder .
due to the personal nature of the testimony , no journalists will be allowed inside the court .
instead , there will be daily press briefings with updates on the proceedings .
the media will be admitted into the court for the verdict , which is expected friday .
a case that shocked the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritzl 's victims thanked the public for their support via this poster the shocking case came to light in april last year when elisabeth 's oldest child , 19-year-old kerstin , who had lived her entire life underground with two brothers and her mother , fell ill and had to be hospitalized .
three of elisabeth 's other children had at an early age been brought to live upstairs with fritzl and his wife , rosemarie .
they had no knowledge of their mother and siblings living in the soundproofed cellar below the family home .
fritzl told his wife that the children had been abandoned by elisabeth , who he said had run off to join a sect .
police say rosemarie was unaware of her husband 's second life in the windowless basement complex .
shortly after his arrest , fritzl confessed to raping and holding his daughter for 24 years with no sunlight , fresh air , heating or hot water .

the testimony will continue to be shown in the coming days of the closed-door trial .
the main charge against the 73-year-old austrian relates to the murder of a newborn boy who died in a secret cellar under his house in 1996 . fritzl also faces charges of rape , coercion and enslavement of his daughter , as well as incest and deprivation of her liberty and that of three of her children .
as the trial opened , prosecutors accused fritzl of repeatedly having raped elisabeth in front of her young children .
fritzl , who was deemed fit for trial following a psychiatric assessment in october , could face a sentence of 10 to 15 years or life in prison if the eight-member jury finds him guilty of murder .
under austrian law , sentences are not cumulative , so he will serve only the longest of the sentences he receives for the crimes he is deemed to have committed .
lawyer to contest murder charge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the austrian says one of his secret cellar children was stillborn , not murdered fritzl 's lawyer said that the charge of enslavement was inappropriate and that he would contest the murder charge by maintaining that the baby was still-born .
prosecutors say fritzl is responsible for the twin baby 's death because he failed to seek medical help for the infant .
neither elisabeth nor her children are expected to appear at the trial , which will be presided over by three judges .
they are now living in a secret location under new identities .
fritzl 's appearance at the court on monday morning was the first time he had been seen in public since his arrest on april 26 last year .
he attempted to cover his face with a blue binder .
due to the personal nature of the testimony , no journalists will be allowed inside the court .
instead , there will be daily press briefings with updates on the proceedings .
the media will be admitted into the court for the verdict , which is expected friday .
a case that shocked the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritzl 's victims thanked the public for their support via this poster the shocking case came to light in april last year when elisabeth 's oldest child , 19-year-old kerstin , who had lived her entire life underground with two brothers and her mother , fell ill and had to be hospitalized .
three of elisabeth 's other children had at an early age been brought to live upstairs with fritzl and his wife , rosemarie .
they had no knowledge of their mother and siblings living in the soundproofed cellar below the family home .
fritzl told his wife that the children had been abandoned by elisabeth , who he said had run off to join a sect .
police say rosemarie was unaware of her husband 's second life in the windowless basement complex .

now , a study has concluded that thousands of german high school students are gaming addicts . some 14,000 ninth graders in germany are considered to be addicted to computer games , according to a new study carried out by the criminological research institute -lrb- cri -rrb- of lower saxony .
the results of the study are being presented on monday , march 16 , in hanover .
a further 23,000 students in this age group are considered to be in danger of becoming gaming addicts , the study said .
researchers interviewed 44,610 ninth-graders nationwide on their gaming habits . they found that ninth graders devote an average of 130 minutes to computer video games on school days , and an average of 167 minutes a day on weekends .
the rates of addiction are strongly correlated to gender .
researchers concluded that nationally , some 3 percent of 15-year-old boys are gaming addicts , while only 0.3 percent of ninth-grade girls were said to have an addiction .
the study also found that teens increasingly spend time playing games in front of their computers .
on average , young people now spend 40 more minutes gaming each day than they did in 2005 .
stricter age limits needed , expert says the head of the cri , christian pfeiffer , singled out one online role-playing game , " world of warcraft " as being particularly addictive and suggested upping the age at which people are permitted to play from 12 to 18 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts searching for a motive behind the winnenden shootings say video games may have been a factor pfeiffer told news magazine der spiegel that it was unacceptable that the rate of addiction was not a criteria examined when a game is assigned an age limit .
there 's been a renewed focus on the detrimental effects of excessive video gaming in the wake of last week 's school shooting in the town of winnenden in southwestern germany .

it was due to launch from the plesetsk cosmodrome in the northwest of russia on monday afternoon .

the company said in a statement that it would adapt output in germany , romania and spain to the " unprecedented decline in the european new car market and the continuing negative economic outlook . "
ford 's plant in valencia , spain will operate on two shifts instead of three , and a plant in saarlouis , germany will follow through on a previously announced 20-day production pause .
but its plant in cologne , western germany will continue full production to meet demand sparked by the german government 's subsidy that offers people willing to scrap their old cars a cash rebate of 2,500 euros on a more environmentally-friendly new car .
the subsidy has boosted sales of smaller cars such as the fiesta and fusion models .
the statement said that the cologne plant would " share with ford 's craiova -lrb- romania -rrb- engine plant the production of a new , small-displacement ecoboost advanced petrol engine . "
more action could follow the us carmaker employs some 70,000 people in europe , where it has 22 factories .
in germany , the company is bound by a union agreement to maintain jobs at their current level .
last month , ford 's european sales dropped by almost 12 percent from the same period last year to just under 89,000 cars , according to statistics from the european automovile manufacturers ' association -lrb- acea -rrb- .
" ford europe must return to sustainable profitability as soon as possible , " said john fleming , ford 's head of the region , in a statement .

the news about zumwinkel , who is currently living in a chateau in italy 's lake garda , unleashed cries of outrage from a panoply of german politicians and commentators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german 's deutsche post is one of the world 's largest logistics firms zumwinkel , 65 - who was forced to resign as deutsche post 's ceo in february of 2008 , was convicted in january , 2009 , of evading nearly one million euros in taxes by hiding the sum in a secret trust in the alpine tax haven of liechtenstein .
a german court penalized zumwinkel with a one million euro fine and two-year prison sentence , which he has yet to serve .
but at a time when the global financial crisis has led to germany 's worst recession since world war ii , the news of the payout has sparked public outrage .
politicians of all stripes have jumped on the bandwagon to denounce business leaders who continue to rake in high salaries and bonuses despite falling profits and management failures that have run their companies to the ground .
' scandalous ' payout on sunday , bavaria 's premier and csu party chief horst seehofer told german newspapers the 20 million payout was " scandalous . "
" these are the kind of people who destroy our social market economy , " said seehofer , whose conservative csu is the bavarian sister party to german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats . " the average person is worried about his job , and mr. zumwinkel is stuffing his pockets full of cash , " he said .
since the german state is a big stakeholder in deutsche post , which was formerly a government monopoly , seehofer even called for an investigation into the justification for such a huge pension payout .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in merkel 's governing coalition were just as scathing .
" this is such an insult to all those in our country who work hard , pay their taxes and stick to the rules , " said spd general secretary hubertus heil .
the huge pension payout comes at a time deutsche post had been hit by losses totalling nearly 1.7 million euros for 2008 .
zumwinkel legally entitled to huge pension payout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel hid nearly one million euros in liechtenstein .
the company 's spokeswoman silje skogstad however told the business news website bloomberg that zumwinkel was entitled to his full pension payout according to the terms of his executive compensation package .
" the financing of zumwinkel 's pension claims is completed , " she said .
however , skogstad declined to comment on the 20 million euro sum cited by faz .
the outrage even reached the ranks of some free democrats , the german political party that favors market liberalization .
leading fdp politician dirk niebel told the faz : " not everything that is legal is legitimate . "
police raid zumwinkel 's chateau in another scandal possibly implicating the former deutsche post boss , police raided his chateau in italy 's scenic lake garda last week , said german prosecutors on friday .
zumwinkel 's other homes - an old villa in cologne and a home in switzerland - had also been raided by the police .
the raid was linked to an investigation into an alleged eavesdropping scandal among employees at deutsche telekom .
telekom workers were said to have leaked company information to journalists in 2005-2006 , where zumwinkel had served as supervisory board chairman at the same time he was post chief . df / jen / faz / bloomberg / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a further 23,000 students in this age group are considered to be in danger of becoming gaming addicts , the study said .

all the weapons except one , a 9mm beretta pistol , were said to be locked in a safe at the residence . the teenage gunman tim k is believed to have stolen the unsecured pistol from his father 's bedroom and used it to shoot dead 12 students and teachers at the albertville secondary school on march 11 .

us homeland security secretary janet napolitano was in berlin on monday to sign the agreement with her german counterpart annette schavan , who is germany 's education and research minister .
the agreement is meant to develop better protection from terrorist attacks , natural disasters , large-scale accidents and organized crime .
“ we want to use the benefits of research cooperation to mobilize the best ideas for optimal risk protection in our countries , ” schavan said in an official statement .
“ the united states and germany will develop innovative research projects that contribute to the protection of our free , open and cross-linked transatlantic societies . ”
" strengthening transatlantic cooperation " the accord , which is said to cost between 10 million euros and 20 million euros by 2012 , is the first such agreement between the two countries . " it is a considerable contribution to strengthening transatlantic cooperation with the new us government , " schavan told der spiegel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : napolitano emphasized cooperation with us allies speaking in berlin , napolitano said that it was important to work with us allies in improving security without infringing on civil liberties . " homeland security is not about walling ourselves off from other countries , it is about cooperating with our allies , " she said .
napolitano also met top security officials from other major european union countries as well as german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble in berlin over the weekend .
discussions on guantanamo inmates still " premature " prior to the sunday talks , napolitano told german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung -lrb- fas -rrb- that discussions on how many guantanamo inmates would be transferred to europe were still " premature . "
us president barack obama signed an executive order to close the controversial detention camp for alleged terrorists , only days after taking office in january .
napolitano told the fas newspaper that the us administration is currently evaluating individual cases . asked about the rights of prisoners detained at the bagram military internment facility in afghanistan , she declined to comment on the situation there .
napolitano did n't comment on questions of possible compensation in cases of terror suspects who might have been wrongly detained .
but she insisted the obama administration 's methods in fighting terrorism would be fundamentally different from that of former president george w. bush .
german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , jointly interviewed by the fas with napolitano , said the fight against terrorism can only be successful when nations adhere to international conventions on human rights .
this includes passenger rights when body searches are conducted at airports .
" on one hand we want to guarantee safety in the skies without making air travel too burdensome , " he said . df / sp / faz / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 16.03.2009 german politicians outraged over payout to deutsche post 's ex-ceo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel 's $ 26 million payoff was called ' scandalous ' in spite of a conviction for tax evasion , the ex-ceo of one of the world 's leading logistic giants is legally entitled to his $ 26 million pension - a revelation that has german politicians seething . one of the world 's leading postal and logistics companies paid 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26 million -rrb- in pension claims to its disgraced former chief executive klaus zumwinkel , reported the german national newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- in its analysis of deutsche post 's 2008 annual report .
the news about zumwinkel , who is currently living in a chateau in italy 's lake garda , unleashed cries of outrage from a panoply of german politicians and commentators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german 's deutsche post is one of the world 's largest logistics firms zumwinkel , 65 - who was forced to resign as deutsche post 's ceo in february of 2008 , was convicted in january , 2009 , of evading nearly one million euros in taxes by hiding the sum in a secret trust in the alpine tax haven of liechtenstein .
a german court penalized zumwinkel with a one million euro fine and two-year prison sentence , which he has yet to serve .
but at a time when the global financial crisis has led to germany 's worst recession since world war ii , the news of the payout has sparked public outrage .
politicians of all stripes have jumped on the bandwagon to denounce business leaders who continue to rake in high salaries and bonuses despite falling profits and management failures that have run their companies to the ground .
' scandalous ' payout on sunday , bavaria 's premier and csu party chief horst seehofer told german newspapers the 20 million payout was " scandalous . "
" these are the kind of people who destroy our social market economy , " said seehofer , whose conservative csu is the bavarian sister party to german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats . " the average person is worried about his job , and mr. zumwinkel is stuffing his pockets full of cash , " he said .
since the german state is a big stakeholder in deutsche post , which was formerly a government monopoly , seehofer even called for an investigation into the justification for such a huge pension payout .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in merkel 's governing coalition were just as scathing .
" this is such an insult to all those in our country who work hard , pay their taxes and stick to the rules , " said spd general secretary hubertus heil .
the huge pension payout comes at a time deutsche post had been hit by losses totalling nearly 1.7 million euros for 2008 .
zumwinkel legally entitled to huge pension payout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel hid nearly one million euros in liechtenstein .
the company 's spokeswoman silje skogstad however told the business news website bloomberg that zumwinkel was entitled to his full pension payout according to the terms of his executive compensation package .
" the financing of zumwinkel 's pension claims is completed , " she said .
however , skogstad declined to comment on the 20 million euro sum cited by faz .
the outrage even reached the ranks of some free democrats , the german political party that favors market liberalization .
leading fdp politician dirk niebel told the faz : " not everything that is legal is legitimate . "
police raid zumwinkel 's chateau in another scandal possibly implicating the former deutsche post boss , police raided his chateau in italy 's scenic lake garda last week , said german prosecutors on friday .
zumwinkel 's other homes - an old villa in cologne and a home in switzerland - had also been raided by the police .
the raid was linked to an investigation into an alleged eavesdropping scandal among employees at deutsche telekom .
telekom workers were said to have leaked company information to journalists in 2005-2006 , where zumwinkel had served as supervisory board chairman at the same time he was post chief . df / jen / faz / bloomberg / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was due to launch from the plesetsk cosmodrome in the northwest of russia on monday afternoon .
but a spokesman at the esa centre for earth observation in frascati , italy , near rome , said the countdown was suspended when the service tower protecting the rocket failed to move clear of the pad and allow the satellite to lift off .
" the launch was delayed until the back-up date , tomorrow .
the reasons are being checked .
it is due to technical reasons connected to the ground services , " a spokesman for the russian space center said .
the 346-million-euro satellite is to reach orbit strapped to the back of a modified russian ballistic missile .

the data could also assist in the study of geo-hazards , such as volcanoes and earthquakes .
goce bears little resemblance to the plain , functional boxes that are usually launched into space .
one of the scientists who worked on the mission , reiner rummel of the technical university of munich , has called it " the most beautiful satellite that has ever been built . "
european technology , design the satellite has fins and a sleek , arrow-like body , which are needed to keep the craft stable as it flies in the outer limits of the atmosphere at an altitude of just under 270 kilometers .
this orbit is much closer to earth than most other planetary observation missions , and is essential if goce is to pick up minute gravitational variations across the planet .
the esa said goce 's design reflects european achievements in both engineering and science .
forty-five companies from 13 european countries worked with the space agency on the satellite , the first of esa 's earth explorers , a series of spacecraft designed to provide answers to important environmental questions .
" precisely in times of climate change , a process that is still a long way from being completely understood , researchers need continuous , new earth observations , " rummel said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 16.03.2009 bundesliga top five continue jostle as klose sidelined for two months großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg edged closer to top spot after downing energie cottbus bundesliga leaders hertha berlin maintained their position as the club 's nearest four rivals kept up the fight for top spot .
but victory for second-placed bayern munich came at the price of star striker miroslav klose . sv hamburg enjoyed a 2-0 victory over energie cottbus sunday to move up to fourth spot in the bundesliga , while in the day 's other game vfb stuttgart were hammered 4-0 by werder bremen .
an ivica olic header after 32 minutes and a free kick from piotr trochowski seven minutes later were enough to ensure victory for martin jol 's hamburg , moving them to 45 points along with bayern munich and vfl wolfsburg , but in fourth place on goal difference .
the three clubs remain four points adrift of league leaders hertha berlin , which defeated bayer leverkusen 1-0 on saturday .
bayern beat vfl bochum 3-0 , while wolfsburg enjoyed a 4-3 victory over schalke 04 on friday .
petric out " that was a routine victory but it was pretty important , " said jol .
" we lacked pace in the second half , but i am happy . "
trochowski replaced mladen petric after just half an hour after the croatian forward pulled a muscle .
the injury puts petric out of action for at least two weeks , meaning he will miss next thursday 's uefa cup clash with turkish giants galatasaray .
hamburg took the lead shortly after trochowski 's introduction when olic got his head on the end of a mickael taveres cross .
germany international trochowski made it 2-0 with a free kick that left cottbus goalkeeper gerhard tremmel with no chance .
olic , who is to move to bayern in the summer , had a chance to make it 3-0 in the second half but ivica iliev cleared off the line .
bremen dominate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen stayed in tenth place despite smashing stuttgart over the weekend bremen meanwhile put a recent controversy over transfer dealings behind them to easily account for stuttgart .
brazilian playmaker diego opened the scoring from a free kick on 34 minutes before turning provider on 53 minutes , back-heeling the ball into the path of claudio pizarro , who rifled home from the edge of the area .
the midfielder was also involved in the bremen 's third goal on 64 minutes , setting up markus rosenberg , who completed the rout 10 minutes later with a second goal .
european hopes the loss is a blow to stuttgart 's hopes of qualifying for the next european season .
markus babbel 's side stay on 39 points , four points behind fifth-placed hoffenheim .
bremen meanwhile continue to sit in a disappointing 10th .
" we showed nothing today , that was really disappointing , simply too little , " said stuttgart 's thomas hitzlsperger .
cottbus remain firmly mired in the relegation zone after the defeat to hamburg , three points clear of bottom club sc karlsruhe and two behind borussia moenchengladbach , who beat cologne 4-2 on saturday .
also saturday , hanover 96 came from two goals down twice to draw 4-4 with borussia dortmund , and arminia bielefeld won 1-0 at karlsruhe .
two months on the sidelines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern and germany striker miroslav klose will be out for two months , his club says also to come from the weekend 's clashes was news that bayern and germany striker miroslav klose could be sidelined for up to two months after an ankle injury sustained during his team 's victory over bochum , bayern 's general manager uli hoeness told the sueddeutsche zeitung daily on monday .
the paper quoted hoeness on its web site as saying that klose was due to undergo surgery later monday " and will then miss six to eight weeks . "
klose will not only miss upcoming bundesliga matches but also munich 's european champions league quarterfinals and two world cup qualifiers for germany .
the 30-year-old damaged ligaments in his right ankle in bayern 's defeat of bochum when he stepped into a small hole on the pitch .
the injury added to munich 's attacking woes with italian striker luca toni and french midfielder franck ribery sidelined and landon donovan back in the us after bayern decided against a transfer .
fourth-choice frontman lukas podolski is munich 's only striker at the moment .
but hoeness said that ribery and toni could both return for the weekend 's league match against bottom club sc karlsruhe .
bundesliga defense also over the weekend , former germany coach and national team player rudi voeller rejected criticism of the bundesliga by current national team coach joachim loew . " this statement that all 20 english clubs are better and quicker than bundesliga clubs is not right .

us homeland security secretary janet napolitano was in berlin on monday to sign the agreement with her german counterpart annette schavan , who is germany 's education and research minister .
the agreement is meant to develop better protection from terrorist attacks , natural disasters , large-scale accidents and organized crime .
“ we want to use the benefits of research cooperation to mobilize the best ideas for optimal risk protection in our countries , ” schavan said in an official statement .
“ the united states and germany will develop innovative research projects that contribute to the protection of our free , open and cross-linked transatlantic societies . ”
" strengthening transatlantic cooperation " the accord , which is said to cost between 10 million euros and 20 million euros by 2012 , is the first such agreement between the two countries . " it is a considerable contribution to strengthening transatlantic cooperation with the new us government , " schavan told der spiegel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : napolitano emphasized cooperation with us allies speaking in berlin , napolitano said that it was important to work with us allies in improving security without infringing on civil liberties . " homeland security is not about walling ourselves off from other countries , it is about cooperating with our allies , " she said .
napolitano also met top security officials from other major european union countries as well as german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble in berlin over the weekend .
discussions on guantanamo inmates still " premature " prior to the sunday talks , napolitano told german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung -lrb- fas -rrb- that discussions on how many guantanamo inmates would be transferred to europe were still " premature . "
us president barack obama signed an executive order to close the controversial detention camp for alleged terrorists , only days after taking office in january .
napolitano told the fas newspaper that the us administration is currently evaluating individual cases . asked about the rights of prisoners detained at the bagram military internment facility in afghanistan , she declined to comment on the situation there .
napolitano did n't comment on questions of possible compensation in cases of terror suspects who might have been wrongly detained .
but she insisted the obama administration 's methods in fighting terrorism would be fundamentally different from that of former president george w. bush .
german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , jointly interviewed by the fas with napolitano , said the fight against terrorism can only be successful when nations adhere to international conventions on human rights .
this includes passenger rights when body searches are conducted at airports .
" on one hand we want to guarantee safety in the skies without making air travel too burdensome , " he said . df / sp / faz / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the main charge against the 73-year-old austrian relates to the murder of a newborn boy who died in a secret cellar under his house in 1996 . fritzl also faces charges of rape , coercion and enslavement of his daughter , as well as incest and deprivation of her liberty and that of three of her children .

the company said in a statement that it would adapt output in germany , romania and spain to the " unprecedented decline in the european new car market and the continuing negative economic outlook . "
ford 's plant in valencia , spain will operate on two shifts instead of three , and a plant in saarlouis , germany will follow through on a previously announced 20-day production pause .
but its plant in cologne , western germany will continue full production to meet demand sparked by the german government 's subsidy that offers people willing to scrap their old cars a cash rebate of 2,500 euros on a more environmentally-friendly new car .
the subsidy has boosted sales of smaller cars such as the fiesta and fusion models .
the statement said that the cologne plant would " share with ford 's craiova -lrb- romania -rrb- engine plant the production of a new , small-displacement ecoboost advanced petrol engine . "
more action could follow the us carmaker employs some 70,000 people in europe , where it has 22 factories .
in germany , the company is bound by a union agreement to maintain jobs at their current level .
last month , ford 's european sales dropped by almost 12 percent from the same period last year to just under 89,000 cars , according to statistics from the european automovile manufacturers ' association -lrb- acea -rrb- .
" ford europe must return to sustainable profitability as soon as possible , " said john fleming , ford 's head of the region , in a statement .

they are now living in a secret location under new identities .
fritzl 's appearance at the court on monday morning was the first time he had been seen in public since his arrest on april 26 last year .
he attempted to cover his face with a blue binder .
due to the personal nature of the testimony , no journalists will be allowed inside the court .
instead , there will be daily press briefings with updates on the proceedings .
the media will be admitted into the court for the verdict , which is expected friday .

three of elisabeth 's other children had at an early age been brought to live upstairs with fritzl and his wife , rosemarie .
they had no knowledge of their mother and siblings living in the soundproofed cellar below the family home .
fritzl told his wife that the children had been abandoned by elisabeth , who he said had run off to join a sect .
police say rosemarie was unaware of her husband 's second life in the windowless basement complex .

the testimony will continue to be shown in the coming days of the closed-door trial .
the main charge against the 73-year-old austrian relates to the murder of a newborn boy who died in a secret cellar under his house in 1996 . fritzl also faces charges of rape , coercion and enslavement of his daughter , as well as incest and deprivation of her liberty and that of three of her children .

fritzl , who was deemed fit for trial following a psychiatric assessment in october , could face a sentence of 10 to 15 years or life in prison if the eight-member jury finds him guilty of murder .

us homeland security secretary janet napolitano was in berlin on monday to sign the agreement with her german counterpart annette schavan , who is germany 's education and research minister .
the agreement is meant to develop better protection from terrorist attacks , natural disasters , large-scale accidents and organized crime .
“ we want to use the benefits of research cooperation to mobilize the best ideas for optimal risk protection in our countries , ” schavan said in an official statement .
“ the united states and germany will develop innovative research projects that contribute to the protection of our free , open and cross-linked transatlantic societies . ”
" strengthening transatlantic cooperation " the accord , which is said to cost between 10 million euros and 20 million euros by 2012 , is the first such agreement between the two countries . " it is a considerable contribution to strengthening transatlantic cooperation with the new us government , " schavan told der spiegel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : napolitano emphasized cooperation with us allies speaking in berlin , napolitano said that it was important to work with us allies in improving security without infringing on civil liberties . " homeland security is not about walling ourselves off from other countries , it is about cooperating with our allies , " she said .
napolitano also met top security officials from other major european union countries as well as german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble in berlin over the weekend .
discussions on guantanamo inmates still " premature " prior to the sunday talks , napolitano told german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung -lrb- fas -rrb- that discussions on how many guantanamo inmates would be transferred to europe were still " premature . "
us president barack obama signed an executive order to close the controversial detention camp for alleged terrorists , only days after taking office in january .
napolitano told the fas newspaper that the us administration is currently evaluating individual cases . asked about the rights of prisoners detained at the bagram military internment facility in afghanistan , she declined to comment on the situation there .
napolitano did n't comment on questions of possible compensation in cases of terror suspects who might have been wrongly detained .
but she insisted the obama administration 's methods in fighting terrorism would be fundamentally different from that of former president george w. bush .
german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , jointly interviewed by the fas with napolitano , said the fight against terrorism can only be successful when nations adhere to international conventions on human rights .
this includes passenger rights when body searches are conducted at airports .
" on one hand we want to guarantee safety in the skies without making air travel too burdensome , " he said . df / sp / faz / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the results of the study are being presented on monday , march 16 , in hanover .
a further 23,000 students in this age group are considered to be in danger of becoming gaming addicts , the study said .
researchers interviewed 44,610 ninth-graders nationwide on their gaming habits . they found that ninth graders devote an average of 130 minutes to computer video games on school days , and an average of 167 minutes a day on weekends .
the rates of addiction are strongly correlated to gender .
researchers concluded that nationally , some 3 percent of 15-year-old boys are gaming addicts , while only 0.3 percent of ninth-grade girls were said to have an addiction .
the study also found that teens increasingly spend time playing games in front of their computers .
on average , young people now spend 40 more minutes gaming each day than they did in 2005 .
stricter age limits needed , expert says the head of the cri , christian pfeiffer , singled out one online role-playing game , " world of warcraft " as being particularly addictive and suggested upping the age at which people are permitted to play from 12 to 18 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts searching for a motive behind the winnenden shootings say video games may have been a factor pfeiffer told news magazine der spiegel that it was unacceptable that the rate of addiction was not a criteria examined when a game is assigned an age limit .
there 's been a renewed focus on the detrimental effects of excessive video gaming in the wake of last week 's school shooting in the town of winnenden in southwestern germany .
investigators have since said that the 17-year-old gunman , tim k. , played " far cry 2 , " a shooter video game in which players hunt arms traffickers in the jungle , the night before he went on a rampage at his former school , killing 15 people before shooting himself . dc / sp / dpa / ard send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was due to launch from the plesetsk cosmodrome in the northwest of russia on monday afternoon .
but a spokesman at the esa centre for earth observation in frascati , italy , near rome , said the countdown was suspended when the service tower protecting the rocket failed to move clear of the pad and allow the satellite to lift off .
" the launch was delayed until the back-up date , tomorrow .
the reasons are being checked .
it is due to technical reasons connected to the ground services , " a spokesman for the russian space center said .
the 346-million-euro satellite is to reach orbit strapped to the back of a modified russian ballistic missile .
the orbiting of the goce satellite has been pushed back several times over fears that the launch system was not ready after an earlier esa satellite , designed to map the world 's ice fields , crashed in 2005 .
insights into oceans , gravity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esa hopes to gain insights into the earth 's oceans and gravity esa scientists said goce would map the earth 's gravitational field with unprecedented resolution and accuracy .
scientists believe data obtained by the satellite could also help improve their understanding of ocean circulation and sea-level change , both of which are affected by climate change .
the data could also assist in the study of geo-hazards , such as volcanoes and earthquakes .
goce bears little resemblance to the plain , functional boxes that are usually launched into space .
one of the scientists who worked on the mission , reiner rummel of the technical university of munich , has called it " the most beautiful satellite that has ever been built . "
european technology , design the satellite has fins and a sleek , arrow-like body , which are needed to keep the craft stable as it flies in the outer limits of the atmosphere at an altitude of just under 270 kilometers .
this orbit is much closer to earth than most other planetary observation missions , and is essential if goce is to pick up minute gravitational variations across the planet .
the esa said goce 's design reflects european achievements in both engineering and science .
forty-five companies from 13 european countries worked with the space agency on the satellite , the first of esa 's earth explorers , a series of spacecraft designed to provide answers to important environmental questions .
" precisely in times of climate change , a process that is still a long way from being completely understood , researchers need continuous , new earth observations , " rummel said .
if all goes well on the second launch attempt , goce will transmit data back to earth over a period of eight months . dfm / dc / dpa / afp / esa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the company said in a statement that it would adapt output in germany , romania and spain to the " unprecedented decline in the european new car market and the continuing negative economic outlook . "
ford 's plant in valencia , spain will operate on two shifts instead of three , and a plant in saarlouis , germany will follow through on a previously announced 20-day production pause .
but its plant in cologne , western germany will continue full production to meet demand sparked by the german government 's subsidy that offers people willing to scrap their old cars a cash rebate of 2,500 euros on a more environmentally-friendly new car .
the subsidy has boosted sales of smaller cars such as the fiesta and fusion models .
the statement said that the cologne plant would " share with ford 's craiova -lrb- romania -rrb- engine plant the production of a new , small-displacement ecoboost advanced petrol engine . "
more action could follow the us carmaker employs some 70,000 people in europe , where it has 22 factories .
in germany , the company is bound by a union agreement to maintain jobs at their current level .
last month , ford 's european sales dropped by almost 12 percent from the same period last year to just under 89,000 cars , according to statistics from the european automovile manufacturers ' association -lrb- acea -rrb- .

all the weapons except one , a 9mm beretta pistol , were said to be locked in a safe at the residence . the teenage gunman tim k is believed to have stolen the unsecured pistol from his father 's bedroom and used it to shoot dead 12 students and teachers at the albertville secondary school on march 11 .
prosecutors could charge the man , whose name has not been released , with involuntary manslaughter for leaving the murder weapons unlocked in his bedroom despite knowing his son was depressed .
police have said that tim k was treated for depression between april and september of last year , before breaking off his treatment .
" there are concrete signs that the parents knew of their son 's health problems , " the prosecutors and local police said in a joint statement .
" based on this , there is reason to suspect this may be a case of involuntary manslaughter . "

the company said in a statement that it would adapt output in germany , romania and spain to the " unprecedented decline in the european new car market and the continuing negative economic outlook . "
ford 's plant in valencia , spain will operate on two shifts instead of three , and a plant in saarlouis , germany will follow through on a previously announced 20-day production pause .
but its plant in cologne , western germany will continue full production to meet demand sparked by the german government 's subsidy that offers people willing to scrap their old cars a cash rebate of 2,500 euros on a more environmentally-friendly new car .
the subsidy has boosted sales of smaller cars such as the fiesta and fusion models .
the statement said that the cologne plant would " share with ford 's craiova -lrb- romania -rrb- engine plant the production of a new , small-displacement ecoboost advanced petrol engine . "
more action could follow the us carmaker employs some 70,000 people in europe , where it has 22 factories .
in germany , the company is bound by a union agreement to maintain jobs at their current level .
last month , ford 's european sales dropped by almost 12 percent from the same period last year to just under 89,000 cars , according to statistics from the european automovile manufacturers ' association -lrb- acea -rrb- .
" ford europe must return to sustainable profitability as soon as possible , " said john fleming , ford 's head of the region , in a statement .

the testimony will continue to be shown in the coming days of the closed-door trial .
the main charge against the 73-year-old austrian relates to the murder of a newborn boy who died in a secret cellar under his house in 1996 . fritzl also faces charges of rape , coercion and enslavement of his daughter , as well as incest and deprivation of her liberty and that of three of her children .
as the trial opened , prosecutors accused fritzl of repeatedly having raped elisabeth in front of her young children .
fritzl , who was deemed fit for trial following a psychiatric assessment in october , could face a sentence of 10 to 15 years or life in prison if the eight-member jury finds him guilty of murder .
under austrian law , sentences are not cumulative , so he will serve only the longest of the sentences he receives for the crimes he is deemed to have committed .

neither elisabeth nor her children are expected to appear at the trial , which will be presided over by three judges .
they are now living in a secret location under new identities .
fritzl 's appearance at the court on monday morning was the first time he had been seen in public since his arrest on april 26 last year .
he attempted to cover his face with a blue binder .
due to the personal nature of the testimony , no journalists will be allowed inside the court .
instead , there will be daily press briefings with updates on the proceedings .
the media will be admitted into the court for the verdict , which is expected friday .
a case that shocked the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritzl 's victims thanked the public for their support via this poster the shocking case came to light in april last year when elisabeth 's oldest child , 19-year-old kerstin , who had lived her entire life underground with two brothers and her mother , fell ill and had to be hospitalized .
three of elisabeth 's other children had at an early age been brought to live upstairs with fritzl and his wife , rosemarie .
they had no knowledge of their mother and siblings living in the soundproofed cellar below the family home .
fritzl told his wife that the children had been abandoned by elisabeth , who he said had run off to join a sect .
police say rosemarie was unaware of her husband 's second life in the windowless basement complex .
shortly after his arrest , fritzl confessed to raping and holding his daughter for 24 years with no sunlight , fresh air , heating or hot water .

the news about zumwinkel , who is currently living in a chateau in italy 's lake garda , unleashed cries of outrage from a panoply of german politicians and commentators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german 's deutsche post is one of the world 's largest logistics firms zumwinkel , 65 - who was forced to resign as deutsche post 's ceo in february of 2008 , was convicted in january , 2009 , of evading nearly one million euros in taxes by hiding the sum in a secret trust in the alpine tax haven of liechtenstein .
a german court penalized zumwinkel with a one million euro fine and two-year prison sentence , which he has yet to serve .
but at a time when the global financial crisis has led to germany 's worst recession since world war ii , the news of the payout has sparked public outrage .
politicians of all stripes have jumped on the bandwagon to denounce business leaders who continue to rake in high salaries and bonuses despite falling profits and management failures that have run their companies to the ground .
' scandalous ' payout on sunday , bavaria 's premier and csu party chief horst seehofer told german newspapers the 20 million payout was " scandalous . "
" these are the kind of people who destroy our social market economy , " said seehofer , whose conservative csu is the bavarian sister party to german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats . " the average person is worried about his job , and mr. zumwinkel is stuffing his pockets full of cash , " he said .
since the german state is a big stakeholder in deutsche post , which was formerly a government monopoly , seehofer even called for an investigation into the justification for such a huge pension payout .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in merkel 's governing coalition were just as scathing .
" this is such an insult to all those in our country who work hard , pay their taxes and stick to the rules , " said spd general secretary hubertus heil .
the huge pension payout comes at a time deutsche post had been hit by losses totalling nearly 1.7 million euros for 2008 .
zumwinkel legally entitled to huge pension payout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel hid nearly one million euros in liechtenstein .
the company 's spokeswoman silje skogstad however told the business news website bloomberg that zumwinkel was entitled to his full pension payout according to the terms of his executive compensation package .
" the financing of zumwinkel 's pension claims is completed , " she said .
however , skogstad declined to comment on the 20 million euro sum cited by faz .
the outrage even reached the ranks of some free democrats , the german political party that favors market liberalization .
leading fdp politician dirk niebel told the faz : " not everything that is legal is legitimate . "
police raid zumwinkel 's chateau in another scandal possibly implicating the former deutsche post boss , police raided his chateau in italy 's scenic lake garda last week , said german prosecutors on friday .
zumwinkel 's other homes - an old villa in cologne and a home in switzerland - had also been raided by the police .
the raid was linked to an investigation into an alleged eavesdropping scandal among employees at deutsche telekom .

the results of the study are being presented on monday , march 16 , in hanover .
a further 23,000 students in this age group are considered to be in danger of becoming gaming addicts , the study said .
researchers interviewed 44,610 ninth-graders nationwide on their gaming habits . they found that ninth graders devote an average of 130 minutes to computer video games on school days , and an average of 167 minutes a day on weekends .
the rates of addiction are strongly correlated to gender .

but victory for second-placed bayern munich came at the price of star striker miroslav klose . sv hamburg enjoyed a 2-0 victory over energie cottbus sunday to move up to fourth spot in the bundesliga , while in the day 's other game vfb stuttgart were hammered 4-0 by werder bremen .
an ivica olic header after 32 minutes and a free kick from piotr trochowski seven minutes later were enough to ensure victory for martin jol 's hamburg , moving them to 45 points along with bayern munich and vfl wolfsburg , but in fourth place on goal difference .
the three clubs remain four points adrift of league leaders hertha berlin , which defeated bayer leverkusen 1-0 on saturday .
bayern beat vfl bochum 3-0 , while wolfsburg enjoyed a 4-3 victory over schalke 04 on friday .
petric out " that was a routine victory but it was pretty important , " said jol .
" we lacked pace in the second half , but i am happy . "
trochowski replaced mladen petric after just half an hour after the croatian forward pulled a muscle .

but victory for second-placed bayern munich came at the price of star striker miroslav klose . sv hamburg enjoyed a 2-0 victory over energie cottbus sunday to move up to fourth spot in the bundesliga , while in the day 's other game vfb stuttgart were hammered 4-0 by werder bremen .
an ivica olic header after 32 minutes and a free kick from piotr trochowski seven minutes later were enough to ensure victory for martin jol 's hamburg , moving them to 45 points along with bayern munich and vfl wolfsburg , but in fourth place on goal difference .
the three clubs remain four points adrift of league leaders hertha berlin , which defeated bayer leverkusen 1-0 on saturday .
bayern beat vfl bochum 3-0 , while wolfsburg enjoyed a 4-3 victory over schalke 04 on friday .
petric out " that was a routine victory but it was pretty important , " said jol .
" we lacked pace in the second half , but i am happy . "
trochowski replaced mladen petric after just half an hour after the croatian forward pulled a muscle .
the injury puts petric out of action for at least two weeks , meaning he will miss next thursday 's uefa cup clash with turkish giants galatasaray .
hamburg took the lead shortly after trochowski 's introduction when olic got his head on the end of a mickael taveres cross .
germany international trochowski made it 2-0 with a free kick that left cottbus goalkeeper gerhard tremmel with no chance .
olic , who is to move to bayern in the summer , had a chance to make it 3-0 in the second half but ivica iliev cleared off the line .
bremen dominate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen stayed in tenth place despite smashing stuttgart over the weekend bremen meanwhile put a recent controversy over transfer dealings behind them to easily account for stuttgart .
brazilian playmaker diego opened the scoring from a free kick on 34 minutes before turning provider on 53 minutes , back-heeling the ball into the path of claudio pizarro , who rifled home from the edge of the area .
the midfielder was also involved in the bremen 's third goal on 64 minutes , setting up markus rosenberg , who completed the rout 10 minutes later with a second goal .
european hopes the loss is a blow to stuttgart 's hopes of qualifying for the next european season .
markus babbel 's side stay on 39 points , four points behind fifth-placed hoffenheim .
bremen meanwhile continue to sit in a disappointing 10th .
" we showed nothing today , that was really disappointing , simply too little , " said stuttgart 's thomas hitzlsperger .
cottbus remain firmly mired in the relegation zone after the defeat to hamburg , three points clear of bottom club sc karlsruhe and two behind borussia moenchengladbach , who beat cologne 4-2 on saturday .
also saturday , hanover 96 came from two goals down twice to draw 4-4 with borussia dortmund , and arminia bielefeld won 1-0 at karlsruhe .

the paper quoted hoeness on its web site as saying that klose was due to undergo surgery later monday " and will then miss six to eight weeks . "
klose will not only miss upcoming bundesliga matches but also munich 's european champions league quarterfinals and two world cup qualifiers for germany .
the 30-year-old damaged ligaments in his right ankle in bayern 's defeat of bochum when he stepped into a small hole on the pitch .
the injury added to munich 's attacking woes with italian striker luca toni and french midfielder franck ribery sidelined and landon donovan back in the us after bayern decided against a transfer .
fourth-choice frontman lukas podolski is munich 's only striker at the moment .
but hoeness said that ribery and toni could both return for the weekend 's league match against bottom club sc karlsruhe .
bundesliga defense also over the weekend , former germany coach and national team player rudi voeller rejected criticism of the bundesliga by current national team coach joachim loew . " this statement that all 20 english clubs are better and quicker than bundesliga clubs is not right .
though it is still a question of money , " the boss of bundesliga club bayer leverkusen said in a television interview . " i have to contradict him entirely on this point , " voeller said .
" i think we are comparable to the leagues in england , spain and italy , which operate under different financial conditions . " of course we can not keep up with the top four english clubs , which are in the quarterfinals of the champions league .
over there , soccer is played a little faster than in the bundesliga , " voeller said . dfm / sp / dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the company said in a statement that it would adapt output in germany , romania and spain to the " unprecedented decline in the european new car market and the continuing negative economic outlook . "
ford 's plant in valencia , spain will operate on two shifts instead of three , and a plant in saarlouis , germany will follow through on a previously announced 20-day production pause .
but its plant in cologne , western germany will continue full production to meet demand sparked by the german government 's subsidy that offers people willing to scrap their old cars a cash rebate of 2,500 euros on a more environmentally-friendly new car .
the subsidy has boosted sales of smaller cars such as the fiesta and fusion models .
the statement said that the cologne plant would " share with ford 's craiova -lrb- romania -rrb- engine plant the production of a new , small-displacement ecoboost advanced petrol engine . "
more action could follow the us carmaker employs some 70,000 people in europe , where it has 22 factories .
in germany , the company is bound by a union agreement to maintain jobs at their current level .
last month , ford 's european sales dropped by almost 12 percent from the same period last year to just under 89,000 cars , according to statistics from the european automovile manufacturers ' association -lrb- acea -rrb- .
" ford europe must return to sustainable profitability as soon as possible , " said john fleming , ford 's head of the region , in a statement .

it says iraqis are much more hopeful about the future and are increasingly pre-occupied with more conventional worries like the economy and jobs .
but iraqis remain unhappy about the role foreign powers play in their country , notably iran , the us and uk .
the survey was carried out for the bbc , abc news and nhk in february .
a total of 2,228 iraqis were questioned across all 18 provinces .
the margin of error is 2.5 % .
security the poll is the sixth in a series of surveys stretching back to march 2004 and shows a marked overall improvement in perceptions , the bbc 's adam mynott says .
its findings show striking shifts in opinion since the last poll in march 2008 .
on security , 85 % of all respondents described the current situation as very good or quite good - up 23 % on a year ago : a total of 52 % say security has improved over the last year , up 16 % on march 2008 only 8 % say it is worse - against 26 % last year 59 % feel safe in their neighbourhoods , up 22 % from 37 % last time .
see poll results on security and democracy supplies improving the numbers of people who report direct experience of car bombs , suicide attacks , sectarian fighting , kidnappings and assassination in their areas are much lower than last year .

and there is a 14 % increase - to 60 % - of those who think things will be better in iraq as a whole in a year from now .
the survey shows that some aspects of everyday life are improving , too .
the availability of power has been a major issue in the past six years , with only about 10 % of the population saying in previous polls that they have had reliable supplies .
in the latest poll , that figure has leapt to 37 % .
and the number of those who say that availability of fuel for cooking or driving is now very good or quite good has also shot up to 67 % , a 48 % rise on the 19 % of march 2008 .
sunni shift as with previous findings , it is possible to distinguish between the responses of shias and sunnis .
all earlier polls have shown stark differences between them , with the sunni minority profoundly more pessimistic than shias about the current situation and iraq 's prospects .
these differences persist , but the new poll poll shows a pronounced shift in sunni opinion towards a more optimistic view : overall , there is a 9 % increase among those who think their lives are going very well or quite well -lrb- shias + 8 % ; sunnis + 16 % -rrb- 14 % more think things will be better for iraq in a year 's time -lrb- shias + 13 % ; sunnis + 29 % -rrb- there is a 23 % increase in those who say their local security situation is very / quite good -lrb- shias + 21 % ; sunnis + 32 % -rrb- 21 % more support democracy as the preferred model of government for iraq compared with a strong leader or islamic state -lrb- shias + 21 % , sunnis + 27 % -rrb- .
regional differences asked whether foreign countries are playing a positive or negative role in iraq , britain , the us and iran get the most negative scores .
overall , 59 % of those questioned think britain 's role is negative , 22 % positive ; 64 % say the us is negative , 18 % positive ; 68 % view iran negatively , 12 % positively .
also , 56 % think the 2003 invasion was wrong -lrb- up 6 % -rrb- , while 42 % say it was right -lrb- down 7 % -rrb- .
only 30 % think coalition forces are doing a good job , 69 % a bad job - more or less the same as a year ago .
in the light of an imminent withdrawal of british troops from southern iraq , iraqis were asked about the value of the british presence since 2003 .
the responses were mixed on this issue : 36 % call it generally positive , 42 % generally negative .
the poll also suggests that there are some marked differences in responses between the northern , central and southern regions of iraq .
overall , respondents in central iraq , which includes baghdad , are significantly less positive about how well things are currently going in their lives .

only 30 % think coalition forces are doing a good job , 69 % a bad job - more or less the same as a year ago .
in the light of an imminent withdrawal of british troops from southern iraq , iraqis were asked about the value of the british presence since 2003 .
the responses were mixed on this issue : 36 % call it generally positive , 42 % generally negative .
the poll also suggests that there are some marked differences in responses between the northern , central and southern regions of iraq .
overall , respondents in central iraq , which includes baghdad , are significantly less positive about how well things are currently going in their lives .

it indicates violence and insecurity are no longer the main concern of most iraqis and that they are increasingly pre-occupied with more conventional worries such as the economy and jobs .
it suggests they remain unhappy about the role foreign powers play in their country , notably iran , the us and uk .
there were mixed views when iraqis were asked about the value of the british presence since 2003 - 36 % called it generally positive , 42 % generally negative .
four in 10 respondents said they were very concerned or somewhat concerned that security in basra could worsen after british troops leave , but 57 % said they were not so concerned , or not concerned at all .
the bbc radio 5 live poll was commissioned as part of the real fighting talk - a day of programmes on monday 16 march focusing on the future of the british armed forces .

contesting claims over the paracel and spratly islands are more complex , analysts explained , because sovereignty has not been finally established .
china , the philippines , vietnam , taiwan , indonesia , malaysia and brunei all have overlapping claims to groups of the islands , which are believed to have large oil and gas reserves .
last week the philippines president , gloria macapagal-arroyo , signed a law which put in writing the country 's long-standing claim to what manila calls the disputed kalayaan island group and the scarborough shoal , prompting protests from beijing .
beijing called the law " illegal and invalid " .
china also reaffirmed its claims , saying the ship would " protect fishing vessels around nansha , xisha and zhongsha islands in china 's southernmost maritime territory " .
a few days before the philippines passed its law , malaysian prime minister abdullah badawi inspected danwan reef , part of the spratly islands , and claimed sovereignty over the reef and adjacent waters .

advertisement street celebrations in el salvador leftist mauricio funes of el salvador 's former marxist rebel fmln party has won the country 's presidential election .
he defeated his conservative rival , the arena party 's rodrigo avila , who has admitted defeat .
arena had won every presidential election since the end of el salvador 's civil war 18 years ago .
addressing jubilant supporters , mr funes said it was the happiest day of his life and the beginning of a new chapter of peace for the country .
branded by his opponents as a puppet of venezuala 's president hugo chavez , mr funes vowed to respect all salvadorian democratic institutions .
the fmln won 51.3 % of the vote against arena 's 48.7 % , reuters news agency reported .
break with tradition " this is the happiest night of my life , and i want it to be the night of el salvador 's greatest hope , " said mr funes .
mauricio funes is the first fmln leader who has not been a combatant " i want to thank all the people who voted for me and chose that path of hope and change . "
his fmln -lrb- farabundo marti national liberation front -rrb- party was founded by marxist guerrilla fighters from the civil war .
the conflict ended in a un-sponsored peace accord in 1991 , after the loss of some 70,000 lives over less than two decades .
mr funes , a former television journalist , marks a break of tradition for the party as he is the first of its leaders not to have been a combatant in that war , says the bbc 's stephen gibbs in el salvador .
he stressed his moderate policies during his campaign and says he intends to maintain good relations with the united states .
he strongly rejected suggestions put forward by his political opponents that el salvador under his watch would become a venezuelan satellite state .
supporters of mr avila , a former police chief , dismissed the fmln as " communists " .
mr funes will take over a country plagued with problems , our correspondent notes .
el salvador has one of the world 's highest murder rates .
it has also been badly hit by the world economic downturn , with remittances from salvadorians living abroad falling dramatically .

the plan aims to reduce wales ' greenhouse gas emissions by helping people save energy and cut costs in the home , at work and in the community .
there will be new rules for the home energy efficiency scheme -lrb- hees -rrb- .
people receiving means-tested benefits whose homes are not energy efficient will be eligible for help .
the assembly government recently said it would struggle to meet its target to end fuel poverty among the vulnerable by 2010 .
fuel poverty is defined as those who spend more than 10 % of their income heating their homes .
the changes to the hees means those who qualify will receive funding for an improved package of support for the most cost-effective heat-saving measures , including solid wall insulation or micro-generation measures where appropriate . "
this scheme was set up at a time when incomes were stable and rising while energy prices were falling ... now we have the reverse " environment minister jane davidson at present , those who are eligible are either householders on a qualifying benefit with a child under 16 , the over-60s , who are disabled or chronically ill , as well as householders over the age of 80 .
the national energy efficiency and savings plan is being launched by environment minister jane davidson .
as well as the changes to eligibility , the plan wants to offer better advice for members of the public on where to get help ; support for small businesses to become more energy efficient ; help for credit unions to provide low-cost loans , and an end to public investment in high-carbon home heating .
she said : " as a government we have made a commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in devolved areas by 3 % a year from 2011 .
" saving energy will help us achieve this .
importantly it also means saving money . "
ms davidson said the hees had a good record , but added : " this scheme was set up at a time when incomes were stable and rising while energy prices were falling .
" now we have the reverse .
we need to target the people who most need help , while also ensuring a range of support mechanisms are in place to make sure the most vulnerable do not slip through the net . "
fuel poverty charity national energy action welcomed the move but said it had been delayed for too long .
director nuria zolle said : " we are very glad that this plan has finally been published for consultation , however disappointed that it has now been two years since the need for this plan was agreed by the welsh assembly government .
" in this time , energy prices have shot up by 38 % pushing an additional 90,000 welsh households into fuel poverty and bringing the total number of fuel poor households in wales to an estimated 340,000 - more than 1 in 4 households .
" people in fuel poverty in wales - families , pensioners and individuals - are paying for the government 's procrastination , having to make the terrible choice between eating and heating as their bills increase . "
the assembly government provides £ 23m a year for the hees .

schools watchdog estyn will carry out more than 100 interviews with education officers and elected members in the two-week inspection .
the council was severely criticised by estyn in a damning report of its education system in 2007 .
the council 's cabinet approved plans to modernise the system in january .
as well as the interviews , estyn will run focus groups with head teachers , governors and partners .
the inspection will finish on 27 march with a presentation of the watchdog 's conclusions .
inspectors from the wales audit office and the care and social services inspectorate wales -lrb- cssiw -rrb- will also form part of the inspection team during part of the exercise .
modernisation policies over the past few months managers within the authority have been working on documentation to show the work done since the last inspection .
the council said its modernisation policies would address a " vast range of issues " including surplus and deficit places and head teacher vacancies .
the model will also address infant and junior school amalgamation , community use of schools , mobile accommodation , promoting bilingualism as well as admissions and transport .
in january rhyl high school was placed in special measures after estyn said the quality of teaching was significantly below average for wales .
last week , more than 40 teachers at the school staged a one-day strike over plans to close the town 's sixth forms and transfer it all to a new site linked to llandrillo college .
in 2006 , blessed edward jones catholic high school in rhyl was also judged to be failing , but improved enough to be taken out of special measures by june last year .
a damning estyn report into the state of education services in the county in 2007 eventually led to the ousting of former council leader rhiannon hughes .
the authority was later forced to submit an action plan for improvement to the welsh assembly government .
